of two kingdoms, \" a half-and-half Numi- than and Getulian;", "3": "\" adding that, in that respect, he resembled the elder Cyrus, who was \" a Semi-Median and Semi.Persian.\"", "4": "Madaura, after

\" colony,\" and rose to considerable splendour.", "6": "The father of Apuleius filled the office of duumvir, the highest magisterial dignity in his native place, and bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two millions of sesterces to his two sons, one of whom, the subject of our present inquiries, succeeded to his office.", "7": "These facts we learn from the direct testimony of the son in his Apologia or Defence ;", "8": "but most of the biographers of Apuleius add other particulars, drawn from the assumption that, under the character of Lucius, the imagi­ nary hero of the story of \"the Golden Ass,\" the author has related sundry details of his own personal history.", "9": "Upon this supposition, we are told that our author's prænomen was Lucius, that his father's name was

Apuleius would have deemed it consistent with decorum to speak of himself, his father and his mother, by their real names, in so frolicsome a work of fiction as \" The Golden Ass,\" since we find, that when addressing the sons of a friend in some complimentary verses of a peculiar character, such as the habits of his day allowed, he thought it his duty to invent pseudonymes for the objects of his flattery.", "20": "*Apuleius received the first rudiments of education at Carthage, renowned at that time as a school of literature, and there he adopted the Platonic system of philosophy, in which he perfected himself by his subsequent studies at Athens.", "21": "There, too, he laid the foundations of that copious stock of various and profound learning, through which he became the most distinguished lite­ rary character of his age.", "22": "Still thirsting for knowledge, and impelled, like his own Lucius, by an insatiable curiosity to ex­ plore all that was hidden from the vulgar gaze, he travelled through Greece, Asia, and Italy, and became a member of many religious fraternities, and a proficient in their mys­ teries.", "23": "After his return to Africa, he was about to renew his travels, and on his way to Alexandria was taken ill at Oëa, a maritime town, which some geographers have identified with the modern Tripoli.", "24": "A young man, named Pontianus, whom he had known as a fellow-student at Athens, invited the invalid to become the guest of his mother, a wealthy widow, named Pudentilla.", "25": "In making this hospitable proposal, Pontianus had more in view than the comfort of his friend, and the restoration of his health.", "26": "Pudentilla was herself also an invalid, being affected with a chronic complaint, which had lasted thir­ teen years-the duration of her widowhood-and for which her medical advisers all agreed in prescribing marriage as a remedy.", "27": "The son, seeing his mother prepared to try the effect of that nostrum, was desirous that her new husband should be one of his own choosing.", "28": "Accordingly, he begged Apuleius would do him the favour to become his stepfather, putting the affair to him, says the latter, in the light of an onerous service, such as one might ask a friend and a philosopher to undertake.", "29": "The widow was neither young nor handsome, but she was virtuous, fond, and very rich.", "30":

was accomplished, Pontianus had married the daughter of one Rufinus, who, long eager to secure to his son-in-law as large a share as possible in the fortune of Pudentilla, did all he could to prevent

him upon the latter charge, and the cause was tried at Sabrata, before Claudius Maximus, the proconsul of Africa.", "41": "It was on that occasion he delivered the Defence, a translation of which will be found in this volume.", "42": "It is a clever and amusing per formance, having nothing of the tragic earnestness of a man who is pleading for his life;", "43": "on the-contrary, Apuleius appears, from first to last, to have felt quite secure as to the issue, and to have flung himself with great glee into a contest which afforded him such capital opportunities for displaying his wit, his learning, and his powers of rhetoric.", "44": "His adversaries had a bad game to play;", "45": "they played it into his hands, and he made good use of their blun­ ders.", "46": "The main charge was

gladi­ atorial shows and wild beast hunts in the province, and statues were erected in his honour by the senate of Carthage and of other states.", "63": "It was probably in his latter days that he composed his most celebrated work, \" The Metamorphoses, or the Golden Ass for neither does he allude to it in those passages in which he boasts of the extent and variety of his literary productions

celebrated romance pur­ ports to be the autobiography of a certain Lucius of Madaura, whose curiosity with respect to magic.", "66": "has been rewarded by his tranformation into the form of a jackass,

this amusing story appeared before the trial at Sabrata, it might have been used with formid­ able effect against its author, whose contemporaries, anticipat­ ing the opinions of a subsequent age,

of Tyana, as a thauma- turgus, and to cite various miracles performed by him as equal, or superior to those of Christ.", "69": "A generation later, St. Augustine permitted himself to doubt whether the

imagined.", "87": "The least faulty perhaps, of all, is the Apologia.", "88": "Here he spoke from deep feeling;", "89": "and although we may in many places detect the inveterate affectation of the

the orations of Apuleius, collected either by himself or one of his admirers, but more probably a collection of passages intended as proemia to sundry declamations, or to be introduced, as occasion might serve, intp the body of an extemporaneous harangue.", "95": "The sixth and last is the De Mundo Liber, a translation of an anonymous Greek treatise, erroneously ascribed to Aristotle, which we have not thought worth inserting.", "96": "The treatise on Plato is not in­ cluded here, as it has already been given in the sixth volume of Mr. Bohn's edition of the entire works of Plato.", "97":

with a certain young man of Boeotia, who is extremely handsome, and she is ardently employing the whole power, and every ma­ noeuvre of her art.", "970": "I heard her yesterday evening, with these ears of mine, I heard her, I say, threaten the Sun himself, that she would involve him in a cloud of mist, and interminable darkness, if that Sun did not make haste in his course through the heavens, and speedily give place to the night, that she might the sooner begin to exert her magic spells.\"", "971": "Yesterday, happening to catch sight of this youth in a bar­ ber's shop,* as she was returning from the bath, she secretly gave me orders to bring away the cuttings of his hair, which were lying on the ground.", "972": "As I was in the act of carefully and stealthily collecting them,

ado before the magistrates.'", "976": "Then, suiting the action to the words, thrusting in his hands between my breasts, and groping about them in a rage, he drew out the hair I had previously concealed there.", "977": "Grievously afflicted by this treatment, and rejecting on the temper of my mistress, who is always excessively enraged, and beats me in the most cruel manner, when she is thwarted in a matter of this nature, I had serious thoughts of running away, but when I thought of you, I instantly abandoned that design.", "978": "On my way home, sad and empty handed, I espied a man clipping some goat skins with a pair of shears.", "979": "Seeing them so nicely sewn toge­ ther, inflated, and standing by themselves, I took up a parcel of the hair from them which lay scattered on the ground, and being of a yellow colour, resembled that of the young Bœotian;", "980": "and this goat's hair I gave to my mistress, concealing the truth.\"", "981": "Accordingly, at night-fall, before you returned from the entertainment, Pamphile, my mistress, now in a state of frenzy, went up into a belvedere covered with shingles, which she secretly frequents, as being especially adapted to these pursuits of hers, for it is open on every side to the winds, and commands a prospect of the eastern and all the other points.", "982": "There she began by arranging in her deadly workshop all the customary implements of her art, such as aromatics of all kinds, plates of metal engraved with talismanic characters, nails from ship­ wrecked vessels, as also, multitudes of limbs and fragments

after plaiting the goats' hairs together, and tying them in a knot, she burns them on live coals, with abundance of perfumes.", "990": "That instant, through the irresistible power of the magic art,

effect an entrance.", "993": "Just at that mo­ ment up came you, well steeped in liquor, and deceived by the darkness of the night, you drew your sword, just like the frantic Ajax, but not like him to slay whole flocks of sheep ;", "994": "* a far more valiant deed was yours, for you deprived of breath three inflated goat skins, so that, having laid your adversaries prostrate, without staining

your open-lipped kisses, and your perfumed bosom, you hold me voluntarily enthralled, and sub­ jected to you as much as any slave.", "1004": "In fact, I am neither an­ xious to return home, nor am I making any preparations for that purpose, and nothing is there which I could prefer to this night.\"\"", "1005": "How gladly, Lucius, would I accomplish what you desire,\" she replied, \" but my mistress is so afraid of the malice and curiosity of the public, that she always performs her mysterious ceremonies in the strictest solitude and privacy.", "1006": "Still, I will consider your gratification more than my own danger, and will look out for a suitable opportunity to accomplish what you wish.", "1007": "Do you only, as I admonished you at the beginning, faithfully preserve silence upon a matter of such importance.", "1008": "\"While we thus conversed together, mutual desire seized us;", "1009": "and inspired with a Bacchanalian frenzy, as it were, we rushed into each other's arms.", "1010": "At last, after long wakefulness, sleep fell upon our weary eyes, and detained us in bed till late in the following day.", "1011": "After some few nights delightfully passed in this manner, Fotis came running to me one day in great excitement and trepidation, and informed me that her mistress, having hitherto made no proficiency by other means in her present amour, in­ tended to assume feathers like a bird, and so take flight to the object of her love ;", "1012": "and that I must prepare myself with all due care for the sight of such a wonderful proceeding.", "1013": "And now, about the first watch of the night, she escorted me, on tip-toe and with noiseless steps, to that same upper cham­ ber, and bade me to peep through a chink in the door, which I did accordingly.", "1014": "In the first place, Pamphile divested herself of all her gar­ ments, and having unlocked a certain cabinet, took out of it several little boxes.", "1015": "Taking the lid off of one of them, and pouring some ointment therefrom, she rubbed herself for a con­ siderable time with her hands, smearing herself all over from the tips of her toes to the crown of her head.", "1016": "Then, after she had muttered a long while in a low voice over a lamp, she shook her limbs with tremulous jerks, then gently waved them to and fro, until soft feathers burst forth, strong wings dis­ played themselves, the nose was hardened and curved into a beak, the nails were compressed and made crooked.", "1017": "Thus did Pamphile become an owl.", "1018": "Then, uttering a querulous scream, she made trial of her powers, leaping little by little from the ground;", "1019": "and presently, raising herself aloft, on full wing, she flies out of doors.", "1020": "And thus was she, of her own will, changed, by her own magic arts.", "1021": "But I, though not enchanted by any magic spell, still, rivetted to the spot by astonishment at this performance, seemed to myself to be any thing else rather than Lucius.", "1022": "Thus de­ prived of my senses, and astounded, even to insanity, I was in a waking dream, and rubbed my eyes for some time, to ascertain whether or not I was awake at all.", "1023": "At last, however, returning to consciousness of the reality of things, I took hold of the right hand of Fotis, and putting it to my eyes, \" Suffer me,\" said I, \"I beg of you, to enjoy a great and singular proof of your affection, while the opportunity offers, and give me a little ointment from the same box.", "1024": "Grant this, my sweetest, I entreat you by these breasts of yours, and thus, by conferring on me an obligation that can never be repaid, bind me to you for ever as your slave.", "1025": "Be you my Venus, and let me stand by you a winged Cupid.\"\"",

which you have enchanted my spirit, that I would prefer no other to my Fotis.", "1034": "And then besides, I bethink me, that as soon as I am rubbed with that ointment, and shall have been changed into a bird of this kind, I shall be bound to keep at a distance from all human habitations;", "1035": "for what a beautiful and agreeable lover will the ladies gain in an owl!", "1036": "Why!", "1037": "do we not see that these birds of night, when they have got into any house, are eagerly seized and nailed to the doors,* in order that they may atone, by their torments, for the evil destiny which they portend to the family by their inauspicious night ?", "1038": "But one thing I had almost forgot to in­ quire :", "1039": "what must I say or do, in order to get rid of my wings, and return to my own form as Lucius ?\"\"", "1040": "Be in no anxiety,\" she said, \"about all that matter;", "1041": "for my mistress has made me acquainted with every thing that can again change such forms into the human shape.", "1042": "But do not suppose that this was done through any kind feeling towards me, but in order that I might assist her with the requisite remedies when she returns home.", "1043": "Only think with what simple and trifling herbs such a mighty result is brought about:", "1044": "for instance, a little anise, with some leaves of laurel infused in spring water, and used as a lotion and a draught.", "1045": "\"Having assured me of this over and over again, she stole into her mistress's chamber with the greatest trepidation, and took a little box out of the casket.", "1046": "Having first hugged and kissed it, and offered up a prayer that it would favour me with a prosperous flight, I hastily divested myself of all my garments, then greedily dipping my fingers into the box, and taking thence a considerable quantity of the ointment, I rubbed it all over my body and limbs.", "1047": "And now, flapping my arms up and down, I anxiously awaited my change into a bird.", "1048": "But no down, no shooting wings appeared, but my hairs evidently be­ came thickened into bristles, and my tender skin was hardened into a hide;", "1049": "my hands and feet, too, no longer furnished with distinct fingers and toes, formed as many massive hoofs, and a long tail projected from the extremity of my spine.", "1050": "My face was now enormous, my mouth wide, my nostrils gaping, and my lips hanging down.", "1051": "In like manner my ears grew hairy, and of immoderate length, and I found in every respect I had become enlarged.†", "1052": "Thus, hopelessly surveying all parts of my body, I beheld myself changed not into a bird, but an ass.", "1053": "I wished to upbraid Fotis for the deed she had done;", "1054": "but, now deprived both of the gesture and voice of man, I could only expostulate with her silently with my under-lip hanging down, and looking sideways at her with tearful eyes.", "1055": "As for her, as soon as she beheld me thus changed, she beat her face with her hands, and cried aloud, \" Wretch that I am, I am undone!", "1056": "In my haste and flurry I mistook one box for the other, deceived by their similarity.", "1057": "It is fortunate, however, that a remedy for this transformation is easily to be obtained ;", "1058": "for, by only chewing roses, you will put off the form of an ass, and in an instant will become my Lucius once again.", "1059": "I only wish that I had prepared as usual some garlands of roses for us last even­ ing ;", "1060": "for then you would not have had to suffer the delay even of a single night.", "1061": "But, at the break of dawn, the remedy shall be provided for you.", "1062": "\"Thus did she lament;", "1063": "and as for me, though I was a per­ fect ass, and instead of Lucius, a beast of burden, I still re­ tained human sense :", "1064": "long and deeply, in fact, did I consider with myself, whether I ought not to bite and kick that most wicked woman to death.", "1065": "However, better thoughts recalled me from such rash designs, lest, by inflicting on Fotis the punishment of death, I should at once put an end to all chances of efficient assistance.", "1066": "So, bending my head low, shaking-my earu, I silently swallowed my wrongs for a time, and submitting to my most dreadful misfortune, I betook myself to the stable to the good horse which had carried me so well, and there I found another ass also, which belonged to my former host Milo.", "1067": "Now it occurred to me that, if there are in dumb animals any silent and natural ties of sympathy, this horse of mine, being influenced by a certain feeling of recognition and com­ passion, would afford me room for a lodging, and the rights of hospitality.*", "1068": "But, 0 Jupiter Hospitalis, and all you the guardian divinities of Faith!", "1069": "this very excellent nag of mine, and the ass, put their heads together, and immediately plotted schemes for my destruction;", "1070": "and as soon as they beheld me approach­ ing the manger, laying back their ears and quite frantic with rage, they furiously attacked me with their heels, fearing I had design upon their food;", "1071": "consequently I was driven away into the farthest corner from that very barley, which the even ing before I had placed, with my own hands, before that most grateful servant of mine.", "1072": "Thus harshly treated and sent into banishment, I betook my- self to a corner of the stable.", "1073": "And while I reflected on the inso­ lence of .", "1074": "my companions, and formed plans of vengeance against the perfidious steed, for the next day, when I should have be­ come Lucius once more by the aid of the roses, I beheld against the central square pillar which supported the beams of the stable, a statue of the goddess Hippona,* standing within a shrine, and nicely adorned with garlands of roses, and those, too, recently gathered.", "1075": "Inspired with hope, the moment I espied the salutary remedy, I boldly mounted as far as ever my fore legs could stretch ;", "1076": "and then with neck at full length, and ex­ tending my lips as much as I possibly could, I endeavoured to catch hold of the garlands.", "1077": "But by a most unlucky chance, just as I was endeavouring to accomplish this, my servant lad, who had the constant charge of my horse, suddenly espied me, sprang to his feet in a great rage, and exclaimed, How long are we to put up with this vile hack, which, but a few mo­ ments ago, was for making an attack upon the food of the cattle, and is now doing the same even to the statues of the Gods ?", "1078": "But if I don't this very instant cause this sacrilegious beast to be both sore and crippled\"—and searching for some­ thing with which to strike me, he stumbled upon a bundle of sticks that lay there, and, picking out a knotted cudgel, the largest he could find among them all, he did not cease to be­ labour my poor sides, until a loud thumping and banging at the outer gates, and an uproar of the neighbours shouting thieves!", "1079": "struck him with terror, and he took to his heels.", "1080": "The next moment the doors were burst open, an armed band of robbers rushed in, and surrounded the house on all sides;", "1081": "people ran from all quarters to help the defence, but the rob­ bers beat them off.", "1082": "Being all furnished with swords and torches, they illuminated the darkness of the night;", "1083": "and their swords gleamed like the rays of the rising sun.", "1084": "Then with their strong axes they broke open the stout bars and fastenings of a strong room in the middle of the house, which was filled with Milo's treasures, and having completely ransacked it, they hastily divided the booty, and tied it up in separate pack­ ages.", "1085": "Now the number of packages exceeded that of the men who were to carry them.", "1086": "Hence, being brought to extraor­ dinary shifts, through a superabundance of wealth, they led forth us, the two asses, and my horse, from the stable, loaded us with the heaviest burdens they possibly could, and drove us before them from the empty house, flourishing their sticks over us.", "1087": "Leaving one of their companions behind as a spy, to bring them word as to any proceedings taken in consequence of the robbery, they hurried us along through the bye-paths of the mountains, beating us every now and then, so that through the weight of my load, the steepness of the mountain, and the in­ terminable length of the way, I was no better than a dead donkey.", "1088": "At last I very seriously thought of resorting to the aid of the civil power, and liberating myself from so many miseries, by invoking the august name of the Emporor.", "1089": "Accordingly, when, in broad daylight, we were passing through a certain populous village, which was thronged with people celebrating a fair, I strove, in the midst of that crowd of Greeks, to utter the august name of Cæsar, in the native language, and I cried out 0! *. distinctly and sono­ rously ;", "1090": "but that was all, for the name of Cæsar I was not able to pronounce.", "1091": "The robbers abominating my discordant cla­ mour, thumped and gored my miserable hide, and left it hardly fit for a corn sieve.t", "1092": "But at last, that good Jupitert bestowed on me an unexpected chance of deliverance.", "1093": "For after we had passed by many small farms and fine country houses, I espied a delightful little garden, in which, besides other sweet flowers, there were virgin roses, § dripping with the morning dew.", "1094": "With longing desire, and overjoyed by the hope of safety, I moved towards them.", "1095": "But while, with quivering lips, I was preparing to seize them, this very im­ portant reflection came across me :", "1096": "if I divested myself of the asinine form, and again became Lucius, while in the hands of the robbers, they would surely kill me, either as a supposed magician, or for fear that I should inform against them.", "1097": "For the present, therefore, as a matter of necessity, I abstained from roses, and putting up with my present misfortune, was fain to champ my bridle under the guise of an ass.", "1098": "TOWARDS the middle of the day, when everything was scorched by the burning heat of the sun, we turned aside into a certain village, to the house of some old men, who were friends and acquaintances of the robbers;", "1099": "for so their first salutations, their lengthened conversation, their exchange of embraces, enabled me, ass as I was, to perceive.", "1100": "They made them presents of some things which they took off my back;", "1101": "and with secret whispers seemed to inform them that they had been obtained by burglary.", "1102": "At length, having lightened us of all our burden, they turned us into the next meadow, to graze as we pleased.", "1103": "My sense of conviviality, however, was not sufficient to keep me in the company of the ass, or of my horse, especially as I was not habituated to making my dinner upon grass.", "1104": "But as I was now perishing with hunger, I boldly effected an entrance into a little garden I caught sight of, behind the stable, and ate my bellyful of the vegetables, raw as they were.", "1105": "Then invoking all the gods, I looked about in every quarter to see if by chance I might any where espy in the neighbouring gar­ dens a rose-tree in full bloom.", "1106": "For the solitude of the spot, its distance from the public road, and the fruit trees that con­ cealed it, now afforded me great hopes, that if, on taking the remedy, I should quit the grovelling gait of a four-footed beast of burden and become erect again, in the shape of a man, I might do so, unobserved by any body.", "1107": "Whilst, then, I was fluctuating amid this sea of contempla­ tion, I beheld, a little further on, a dell shaded by a leafy grove;", "1108": "and among its various plants and delightful foliage, shone the vermilion tint of blooming roses.", "1109": "In my imagina­ tion, which was not entirely that of a brute, I pictured this to myself as the grove of Venus and the Graces;", "1110": "among whose shady recesses, the regal splendour of that genial flower was brilliantly glowing.", "1111": "So, invoking Prosperous Event, * I ran with such speed, that, by Hercules!", "1112": "I fancied myself no longer an ass, but an exceedingly swift racer of the circus.", "1113": "Still this remarkable effort of activity was unable to outstrip my evil fortune.", "1114": "For when I had now arrived at the spot, I no longer saw those fresh and charming roses, wet with divine dews and with nectar, which happy brambles and thrice-blessed thorns produce, nor, indeed, any dell whatever, but only the margin of a river's bank, planted with thickset trees.", "1115": "These trees had long leaves like those of the laurel, and bore a sort of inodorous blossom of a cup-like form and red colour.", "1116": "These scentless flowers the ignorant common people call, in their rural vocabulary, rose-laurels, to eat which is sure death to all cattle.", "1117": "Finding myself ensnared by such a fatality, and casting aside all regard for safety, I determined voluntarily to eat of these envenomed roses.", "1118": "But, while I was hesitatingly ap­ proaching in order to pluck them, a young fellow, the very gardener, as I saw, whose vegetables I had so shockingly laid waste, perceiving the loss he had sustained, ran furiously at me with a great stick in his hand, and having caught me, belaboured me so, that I should have been in danger of losing my life, had I not at last had the wisdom to take my own part.", "1119": "For throwing up my rump, I struck out at him rapidly and repeatedly with my hind feet, and having severely punished him, and laid him prostrate against a bank on the mountain's side, sought safety in flight.", "1120": "Instantly, however, a certain woman, his wife, I suppose, catching sight of him from an elevated spot, as he lay prostrate and half dead, flew towards him, with shrieks and yells, evi- dently on purpose, that by her lamentations she might be the occasion of my instant destruction.", "1121": "For all the villagers, being aroused by her screams, straightway called out their dogs, and from.", "1122": "all quarters hounded them on, in order that, exasperated by fury, they might rush upon me and tear me in pieces.", "1123": "I made no doubt whatever but that I was on the brink of death when I saw the dogs, very large ones too, and many in number, and fit to fight with bears and lions, rushing furiously against me from all quarters.", "1124": "Adopting, therefore, what seemed my only chance, I gave up all thoughts of flight, and galloped back to the inn at which we had put up.", "1125": "But the country people keeping off the dogs with much difficulty, seized and bound me with a very stout thong of leather to a staple, and would no doubt have beat me to death, had it not been that my stomach, compressed by the pain of the blows, and disordered by those raw vegetables with which it was stuffed, squirted out its contents, and drove away my persecutors from my aching sides, besprinkling some of them with the most abo­ minable liquid, and choking others with the stench.'", "1126": "Not long afterwards, as the sun was now declining from the meridian, the robbers again led us forth from the stable heavily laden, myself especially, whose burden was far heavier than that of the rest.", "1127": "We had now completed a good part of the journey;", "1128": "I was exhausted by its length and the weight of my burden, sore from the cudgelling I had got, and lame and staggering from my hoofs being quite worn to the quick;", "1129": "so, as I was passing along the winding course of a gently flowing rivulet, I was thinking that I would cunningly seize that excellent oppor­ tunity, and lie down, bending my legs under me, fully deter­ mined not to rise from the spot, whatever blows might be in­ flicted on me;", "1130": "ay, ready even, not only to be beaten with a stick, but pierced with a sword, rather than budge.", "1131": "For I imagined that being now fully half dead and exhausted, I should receive an honourable discharge,* on account of bodily infirmity:", "1132": "or, that at least the robbers, irritated at the delay, and desirous of hastening their flight, would divide the load which I carried on my back between the two other beasts of burden, and that, by way of a still more severe revenge, they would leave me a prey to the wolves and vultures.", "1133": "My most cruel destiny, however, thwarted the execution of so admirable a plan.", "1134": "For that other ass, divining and antici­ pating my intention, immediately pretended to be overcome with fatigue, and fell sprawling on the ground with all his bag­ gage, and lying as if he was dead, made no attempt to rise for all their whacking or goading, no, nor even when they tried to pull him up on all sides by the tail, the ears, and the legs.", "1135": "At last the robbers grew tired of the hopeless job, and having conferred together, they resolved that their flight should not be further retarded by wasting time upon an ass that was a,,;", "1136": "good as stone dead.", "1137": "So, having divided his load between me and the horse, and drawing a sword, they cut both his ham­ strings ;", "1138": "then they dragged him, still breathing, a little out of the public road, and threw

myself to my masters to be a diligent, deserving ass.", "1140": "Besides, I had heard them say to each other, that we should soon come to a stop, and make an end of our journey and our toils, for yonder was the place pf their abode.", "1141": "At length, having passed a little hill of easy ascent, we ar­ rived at the place of our destination.", "1142": "All the things were un­ packed and

demands that I should here give a description of the locality and of the cave in which the robbers dwelt.", "1145": "For thus I shall make trial of my own abilities, and at the same time enable you to judge if I was an ass in sense and understanding as well as in form.", "1146": "It was a rugged mountain, covered with dark forests, and of extraordinary height.", "1147": "Winding athwart its declivity, flanked by steep, inaccessible rocks, ran deep and intricate gullies, choked with brambles, and thus affording a natural defence.", "1148": "A spring burst forth from the summit of the mountain in great bubbling gushes, and rolling its silvery waters down the steeps, parted into a number of rivulets, formed pools in the valleys, and encompassed the base of the mountain with large sheets of standing water.", "1149": "On the rock, over the mouth of the cavern, there was a sort of fort, constructed with strong posts and hur- dies, enclosing a space well suited for penning sheep.", "1150": "Before the door there were small shrubs * extending along in place of a wall, and this enclosure you may fairly denominate, on my authority, the robbers' receiving room.", "1151": "There was no other edifice in the place, except a small hut roughly covered with reeds;", "1152": "in which sentinels, selected by lot from the band of robbers, as I afterwards learned, kept watch by night.", "1153": "Leaving us secured by a stout leather thong before the door, they crept into the cave, one after another, with their limbs squeezed together, and bawled angrily to an old woman, who, though bent with age, seemed to be entrusted with the entire charge of so many young men.\"", "1154": "What!", "1155": "you old corpse, whom Life is ashamed to own, and Death scorns, do you mean to

that craving stomach of yours.", "1157": "\"", "1158": "\"Nay, now,\" the frightened and trembling old woman squeaked out, “ nay, now, my brave and honourable young masters, there is plenty of nice stewed meat of all kinds, loaves in abundance, wine without stint, in polished cups, and warm water ready as usual for your hasty bath.\"", "1159": "When she had said this, they immediately undressed, and standing naked be­ fore a great fire, sluiced themselves with hot water, anointed themselves with oil, and then went and reclined at a table abundantly supplied with dishes.", "1160": "Hardly had they taken their places, when another and much more numerous party of young men entered, whom you would without hesitation have taken to be robbers also;", "1161": "for they, too, brought with them booty in the shape of gold and silver money, drinking vessels, and silken garments embroidered with threads of gold.", "1162": "The new-comers having likewise refreshed themselves by bathing, joined their comrades;", "1163": "and some who were chosen by lot waited upon the rest.", "1164": "They ato and drank in a most disorderly manner, with meat piled up in heaps, bread in hil- locks, and tankards ranged in whole platoons upon the board.", "1165": "They were obstreperous in their mirth, sang as loud as they could bawl, exchanged scurrilous jokes, and behaved in all respects like Theban Lapithæ,* or half-brute Centaurs.", "1166": "At last the burliest among them all thus addressed the rest:", "1167": "-\" Right bravely have we ransacked that house of Milo, at Hypata!", "1168": "And

to all these packages you have brought home.", "1170": "Be that as it may, it was his own excess of bravery that was his destruction, and the memory of so great a hero will be celebrated among illustrious kings and leaders in battle.", "1171": "But as for you, who are very careful robbers, you do a trumpery trade ‡ in petty, dastardly thefts, sneaking timidly about baths, and old women's bits of houses.", "1172": "\"To this, one of the new-comers replied, \"You don't know,.", "1173": "then, what is notorious to everybody, that large houses are much the easiest to sack ?", "1174": "For

took great pains to conceal his vast wealth, lest he should be required to serve in public capacities.", "1181": "In fact, content with a small but remarkably well barred and bolted house, he lived there all alone, ragged and dirty, and brooded over his bags of gold.\"", "1182": "Accordingly, we agreed to pay our first visit to him;", "1183": "for, despising the resistance of a single pair of hands, we thought we should, without any difficulty, carry off all his wealth.", "1184": "Without delay, therefore, as soon as it was night, we met to­ gether before his gate;", "1185": ".", "1186":

endeavoured to draw back the bolt.", "1187": "But Chryseros, that most villanous of all bipeds, having been on the watch all the time, and aware of all that was going on, crept softly to the door, preserving a profound silence, and with a sudden violent effort, fastened the hand of our leader, with a great nail, to a pannel of the gate.", "1188": "Then, leaving him transfixed, like a wretch on the cross, he ascended to the roof of his hovel, and shouted with all his might to his neighbours, calling to them by their respective names, and advising them to have regard for their- common safety,

dilemma, on the point of being overwhelmed by numbers unless we deserted our comrade, we adopted, with his, own consent, a desperate remedy, suggested by the circum­ stances.", "1192": "For we cut off our leader's † arm by a blow right through the joint;", "1193": "and leaving it there, we bound up the stump with plenty of rags, lest the drops of blood might betray our track, and hastily carried off with us what remained of Lama­ chus.", "1194": "The whole neighbourhood was now alarmed, and pursued us with loud outcries;", "1195": "and we, in the fear of impending peril, quickened our flight, whilst he could neither keep up with- our swift pace, nor yet remain where he was with any safety.", "1196": "Then this most magnanimous and transcendently brave man besought us with all manner of prayers and entreaties, by the right hand of Mars, and by our mutual oaths, to rescue a brave comrade from torture and captivity.", "1197": "'", "1198": "For how is it possible,' said he, ‘that a brave robber can survive the loss of his right hand, with which alone he can plunder and cut throats ?", "1199": "It would be happiness for him to meet a voluntary death by the hand of one of his comrades.", "1200": "As, however, he could not persuade any one of us, with all his entreaties, to commit a voluntary act of parricide, he drew his sword with his remaining hand, and after kissing it repeatedly, plunged it with a mighty stroke into the middle of his breast.", "1201": "Filled with veneration for the courage of our magnanimous leader, we carefully wrapped his mutilated dead body in a linen garment, and committed it to the sea,* there to find a place of concealment.", "1202": "And now does our Lamachust lie entombed, with the whole ocean for his burying-place, after having ended his life in a manner worthy of his heroic deeds.“", "1203": "And Alcimus likewise, with all his well-concerted enter­ prises, could not escape the sinister influence of fortune.", "1204": "He had

mistake, fall not into the hands of his associates, but into other people's houses;", "1209": "he therefore thrust his body out of the window, in order that he might make a judicious survey of the environs, and particularly that he might look with an eye to future business at that adjoining house she had mentioned.", "1210": "While, however, he was intent upon this, and quite careless of his own safety, that old miscreant took him unawares, as he leaned outwards, with his body balancing un­ steadily, and with a push which, though feeble, was sudden and unexpected, she pitched him out headlong.", "1211": "Besides falling from a great height, he dropped upon an enormous great stone which happened to lie near the house, so that he smashed all his ribs, and lay vomiting streams of blood, till, after he had first related* to us what had taken place, death put a speedy end to his torments", "1212": "Him also we buried in the same manner as our former leader, and sent him, as a worthy comrade, to follow Lamachus.\"", "1213": "Having thus suffered a double loss, we now abandoned our Theban enterprises, and departed for the next city, which is Plateæ.", "1214": "Here we heard a great deal of talk about a person named Demochares, who was about to exhibit a spectacle of gladiators.", "1215": "For, being a man of high birth, and distinguished for his great wealth and liberality, he catered for the public amusement with a splendour commensurate with his fortune.", "1216": "Where is the man with genius and eloquence enough to do- scribe, in appropriate words, all the various details of the manifold preparations?", "1217": "There were gladiators famous for dexterity of hand ;", "1218": "hunters of well-tried swiftness of foot;", "1219": "and criminals who, having forfeited their right to live in safety, were being fattened as food for wild beasts.", "1220": "There were great wooden stages, with towers formed of planks, like moveable houses, adorned outside with pictures, and serving as hand­ some receptacles for the performers in the exhibition.", "1221": "And then what a number, what a diversity of wild beasts!", "1222": "For he had been at great pains to procure, even from abroad, those noble living tombs of condemned men.\"", "1223": "Among his other costly preparations, he had procured, in.", "1224": "one way or other, with all the resources of his fortune, a great number of huge bears.", "1225": "For, besides those captured by his own servants in the chase, and those which he had bought at much cost, others had been presented to him by his friends, who vied with each other in showing him these attentions;", "1226": "and the whole collection was maintained with great care and cost.", "1227": "These noble and splendid preparations, however, for the public amusement, could not escape the evil eye of invidious Fortune.", "1228": "For these bears, pining and wasting away under their length­ ened confinement, the burning heat of the summer, and the debilitating effects of want of exercise, were attacked by a sudden mortality, and reduced to a very inconsiderable num­ ber.", "1229": "Hence, you might everywhere have seen bodies of half- dead bears lying in the streets, like so many shipwrecked vessels;", "1230": "and the ignoble mob, whose poverty compelled them to fill their pinched bellies with any filthy offal, began to flock about the food that was lying in all directions.", "1231": "\"Prompted by this circumstance, Babulus here and I thought of the following clever stratagem.", "1232": "We carried the fattest of these bears to our lodging, as though intending to pre­ pare it for food;", "1233": "and having entirely stripped the skin from the flesh, carefully preserving all the claws, and leaving the head of the beast entire, as far as articulation with the neck, we care­ fully scraped the hide, sprinkled it with fine ashes, and exposed it in the sun to dry.", "1234": "While it was being purified of its oily juices by the heat of that celestial fire, we gorged ourselves with its pulpy flesh, and made those of the troop who were pre­ sent take an oath to this effect:", "1235": "that one of our number--one who surpassed the rest, not so much in stoutness of body as of heart, and above all, one who should undertake it voluntarily- being covered with this skin, should assume the form of a bear, and then, being brought into the house of Demochares, should, on a seasonable occasion, afford us an easy entrance through the door, in the dead of night.\"", "1236": "No few of our gallant troop did the cleverness of this scheme encourage to undertake its execution;", "1237": "but Thrasyleon was elected by the suffrages of the band as the fittest to per­ form the hazardous service.", "1238": "With a serene countenance, he enclosed himself in the hide, which was now rendered soft and pliable;", "1239": "then with fine stitches we drew the edges together, and covered the fine seams with the thick shaggy hair, fitting Thrasyleon's head into the part close by the back of the mouth, where the neck of the beast had been, and leaving small holes for breathing about the nostrils and the eyes.", "1240": "Lastly, we enclosed our most valorous comrade, now changed into a wild beast, within a cage which we had bought for a small sum, into which he sprang with unflinching courage;", "1241": "and having thus completed the preliminaries of the stratagem, we proceeded to the execution of the remainder.\"", "1242": "Having learned, on enquiry, the name of a person called Nicanor, who was sprung from a Thracian family, and between whom and Demochares there were the strongest ties of friend­ ship, we wrote a counterfeit letter, intimating that this kind friend had dedicated the first fruits of his hunting to Demo­ chares, by way of a graceful present.", "1243": "And now, the evening being far advanced, availing ourselves of the favourable dark­ ness, we presented to Demochares the cage in which Thrasy­ leon was enclosed, together with the counterfeit letter;", "1244": "on which, admiring the huge size of the beast, and overjoyed at the opportune liberality of his friend, he immediately gave orders that ten pieces of gold should be counted out from his coffers to us who had brought him a present that afforded him so much delight.", "1245": "Meanwhile, as novelty always excites the curiosity of men and attracts them to unexpected sights, mul­ titudes flocked together about the brute, admiring its size;", "1246": "but our friend Thrasyleon very cleverly restrained their rather too prying curiosity, by frequently rushing at them in a very alarming way.", "1247": "By the unanimous voice of the citizens, Demo­ chares was pronounced most lucky and fortunate, in that, after so heavy a loss among his wild beasts, he had been able, in some way or other, to repair his losses by this new supply.", "1248": "He or­ dered the beast, therefore, to be immediately taken to his farm, and that it should be conveyed with the greatest care.“", "1249": "On. this, I interrupted him, and said, ‘ Be careful, sir, how you suffer this animal, which has suffered severely from the heat of the sun, and the length of the distance, to be trusted among a herd of many others, and those, according to what I hear, not yet recovered.", "1250": "Why not provide some spot in your own house for it, which is open and exposed to the breezes, and, if possible, bordering upon some cool lake ?", "1251": "Are you not aware that animals of this kind always couch in shady groves and dripping caverns, on breezy hills, and near pleasant fountains ?'", "1252": "Demo­ chares, taking the alarm at these admonitions, and reflecting on the great number of wild beasts he had already lost, as­ sented, without hesitation, to what I said, and readily permitted us to place the cage wherever we pleased.", "1253": "‘Besides,’ said I, ' we ourselves are ready to watch here by night, before this cage, in order that we may as carefully as is requisite give the beast its food at the proper time, and its usual drink, as it is distressed by the heat, and the harass it has suffered in being brought hither.'", "1254": "Demochares, however, made answer:", "1255": "‘We do not stand in need of your services;", "1256": "for nearly every one in my household is now, from long custom, well skilled in feeding bears.'\"", "1257": "After this, we bade him farewell;", "1258": "and going out of the gate of the city, we espied a certain monument, standing at a con­ siderable distance from the public road, in a solitary and retired spot.", "1259": "Here we opened some coffins,* which, through rottenness and age, had lost half of their lids, and which were tenanted by dead bodies, that were now nothing but dust and ashes.", "1260": "These we intended to use as so many hiding-places for our an­ ticipated booty.", "1261": "Then having, according to the observance -of our craft, watched for that season of a moonless night in which sleep most powerfully invades and overcomes the hearts of mortals with its first impetus, our band drew up, -well-armed with swords, before the gates of Demochares, ready to perform our agreement to plunder his house.", "1262": "In like man­ ner, Thrasyleon crept forth from his cage, availing himself of that precise moment of the night which is adapted to theft, and instantly slew with his sword every one of the house guards that lay fast asleep beside his cage, and lastly, the porter him­ self.", "1263": "Then, taking the key, he opened the folding doors-of the gate, and as we immediately rushed in, he pointed out to us the strong room, where he had sagaciously observed a quantity of silver plate deposited in the evening.", "1264": "This being instantly broken open by the combined force of our band, I recommended each of my comrades to carry away as much gold and silver as he could, and conceal it in those abodes of the dead, the most trusty of all people, and then returning with speedy steps, get ready a second burden, whilst I would remain alone, for our common good, before the door of the house, and keep a careful watch, until such time as they should return.", "1265": "Moreover, it appeared to me that the figure of a bear, running about in the middle of the house, was adapted to terrify any member of the family who might happen to be awake.", "1266": "For who, however brave and intrepid he might naturally be, would not, on behold­ ing the huge form of such an enormous beast, in the night espe­ cially, immediately betake himself to flight, and pulling to the bolt, shut himself in, terrified and trembling, in his chamber ?“", "1267": "A sinister event, however, thwarted all these judicious ar­ rangements.", "1268": "For while I was waiting, in anxious suspense, for the return of my comrades, one of the servant lads, happen­ ing, so the Gods ordained, to be awoke by the noise, I suppose, of the bear, crept gently forward, and seeing the wild beast running loose, and wandering over the whole house, he silently retraced his steps, and, as quickly as he could, gave notice to all of what he had seen;", "1269": "immediately upon which, the whole house was filled with a numerous assemblage of the domestics.", "1270": "The darkness was illuminated with torches, lamps, wax tapers, tallow candles, and other appliances for giving light by night.", "1271": "And not one was there in the throng without arms of some de­ scription, but all were furnished with clubs, spears, and drawn swords, with which they guarded the approaches to the house.", "1272": "And then they hallooed on some of those hunting dogs, with long ears and shaggy hair, to attack the wild beast.“", "1273": "Upon this, the tumult still increasing, I made my way stealthily out of the house, and concealing myself behind the gate, I saw Thrasyleon defending himself in a wonderful manner against the dogs.", "1274": "For, though he had now arrived at the very uttermost goal of life, still, forgetful neither of himself nor of us, nor his former valour, he struggled, as it were, in the very jaws of Cerberus.", "1275": "In fact, acting with spirit up to the scenic character which he had voluntarily assumed, at one moment flying and at another resisting, with various gestures and con.", "1276": "tortions of his body, he at length escaped from the house.", "1277": "Still, though he had gained his liberty, so far as being in the public road, he was not able to ensure his safety by flight;", "1278": "for all the dogs belonging to the next lane, and they were very savage and numerous, joined in whole troops with the hunting dogs, which had rushed out of the house, in full pursuit of him.", "1279": "I was then witness of a shocking and frightful spectacle,—our friend Thrasyleon, surrounded and hemmed in by troops of raging dogs, and lacerated all over by their teeth.\"", "1280": "At last, unable to endure so shocking a spectacle, I mingled with the surrounding crowds of people, and this being the only way in which I could secretly give assistance to my brave comrade, I thus attempted to divert the promoters of the at­ tack from their purpose, ‘ Oh what an enormous shame,' said I, ' thus to destroy such a fine and remarkably valuable beast.'", "1281": "The artifice failed, however, and all I could say had no in­ fluence in favour of the unfortunate young man.", "1282": "For a tall strong fellow came running out of the house, and instantly thrust a spear through the bear's vitals;", "1283": "another followed his example ;", "1284": "and then a great many took courage to assault him at close quarters, and vied with each other in piercing him with their swords.", "1285": "But as for Thrasyleon, that distinguished honor to our band, his heroic life, so worthy of immortality, being at length vanquished, though not his fortitude, he did not forfeit the oath he had plighted by any vociferation, shrieks, or cries.", "1286": "But, lacerated as he was by tooth and steel, he imitated to the last with all his might the growling and bellowing of a wild beast, and thus enduring his present cala­ mity with magnanimous fortitude, he kept his glory intact, while he yielded up his life to fate.", "1287": "Still, so great was the terror and dismay with which he had struck the crowd, that until the dawn, ay, even when it was broad day, not one dared to lay a finger even on the beast, dead as it lay, until at last, a certain butcher, who was a little bolder than the rest, advanc­ ing slowly and timidly, cut open the belly of the beast, and stripped the bear's hide off the mighty robber.", "1288": "Thus, then, was Thrasyleon also lost to us, but not lost to glory.\"", "1289": "And now, immediately collecting those packages which the trusty dead had taken care of for us, we made all haste to quit the limits of Plateæ, while ever and anon the reflection came across our minds, that it is no wonder if fidelity is not to be found among the living, since, abominating their perfidy, it has descended to the dead.", "1290": "In fine, here we are, all of us fatigued with the.", "1291": "weight of OUT loads, as well as the rough roads along which we have travelled;", "1292": "we have lost three of our comrades, and brought home the booty you see.", "1293": "\"", "1294": "END OF THE FOURTH EPISODE.", "1295": "After the robber had concluded his narrative, they poured out libations of pure wine from golden cups, to the memory of their deceased comrades ;", "1296": "and then, having propitiated the god Mars by some songs, they went to sleep for a short time.", "1297": "Mean­ while, the old woman served out to us fresh barley in such un­ measured abundance, that my horse, in fact, amid such great plenty, and having it all to himself, might have fancied he was supping with the Salii.*", "1298": "But as for me, though I had been in the habit of eating barley, well crushed, and long boiled in broth, having found out a corner in which the remains of the bread, belonging to the whole band, had been stored away, I strenuously exercised my jaws, which ached with long-con­ tinued fasting, and began to be covered with spiders' webs.", "1299": "When the night was far advanced, the robbers arose from sleep, struck their tents, and, being variously equipped, some of them being armed with swords, and others disguised as spectres, t with hasty steps, they sallied forth from their abode.",

sheaves of barley.", "2223": "For, believing me to be a female ass-driver, they let me pass free;", "2224": "because at that time my beardless cheeks were still soft and smooth as a boy's.", "2225": "Yet I have not degenerated from my paternal glory, or forgotten my fortitude, though somewhat fearful in consequence of being placed in the midst of martial blades ;", "2226": "but protected by the disguise of a dress foreign to my sex, and attacking villas or towns, single handed, I have pro- sured for myself this small viaticum by plunder.\"", "2227": "END OF THE SIXTH EPISODE.", "2228": "Ripping open his rags as he spoke, he poured forth into the midst of them two thousand pieces of gold coin.", "2229": "\"There,\" said he, \"I willingly offer to your band this contribution, and myself also (if you do not reject my offer), as a most faithful leader, who, in a short space of time, will make this your habitation to be no longer rocky, but golden.\"", "2230": "The rob­ bers, without hesitation, unanimously elected him their leader.", "2231": "They also brought forth a tolerably fair garment, which he put on, throwing away his rich rags.", "2232": "And having thus changed his attire, and embraced each of them, he was placed on the couch at the head of the table, and his leadership was inaugu­ rated by a supper, and copious bowls.", "2233": "In the conversation that ensued, the robber was made aware of the flight of the damsel, of my carrying her, and of the monstrous death to which each of us was destined.", "2234": "He asked where the virgin was, and being taken to her, and seeing her laden with chains, he turned away from her, with a contemp­ tuous curl of his nose, and said :", "2235": "\"I am not indeed so stupid, or at least so rash, as to oppose your decree;", "2236": "but I should have to endure the reproaches of my own conscience, if I dissembled what appears to me to be for your benefit.", "2237": "But, in the first place, suffer me, who am solicitous for your sake, to speak boldly, especially since, if my views are not acceptable to you, you may fall back on what you have decreed concerning the virgin and the ass.", "2238": "Now, I think that those robbers who are truly wise ought to prefer nothing to their own gain, not even vengeance itself, which is often detrimental to those who inflict it as well as to others.", "2239": "If, then, you destroy the virgin in the body of the ass, you will gratify nothing but your indig­ nation, without any profit to yourselves.", "2240": "It is my opinion that she should rather be taken to some city, and there sold;", "2241": "for a virgin of her age may be sold for no small price.", "2242": "I myself, some time ago, knew certain bawds, one of whom might, as I think, give a great sum of money for this virgin, and place her in a brothel, suitable to her birth, and from which she will not be likely to run away again.", "2243": "She will also have afforded you some revenge, when she has passed into bondage at a brothel.", "2244": "I have sincerely offered this counsel to you, as conducive to your advantage ;", "2245": "but you are the masters of your own judg­ ments and acts.\"", "2246": "Thus it was that this advocate of the rob­ bers' exchequer, and no less excellent saviour of the virgin and ass, pleaded our cause.", "2247": "The rest of the robbers, after tormenting my entrails and my miserable spirit by their tedious deliberations, at length cor­ dially acceded to the opinion of the new robber, and immedi­ ately freed the virgin from her bonds.", "2248": "But as for her, from the moment she beheld that young man, and heard him men­ tion a brothel and a bawd, she began to be elated, and to smile most joyfully, so that I felt inclined, with good reason, to vitu­ perate the whole sex, when I saw a virgin, who pretended that she was enamoured of a young lover, and was desirous of a chaste marriage, now suddenly delighted with the name of a vile and filthy brothel.", "2249": "It was a case in which the character of the whole female sex was in question, and the verdict de­ pended on the judgment of an ass.", "2250": "The young man, how­ ever, resuming his discourse, said :", "2251": "\"", "2252": "Why do we not proceed to supplicate Mars to be propitious to us in selling the virgin, and searching for other associates ?", "2253": "But, as far as I see, we have not any beast for sacrifice, nor sufficient wine for drink­ ing largely.", "2254": "Send with me, therefore, ten of our comrades, with whom I may go to the next town, and bring you thence meat and drink fit for priests.\"", "2255": "Accordingly, he departed, attended by ten of the robbers, and the rest prepared a great fire, and raised an altar of green turf to the god Mars.", "2256": "The foragers soon returned, bringing with them skins full of wine, and driving before them a great number of cattle;", "2257": "from among which they selected a large he-goat, old and shaggy, and sacrificed it to Mars the Secutor* and Associate.", "2258": "A sumptuous supper was immediately prepared.", "2259": "Then the stran­ ger said:", "2260": "\"You must consider me as a strenuous leader not only of your plundering expeditions, but also of your pleasures.\"", "2261": "And with that he went cleverly to work, and performed every thing that was requisite with admirable dexterity.", "2262": "He swept the floor, made the couches smooth, cooked the meat, seasoned the dishes, and served them up handsomely;", "2263": "but especially he plied each of them, and that frequently, with large bowls of wine.", "2264": "Nevertheless, under pretence of fetching what he wanted from time to time, he often went to the virgin, and gaily presented her with fragments which he had se­ cretly taken away, and cups of wine, of which he had pre­ viously tasted.", "2265": "And she most willingly received what he brought her, and sometimes, when he wished to kiss her, she readily responded to his wish, and kissed him.", "2266": "quite lovingly", "2267": "These things greatly displeased me;", "2268": "and I said to myself:", "2269": "Shame upon you, girl, do you forget your faithful lover and your nuptials ?", "2270": "Do you prefer this foreign and cruel homicide to that young man, whoever he be, to whom your parents have betrothed you ?", "2271": "Does not your conscience prick you, that you thus trample on affection, and are pleased to act libidinously among gleaming spears and swords ?", "2272": "What if the other rob­ bers, likewise, should, by some means or other, perceive what you are doing, would you not again return to the ass, and again procure my destruction?", "2273": "Really you are playing your game at the risk of another's skin.", "2274": "Whilst I was thus cogitating in great indignation, and falsely accusing the virgin in my own mind, I gathered from certain words of theirs, which though dubious, were not obscure to an intelligent ass, that the young man was not the famous robber Hsemus, but Tlepolemus, the bridegroom of the virgin.", "2275": "For, in the course of their conference, caring nothing for my pre­ sence, he said somewhat more distinctly:", "2276": "\" Be of good cheer, dearost Charite;", "2277": "for you shall presently have all these your enemies in captivity.\"", "2278": "And I observed that while he himself refrained from drinking immoderately, he never ceased to ply the robbers more and more with wine, now unmingled with water, and moderately heated, so that they began to be over­ come with intoxication.", "2279": "And, by Hercules, I suspect that he had mingled in their cups a certain soporiferous drug.", "2280": "At last, when they all, without a single exception, lay dead drunk on the floor, then Tlepolemus, having without any difficulty bound them strongly with ropes, and tied them together as he thought proper, placed the damsel on my back, and directed his steps to his own home.", "2281": "As soon as we arrived there, the whole city turned out at the wished-for sight.", "2282": "Parents, kindred, retainers, bondmen, and servants, joyfully ran out to meet us.", "2283": "You might see a procession of every age and sex, and, by Hercules, a new and memorable spectacle, a virgin riding in triumph on an ass.*", "2284": "As for myself, rejoicing with all my might, and not choosing to be at variance with the present display, as if I had no concern in it, I brayed strenuously, with erect ears and expanded nos­ trils, or rather, I trumpeted with a noise like thunder.", "2285": "The damsel having now retired to her chamber, where her parents cherished and caressed her, Tlepolemus immediately took me back to the cave, accompanied by a great number of beasts of burden, and a multitude of his fellow-citizens.", "2286": "Nor did I return unwillingly;", "2287": "for, curious at all times, I was then particularly desirous to be a spectator of the captivity of the robbers, whom we found still fast bound, with wine even more than with ropes.", "2288": "Having, therefore, ransacked the cave, and brought out every thing that was in it, and we, and all the rest being loaded with gold and silver, Tlepolemus and his at­ tendants rolled some of the robbers, bound as they were, over the neighbouring cliffs, and others they beheaded with their own swords.", "2289": "Then we returned to the city, exulting and re­ joicing in so complete a revenge.", "2290": "The robbers' wealth was deposited in the public treasury;", "2291": "but the damsel, who had been recovered by Tlepolemus, was given to him according to law.", "2292": "Then that noble woman paid the greatest attention to me, whom she called her saviour;", "2293": "and, on the very day of her nuptials, ordered my manger to be completely filled with bar­ ley, and as much hay to be given me as would be enough for a Bactrian eamel.", "2294": "But what sufficiently dire execrations could I imprecate on Fotis, who had transformed me not into a dog, but an ass, when I saw all the dogs stuffed and crammed with the relics of the most abundant supper, and with the food they had pillaged ?", "2295": "After the first night, the bride did not cease to tell her parents and her husband how greatly she was in­ debted to me, till they promised that they would confer on me the- highest honours.", "2296": "Convoking, therefore, their most inti­ mate friends, they held a consultation as to how I might most worthily be rewarded.", "2297": "One was of opinion that I should be shut up in the house, and there, leading an idle life, be fattened with choice barley, beans, and vetches.", "2298": "But the opinion of another prevailed, who regarded my liberty, and persuaded them rather to give me the run of the plains and meadows, where I might take ray pleasure among the herds of horses, and procreate many mules, for the masters of the mares.", "2299": "The keeper of the horses was accordingly summoned, and I was delivered over to him, with many injunctions that he should take care of me.", "2300": "And right gaily did I trot along by his side, rejoicing at the thought that I was now to have nothing more to do with packs and bags, and so forth, and that having obtained my liberty, I should doubtless find some roses in the meadows, when they began to blossom in spring.", "2301": "Frequently, too, it occurred to me, that since such great marks of gratitude and so many honours were conferred on me when but an ass, so much the greater would be the re­ spect and favour shown me when I had recovered the human form.", "2302": "But when the keeper of the horses had taken me to the country, I found there none of the pleasure or the liberty I ex­ pected.", "2303": "For his wife, an avaricious, bad woman, immediately yoked me to the mill, and frequently striking me with a green stick, prepared bread for herself and her family at the expense of my hide.", "2304": "And not content to make me drudge for her own food only, she also ground corn for her neighbours, and so made money by my toil.", "2305": "Nor, after all my weary labours, did she even afford me the food which had been ordered for me;", "2306": "for she sold my barley to the neighouring husbandmen, after it had been bruised and ground in that very mill, by ray own round­ about drudgery;", "2307": "but to me, who had worked during the whole of the day at that laborious machine, she only gave, towards evening, some dirty, unsifted, and very gritty bran.", "2308": "I was brought low enough by these miseries ;", "2309": "but cruel Fortune ex­ posed me to fresh torments, in order, I suppose, that I might boast of my brave deeds, both in peace and war, as the saying is.", "2310": "For that excellent equerry, complying, rather late, indeed, with his master's orders, for a short time permitted me to as­ sociate with the herds of horses.", "2311": "At length a free ass, I capered for joy, and softly ambling up to the mares, chose out such as I thought would be the fittest for my concubines.", "2312": "But here my joyful hopes gave place to extreme danger.", "2313": "For the stallions, who had been fed high for the sake of copulating with the mares, and who, independently of this, were terribly strong creatures, more than a match for any ass, regarding me with suspicion, and anxious to preserve the purity of their race, furiously pursued me as their rival, without respect for the laws of hospitable Jupiter.", "2314": "One of them, with his head and neck and ample chest aloft, struck at me like a pugilist with his forefeet;", "2315": "another, turning his brawny back, let fly at me with his hind feet;", "2316": "and another, with a vicious neigh, his ears thrown back, and showing his white teeth, sharp as spears, bit me all over.", "2317": "It was like what I have read in history of the King of Thrace,* who exposed his unhappy guests to be lacerated and devoured by wild horses.", "2318": "For so sparing was that power­ ful tyrant of his barley, that he appeased the hunger of his voracious horses by casting human bodies to them for food.", "2319": "In fact, I was so worried and distracted by the continual attacks of the horses, that I wished myself bark again at the mill round.", "2320": "Fortune, however, who could not be satiated with my tor­ ments, 'soon after visited me with another calamity.", "2321": "For I was employed to bring home wood from a mountain, and a boy, the most villanous of all boys, was appointed to drive me.", "2322": "It was not only that I was wearied by toiling up and down the steep and lofty mountain, nor that I wore away my hoofs by running on sharp stones, but I was cudgelled without end, so that all my bones ached to the very marrow.", "2323": "More­ over, by continually striking me on the off-haunch, and always in the same place, till the skin was broken, he occa­ sioned a great ulcerous cavity, gaping like a trench or a window;", "2324": "yet he never ceased to hit me on the raw.", "2325": "He likewise laid such a load of wood on my back, that you might have thought it was a burden prepared for an elephant, and not for a jackass.", "2326": "And whenever the ill-balanced load inclined to one side, instead of taking away some of the faggots from the heavier side, and thus easing me by somewhat lightening, or at least equalizing the pressure, he always remedied the inequality of the weight by the addition of stones.", "2327": "Nor yet, after so many miseries which I had endured, was he content with the immoderate weight of my burden;", "2328": "but when it happened that we had to pass over a river, he would leap on my back in order to keep his feet dry, as if his weight was but a trifling addition to the heavy mass.", "2329": "And if by any acci­ dent I happened to fall, through the weight of my burden, and the slipperiness of the muddy bank, instead of giving me a helping hand as he ought to have done, and pulling me up by the headstall, or by my tail, or removing a part of my load, till at least I had got up again;", "2330": "this paragon of ass-drivers gave me no help at all, however weary I might be, but begin­ ning from my head, or rather from my ears, he thrashed all the hair off my hide with a huge stick, till the blows stirred me up and served me instead of a stimulating medicament.", "2331": "Another piece of cruelty he practised on me, was this.", "2332": "He twisted together a bundle of the sharpest and most venomous thorns, and tied them to my tail as a pendulous torment;", "2333": "so that, jerking against me when I walked, they pricked and stabbed me intolerably.", "2334": "Hence, I was in a sore dilemma.", "2335": "For when I ran away from him, to escape his unmerciful drubbings, I was hurt by the more vehement pricking of the thorns;", "2336": "and if I stood still for a short time, in order to avoid that pain, I was compelled by blows to go on.", "2337": "In fact, the rascally boy seemed to think of nothing else than how he might be the death of me by some means or other;", "2338": "and that he sometimes threatened with oaths to accomplish.", "2339": "And, indeed, there happened a thing by which his detestable malice was stimulated to more baneful efforts ;", "2340": "for on a certain day, when his excessive insolence had overcome my patience, I lifted up my powerful heels against him ;", "2341": "and for this he retaliated by the following atrocity.", "2342": "He brought me into the road heavily laden with a bundle of coarse flax, securely bound together with cords, and placed in the middle of the burden a burning coal, which he had stolen from the neighbouring village.", "2343": "Presently the fire spread through the slender fibres, flames burst forth, and I was all over in a blaze.", "2344": "There appeared no refuge from immediate destruction, no hope of safety, and such a conflagration did not admit of delay, or afford time for deliberation.", "2345": "Fortune, however, shone upon me in these cruel circumstances ;", "2346": "perhaps for the purpose of reserving me for future dangers, but, at all events, liberating me from present and decreed death.", "2347": "For by chance perceiving a neighbouring pool muddy with the rain of the preceding day, I threw myself headlong into it;", "2348": "and the flame being immediately extinguished, I came out, lightened of my burden, and liberated from destruction.", "2349": "But that audacious young rascal threw the blame of this most wicked deed of his on me, and affirmed to all the shepherds, that as I was passing near the neighbours' fires, I stumbled on purpose, and set my load in a blaze ;", "2350": "and he added, laughing at me, \"How long shall we waste food on this fiery monster?", "2351": "\"A few days after this, he had recourse to still worse artifices against me.", "2352": "After having sold my load of wood at the nearest cabin, he led me home unladen, declaring that he could not mar age so vicious a brute, and that he renounced the miserable office of being my driver.", "2353": "\"", "2354": "Look at that lazy, crawling, out-and-out jackass,\" said he. \"", "2355": "Besides all his other miss- deeds, he is now worrying me with new ones that put me in mortal fear.", "2356": "For whenever he sees a traveller, be it a comely woman, or a marriageable girl, or a tender youth, he imme­ diately makes at them as if he was mad, upsetting his burden, and sometimes pitching off his very pack-saddle, and throws them down with abominable intentions, makes up his great ugly mouth as if to kiss them, and bites and tramples them most indecently.", "2357": "All this occasions us no small strife and quarrels, and will perhaps bring us into trouble with the ma­ gistrates.", "2358": "Just now, espying a decent young woman, this frolicksome gallant ran at her, scattering all his wood, threw her down in the mud, and wanted to have his wicked will of her there and then.", "2359": "Had not her shrieks brought some people to her help, who were passing that way, and who snatched her half dead from under his hoofs, she must have died a horrible death, and left us to suffer the last penalty of the law.", "2360": "\"With these and other such lies, which hurt my modesty the more because I could not reply to them, he desperately incensed the herdsmen against me.", "2361": "At last said one of them, \" Why do we not immolate as he deserves this public paramour, this universal adulterer ?", "2362": "Hark ye, boy ;", "2363": "cut off his head, throw his entrails to the dogs, and keep his flesh to feed the work­ people ;", "2364": "then we will carry his skin, well rubbed with ashes and dried, to our master, and easily make up a story of his having been killed by a wolf.", "2365": "Without delay my villanous accuser prepared joyfully to execute the herdsman's sentence with his own hand, and began to sharpen his knife on a whetstone, mocking, my woe, and maliciously calling to mind the kick I had given him, and which, by Hercules !", "2366": "I wished had finished him.", "2367": "But one of the rustics exclaimed that it was a shame to slaughter so fine an ass. \"", "2368": "Why lose the services of so useful a beast,\" he said, \" merely because he is too lustful ?", "2369": "Only geld him, and he can no how play his pranks any more ;", "2370": "we shall be safe from danger on his account, and besides, he will grow stouter and fatter than ever.", "2371": "I have known many an animal, not asses merely, but even high-spirited horses, that were so hot after mares, as to be quite furious and unmanageable, and which, after being cut, became quiet and fit to carry loads or do any- thing else that was required of them.", "2372": "So if you have no ob­ jection to what I say, after I have been to the market, which will not detain me long, I will fetch the implements from home, and immediately come back and geld this terrible rude gallant, and make him gentler than any wether.", "2373": "\"Snatched by this proposal from the very clutches of death, but reserved for a most cruel punishment, I grieved as though I were about to perish wholly in losing an appendage to my body, and thought of destroying myself by continual fasting, or by leaping down a precipice:", "2374": "in that way I should die none the less, but I should die entire.", "2375": "Whilst I was pondering my choice of deaths, morning came again, and that boy, who was my tormentor, led me as usual up the mountain, where fastening me to a branch of great oak, he went a little way off, and began to cut down a load of wood with his axe.", "2376": "Just then, I saw a horrid bear lift up its great head, and creep out of a cave close by.", "2377": "Appalled at the sudden sight, I started back, sinking down with all my might upon my haunches, while my head and neck were held up by the thong, until it broke ;", "2378": "whereupon I dashed down the mountains, not on my feet only, but projecting myself bodily, reached the plains beneath, and scoured across them, running with all my might from the dreadful bear, and the boy that was worse than the bear.", "2379": "A man who was passing that way, seeing me roam at large, caught me, got on my back, and thumping me with a stick, turned me into a side road unknown to me.", "2380": "I carried him along with good will, thinking I was running away from that cruel operation, and caring little about the blows I received, for I was used to that sort of thing.", "2381": "But Fortune, with her inveterate malice, anticipated so opportune a chance of escape, and gave me over to fresh sufferings.", "2382": "For my master's herds­ men having gone out in all directions to look for a stray heifer, Happened to fall in with us, and seizing me by the head stall, which they readily identified, they began to lead me away.", "2383": "My rider, however,

they discovered what were plainly the remains of his body, torn to pieces and strewed here and there.", "2395": "I knew well it was the bear's teeth had done this, and I would certainly have said so,

Thrasyllus, of noble birth, of knightly rank, and very rich ;", "2428": "but he was a man addicted to the luxury of taverns, and to harlots, and potations by day.", "2429": "On this account he iniquitously associated with a factious band of robbers, and his hands were dyed with human blood.", "2430": "Such was the man, and such was the report concerning him.", "2431": "Now, as soon as Charite was mar­ riageable, he was among her principal suitors, and most ar­ dently endeavoured to obtain her in wedlock.", "2432": "And, though he surpassed in nobility all the rest of her lovers, and solicited her parents with splendid gifts, yet he was rejected by them, on account of his morals, and suffered the disgrace of a repulse.", "2433": "When, therefore, Charite, my master's daughter, came into the hands of the worthy Tlepolemus, Thrasyllus, though disap­ pointed in his hopes, yet firmly cherishing his love, and adding to his passion the rage he felt on account of his rejected suit, sought for an opportunity of perpetrating a bloody deed.", "2434": "At length, a seasonable occasion presenting itself, he prepared to execute the wickedness which had for a long time been the subjects of his thoughts.", "2435": "On the day on which the virgin had been liberated, by the cunning and fortitude of her spouse, from the deadly swords of the robbers, he mingled with the crowd of those that congratulated her, and made himself re­ markable by the exulting joy he professed in the present safety of the new married pair, and in the hopes of their future off­ spring.", "2436": "Hence, being received into our house, among the principal guests, as the nobility of his race demanded, and con­ cealing his wicked designs, he falsely personated the character of a most faithful friend.\"", "2437": "And now, gradually ingratiating himself more and more by his assiduity, by frequent conversation, and sometimes also by sitting as a guest at the young couple's table, he fell, by imperceptible degrees, into deeper love than ever.", "2438": "Nor is this wonderful, since the flame of love, small at first, delights with a gentle glow ;", "2439": "but, when fanned by continued familiar inter­ course, it waxes fierce, and burns a man up wholly.", "2440": "Thra­ syllus for a long time pondered how he might find an oppor­ tune place for clandestine conference.", "2441": "He perceived that he was more and more excluded from the avenues to an adulterous intercourse by the multitude of observers, and that the strong bonds of a new and increasing affection could not be severed;", "2442": "and, further, that even if Charite were willing to comply with his desires, which she never would be, her ignorance of the art of deceiving a husband would hinder such a purpose.", "2443": "Yet, in spite of all these obstacles, ho was bent with desperate ob- stinacy on the accomplishment of what was impossible, as though it had not been so.", "2444": "Things which seem difficult in the beginning of love, appear easy when it has been strengthened by time.", "2445": "Hear now, and carefully note, I pray you, to what deed he was driven by the violence of his furious lust.\"", "2446": "One day Tlepolemus, accompanied by Thrasyllus, went to hunt wild beasts, if, indeed, the roe comes under that denomi­ nation ;", "2447": "for Charite would not allow her husband to pursue beasts armed with tusk or horn.", "2448": "The toils were spread round a hill thickly covered with trees, and the high-bred hounds were turned in to rouse the beasts from their lairs.", "2449": "Their good training was immediately seen, for they spread abroad so as to enclose every avenue.", "2450": "For a while they followed the scent in silence, till at last one gave tongue, and then they all burst out with impetuous, dissonant yells, that made everything ring again.", "2451": "But it was not a roebuck, nor a timid doe, nor a hind, the gentlest of all wild creatures, that was started, but an enor­ mous boar, the like of which was never seen-a brawny, thick- hided, filthy brute, with bristles standing upright on his back, foaming and gnashing his teeth, with eyes that darted fire, and rushing along like a thunderbolt.", "2452": "The keenest of the hounds that pressed upon his flanks were ripped up by his tusks, and flung here and there;", "2453": "then he broke through the toils at the first charge, and got clear off.", "2454": "We, meanwhile, were terror- stricken, having been used only to such hunting as was without danger, and being, besides, without weapons or means of de­ fence ;", "2455": "so we hid ourselves the best way we could under thick foliage and behind trees.\"", "2456": "Thrasyllus now seeing a favourable opportunity for accom­ plishing his intended treachery, said insidiously to Tlepolemus:", "2457": "'", "2458": "Why do we remain stupified with surprise, or even dismayed, like these low-souled slaves, and trembling like women, whilst we suffer such a fine prey to escape us ?", "2459": "Why not mount and pursue ?", "2460": "You take a javelin, and I will take a lance.'\"", "2461": "Without more said, they jumped at once on their horses, and made after the brute with all speed.", "2462": "But the boar, conn- dent in its strength, wheeled round, and looking horribly fero­ cious as it gnashed its teeth, stood glaring at them uncertain which to attack first.", "2463": "Tlepolemus hurled his javelin, and lodged it in the animal's back;", "2464": "but Thrasyllus, leaving the boar alone, charged the horse Tlepolemus rode with his lance, and cut its hamstrings.", "2465": "The quadruped, sinking down in a poo* of its own blood, rolled over on its back, and involuntarily threw its master, whom the boar immediately rushed at in fury, and after tearing his clothes, rent his body in many places as he was endeavouring to rise.", "2466": "Meanwhile, his good friend felt no remorse for the infamous deed he had begun, nor was his cruelty yet satisfied;", "2467": "for whilst Tlepolemus was striv­ ing to defend his gored legs, and was piteously calling to him for help, he pierced him through the middle of the right thigh with his lance;", "2468": "which he did the more boldly, because he judged that the wound would resemble those made by the brute's tusks.", "2469": "Afterwards he ran the boar through and through with­ out difficulty.\"", "2470": "After the young man was thus slain, we were all called out from our hiding-places, and ran to him in great grief.", "2471": "But Thrasyllus, though he had accomplished his purpose, and re­ joiced in having slain him whom he looked on as his enemy, yet concealed his joy under a countenance that simulated sorrow;", "2472": "and ardently embracing the corpse that he himself had made, he cleverly counterfeited all the signs of mourning, only his tears refused to flow.", "2473": "Thus imitating us who lamented truly, he falsely cast upon the boar the odium of the deed his own hand had done.", "2474": "\"The news of this crime spread quickly, and first of all reached the family of Tlepolemus, and smote the ears of his unhappy wife.", "2475": "The moment she heard it—she will never hear news more-she lost her senses, and ran like a frantic bacchanal through the crowded streets, and away over the fields, scream­ ing out her husband's name, and bewailing his fate.", "2476": "The com­ passionate citizens flocked after her;", "2477": "all who met her followed Jier, sympathizing in her grief;", "2478": "and the whole city was emptied to see the sad spectacle.", "2479": "At last, she reached the spot where lay the body of her husband;", "2480": "there, swooning away, she fell prostrate on his corpse, and all but yielded up on the spot the soul that was devoted to him;", "2481": "but her friends with difficulty forced her away, and she remained unwillingly alive.", "2482": "\"At last, the body was carried to the tomb, the whole city joining in the funeral procession.", "2483": "Then did Thrasyllus cry, and roar, and beat his breast, and even weep, for the tears which lie had been unable to shed in his first feigned sorrow, were now supplied him by his augmented joy.", "2484": "He concealed his real feelings with all sorts of affectionate words, calling piteously to the deceased by name, as his friend, his playmate in boyhood, his comrade, his brother.", "2485": "And every now and then he would take hold of Charite's hands to hinder her from beating her bosom;", "2486": "would try to mitigate her grief and wail­ ing with words expressive of the liveliest sympathy, and with various examples of the uncertainty of life.", "2487": "And amidst all these false shows of humanity and friendship, he took every opportunity of touching the person of the bereaved woman, and nourishing his own odious passion by that stolen pleasure.\"", "2488": "The funeral being ended, the widow was now impatient to join her husband, and thought over all means to that end.", "2489": "At last, she chose one that was gentle, cost no effort, needed no weapon, and was like quietly falling asleep.", "2490": "She abstained from food, neglected her person, and would have passed away from daylight to the darkness of the grave, but for the urgent pertinacity of Thrasyllus, who, partly by his own efforts, partly through those of her friends and her parents, prevailed on her to refresh her disfigured and almost perishing body with the bath and with food.\"", "2491": "Charite, who revered her parents, yielded against her will to a religious sense of duty, and with a somewhat more serene countenance did what was necessary for the preservation of her life;", "2492": "but still her inmost soul was consumed with grief.", "2493": "She spent all her days and nights in pining remembrance, and in paying divine honours to an image of the deceased, which she had caused to be made in the costume of the god Bacchus, so that she tortured herself, even by that kind of consolation.", "2494": "Meanwhile, the reckless, headlong Thrasyllus, without waiting until the tears she shed had satisfied her grief, nor till the commotion of her spirits had partly subsided, and time had gradually blunted the keenness of her sorrow, did not forbear to speak to her of marriage while she was still weeping for her husband, rending her garments, and tearing her hair, and to reveal to her by his indecent importunity the secret of his breast and his ineffable treachery.\"", "2495": "Charite was seized with horror and loathing at the abo­ minable proposal, which came upon her like a clap of thunder, or a blast from some malignant star, and she fell senseless as if smitten by lightning.", "2496": "Recovering after a while, with wild shrieks, she called to mind what had passed between her and the villain Thrasyllus, and postponed her reply to his suit until she should have maturely considered it.", "2497": "\"During that delay, the shade of the cruelly-slam Tlepo­ lemus, lifting up its ghastly, gory face, thus addressed her as she slept:", "2498": "' My own wife, a name which none else shall call you, if my memory dwells in your heart-if my cruel death has broken the bonds of affection that united us, contract a happier marriage with whom you will, only give yourself not into the sacrilegious hands of Thrasyllus:", "2499": "neither talk with him, nor sit at the same board, nor share the same bed with him.", "2500": "Shun the blood-stained hand of my murderer;", "2501": "begin not your marriage with parricide.*", "2502": "Those gory wounds which you have washed with your tears were not all inflicted by the tusks of the boar;", "2503": "but the lance of the wicked Thrasyllus has parted me from you.'", "2504": "And then he told her all the circum­ stances, and set before her the whole scene of the crime.\"", "2505": "When Charite had first laid her head upon her pillow, her tears flowed over her beautiful cheeks even while she slept;", "2506": "but roused by the vision of her restless sleep as by the wrench of the rack, she broke out again into loud and long wailing, tore her night-dress, and beat her lovely arms with merciless hands.", "2507": "Yet she imparted to no one the story of the appari­ tion she had seen;", "2508": "but concealing altogether the knowledge she had obtained of the crime, she secretly resolved to punish the nefarious murderer, and to deliver herself from the intoler­ able burthen of life.", "2509": "\"Again the odious and importunate suitor assailed her obdu­ rate ears with proposals of marriage;", "2510": "but she gently declined them, and dissembling her purpose with admirable artifice, she thus replied to his urgent supplications :", "2511": "'", "2512": "The sweet face of your brother, my beloved husband, is still before my eyes;", "2513": "the cinnamon odour of his ambrosial body is still in my nostrils;", "2514": "the beautiful Tlepolemus still lives in my bosom.", "2515": "You will do best then if you allow a most wretched woman the necessary time for mourning, and let the remaining months of the year be spent in that legitimate duty.", "2516": "What I ask concerns not only my own reputation, but your safety also, lest by a prema­ ture marriage we provoke the just indignation of my husband's ghost to your destruction '\"Unchecked in his importunity by these arguments, and even by the promise that accompanied them, Thrasyllus persisted in molesting her ears with his vile addresses, until, apparently overcome, Charite said to him:", "2517": "' One thing at least, Thra­ syllus, you must grant to my earnest entreaties, and that is that our cohabitation be quite secret and unknown to any of my family until the year is out.'", "2518": "Thrasyllus was completely duped by her feigned compliance with his suit;", "2519": "he consented with 'alacrity to the clandestine intercourse, and passionately longed for the return of night and darkness, caring for nothing in comparison with the possession of Charite.", "2520": "' But mind,' said Charite, ' come well muffled up, without any attendant,- and approach my door in silence at the first watch.", "2521": "Only whistle once, and wait for my nurse, who will be on the watch behind the door, and will instantly open it for you, and conduct you in the dark to my chamber.'\"", "2522": "Thrasyllus, suspecting nothing, was delighted with the scheme of those funereal nuptials, and was only troubled with impatience at the length of the day and the slow approach of evening.", "2523": "At last, when daylight had disappeared, dressed as Charite had directed, he was admitted by the watchful nurse, and stole full of hope to the nuptial chamber.", "2524": "There the old woman, treating him with obsequious attention by her mis­ tress's orders, noiselessly produced cups and a flagon con­ taining wine mixed with a soporiferous drug.", "2525": "Then excusing her mistress's delay on the pretext that she was with her father, who was ill, she plied him with the beverage, which he drank freely, and without suspicion, until he fell fast asleep.\"", "2526": "As soon as he lay stretched on his back in that helpless state, Charite was summoned, and rushing in with dire deter­ mination, stood quivering with rage over the murderer, ' Be­ hold,' she cried, ' this

Tlepolemus, and sacrifice those eyes to his sacred shade.", "2546": "But why do I suffer you to have a respite from your deserved torture, while you are dreaming perhaps of embracing me, who am your

by the side of Tlepolemus, re-united her for ever to the husband she loved.\"", "2568": "When Thrasyllus was aware of all this, he thought he could not inflict on himself a death commensurate with the cala­ mities he had caused, and that the sword could not suffice to expiate his guilt;", "2569": "therefore he had himself carried to the tomb of Tlepolemus and Charite, where, crying out repeatedly, ' Be­ hold, 0 ye injured manes, here is your voluntary victim,' he caused the doors to be firmly closed upon him;", "2570": "and there he suffered the doom pronounced by himself, and perished by starvation.\"", "2571": "END OF THE SEVENTH EPISODE.", "2572": "Such was the story, interrupted with many sighs and tears, which the servant told to the sorrowing rustics, who fearing a change of master, and deeply commiserating the misfortune of the house to which they had belonged, determined to run away.", "2573": "The master of the stud, the same to whom I had been given in charge with such impressive orders to be kind to me, plun­ dered the cottage of everything valuable in it, and loading me and other beasts of burden with the spoil, deserted his old abode.", "2574": "We carried women and children, cocks and hens, geese, kids, whelps ;", "2575": "in short, whatever was unable to keep up with our pace, was made to walk with our feet.", "2576": "But enormous as my load was, I did not care for it, so glad was I of the flight that saved me from the knife of that abominable -elder.", "2577": "Having crossed a steep mountain covered with a forest, and descended to the plain on the other side, we arrived, just as evening was throwing its shadows on our road, at a certain populous and thriving town, whence the inhabitants would not allow us to proceed by night, nor even in the morning.", "2578": "The reason of this was, that the whole district was infested by mul­ titudes of fierce wolves of enormous bulk and strength, that even beset the roads and fell like highway robbers on those who travelled by them.", "2579": "Nay, sometimes impelled by the rage of hunger, they stormed the neighbouring farms, and the men were no more safe from their fury than their defenceless flocks.", "2580": "They told us too, that the road we should have to travel was strewn with half-eaten human bodies, and whitened with flesh­ less bones;", "2581": "and therefore, that we ought to proceed with ex­ treme caution, and be especially careful to travel only in broad day-light, while the sun was high in the heavens, since its light checks the fury of those dreadful creatures;", "2582": "'and that we should move, not stragglingly, but in close compact order, through those dangerous places.", "2583": "But our rascally fugitive conductors, in blind haste to escape the risk of pursuit, despised these salutary warnings, and with­ out waiting for day-light, loaded and drove us forward.", "2584": "Then I, aware of the danger, took all possible care to keep between the other beasts in the very middle of the throng, so as to save my buttocks from the fangs of the wolves;", "2585": "and all our con­ ductors were much surprised to see me beat the horses in speed.",

renowned Pegasus, and that the reason why he had been styled winged, was, doubtless, because he had skipped and bounded up to the very sky, in his dread of being bitten by the fire-breath­ ing Chimæra.", "2588": "Meanwhile the herdsmen who drove us had armed themselves as if for battle.", "2589": "This one carried a lance, that one a hunting spear, another a bundle of javelins, another a club ;", "2590": "and some had provided themselves with stones, which the rough road supplied in abundance.", "2591": "A few carried sharpened stakes, and a great number waved blazing torches to frighten the beasts;", "2592": "and nothing but the trumpet was wanting to give our troop the appearance of an army in battle array.", "2593": "But after having terribly frightened ourselves, we escaped the threatened danger only to fall into a worse one.", "2594": "For, whether scared by the shouting of solargeabody of men, and by the glare of the torches, or being engaged elsewhere, the wolves never approached us, nor did one of them come in sight even at a distance.", "2595": "But the labourers on the farm which we were then passing, taking us for a gang of robbers, and letting slip enormous dogs, which had been carefully trained for their masters' defence, and were fiercer than any wolves or bears, urged them against us with all sorts of shouts and cries.", "2596": "With their natural ferocity thus encouraged and exasperated, the dogs rushed at us, at­ tacked ns on all sides, men and cattle w ithout distinction, and after mauling them a long time, laid many of them low.",

bodies of those who were down, and overrunning our whole troop, biting all that came before them.", "2599": "This was terrible indeed, but worse was added to it;", "2600": "for the peasants poured down showers of stones upon us from the roofs of their cottages and from an adjacent hill, so that we were quite at a loss to know which we should most avoid, the dogs that attacked us at close quarters, or the stones that were launched at us from a distance.", "2601": "One of the latter fell upon the head of a woman who was seated on my back, and who, smarting from the blow, immediately began to scream and roar for her husband to come to her aid.", "2602": "Wiping the blood from her wound, the herdsman cried out, \" In the name of all the gods, why do you so cruelly assault and maltreat poor hard­ working travellers ?", "2603": "Have we offered to rob you ?", "2604": "What harm have we ever done you ?", "2605": "You do not live in dens like wild beasts, or in caves like savages, that you should take delight in shedding human blood.", "2606": "\"As soon as he had said this, the shower of stones ceased, the ferocious dogs were called off, and one of the peasants cried

like at your hands, so now you may go your ways in peace and safety.\"", "2609": "Therefore we continued our journey, but wounded in all manner of ways, some with stones, others by the teeth of the dogs, but all more or less hurt.", "2610": "Having gone a little way further, we reached a grove of tall trees, with pleasant green glades, where our leaders thought good to rest and take some refreshment, and dress the wounds of their bruised and mangled bodies.", "2611": "So they threw them­ selves on the ground in all directions, and after lying awhile to recover from their fatigue, they began to apply various re­ medies to their wounds, washing the blood from them in the running stream ;", "2612": "applying wet sponges to their contusions, and tying up their gaping wounds with bandages.", "2613": "In this way each did the best he could for himself.", "2614": "Meanwhile, an old man was descried on the top of a hill, with goats feeding round him, and plainly showing that he was a goat-herd.", "2615": "One of our people called out, and asked him had he any milk or new cheese to sell.", "2616": "But he, shaking his head a long while, replied :", "2617": "\"And are you

flict, sprang to his feet, and enquiring where it was the boy had fallen, went with the old man towards some rough bushes which the latter pointed out a little way off.", "2631": "Meanwhile, after the cattle had done feeding, and their drivers had finished their meal and the dressing of their wounds, each of them packed up his baggage again, and.", "2632": "made ready for another start.", "2633":

priests of the god­ dess on the sacrificial meats ;", "2752": "and I upset and smashed great part of the supper things, and even the tables.", "2753": "The master of the house, greatly annoyed by such unseemly havoc, ordered one of his servants to take away “the troublesome, frisky brute,\" as he called me, and gave the man strict injunctions to shut me up in some safe place, that I might not again

a bellyful of food.", "3079": "For both my master and myself had meals alike in quality and quantity, and very meagre they were;", "3080": "since they consisted of old and unsavoury lettuces, which had run to seed, looked just like so many brooms, and were full of a clammy, bitter juice, that smelt disgustingly.", "3081": "One night, a householder who lived in the next village, having lost his way through the darkness of a moonless night, and got drenched to the skin with rain, turned with his wea­ ried horse into our garden;", "3082": "and being as courteously received as circumstances would allow of, and being invited to tako there a night's repose, which, if not surrounded by many re­ finements, was at all events very welcome, he desired to make a present to his hospitable entertainer, and promised that he would give him from his farm some corn and oil, and two casks of wine.", "3083": "My master therefore proceeded, without delay, to the farm of the householder, which was distant from his garden sixty stadia,*seated on my bare back, and carrying with him a little sack, and some empty wineskins.", "3084": "The journey accomplished, we arrived at the farm, and there the kind host immediately asked my master to partake of a sumptuous entertainment.", "3085": "But while they were drinking jovially, a most astonishing prodigy took place.", "3086": "One ofthe hens in the poultry-yard, running through the middle of the yard, kept up a continual cackling, as if she wanted to lay.", "3087": "On this her master, looking at her, said, \"Notable servant that you are, and remarkably prolific, for this long time you have treated us with your daily productions.", "3088": "And now, too, I see, you are thinking about helping us to a dainty morsel.", "3089": "Boy!\" said he, speaking to one of his servants, “get the basket that the hens lay in, and place it in the corner as usual.\"", "3090": "When the boy had done as he was desired, the hen, refusing to go to her nest as usual, produced before the very feet of her master a premature offspring, and one of a singularly ominous nature.", "3091": "For she did not bring forth an egg, as we usually see hens do, but a chicken, perfectly formed, with feathers and claws, eyes and voice;", "3092": "which immediately began to follow its mother about.", "3093": "Another prodigy also occurred, of a far more astonishing nature than the former, and at which all men might with great reason be terrified.", "3094": "For, under the very table which held the remnants of the entertainment, the earth opened with a yawning chasm from its inmost depths, and a copious foun­ tain of blood gushed forth;", "3095": "while numerous drops, as they splashed about, sprinkled the table with gore.", "3096": "At that very instant also, while every one was struck with astonishment and dismay at these divine presages, one of the servants came running from the wine cellar, and announced that all the wine, that had long ago been racked off, was boiling up in all the vessels, with a heat as if a large fire had been put under it.", "3097": "In the meantime also, some weasels were observed, outside of the house, dragging into it a dead serpent.", "3098": "Then, too, out of the mouth of the sheep-dog jumped a small green frog;", "3099": "and a ram that stood near him rushing on the same dog, strangled him at a single grip.", "3100": "These numerous portents, and others of a like nature, filled the minds of the master of the house and all his family with intense amazement and terror;", "3101": "what was to be done first or what last;", "3102": "what they ought especially to do, and what they ought not to do to appease the anger of the Gods;", "3103": "with how many and what sort of victims they should make atonement, they were quite at a loss to decide.", "3104": "While all were stupefied with expectation of some dreadful catastrophe, a servant came running in, and announced to the master of the house a great and fearful visitation.", "3105": "THIS good man was the proud father of three sons, now grown up, well educated, and remarkable for their good conduct.", "3106": "Between these young men and a poor man, the owner of a small cottage, there had been an intimacy of long standing.", "3107": "Now, close adjoining to the humble cottage lay the extensive and fertile domain of a wealthy and powerful young man, who made but bad use of the influence derived from his high birth.", "3108": "As he was powerful from the number of his dependents, and did what he pleased in the city, he behaved in a very un­ ceremonious manner to his poor neighbour, killing his sheep, driving away his oxen, and trampling down his corn before it was ripe.", "3109": "Already he had deprived him of all hopes of a harvest, and now he wanted to expel him from the posses­ sion even of his land.", "3110": "To this end, raising a frivolous ques­ tion about the boundaries of the fields, he laid claim to the whole of the land as his own.", "3111": "Upon this, the countryman, who was otherwise a mild, harmless man, seeing himself plundered, through the avarice of his rich neighbour, collected together a considerable number of his friends, for the purpose of ascertaining what were the actual boundaries of his land, in order that, at all events, he might keep enough of his paternal land to dig himself a grave.", "3112": "Among others, the three brothers were present, to give such small assistance as best they might, in their friend's extreme need.", "3113": "Still, the mad oppressor was not in the least daunted, or even moved, by the presence of many citizens, and was so far from being disposed to abstain from acts of rapine, that he would not even confine himself to civil language.", "3114": "For, when they mildly expostulated with him, and endeavoured to pacify his boisterous disposition by soothing words, he swore in the most solemn manner by his own life and that of his dearest relatives, that he cared but little for the inter­ ference of so many arbitrators;", "3115": "and that, in fact, he would forthwith order his servants to take that neighbour of his by the ears, and drag him far away from his cottage, and banish him altogether.", "3116": "His words aroused the greatest indignation in the minds of all who heard him;", "3117": "and one of the three brothers answered, without hesitation, and told him plainly, that it was in vain, that trusting to his riches, he made such arrogant threats, since the poor even can obtain redress against the insolence of the wealthy, through the liberal protection of the laws.", "3118": "What oil is to flame, what sulphur is to a conflagration, what the whip is in the Fury's hand, such was the fuel afforded by these words to the furious disposition of this man.", "3119": "Roused to a perfect frenzy, and bidding them all, and their laws too, go and be hanged, he ordered the shepherds' dogs to be let loose, as well as those upon the farm, savage and blood-thirsty creatures, accustomed to prey upon the dead carcases that were thrown into the fields, and to bite and mangle the passing traveller.", "3120": "Accordingly, incited by the well-known hallooing of the shepherds, the dogs rushed upon the men, barking hor­ ribly, and tore the flesh off their bones.", "3121": "Nor even when the men fled did they spare them;", "3122": "but pursued them with so much the more ferocity.", "3123": "In this scene of havoc and slaughter of the confused mul­ titude, the youngest of the three brothers stumbled against a stone, and was thrown to the ground, where he was devoured by those ferocious dogs.", "3124": "The moment his brothers recog­ nized his dying shrieks, they ran to help him, and wrapping their cloaks around their left hands, used every effort to pro­ tect their brother, and to drive off the dogs, by volleys of stones.", "3125": "But they were unable to quell their ferocity;", "3126": "and the unfortunate youth was torn in pieces, and died, entreating with his breath, that they would avenge the death of their youngest brother on that most villanous purse-proud man.", "3127": "Then the two remaining surviving brothers, not, by Hercules, eomuch despairing of, as spontaneously disregarding their own safety, made an attack upon the rich man, and with furious impetuosity hurled a shower of stones against him.", "3128": "Then the blood-thirsty wretch, who, before this, had been trained by practice in many similar deeds of outrage, hurled a lance, and pierced one of the two brothers through the middle of the breast.", "3129": "And yet, though mortally wounded, the young man did not fall to the ground.", "3130": "For the lance, which had pierced him, and the greater part of which had come out at his back, was by the force of the blow fixed in the earth, and kept his body suspended by the firmness of the handle, as it stood quivering in the ground.", "3131": "In addition to this, one of the assassin's servants, a tall robust fellow, violently hurled a stone from a distance, and tried to hit the third brother on the right arm;", "3132": "but the stone, passing just by the tips of his fingers, and so expending its force in vain, fell to the ground without inflicting any injury, contrary to the expectation of all who were present.", "3133": "Now as the youth was endowed with singular presence of mind, this fortunate circumstance afforded him some hope of revenge.", "3134": "For, pretending that his hand was disabled, he thus addressed his most savage antagonist:", "3135": "\" Exult in the destruction of our whole family, glut your in­ satiable vengeance with the blood of three brothers, and com­ plete your glorious triumph over your prostrate fellow-citi­ zens ;", "3136": "only remember, that after you have deprived this poor man of his lands, extend and extend as you may, you will still always have some neighbour or other.", "3137": "But this right hand of mine, which should undoubtedly have struck off your head, hangs powerless, smitten by the iniquitous decree of fate.\"", "3138": "The furious cutthroat, exasperated by these words, seizing a sword, rushed eagerly on the wretched youth, with the inten­ tion of slaying him with his own hand.", "3139": "However, he had provoked one who was not inferior to himself.", "3140": "For the youth, quite contrary to his anticipation, seized hold of his right hand with a most powerful grasp;", "3141": "and then brandishing his sword, with repeated blows dismissed the impure soul of the rich man from his body ;", "3142": "and lastly, to free himself from the hands of the attendants who were running to give assistance, he cut his own throat with the sword that was still reeking with the blood of his enemy.", "3143": "END OF THE TWELFTH EPISODE.", "3144": "These were the events which the astounding prodigies had foreshown;", "3145": "and these were the events which were related to the most unfortunate master.", "3146": "The old man, overwhelmed by so many misfortunes, could not so much as utter a single word, or even shed a tear, but seizing the knife with which he had just before been helping his guests to cheese and other viands, he pierced his own throat with numerous gashes, thus following the example of his most unhappy son;", "3147": "so that falling with his face on the table, he washed away, with a river of flowing blood, the stains of that portentous gore which had before fallen upon it.", "3148": "The gardener, commiserating the fate of this house, which had thus come to destruction in the shortest space of time, and deploring his own mischance, made a return for his meal with his tears, and ever and anon clasping together his empty hands, immediately mounted on my back, and re­ turned the way we came.", "3149": "His return, however, was by no means free from accident.", "3150": "For a certain tall fellow, who was a soldier belonging to one of the legions,* as his dress and appearance seemed to indicate, met us on the road, and asked the gardener, in a haughty and insolent tone, whither he was leading that unladen ass ?", "3151": "My master, who was still full of grief, and was ignorant, besides, of the Latin language, passed on without making any reply.", "3152": "Upon this, the soldier could not control the insolence that was so natural to him;", "3153": "but considering his silence as a mark of contempt, thrust him from my back, at the same time striking him with a vine-stick,†which he carried in his hand.", "3154": "The gardener humbly declared that he did not understand what the soldier said, being ignorant of the language in which he spoke.", "3155": "The soldier, therefore, demanded in Greek, \" Whither are you leading that ass?\"", "3156": "The gardener replied, that he was going to the next town. \"", "3157": "But I am in want of it,\" said the soldier;", "3158": "\" it must help, with other beasts, to carry from the neigh­ bouring village the baggage of our commanding officer.\"", "3159": "With that, laying hold of the rope by which I was led along, he began to pull me away.", "3160": "The gardener, however, wiping away the blood that trickled down his face from the blow he had just received, again entreated the soldier to act more civilly and humanely, and supplicated him to do so, by all his hopes of future good fortune.", "3161": "\"This ass,\" said he, \" is very lazy, and then besides, he has that abominable complaint, the falling sickness;", "3162": "it is as much as he can do to carry a few bundles of vegetables from my garden close by;", "3163": "it quite blows him;", "3164": "so he is not a likely beast for the carriage of larger burdens.", "3165": "\"When, however, he found that the soldier could not be softened by entreaties, but was still more and more savagely bent on plundering him, and that now he had shifted his hold of the vine-stick, and was preparing to fracture his skull with the large knob at the end, he had recourse to his last chance.", "3166": "deigning that he would embrace the soldier, in order to excite his compassion, he bent down, and pulling both legs from under him, dashed him violently to the ground;", "3167": "then instantly throwing himself upon his sprawling antagonist, he bit him, and thumped him, and jobbed him all over, face, arms, and ribs, with his fists, his elbows, and with a stone which he picked up in the road.", "3168": "As for the sol­ dier, he could neither resist nor at all defend himself, from the very moment that he was laid prostrate on the ground;", "3169": "but could only threaten'from time to time that the moment he got up he would cut him to pieces with his sword.", "3170": "The gar­ dener, taking warning by this hint, snatched the sword from his side, and throwing it far away, again pummelled him harder than ever, so that the soldier, stretched on his back and disabled with wounds and bruises, had to counterfeit death, as the only means of saving his life.", "3171": "The gardener, then taking the sword away with him, mounted my back, and made off at my utmost speed straight towards the town ;", "3172": "and, not caring to visit his own garden, at all events for the present, he directed his steps towards the house of an intimate friend of his.", "3173": "After relating all the circumstances, he begged and entreated his friend to stand by him in his present dangerous position, and to conceal him and his ass there for a short time, so that by keeping out of the way two or three days, he might escape the penalty of the capital offence he had committed.", "3174": "This man, not being forgetful of their former friendship, he readily re­ ceived him, and having dragged me with my legs tied together up stairs into an attic, the gardener crept into a chest that was in the warehouse below, and covering himself with the lid, there lay concealed.", "3175": "Meanwhile the soldier, as I afterwards learned, like one recovering from a violent fit of intoxication, made his way to the town, staggering and tottering, sore with the pain of so many wounds, and with difficulty supporting himself on his stick.", "3176": "Ashamed to mention to any of the citizens the parti­ culars of his own violence and his ignominious defeat, he silently digested the affront he had received, until meeting at last with some of his fellow-soldiers, he told them of his mis­ fortune.", "3177": "They were of opinion, that he should conceal him­ self for some time in the barracks;", "3178": "(for, besides the disgrace to himself, he feared also the military oath sworn by the Genius,* on account of the loss of his sword), while they, noting down the description he gave of us, would make the most zealous endeavours for our discovery, and the gratification of their own vengeance.", "3179": "Nor was a perfidious neighbour want­ ing to tell them very speedily where we were concealed.", "3180": "Thereupon, the soldier's comrades applied to the magis­ trates, and falsely assorted that they had lost on the road a silver cup of considerable value, that belonged to their com­ manding officer, and that a certain gardener had found it, and would not give it up, but was now lying concealed in the house of a friend.", "3181": "The magistrates, on being made acquainted with the loss, and the name of the commanding officer, came to the door of our dwelling, and with a loud voice, gave notice to our host that it would be better for him to deliver us up, whowere beyond a doubt concealed in his premises, than to render himself liable to capital punishment.", "3182": "But our friend, not being in the least daunted, and resolute to save the guest he had taken under his protection, declared that he knew no­ thing about us, and that he had not seen that gardener for several days.", "3183": "On the other hand, the soldiers, swearing by the Genius of the emperor, maintained that he was concealed there, and nowhere else.", "3184": "At length the magistrates were determined, by making a strict search, to confute him in this his obstinate denial.", "3185": "Ac­ cordingly, sending the lictors and other public officers into the Bouse, they ordered them carefully to search every hole and corner.", "3186": "But, after all their search, the officers reported that no human being, nor yet any ass, was to be found within the threshold.", "3187": "The dispute now grew very warm on both sides;", "3188": "the soldiers swore by Cæsar that they knew for certain we were there, while the master of the house swore as stoutly by all the gods in denial of the assertion.", "3189": "On hearing this conten­ tion and clamour, I, who was in general an ass of an inqui­ sitive and restless disposition, stretched my neck out of a little window, and tried to see what all the noise was about;", "3190": "but one of the soldiers, by chance turning his eyes in the direction of my shadow, instantly called out to all of them to observe it;", "3191": "whereupon they instantly raised a loud shout, and rushing up the steps, some of them seized hold of me, and led me prisoner from my place of concealment.", "3192": "And now, without more de­ lay, they narrowly examined every corner, and opening the chest, they found the wretched gardener, dragged him out, and carried him before the magistrates, and finally to the public gaol, in order that he might suffer capital punishment.", "3193": "Nor -could they ever have done joking and laughing at the notion of my looking out of the window.", "3194": "From this circumstance, also, the well-known proverb originated, about the peeping ass and his shadow.", "3195": "*WHAT became of my master, the gardener, on the following day, I know not.", "3196": "But the soldier, who had been so hand­ somely thrashed for his overbearing conduct, untied me from my manger and took me away, there being no one to hinder him.", "3197": "Then going to his barracks, as it appeared to me, he led me into the public road, laden with his baggage, and equipped quite in military style.", "3198": "For he put on my back a glittering helmet, of remarkable brightness, a shield still more splendid, and a long gleaming lance.", "3199": "The latter he took care to place conspicuously on the top of the pole, which he had arranged in the form of a trophy, not so much in compliance with the regu­ lations, as for the purpose of terrifying unfortunate travellers.", "3200": "Having passed over a level country by an easy road, we came to a little town, but we did not put up at an inn, but at the house of a certain decurion.", "3201": "After having delivered me to the care of a servant, the soldier repaired without delay to the presence of his officer, who had the command of a thousand men.", "3202": "I remember that a few days after our arrival, a most wicked and dreadful crime was perpetrated in that town.", "3203": "I will re­ cord it in my book, that you also may read it.", "3204": "THE master of the house had a son, a young man of great literary attainments, and consequently remarkable for his piety and modesty;", "3205": "so that any one would have wished to have just such a son.", "3206": "The mother of this young man having been dead many years, his father contracted a second marriage, and his second wife had borne him another son, who had now just passed his twelfth year.", "3207": "But the stepmother, who held supreme sway in her husband's house, rather in consequence of her good looks than her good morals, regarded her stepson with lustful eyes, whether it was that she was naturally vici­ ous, or was impelled by Fate to such extreme criminality.", "3208": "Know, therefore, excellent reader, that you are about to peruse a tragic, and not a comic tale, and that you will have to ascend from the sock* to the buskin.", "3209": "Now as long as the little Cupid was in its infancy, this woman easily repressed her rising blushes, and concealed them in silence.", "3210": "But when love, raging without control, wrapped her whole soul in flame, she then succumbed to the cruel God;", "3211": "and, feigning illness, concealed the disease of the mind under the pretence of bodily ailment.", "3212": "Now every one knows that all the morbid changes in the bodily condition and appearance are quite alike in those who are sick and those who are in love;", "3213": "such, for instance, as an unsightly paleness, languor of the eyes, restless sleep, and sighs the more deep from the slowness of the torment.", "3214": "You might have supposed that she was only afflicted by fitful attacks of fever, had it not been that she wept.", "3215": "Alas!", "3216": "for the unskilful impressions of her doctors!", "3217": "what meant the hurried pulse, the sudden flush, the oppressed respiration, the frequent tossings and turnings from side to side.", "3218": "Good Gods!", "3219": "how easy is it even for one who is no doctor, but is acquainted with the symptoms of love and passion, to comprehend the true nature of the case, when he sees a person burning without bodily heat ?", "3220": "Unable any longer to control her raging passion, she at length broke her long silence, and sent for her son to be called to her, a name she wished he had never borne or might bear no more, that she might not, by using it, be reminded of her shame.", "3221": "The young man obeyed without delay the command of his love-sick parent, and with a forehead wrinkled with sorrow, like that of an old man, he went into the chamber of her who was the wife of his father and the mother of his brother, pay­ ing that obedience to her which, to a certain degree, was her due.", "3222": "As for her, fast aground, as it were, upon the shoals of doubt, and long unable to break a silence that tortured her, she again rejects every word which she had at first conceived to be most adapted to the present interview, and even still in a state of indecision, through shame, she cannot tell how to begin.", "3223": "The young man, however, suspecting nothing wrong, with a down­ cast countenance, spontaneously asked her what was the cause of her present malady.", "3224": "Upon this, availing herself of the per­ nicious opportunity afforded her, she took courage to falter out these few words, while she wept profusely, and hid her face with her garment:", "3225": "\"You yourself are the sole cause and origin of my malady, and you are the remedy too, and the only chance of life now left me.", "3226": "For those eyes of yours, penetrating through my own into the inmost core of my heart, have kindled there a most vehement fire.", "3227": "Take pity, therefore, on me, who am perish­ ing for your sake;", "3228": "and let no scruples on your father's ac­ count have the least weight with you, for, by complying with my wishes, you will preserve for him a wife, who is otherwise doomed to die.", "3229": "It is with reason that I love you, since in your face I recognize his features.", "3230": "We are alone;", "3231": "you have nothing to fear;", "3232": "you have full opportunity for this act, so ne­ cessary to my existence-a thing that no one knows.", "3233": "\"The young man being in utter confusion at this unexpected misfortune, although he recoiled from the mere thought of such an abominable deed, yet did not think it right to exasperate her by too abrupt a refusal of a denial, but rather that he ought to appease her by a delusive promise.", "3234": "He promised, therefore, without reserve, and earnestly persuaded her to keep up her spirits, restore her strength by nutriment, and pay attention to her health, till his father should go on some journey or other, and leave them free to enjoy their pleasures.", "3235": "He then with­ drew from the baneful presence of his stepmother, and con­ ceiving likewise that this calamity with which his house was threatened called for the deepest consideration, he immediately related the affair to an aged mail of well-tried prudence, who had been his tutor.", "3236": "After long deliberation, nothing seemed to be so advisable as to escape this storm, let loose by adverse fortune, by instant flight.", "3237": "The woman, however, impatient at even the smallest delay, invented some pretext or other, and found means cunningly to persuade her husband to take a journey, with all speed, to some small farms of his, which were situate at a very con­ siderable distance.", "3238": "This being done, in a state of frantic eager­ ness for the fulfilment of her hopes, she solicited her stepson to perform his promise.", "3239": "The young man, however, now pre­ tending this thing, now that, as an excuse, avoids her execrable presence, till at last, clearly perceiving, from the varying na­ ture of his messages, that he refused to fulfil his promise, her nefarious love became suddenly changed into hatred far more intense.", "3240": "Immediately summoning a most villanous slave of hers, who had formed a portion of the dowry she brought her husband, and who was ready for the perpetration of any crime, she communicated to him her perfidious designs, and there was no course that seemed to them preferable to de­ priving the unfortunate youth of life.", "3241": "Accordingly, this vil­ lain was sent immediately to buy a poison of the most deadly quality, and, having carefully mixed it in wine, she prepared it for the destruction of her guiltless son-in-law.", "3242": "As it so happened, while the wicked pair were deliberating about a suitable opportunity for giving him the poison, the younger boy, this most abandoned woman's own son, returning home after his morning studies, and feeling thirsty from his breakfast, found the cup of wine which contained the poison,.", "3243": "and swallowed at a draught the contents;", "3244": "but no sooner had he drunk the deadly potion which had been prepared for his bro­ ther, than he fell lifeless on the ground.", "3245": "His tutor, horrified at his sudden death, alarmed the mother and the whole family with his cries.", "3246": "And now, when the cause was ascertained to have been the noxious draught, opinions varied as to who were the authors of the crime.", "3247": "But this wicked woman, a singular specimen of a stepmother's malice, not at all moved by the shocking death of her son, nor by the consciousness of having murdered him, nor by the misfortune of her house, nor by the grief her husband would feel for the loss of his son, seized upon the destruction of her own offspring as a ready means of vengeance.", "3248": "She immediately sent a messenger to inform her husband, who was on his journey, of the calamity which had befallen his house;", "3249": "and when he returned home with all pos­ sible haste, she, with enormous effrontery, pretended that her son had been destroyed by poison, administered to him by her stepson.", "3250": "And in this she did not altogether speak falsely, because the boy really had met with the death which had been intended for the young man.", "3251": "She, however, pretended that the younger brother had been put an end to through the wicked­ ness of her stepson, because she would not comply with the licentious proposals the latter had made to her.", "3252": "Nor was she contented with lies of such enormity, but even added, that he had likewise threatened her with a sword, in consequence of her detection of his wickedness.", "3253": "Grievously was the unhappy man afflicted at the death of both his sons;", "3254": "for he saw his younger son buried before his face, and he knew that his other son would certainly be con­ demned to death for incest and fratricide;", "3255": "and then, besides, he was impelled to extreme hatred of this son by the feigned lamentations of a wife whom he held too dear.", "3256": "No sooner, therefore, had the funeral rites of the unfortunate boy been arranged, than the unhappy old man hastened straight from the pile to the forum, with the tears still wet upon his cheeks, and tearing his white hairs, begrimed with ashes ;", "3257": "and there, giving loose to his passionate feelings, he used every endeavour to- procure the destruction of his remaining son, by tears and by.", "3258": "entreaties, even embracing the very knees of the decu­ rions;", "3259": "and never imagining the treachery of his most infam­ ous wife, he exclaimed that his son was an incestuous wretch, who had attempted to violate his father's bed;", "3260": "that he was a fratricide, and had threatened to kill his stepmother.", "3261": "In fine, by his lamentations, he aroused not only the senate but the people, to such a degree of pity and indignation, that, impatient of the tedious formality of a judicial process, and waiving in- contep.", "3262": "table proofs in support of the accusation, and the studied subterfuges of pleaders, they shouted out with one consent, that a public crime ought to be punished by the public, and that the author of it ought to be stoned to death.", "3263": "In the meantime, the magistrates, apprehensive, on their own account, lest the growing excitement should lead to results destructive of all order and of the civic weal, began, partly by expostulating with the decurions, and partly by soothing the feelings of the public, to induce them that the trial might proceed in due order, and in conformity with the customs of their ancestors, the allegations on both sides being duly weighed, and the sen­ tence pronounced in a legal manner.", "3264": "They added, that no one ought to be condemned without a hearing, after the manner of fierce barbarians or lawless tyrants, since, by so doing, they would leave, in those times of profound peace, a dreadful pre­ cedent for posterity.", "3265": "This sound advice prevailed;", "3266": "and immediately the crier proclaimed aloud that the senators were to assemble in the senate-house.", "3267": "These having immediately taken their accus­ tomed places, according to their rank and dignity, the crier again made proclamation aloud, and the accuser first came forward;", "3268": "then the prisoner was called and brought into court, and, lastly, the crier, in conformity with the law of Athens and the process of the Areopagus, announced to the advocates on both sides that they were to plead without pre­ amble, and to avoid all appeals for the purpose of exciting com­ miseration.", "3269": "That this was the manner of proceeding I learned from overhearing the remarks of many people, as they were talking with one another.", "3270": "But as I was not present at the trial, but tied up to a manger, I shall only commit here to writing what I ascertained to be exactly the truth.", "3271": "As soon as the harangues of the orators were concluded, the senators determined that the truth of the charges should be established by certain proofs, and that a question of such great consequence should not be left to suspicion and conjecture.", "3272": "They, likewise, thought it requisite that the servant, who was said to be the only person who knew the facts of the case, should be brought forward.", "3273": "Nor was that candidate for the gallows in the least dismayed, either by the doubtful result of so serious an investigation, or by the view of the thronged senate house, or even by his own guilty conscience, but began to state and affirm as true a number of things which he him­ self had invented.", "3274": "He said, that the young man, being indig­ nant at the repulse received from his step-mother, had sum­ moned him;", "3275": "that, in order to avenge the affront, he had or­ dered him to destroy her son;", "3276": "that he had promised him a great reward to ensure his secrecy ;", "3277": "that on his refusal to do what he wished, he had threatened to put him to death ;", "3278": "that he had delivered to him the poison mixed with his own hand, to be given to his brother;", "3279": "and that the young man, suspecting he had forborne to administer the potion, and had reserved it, to produce as evidence of the crime, at last gave it to the boy with his own hand.", "3280": "\"When this villanous knave had, with an affected agitation, uttered these egregious lies, which bore a most plausible re­ semblance to truth, the trial was brought to a conclusion, and not one was there among the senators so favourably disposed towards the young man, as not to pronounce him clearly guilty, and condemn him to be sewed up in the leathern sack.", "3281": "The verdicts, in which they all agreed, were about to be com­ mitted to writing, according to custom, and to be placed in the brazen urn;", "3282": "after which, the die being cast, no change could lawfully be made, but the life of the criminal was placed in the hands of the executioner.", "3283": "Just then, an aged physician, a member of the senate, and a person of approved integrity, and of remarkable influence, covering with his hand the mouth of the urn, that no one might rashly put his billet into it, thus addressed the court:", "3284": "“I rejoice that, long as I have lived, I have ever enjoyed your approbation;", "3285": "and I will not suffer a manifest act of homi­ cide to be perpetrated, by condemning a man to death on a false accusation;", "3286": "nor you to violate your oath, as judges, for the lying testimony of a slave.", "3287": "I myself will not cheat my own conscience, and trample on the reverence which is due to the gods, by pronouncing an unjust sentence.", "3288": "Learn, there­ fore, from me, the real circumstances of the case.", "3289": "This vil­ lanous fellow came to me some time ago, and offered me a hundred golden solidi for a prompt and deadly poison, telling me he wanted it for a person who, being grievously afflicted with an incurable disease, wished to rid himself from the tor­ ment of life.", "3290": "Noticing the confusion and incoherence of the rascal's story, and feeling sure that he was about to perpetrate some crime, I certainly gave him the potion, but as a precaution, in case the affair should be looked into at some future time, I did not immediately take the money that was agreed upon, but said to him, ' Lest by chance any of these golden coins which you offer me should be found to be light or spurious, put them in this bag, and seal it with your own seal, till they are to-morrow examined in the presence of a money-changer.'", "3291": "lIe complied, and sealed up the money;", "3292": "as soon, therefore, as he was brought into court to give evidence, I ordered one of my servants to go with all haste and fetch the bag from my shop, and here I now produce it before you.", "3293": "Let him look at it, and examine the impression of his own seal.", "3294": "Now how can the brother be accused of having procured the poison which this fellow bought ?", "3295": "\"On the instant, a violent fit of trembling seized the villain;", "3296": "his natural hue gave place to a deadly paleness;", "3297": "and a cold perspiration suffused all his limbs.", "3298": "He began to shift about his feet with irregular movements;", "3299": "to scratch now this, now that side of his head;", "3300": "and, with his mouth half open, stam­ mering and stuttering, to utter I know not what silly nonsense, insomuch that not a single person could reasonably suppose him to be innocent of the crime.", "3301": "Recovering, however, his craftiness once again, he unceasingly denied the charge, and accused the physician of lying.", "3302": "On this, the physician, inde­ pendently of his being bound by oath to give a just judgment, when he saw that his honour was openly impeached, made redoubled efforts to confute this villain;", "3303": "till at last the public officers, by order of the magistrates, seizing the slave's hand, found the iron ring, and compared it with the impression on the bag.", "3304": "As the result corroborated the suspicion previously entertained, the rack and the wooden horse were put in opera­ tion, according to the Greek custom.", "3305": "Being upheld, however, by a wonderful amount of boldness, he was proof against all blows, and even fire itself.", "3306": "At last, the physician exclaimed, \" I will not suffer, by Hercules !", "3307": "I will not suffer, either that this innocent young man shall receive a punishment at your hands contrary to jus­ tice, or that this fellow shall stultify our judgment and escape the punishment due to his crimes.", "3308": "I will give you an evident proof on this matter under consideration.", "3309": "When this most abandoned man was anxious to obtain the deadly poison, I was of opinion that it ill accorded with my art to furnish any one with the means of producing death, being sensible that medi­ cine was sought not for the destruction, but for the preservation of mankind;", "3310": "yet I feared that if I should refuse to give it him, I should thereby prompt him to another method of perpetrating the crime, and that he would accomplish the criminal purpose upon which he had resolved, either by buying a deadly potion from some other person, or, at all events, by the sword, or some such weapon ;", "3311": "fearing this, I gave him indeed a drug, but it was a preparation of the soporiferous plant called mandrake, remarkable for the torpor which it is known to occasion, and which produces a sleep exactly resembling death.", "3312": "Nor is it to be wondered at, that this most desperate knave, being cer­ tain of undergoing, if convicted, the utmost penalty that can be inflicted on him, conformably to the customs of our ances­ tors, should be ready to endure these tortures, as being lighter evils.", "3313": "But if the boy has really taken the potion which was mixed by my hands, he is still alive, in a torpid state, and asleep :", "3314": "and immediately his drowsy slumbers are shaken off, he will return to the light of day.", "3315": "But if he is really dead, you may look for some other way of accounting for his de­ cease.", "3316": "\"The old man having addressed them to this effect, they as­ sented to what he said;", "3317": "and immediately proceeded in great haste to the pile on which the body of the boy was laid.", "3318": "Not a member was there of the senate, nor a person of the first rank, who did not run thither, impelled by curiosity.", "3319": "And behold, the father himself, having with his own hands removed the lid of the coffin, found his son rising that moment from the dead, the deathlike sleep shaken off;", "3320": "and most ardently embracing him, and unable in words to express his present joy, he led him forth into the presence of the people, and the boy was brought into court, just as he was, swathed and bound in the grave-clothes.", "3321": "And now the naked truth was obvious to every one, the wickedness of the nefarious slave, and of the still more aban­ doned woman, being clearly exposed.", "3322": "Accordingly, the step- mother was condemned to perpetual banishment, the slave was crucified;", "3323": "and by the consent of all, the golden solidi were presented to the worthy physician, as a reward for the trance he had produced with such happy results.", "3324": "Thus did the sin­ gular and romantic fortune of the old decurion come to a termination worthy of Divine providence;", "3325": "since, in a passing moment, indeed an instant of time, he suddenly became the father of two young men.", "3326": "after he had been in danger of losing both.", "3327": "END OF THE THIRTEENTH EPISODE.", "3328": "As for myself, you shall hear what changes of fortune I experienced at that time.", "3329": "The soldier who had made me his own without paying for me, being about to carry letters to the great prince at Rome, in obedience to the commands of his tribune, sold me for eleven denars to two brothers, servants of a very wealthy personage in the neighbourhood.", "3330": "One of them was a confectioner, who made bread and sweetmeats;", "3331": "the other was a cook, and dressed rich stews seasoned with the relishing juices of pounded herbs and aromatics.", "3332": "These two, dwelling together and living in common, bought me for the purpose of carrying the numerous vessels which were required for their master's use, when he was tra­ velling through different countries.", "3333": "I was admitted, there­ fore, as a third companion with these two brothers;", "3334": "and never, at any time, during my transformation, did I experience a fortune so marked with good luck.", "3335": "For, in the evening, after the supper, which was always on a magnificent scale, my masters were in the habit of bringing home to their little room numerous fragments that were left;", "3336": "the one brought ample remains of roast pig, chickens, fish, and delicate dishes of that kind;", "3337": "while the other brought bread, pastry, sugar­ plums, hook cakes, lizard cakes, and many kinds of honied sweetmeats.", "3338": "Accordingly, after they had fastened the door of their chamber, and had gone to the baths for the pur­ pose of refreshing themselves, I used to cram myself with the dainties that fell in my way through the favour of the Gods.", "3339": "For I was not so much a fool, nor so truly an ass, as to neglect this most delicious fare, and feed upon coarse hay.", "3340": "My thie­ vish manoeuvres for a long time succeeded most beautifully, because, as yet, I pilfered cautiously and sparingly, only a few articles out of a great number, and they had no suspicion of such tricks being played by an ass.", "3341": "But when, becoming still more fearless of detection, I devoured all the nicest bits, and, rejecting all that was stale, began to lick up the more choice morsels, the brothers were not a little surprized and per­ plexed.", "3342": "And though even then they did not believe such a thing of me, still they made diligent enquiry as to who was the author of their daily losses.", "3343": "At length, indeed, they even went so far as to accuse each other of this most base act of theft;", "3344": "and they began to keep sharper watch, and to count all they put by.", "3345": "At length, throwing off all hesitation and reserve, one of them thus addressed the other:", "3346": "\"Why, really now, this is neither fair nor like a man, for you every day to be diminish­ ing what has been put by, and to be purloining the choicest parts, and then to go and sell them, so as silly to increase your own stock, and then cry halves of the remainder.", "3347": "If, in fact, you are tired of our partnership, we may still live as brothers in all other respects, and yet give up this partnership concern of ours.", "3348": "For I see that when dissatisfaction at the loss has in­ creased to a very considerable extent, it will create very great discord between us.", "3349": "\"To this the other rejoined, “I do, by Hercules!", "3350": "admire this effrontery of yours, after you have secretly been pilfering the articles, to forestall my complaints, which, in silence and sorrow, I have kept to myself, being determined to put up with it as long as ever I could, rather than accuse my biothei of shabby theft.", "3351": "But it is well, that having spoken upon the matter on both sides, we are put upon seeking a remedy for our loss, lest our misunderstanding, gathering strength by si­ lence, should produce between us a strife like that of Eteocles and his brother.", "3352": "\"Bandying these and similar reproaches against one another, they both of them solemnly declared that they had been guilty of no fraud whatever, nor of the slightest purloining;", "3353": "but agreed, that they ought by every possible contrivance try to discover the thief who was the author of their common loss.", "3354": "It was not possible, they said, that the ass, which was the only being there, could take a fancy to such kind of food:", "3355": "and still, every day the choicest portions were nowhere to be found ;", "3356": "and certainly no flies found their way into their room, that were as large as were the harpies of old, who robbed Phineas of his dainties.", "3357": "In the meantime, I, being bountifully crammed with dainty morsels, and well stuffed with human food, found my body plumped up, my hide softened with rich juices, and my coat grown sleek and shining.", "3358": "But that same comeliness was the cause of a great shock to my feelings.", "3359": "For being roused to suspicion by the uncommon breadth of my back, and perceiv­ ing that my hay remained every day quite untouched, they now directed all their attention to me.", "3360": "Accordingly, having shut the door at the accustomed hour as usual, as though they were going to the bath, they peeped at me through a little crevice, as I was intent upon eating the fragments which were exposed in various directions.", "3361": "And now, forgetting all con­ sideration for their loss, they burst into a violent fit of laughter at the monstrous epicurism of an ass ;", "3362": "and then calling toge­ ther a number of their fellow-servants, they pointed out to them the incredible appetite of an animal like me.", "3363": "Then laughter so loud and so continued seized them all, that the master, who happened to be passing by, asked what fun was going on to make his servants laugh so excessively.", "3364": "Being told what it was, he came himself and peeped through the same cranny.", "3365": "Then he too laughed until his stomach ached, and opening the door of the room, he came nearer to me, and observed me very attentively.", "3366": "But as for me, seeing that for­ tune was inclined to smile more propitiously upon me, I went on eating quite at my ease, the merriment of those present in­ spiring me with additional confidence;", "3367": "till at last the master of the house, enchanted by the novelty of the sight, ordered me to be led to the supper-room;", "3368": "or rather he led me to it with his own hands;", "3369": "and the table being laid, he directed every kind of substantial food to be placed before me, and dishes that had not been tasted.", "3370": "Now, though I was well stuffed already, yet desiring to render myself more agreeable, and more pleasing to 'him, I ate of the food placed before me as if I had been quite hungry.", "3371": "But they, prompted by extreme curiosity, thinking of every thing which an ass would be most likely to loathe, offered it to me, for the purpose of testing my politeness;", "3372": "such as meat seasoned with assafœtida, fowls sprinkled over with pepper, and fish soused in foreign pickle.", "3373": "In the meantime, the banquet room resounded with roars of laughter.", "3374": "At last, a bit of a buffoon who was present, said, \" Give a little wine to our comrade.\" \" Well said, rogue,\" cried the master ;", "3375": "“I dare say our friend would have no objection to a cup of honied wine.\" \" Here, lad,\" said he, “ wash well that golden cup, fill it with honied wine, and offer it to my guest;", "3376": "and at the same time, tell him that I have drunk his good health.\"", "3377": "All the guests now awaited the result in a state of intense curiosity;", "3378": "the huge cup was handed to me, and wither more ado, I emptied it at a single draught quite deliberately, and with a very jovial air, screwing up the extremities of my lips, in resemblance of a tongue.", "3379": "Then a shout of applause arose, and all, with one accord, drank my health.", "3380": "In the end, the master, being excessively pleased, after calling the servants who had bought me, ordered that four times the price they had paid for me should be given to them;", "3381": "thereupon he delivered me into the charge of a certain person, a freedman of his, to whom he was much attached, and who was very well off, and desired him to take all possible care of me.", "3382": "This person treated me in a very humane and kind manner;", "3383": "and that he might still more deserve the esteem of his patron, most studiously consulted his amusement by teaching me clever tricks.", "3384": "In the first place, he taught me to recline at table, leaning on my elbow;", "3385": "next, to wrestle and to dance even, raising my fore feet;", "3386": "and-a thing that won especial admiration-to use signs instead of words, so as to indicate what I disapproved of by throwing back, and what I approved of by bowing my head.", "3387": "He also taught me, when I was thirsty, to look towards the cup-bearer, and by winking first one eyelid then another, to show that I wanted something to drink.", "3388": "In all these matters I showed myself very ready and obedient;", "3389": "as I could have done them all, though no one had shown me how.", "3390": "But I was afraid, lest, if I should happen to perform them, in imitation of human beings, without the aid of a master, most people would think that it portended sinister events, and that I, as a monster and prodigy, might have to part with my head, and be given as fat provender to the vultures.", "3391": "And now my renown was spread abroad in all directions, so that I rendered my master quite famous and illustrious, in con­ sequence of my wonderful accomplishments.", "3392": "“This,\" said the people, \" is the man who has an ass for his guest and com­ panion ;", "3393": "an ass that wrestles, an ass that dances, and under­ stands the language of men, and expresses what he means by signs.\"", "3394": "It is proper, however, that I should now, at all events, inform you, though I ought to have done so in the be­ ginning, who this Thyasus was, and whence he came;", "3395": "for such was the name of my master.", "3396": "The country which gave him birth was Corinth, a city which ranks as the chief of all the province of Achaia.", "3397": "And, as he had gradually attained all the honours which his pedigree and dignity demanded, he had now been nominated to the office of quinquennial magis­ trate.", "3398": "Accordingly, in order that he might act conformably to the splendour of that office, he had promised to exhibit a show of gladiators for the space of three days;", "3399": "thus extending his liberality to the greatest possible degree.", "3400": "In fact, it was his desire of receiving the public applause that had now brought him to Thessaly, in order to procure from thence the most noble wild beasts and some celebrated gladiators.", "3401": "And now, having made all his arrangements and completed all his purchases quite to his satisfaction, he was preparing to return home.", "3402": "Disdaining, however, his own splendid chariots, which, some covered and some open, were drawn along in the .", "3403": "rear of the cavalcade;", "3404": "regardless also of his Thessalian horses, and his other beasts of Gallic breed, whose generous pedigree bore testimony to their rarity and value;", "3405": "despising and neglect­ ing all these, he rode most lovingly on me, who was decked out with golden trappings, a coloured saddle, purple cloths, a silver bit, an embroidered girth, and some little bells that tinkled as I went along, and sometimes he addressed me in the kindest of words.", "3406": "Among-many other expressions too which he made use of, he declared how extremely delighted he was at pos­ sessing in me, at one and the same time, a companion and a bearer.", "3407": "And now, having finished our journey, partly by land and partly by sea, we arrived at Corinth, where vast numbers of the citizens came out to meet us, not so much as it seemed to me for the purpose of doing honour to Thyasus, as from a desire of seeing me.", "3408": "For so great a rumour had pervaded that city about me, that I was a source of no small emolument to my keeper.", "3409": "For perceiving that many were eagerly desirous to see my pastimes, he had the doors shut, and admitted them one by one, charging each a good price for admission.", "3410": "By this means he managed every day to pick up no small sums.", "3411": "Among the number of spectators, there was a lady of rank and fortune, who having purchased a sight of me, was quite enchanted with my manifold tricks, and at last conceived a wonderful desire of being more intimate with me.", "3412": "In short, her passion grew to such a height, that, like an asinine Pasi- phäe, she prevailed on my keeper, for a considerable sum of money, to let her have my company for a single night:", "3413": "and the good-for-nothing fellow consented, regardless of all con.", "3414": "siderations save only his own gain.", "3415": "And now, the laborious and wakeful night being finished, the woman, to avoid being seen, withdrew from my embraces before day-light, at the same time making a contract with my keeper for some future night, at the same price.", "3416": "He was willing enough to gratify her, partly for the large sum he re­ ceived from her, and partly for the opportunity afforded him of displaying such a novel spectacle to his lord;", "3417": "to whom, without delay, he unfolded the whole scene of our lust.", "3418": "There­ upon Thyasus, having liberally rewarded his freed man, des­ tined me to be shown in public.", "3419": "And, because that egregious wife of mine could not be publicly connected with me, being a person of quality, nor any other volunteer could be found for the same purpose, a certain vile woman, who had been sen­ tenced by the prefect to be devoured by wild beasts, was pro­ cured, for a great sum of money, to have connexion with me in the theatre, in the sight of all the spectators.", "3420": "Of this wo­ man I have heard the following history:", "3421": "-SiE had a husband, whose father, when setting out on a journey, had given directions to his wife, the young man's mother, whom he left in a state of pregnancy, that if she brought forth an infant of the weaker sex, she should imme­ diately have it put to death.", "3422": "Now she, having brought forth a girl during her husband's absence, and being moved by the natural affection of a mother, disobeyed the commands of her husband, and delivered it to her neighbours to be brought up.", "3423": "On her husband's return, she informed him that she had been delivered of a daughter, who had been destroyed.", "3424": "When now the bloom of age called for the maiden's nuptial day, as she could not give her daughter a portion suitable to her parentage, without the knowledge of her husband, the only way she could do was to disclose the secret to her son.", "3425": "Besides, she was very much afraid lest he, by some accident, might in the ardour of youth inadvertently make some attempt on the chas­ tity of his sister, who was also ignorant that he was her bro­ ther.", "3426": "The young man, who was remarkable for his' affectionate disposition, religiously obeyed the commands of his mother, behaved like a good brother, and kept the family secret so well, that to all appearance he entertained for his sister only an ordinary degree of good will.", "3427": "But he undertook to perform a brother's duties by receiving her into his own house, as if she had been some orphan girl of the neighbourhood, who had been deprived of the guardian care of her parents;", "3428": "and he proposed to marry her, ere long, to a most dear companion of his, with whom he was united by the closest ties of friend­ ship, and to bestow on her most liberally a dowry at his own expense.", "3429": "But these excellent and innocent arrangements could not escape the deadly malevolence of Fortune, who caused a dire jealousy to spring up in the young man's house, and drove the wife to those crimes for which she was now condemned to be thrown to the wild beasts.", "3430": "She began by suspecting the girl to be a rival, who supplanted her in her husband's affections ;", "3431": "then she hated her, and finally she resolved to put her to death in the most inhuman manner.", "3432": "Accordingly, she had recourse to the following 'wicked stratagem :", "3433": "having stolen her husband's ring, she went to a farm of theirs in the country, and from there sent a servant, who, though faithful to her, was an utter villain, and told him to inform the girl that the young man had come to the farm and desired to see her, adding, that she was to come alone, with all possible speed.", "3434": "And, lest any doubt might happen to arise in her mind about the propriety of coming, she delivered to him the ring which she had stolen from her hus­ band, to show as a token that his message was authentic.", "3435": "On this, in compliance with the injunctions of her brother, for she was the only one who knew that he was her brother, and having also taken notice of his seal, which was shown to her, she promptly did as she was desired.", "3436": "As soon, however, as, through this most base stratagem, she had fallen into the snares which were prepared for her, the wicked wife, goaded to mad- ness by her jealous fury, stripped the girl naked, and had her dogged until she was nearly dead.", "3437": "It was in vain that the poor girl confessed the truth, which was wrung from her by the lash, and declared that she was wrongfully accused;", "3438": "in vain she cried out again and again that the young man was her brother.", "3439": "Her sister-in-law treated her story as a false­ hood, and thrusting a burning brand between her thighs, made her suffer a hideous death.", "3440": "Immediately upon this, her brother and her husband being informed of her cruel death, hastened to her, and in sore afflic­ tion committed her to the tomb.", "3441": "Nor was the young man able patiently to endure the miserable fate of his sister, by the hands of her, too, by whom, least of all, it ought to have been occasioned;", "3442": "but, being racked with grief and choler, he fell into a burning fever, so that he seemed in urgent need of me­ dical aid.", "3443": "On this his wife, who had long since forfeited her claim to that title, went to a certain physician, notorious for his perfidy, who, being famous for his victories in many a mortal struggle, could enumerate the mighty trophies which his right hand had gained.", "3444": "To him she immediately offered fifty thousand sesterces, if he would sell her poison so efficacious as to destroy in an instant, that so she might purchase the death of her husband.", "3445": "This done, she and the physician pretended that the most excellent potion which they had brought, and which the learned call sacred, was necessary for mitigating pains of the viscera, and carrying off the bile;", "3446": "but, in its stead, was sub­ stituted another potion, sacred to the interests of Proserpine.*", "3447": "And now, in the presence of the sick man's household, and some of his relations and friends, the physician, with his own hand, after having well stirred the contents, offered the cup.", "3448": "But that audacious woman, in order that she might at the same moment remove the accomplice in her crime, and save the money which she had promised, held back the cup in the presence of them all, and said, \"Most worthy of doctors, you must not give this draught to my dearest husband till you have swallowed a good portion of it yourself.", "3449": "For how am I to know but that there may be some deadly poison in it ?", "3450": "And this ought by no means to offend you, who are a man so pru­ dent and so learned, if I, as an affectionate wife, am anxious for the safety of my husband, and so perform a necessary act of duty.\"", "3451": "The physician, quite confounded by the desperate assurance of the bloodthirsty woman, and having no time to think of any subterfuge, could not help drinking largely of the potion, lest he should excite suspicion of his guilt if he showed any hesitation or fear.", "3452": "Then the young man, confidently fol­ lowing his example, took the cup from his hand, and drank what was left.", "3453": "The matter being for the present finished, the physician was preparing to return home as quickly as possible, in order that he might counteract the deadly effects of the poison he had taken, by a timely antidote.", "3454": "But the barbarous woman, bent on completing her infernal work, would not suffer him to de­ part from her a hair's breadth till, as she said, the potion should have been digested and its effect determined by actual proof.", "3455": "However, after much importunate entreaty, she at length reluctantly allowed him to go.", "3456": "In the meantime, the virulence of the fatal poison had spread through all his inside, and made havoc in his vitals.", "3457": "Stupified, and in excruciating pain, it was with the utmost difficulty he reached home, where he had barely time to relate what had happened, and give in­ junctions to his wife, at all events, to demand the promised re­ ward for thus ensuring the death of two persons.", "3458": "Thus cut off .", "3459": "by a violent death, did this very celebrated doctor breathe his last.", "3460": "Nor did the young man live much longer, but perished by the same kind of death, amid the feigned tears of his false wife.", "3461": "After he had been committed to the tomb, and a few days had intervened, during which funeral obsequies were per­ formed for the dead, the widow of the physician came and demanded the money which was due for the double homicide.", "3462": "But the other widow, always consistent with herself, put on a very unreal appearance of good faith, and replied with great suavity, assuring the applicant that she would promptly pay ner the stipulated sum, only she wished she would give her a little of the same mixture, for the purpose of completing the business she had begun.", "3463": "Completely duped by her insidious perfidy, the doctor's widow readily consented to do as she was requested;", "3464": "and that she might ingratiate herself the more with this wealthy wo­ man, she hastened home, and immediately brought her the whole box of poison.", "3465": "Having, therefore, obtained that power­ ful instrument of crime, the wretch now prepared to indulge her murderous propensities without stint.", "3466": "She had an infant daughter, by the husband whom she had lately murdered;", "3467": "and she felt extremely galled that the laws would give to this little child the inheritance of her father, as being his next of kin.", "3468": "Coveting the whole patrimony of the daughter, she waited only for an opportunity of depriving her of life.", "3469": "Making sure, therefore, that wicked mothers come in for the reversion of the inheritances of their deceased children, she showed herself to be just such a parent as she had been a wife.", "3470": "Accordingly, preparing a breakfast, she seized her op­ portunity, and with the same poison destroyed both the widow of the physician and her own daughter.", "3471": "As for the child, the baneful venom instantly stopped her breathing, and consumed her tender life.", "3472": "But as for the doctor's widow, when she felt the virus of the detestable drug creeping through her lungs, she at once suspected the truth;", "3473": "the increasing difficulty of her breathing converted her suspicion into a certainty, and she hastened at once to the house of the governor of the province, clamorous for justice, and declaring she had enormous crimes to reveal.", "3474": "A great concourse of people gathered round her, and the governor immediately gave her a hearing.", "3475": "After she had unfolded to him from first to last all the atrocities of that horrible woman, she was seized with a fit;", "3476": "her mouth, that was open in the act of speaking, closed convulsively;", "3477": "she ground her teeth violently together, and fell dead at the go­ vernor's feet.", "3478": "That able and energetic functionary would not allow the manifold crimes of this execrable poisoner to lose their terrors by delay, but immediately ordered her chamber­ maids to be brought before him, and extracted the truth from them by means of torture.", "3479": "On their deposition he sentenced the culprit to a punishment which was no doubt less than she deserved, but as no other torment could be devised so well adapted to the enormity of her guilt, he ordered that she should be thrown to wild beasts.", "3480": "END OF THE FOURTEENTH EPISODE.", "3481": "With such a woman as this it was determined that I should be publicly connected, as if I had been lawfully married to her.", "3482": "It was with extreme anguish, therefore, that I looked forward to the day of the spectacle;", "3483": "being frequently tempted rather to destroy myself with my own hand, than be defiled by con­ tact with such an abandoned woman, or be disgraced by the infamy of such a public spectacle.", "3484": "But, as I was destitute of human hands and of fingers, I had no means of drawing a sword with my round and stumpy hoof.", "3485": "However, I consoled myself, as well as I could, in my extreme anguish, with a slen­ der hope;", "3486": "for the spring now beginning to appear, would deck all the country with flowering buds, and clothe the meadows with a purple glow;", "3487": "the roses would burst forth from their thorny cells, exhaling aromatic odours, and these would restore me to my former shape as Lucius.", "3488": "And now behold, the day destined for the show came;", "3489": "and amid shouts of applause, a long train escorting me, I was led to the amphitheatre.", "3490": "During the first part of the performance, which was devoted to the joyous choral dances of the players, I was placed outside the gate, and was glad to crop some very fresh grass which grew just at the entrance;", "3491": "while I every now and then delighted my curious eyes with a most agreeable view of the spectacle through the open gate.", "3492": "Beautiful boys and maidens, in the bloom of youth, splen­ didly dressed, moved with great elegance of gesture through the graceful evolutions of the Greek Pyrrhic dance.", "3493": "Now they revolved in a circle;", "3494": "now they deployed into an oblique line, with hands joined ;", "3495": "at times they formed a wedge-like figure enclosing an open square;", "3496": "then they parted into two troops, and went through a variety of intricate movements, till they ceased at the sound of the trumpet.", "3497": "Then the screen was lowered, the hangings were drawn aside, and a dramatic scene was exhibited.", "3498": "There was a wooden structure formed in imitation of that celebrated mountain, Ida, of which the poet Homer has sung.", "3499": "It was a fabric of considerable height, covered over with turf and with growing trees up to the very top, whence, by the con­ trivance of the artist, a fountain was made to flow and pour down a stream of water.", "3500": "A few goats cropped the grass, and a young man, handsomely arrayed in flowing Barbaric vestments, and having his head covered with a golden tiara, in resemblance of Paris, the Phrygian shepherd, appeared to be employed in pas­ toral pursuits.", "3501": "A beautiful boy then came forward, his only garment being the mantle generally worn by striplings, which covered his left shoulder.", "3502": "His beautiful yellow hair flowed loosely, and from the midst of it issued a pair of little golden wings;", "3503": "these and the caduceus he carried showed him to be Mercury.", "3504": "He danced forward, holding in his hand a golden apple, which he presented to the performer who personated Paris, made known to him by signs what Jove commanded, and gracefully retired.", "3505": "A girl then made her appearance, of noble features, representing the goddess Juno.:", "3506": "for her head was surrounded with a white diadem, and she bore a sceptre in her hand.", "3507": "Another then entered, who was easy to be recog­ nized as Minerva, having on her head a shining helmet, en­ circled with a wreath of olive.", "3508": "She raised her shield aloft, and brandished her spear, like that goddess when engaged in battle.", "3509": "After these came another female, of surpassing beauty;", "3510": "the loveliness of her divine complexion declared her to be Venus, and Venus such as she was while yet a virgin.", "3511": "Her perfect form was naked, all but some charms imperfectly concealed by a gauze scarf, which the wind played with amorously, some­ times uncovering the beauties beneath it, sometimes pressing it against the limbs, and displaying their delicious contour.", "3512": "The goddess appeared in two different colours;", "3513": "her body was dazzlingly white, because she had descended from the heavens, while her silken garment was azure, because she had emerged from the sea.", "3514": "The virgins who represented the goddesses were accompanied by their respective attendants :", "3515": "Juno by two young players, representing Castor and Pollux, whose heads were covered with helmets of semi-oval form, graced with a cluster of stars.", "3516": "She advanced with a calm and unaffected air to the warbling of the flute, and promised the shepherd, with modest gestures, that she would bestow on him the empire of all Asia, if he adjudged to her the prize of beauty.", "3517": "She who personated Minerva was attended by two armed youths, Terror and Fear, who danced before her with drawn swords.", "3518": "Behind her a piper played a martial air, mingling shrill and deep-braying tones, and excited the agility of the dancers as with the blast of the trumpet.", "3519": "With restless head and threatening glances, Pallas bounded forward, and with animated gesture signified to Paris that if he pronounced her victorious in the contest of beauty, she woUld render him illustrious for his valour, and his achievements in war.", "3520": "Greeted with vast applause from the spectators, Venus ad­ vanced with a sweet smile, and stood still in a graceful attitude in the middle of the stage, surrounded by a throng of merry little boys, such plump, round-limbed, fair-skinned little fel­ lows, you would have sworn they were real Cupids, who had just flown from heaven or from the sea;", "3521": "for they had little wings, and arrows, and all other accoutrements conformable;", "3522": "and they carried gleaming torches before their mistress, as if to light her way to a nuptial banquet.", "3523": "She had also in her train a lovely choir of virgins, the charming Graces and the Hours, who strewed the path of their goddess with loose flowers and bouquets, and propitiated the queen of pleasure with the pleasant offerings of the spring.", "3524": "Presently the flutes began to breathe soft Lydian airs, that thrilled the audience with delight;", "3525": "but greater still was their delight, when Venus began to move in concert with the music, and with slow lingering steps, and gentle sinuous flexure of the spine and head, and graceful movements of the arms, to respond to the soft modulations of the flutes;", "3526": "while now her eyes swam with voluptuous languor, now flashed with the ardour of pas­ sion, and sometimes she seemed, as it were, to dance with her eyes alone.", "3527": "As soon as she had approached close to the judge, she was understood to promise, by the movements of her arms, that if she was preferred to the other goddesses, she would bestow on Paris a wife surpassing all women in beauty, in a word, one like herself.", "3528": "Gladly, then, did the young Phrygian deliver to her the golden apple he held in his hand, as a token of her victory.", "3529": "What wonder is it, then, you vilest of people, forensic cattle rather, vultures clad in gowns, if all judges now sell their de­ cisions for a price ?", "3530": "Even in the early ages of the world, favour was able to corrupt judgment in a question agitated between Gods and men, and a young man, a rustic and a shep­ herd, elected judge by the counsels of mighty Jupiter, bartered the first judicial decision for the lucre of lust, ensuring thereby the destruction of all his race.", "3531": "Ay, by Hercules, and another such judgment was given in later times, by the illustrious leaders of the Greeks, when Palamedes, renowned for wisdom and learning, was condemned on false accusations as a traitor;", "3532": "as also when the mendicant Ulysses was preferred to the mighty Ajax, who excelled in military prowess.", "3533": "And what sort of judgment was that given by those renowned lawgivers, the Athenians, .those clever people, and masters of all the sciences?", "3534": "Was not that divinely wise old man, whom the Delphic god pronounced superior in wisdom to all men, circumvented by the treachery and envy of a most infamous faction, as a de­ clared corrupter of youth, though he restrained their excesses as with a bridle ?", "3535": "Was he not cut off by the deadly juice of a pestilential herb, leaving to his fellow-citizens the stain-of indelible ignominy ?", "3536": "For even at this day the most excellent philosophers make choice of his most holy sect before all others, and swear by his name, in their highest aspirations for con­ summate happiness.", "3537": "Lest, however, any one blame this outburst of indignation, and say to himself, Look ye now, are we to suffer an ass to philosophize to us ?", "3538": "I shall again return to the point in the narrative from which I digressed.", "3539": "After that judgment of Paris was finished, Juno and Minerva retired from the stage in sorrow and anger, and showed by their gestures the indig­ nation they felt at being rejected;", "3540": "but Venus, full of joy and merriment, testified her gladness by dancing with all her choir.", "3541": "Then wine, mixed with saffron, burst forth on high from the summit of the mountain, through a pipe that lay concealed, and flowing in scattered streams, besprinkled as it fell, with an odoriferous shower, the goats that fed around, and changed their native whiteness for a more beautiful yellow tint.", "3542": "And now, the whole theatre exhaling a sweet odour, a chasm of the earth absorbed the wooden mountain.", "3543": "One of the soldiers now ran down the street, to fulfil the demands of the people, and bring from the public prison the woman before-mentioned, who, as I have stated, was condemned to the wild beasts, on account of her manifold crimes, and des­ tined to be my illustrious bride.", "3544": "What was intended also to be our genial bed was already prepared.", "3545": "It was brilliantly adorned with the Indian tortoise-shell, swelling with feathery heaps, and decorated with a silken coverlet.", "3546": "As for me, be­ sides the shame of being thus publicly exhibited, and besides the contact of that wicked and polluted woman, I was also in the highest degree tormented with the fear of death ;", "3547": "for it struck me that if, while we were performing our prescribed part in the exhibition, any wild beast should be let in on pur­ pose to destroy the woman, it would not be so remarkably well trained or sagacious, or so temperate and abstemious, as to tear the woman to pieces who was at my side, and spare me, as being uncondemned, and guilty of no crime.", "3548": "Being therefore alarmed, not on grounds of delicacy alone, but on account of my life, while my master was intent on pre­ paring for the representation, and all his servants were partly engaged in getting ready for the spectacle of hunting, and partly in gazing at the grandeur of the show :", "3549": "and as no one thought that so tame an ass required to be so very attentively watched, and I was free to follow my own devices, accordingly little by little I stole away softly and quietly.", "3550": "When I reached the nearest gate, I hurried along at a most rapid pace.", "3551": "And after I had travelled a hot gallop of six miles, I arrived at Cenchreæ;", "3552": "a city which has the reputation of being the most noble colony of the Corinthians, and is washed by the Ægean and Saronic sea.", "3553": "Here, also, there is a port, which is a most safe harbour for ships, and frequented by a vast concourse of people.", "3554": "Avoiding, therefore, the crowds, and choosing a sequestered spot on the sea-shore, close to the spray of the waves, I stretched my weary body on the soft bosom of the sand.", "3555": "The chariot of the sun had sped onward to the end of its course;", "3556": "and I re­ signed myself to repose, and was soon wrapped in sweet sleep.", "3557": "AWAKING in sudden alarm about the first watch of the night, I beheld the full orb of the moon shining with re­ markable brightness, and just then emerging from the waves of the sea.", "3558": "Availing myself, therefore, of the silence and soli­ tude of night, as I was also well aware that the great primal goddess possessed a transcendent majesty, and that human affairs are entirely governed by her providence;", "3559": "and that not only cattle and wild beasts, but likewise things inanimate, are invigorated by the divine influence of her light;", "3560": "that the bodies likewise which are on the earth, in the heavens, and in the sea, at one time increase with her increments, and at another lessen duly with her wanings;", "3561": "being well assured of this, I determined to implore the august image of the goddess then present, Fate, as I supposed, being now satiated with my many and great calamities, and holding out to me at last some pro­ spect of relief.", "3562": "Shaking off all drowsiness, therefore, I rose with alacrity, and directly, with the intention of purifying myself, began bathing in the sea.", "3563": "Having dipped my head seven times in the waves, because, according to the divine Pythagoras, that number is especially adapted to religious purposes, I joyously and with alacrity thus supplicated with a tearful countenance the transcendently powerful Goddess:", "3564": "-\"", "3565": "Queen of heaven, whether thou art the genial Ceres, the prime parent of fruits, who, joyous at the discovery of thy daughter, didst banish the savage nutriment of the ancient acorn, and pointing out a better food, dost now till the Eleusi- nian soil;", "3566": "or whether thou art celestial Venus, who, in the first origin of things, didst associate the different sexes, through the creation of mutual love, and having propagated an eternal offspring in the human race, art now worshipped in the sea- girt shrine of Paphos;", "3567": "or whether thou art the sister of Phoebus, who, by relieving the pangs of women in travail by soothing remedies, hast brought into the world multitudes so innumerable, and art now venerated, in the far-famed shrines of Ephesus;", "3568": "or whether thou art Proserpine, terrific, with midnight bowlings, with triple features checking the attack of the ghosts, closing the recesses of the earth, and who wan­ dering over many a grove, art propitiated by various modes of worship ;", "3569": "with that feminine brightness of thine, illuminating the walls of every city, and with thy vaporous beams nurtur­ ing the joyous seeds of plants, and for the revolutions of the sun ministering thy fitful gleams:", "3570": "by whatever name, by whatever ceremonies, and under whatever form* it is lawful to invoke thee;", "3571": "do thou graciously succour me in this my extreme distress, support my fallen fortune, and grant me rest and peace, after the endurance of so many sad calamities.",

former self.", "3574": "But if any offended deity pursues me with inexorable cruelty, may it at least be allowed me to die, if it is not al­ lowed me to live.", "3575": "\"Having after this manner poured forth my prayers and added bitter lamentations, sleep again overpowered my stricken feelings on the same bed.", "3576": "Scarcely had I closed my eyes, when behold!", "3577": "a divine form emerged from the middle of the sea, and disclosed features that even the gods themselves might venerate.", "3578": "After this, by degrees, the vision, resplendent throughout the whole body, seemed gradually to take its stand before me, rising above the surface of the sea.", "3579": "I will even make an attempt to describe to you its wondrous appearance, if, indeed, the poverty of human language will afford me the power of appropriately setting it forth;", "3580": "or, if the Divinity herself will supply me with a sufficient stock of eloquent diction.", "3581": "In the first place, then, her hair, long and hanging in tapered ringlets, fell luxuriantly on her divine neck;", "3582": "a crown of varied form encircled the summit of her head, with a diversity of flowers, and in the middle of it, just over her forehead, there was a flat circlet, which resembled a mirror, or rather emitted a white refulgent light, thus indicating that she was the moon.", "3583": "Vipers rising from furrows of the earth, supported this on the right hand and on the left, while ears of corn pro­ jected on either side.", "3584": "Her garment was of many colours, woven of fine flax;", "3585": "in one part it was resplendent with a clear white colour, in another it was yellow like the blooming crocus, and in another flaming with a rosy redness.", "3586": "And then, what rivetted my gaze far more than all, was her mantle of the deepest black, that shone with a glossy lustre.", "3587": "It was wrapped around her, and passing from below her right side over the left shoulder, was fastened in a knot that resem­ bled the boss of a shield, while a part of the robe fell down in many folds, and gracefully floated with its little knots of fringe that edged its extremities.", "3588": "Glittering stars were dispersed along the embroidered extremities of the robe, and over its whole surface;", "3589": "and in the middle of them a moon of two weeks old breathed forth its flaming fires.", "3590": "Besides this, a garland, wholly consisting of flowers and fruits of every kind, adhered naturally to the border of this beautiful mantle, in whatever direction it was wafted by the breeze.", "3591": "The objects which she carried in her hands were of a diffe­ rent description.", "3592": "In her right hand she bore a brazen sistrum,* through the narrow rim of which, winding just like a girdle for the body, passed a few little rods, producing a sharp shrill sound, while her arm imparted motion to the triple chords.", "3593": "An oblong vessel, made of gold, in the shape of a boat, hung down from her left hand, on the handle of which, in that part in which it met the eye, was an asp raising its head erect, and with its throat puffed out on either side.", "3594": "Shoes, too, woven from the palm, the emblem of victory, covered her ambrosial feet.", "3595": "Such was the appearance of the mighty goddess, as, breath­ ing forth the fragrant perfumes of Arabia the happy, she deigned with her divine voice thus to address me:", "3596": "\"Behold me, Lucius;", "3597": "moved by thy prayers, I appear to thee;", "3598": "I, who am Nature, the parent of all things, the mistress of all the ele­

will carry in the procession a crown of roses, attached to the sistrum in his right hand.", "3621": "Without delay, then, pushing the crowd aside, join my procession, and put your trust in my gracious disposition ;", "3622": "then, having approached close, as though to kiss the hand of the priest, gently pluck the roses, and at once divest yourself of the hide of that abominable beast, which I have long looked upon with detestation.\"", "3623": "Nor hold in dread any thing pertaining to my concerns as difficult.", "3624": "For even at this very same instant* of time in which I appear to you here present, I am giving orders also to my priest how to bring about the things that are to take place hereafter.", "3625": "By my command, the dense crowds of people shall give way before you.", "3626":

protection you will live happy, you will live glorious:", "3630": "and when, having passed through the allotted period of your life, you shall descend to the realms beneath, there, also, in the subterranean hemisphere, you, dwelling in the Elysian fields, shall frequently adore me whom you now behold thus propitious to you, and shall there see me shining amidst the darkness of Acheron, and reigning in the Stygian realms.", "3631": "And further, if you shall be found to deserve the protection of my divinity by sedulous obedience, religious de­ votion, and inviolable chastity, you shall be sensible that it is possible for me, and me alone, to extend your life beyond the limits that have been appointed to it by your destiny.", "3632": "\"The venerable oracle having thus concluded, the invin­ cible divinity dissolved into herself.", "3633": "Instantly shaking off sleep, I arose, in a state of fear and joy, and bathed in per­ spiration.", "3634": "Astonished in the highest degree at so evident a manifestation of the powerful goddess, having sprinkled myself with the spray of the sea, and intent on her high commands, I tried to recall to mind the successive particulars of her injunc­ tions.", "3635": "Soon after this, the golden sun arose, and put to flight the clouds of dark night:", "3636": "and now, behold, a crowd of people filled all the streets with a religious procession, conducted in a style of triumph.", "3637": "All things likewise, independently of my own delight, seemed to me to be affected with the greatest hilarity, insomuch that I thought even the cattle of all kinds, every house, and the day itself, wore an aspect of gladness and serenity;", "3638": "for a sunny and placid day had suddenly succeeded to the frost of the previous one;", "3639": "so that, allured by the warmth of the spring, the tuneful little birds sang sweetly, and with their merry warbling soothed Her who was the mother of the stars, the parent of the seasons, and the mistress of the whole universe.", "3640": "And then the trees, too, both those prolific and those which only yielded a shade, unbound from their wintry sleep by the warm southern breezes, and embellished with young foliage, sent forth a sweet rustling sound from their branches.", "3641": "The waves of the sea, no longer heaving turbidly to the roaring blast of the tempest, gently washed the shore;", "3642": "the dark clouds were dispersed, and the heavens shone with the serene splendour of their native light.", "3643": "And now, behold, the prelude to the grand procession came gradually into action.", "3644": "The persons who composed it were all finely caparisoned in various ways, each according to his own taste and inclination.", "3645": "This man, being girded with a belt, repre­ sented a soldier;", "3646": "another was equipped as a hunter, with a short scarf, a hunting-knife, and javelin.", "3647": "Another, wearing gilded sandals, a silken garment, and precious female ornaments, and with false hair on his head, personated a woman by his appear­ ance and his gait.", "3648": "Another, with his boots, his shield, his helmet, and his sword, appeared as though he had come straight from the school of the gladiators.", "3649": "There was one who played the part of a magistrate, with the fasces and the purple robe;", "3650": "another that of a philosopher, with his cloak, his staff, his wooden-clogged shoes, and his goatish beard;", "3651": "two persons, with dissimilar reeds, represented, the one a fowler with bird­ lime, and the other a fisherman with his hook.", "3652": "I also saw a tame she-bear, wearing the dress of a woman, and carried in a chair;", "3653": "an ape, too, with a plaited straw hat on its head, and clothed with a Phrygian garment of saffron colour, carrying in its hand a golden cup, and representing the shepherd Ganymede;", "3654": "likewise an ass, on which wings were glued, and which walked near a feeble old man ;", "3655": "so that you would certainly have said that the one was Bellerophon, and the other Pegasus;", "3656": "but still you would have enjoyed your laugh at both.", "3657": "Amid this merry masquerade of the swarming people, the procession proper of the guardian Goddess now advanced.", "3658": "Females, splendidly arrayed in white garments, expressing their joy by various gestures, and adorned with vernal chaplets, scattered flowers on the ground from their bosoms, along the path of the sacred procession.", "3659": "Others, again, with mirrors placed upon their backs, showed all who followed to the God­ dess, with their faces towards her as if they were coming to meet her.", "3660": "Others, carrying ivory combs, imitated the combing and bedecking of her regal hair, with the motion of their arms, and the twisting of their fingers.", "3661": "There were others, too, who sprinkled the streets with drops of genial balsam, and other kinds of perfume.", "3662": "In addition to all this, there was a great multitude of men and women, who propitiated the Goddess, offspring of the celestial stars, by bearing lamps, torches, wax- tapers, and other kinds of artificial light.", "3663": "Next came musicians, playing sweetly on pipes and flutes.", "3664": "A graceful choir of chosen youths, in snow-white garments, followed them, repeating a beautiful song, which an excellent poet had composed under favour of the Muses, the words of which explained the first origin of the votive procession.", "3665": "Pipers also, consecrated to the great Serapis, played an air appropriate to the worship of the god, on pipes with transverse mouth-pieces, and tubes held ob­ liquely towards their right ears.", "3666": "There were, also, a number of persons, whose office it was to give notice that room should be left for the sacred procession to pass.", "3667": "Then came a multi­ tude of those who had been initiated into the sacred rites of the goddess, consisting of men and women of all classes and ages, resplendent with the pure whiteness of their linen gar­ ments.", "3668": "The women had their anointed hair enveloped in a transparent covering;", "3669": "but the men had shaven and shining pates ;", "3670": "earthly stars were these of extreme sanctity, who kept up a shrill and incessant tinkling upon brazen, silver, and even gold sistra.", "3671": "But the chief ministers of the sacred rites, clothed in garments of white linen, drawn close over the breast, and hanging down to their feet, carried the insignia of the mighty Gods, exposed full to view.", "3672": "The first held aloft a brilliant lamp, not by any means resembling those lamps of ours which illumine banquets at night;", "3673": "but it was of gold, of a boat-like form, and emitted a flame of considerable magnitude, from an aperture in the middle.", "3674": "The second was arrayed in a similar manner, but carried in both his hands models of altars, * to which the auxiliary providence of the supreme goddess gave the appropriate name of auxilia.\"", "3675": "The third bore a palm tree, the leaves of which were beautifully wrought in gold, as also the caduceus of Mercury.", "3676": "The fourth displayed the sym­ bol of Equity, a left hand, fashioned with the palm expanded ;", "3677": "which seems to be more adapted to administering Equity than the right, from its natural inertness, and its being endowed with no craft and no subtlety.", "3678": "The same person also carried a golden vessel, which was rounded in the shape of the female breast, and from which he poured forth milk on the ground.", "3679": "The fifth bore a golden corn-fan, made with thickset branches of gold ;", "3680": "while another carried an amphora.", "3681": "In the next place, appeared the gods that deigned to walk with the feet of men.", "3682": "Here, dreadful to view, was the mes­ senger of the gods above, and of those of the realms beneath, standing erect, with a face partly black, and partly of a golden hue, bearing in his left hand a caduceus, and shaking in his right a green branch of palm ;", "3683": "close upon whose footsteps fol­ lowed a cow, in an erect position ;", "3684": "this cow being the prolific resemblance of the all-parent goddess, and seated on the shoul­ ders of one of the blessed devotees of this divinity, who acted gesticulatingly as he walked.", "3685": "Another carried a chest, con­ taining the secret utensils of this stupendous mystery.", "3686": "Another bore in his beatified bosom a venerable effigy of his supreme Divinity, bearing no resemblance to any bird or beast, wild or tame, or even to man;", "3687": "but worthy of all veneration for the exquisite art with which it was wrought, as also for its very originality, and an ineffable symbol of a sublime religion, the mysteries of which were ever to be kept in deep silence.", "3688": "It was of burnished gold, after the following manner:", "3689": "there was a small urn, hollowed out in a most artistic manner, with a bottom quite round, and which outside was covered with the wonderful hieroglyphics of the Egyptians.", "3690": "The spout of this urn was very long, not much elevated;", "3691": "a handle was attached to the other side, and projected from the urn with a wide sweep.", "3692": "On this lay an asp, uplifting its scaly, wrinkled, and swollen throat, and embraced it with its winding folds.", "3693": "At last the moment was at hand, when I was to experience the blessing promised me by the most potent goddess;", "3694": "and the priest, attired just as she had described, approached with the .", "3695": "means of my deliverance.", "3696": "In his right hand he carried the sistrum of the goddess, and a crown of roses ;", "3697": "and by Hercules, a crown it was for me;", "3698": "since by the providence of the mighty goddess, after having endured so many hardships, and escaped so many dangers, I should now achieve a victory over my cruel enemy, Fortune.", "3699": "Still, however, though agitated by a sudden burst of joy, I did not rush forward at once, lest the tranquil order of the sacred procession should be disturbed by the impetuosity of a quadruped;", "3700": "but passed through the crowd with a quiet and altogether human step, and a sidelong movement of my body, and as the people gave way, through the interference, no doubt, of the goddess, I gradually crept nearer and nearer.", "3701": "But the priest, as I could plainly perceive, recollecting the nocturnal oracle, and struck with wonder at the coincidence with the duty which he had been commanded to perform, instantly stood still, and extending his right hand of his own accord, presented the chaplet to my very mouth.", "3702": "Trembling, and with a great beating of my heart, I seized the bright rosy chaplet, and greedily, most greedily devoured it.", "3703": "Nor did the celestial promise deceive me;", "3704": "for immediately my unsightly and brutal figure left me.", "3705": "First of all, my rough hair fell off, and next my thick skin became thin;", "3706": "my big belly shrank in;", "3707": "my hoofs spread out into feet and toes;", "3708": "my hands were no longer feet, but ready for the duties of their elevated position, My long neck was shortened;", "3709": "my face and my head became round;", "3710": "my enormous ears were restored to their former small dimensions;", "3711": "my stony teeth returned to the diminutive size of those of men;", "3712": "and the tail, which before especially annoyed me, was no where to be seen.", "3713": "The people were as­ tonished, and the religious adored the power of the supreme Divinity, so manifested in the facility of my restoration, which resembled the visions of a dream.", "3714": "Extending their hands to­ wards the heavens, they attested, with a loud and unanimous voice, the favour of the goddess thus signally displayed.", "3715": "As for me, I stood riveted to the spot in excessive asto­ nishment, my mind being unable to contain a delight so sudden and so great, quite at a loss what first and in especial to say, how to make a commencement with a new voice, how most auspiciously to prepare my address, my tongue being now born • again, and in what words sufficiently to express my thanks to a Goddess so great.", "3716": "The priest, however, who through the divine admonition knew all my misfortunes from the beginning, though he himself also was in a state of utter astonishment at this remarkable miracle, at once signified his wish by nodding his head, and ordered that a linen garment should be given me, for the purpose of covering my nakedness.", "3717": "For, the very instant that the ass had laid aside his abominable covering, I carefully shaded myself with a natural screen, as much as it was possible for a naked person to do, by closely compressing my thighs, and applying my hands.", "3718": "Upon this one of the throng of devotees promptly throwing me his upper tunic, covered me therewith;", "3719": "which being done, the priest with a benign countenance, and, by Hercules, astonished at my perfectly human appearance, thus addressed me:", "3720": "—\" At last, Lucius, you have arrived at the haven of peace and the altar of mercy, after the many and various hardships you have undergone, and all the buffetings of stormy Fortune.", "3721": "Neither the nobility of your descent, nor your dignified posi­ tion, nor even the learning in which you excel, have benefited you in the slightest degree;", "3722": "but falling into the slavery of pleasure, in the wantonness of buxom youth, you have reaped the inauspicious reward of your ill-fated curiosity.", "3723": "Never­ theless, blind Fortune, while harassing you with the worst of dangers, has conducted you, in her short-sighted malice, to this state of religious beatitude.", "3724": "Let her go now, and rage with all her fury, and let her seek some other object for her cruelty ;", "3725": "* for direful calamity has no power over those whose lives the majesty of our Goddess has claimed for her own service.", "3726": "What advantage has unscrupulous For­ tune derived from the robbers, from the wild beasts, from the servitude, from the long toils on rugged roads, and from the fear of death to which you were daily exposed?", "3727": "You are now received under the guardianship of Fortune, but of a For­ tune who can see, and who even illuminates the other Deities with the splendour of her light.", "3728": "Assume henceforth a more joyous countenance, such as befits that white garment which you wear.", "3729": "Follow the train of the Goddess your deliverer with triumphant steps.", "3730": "Let the irreligious see, let them see and ac­ knowledge their error.", "3731": "Behold now, Lucius, rejoicing in the providence of great Isis, and freed from his former miseries, triumphs over his destiny.", "3732": "Nevertheless, that you may be more secure and better protected, enrol your name in this holy militia, which you will hereafter rejoice to belong to;", "3733": "dedicate yourself to the service of our religion, and voluntarily bend your neck to the yoke of this ministry;", "3734": "for when you have once begun to serve the Goddess, you will then in a still higher degree enjoy the fruit of your, liberty.", "3735": "\"The worthy priest having uttered these words, while his breath heaved with inspiration, concluded his address, and I mingling with the throng of devotees, accompanied the pro­ cession;", "3736": "an object of curiosity to the whole city.", "3737": "All pointed at me with their fingers and heads, and said, \"", "3738": "This day has the august power of all mighty God restored that person to the human form.", "3739": "Happy, by Hercules!", "3740": "and thrice blessed he, to have merited, by the innocence and probity of his past life, such special patronage of heaven;", "3741": "in that, being after a manner born again, he is immediately affianced to the service of the sacred ministry.", "3742": "\"While these remarks were being made, and amid the tumult of their noisy congratulations, moving slowly on, we now ap­ proached the sea-shore, and came to that very place where, on the preceding day, I, while yet an ass, had laid me down.", "3743": "The images of the Gods being there arranged in proper order, the chief priest dedicated and consecrated to the Goddess a very skilfully built ship, pictured all over with the curious hiero­ glyphics of the Egyptians, after having most carefully purified it with a lighted torch, an egg, and sulphur, while at the same time his chaste lips poured forth solemn prayers.", "3744": "The shining white sail of this auspicious bark bore an inscription in large characters, which was a repetition of a vow that had been made on shore for the prosperity of the convoy at this season of the re­ commencement of navigation.", "3745": "Now the mast was raised, which was a rounded pine tree, tall and well polished, and conspicuous for the beauteous appearance of its head.", "3746": "The prow also was turned in imitation of a goose's neck,* and covered with gold leaf, the bark shone resplendently, while the whole of the highly polished keel consisted of shining citron wood.", "3747": "All the people, religious and profane, t vied with each other in heaping together corn-fans laden with aromatics and other sacrificial offerings, and poured upon the waves a libation of milk mixed with other ingredients;", "3748": "until the ship, freighted with abundant gifts and auspicious prayers, and let slip from the ropes that held the anchor, put to sea with a serene breeze, which seemed to have sprung up for her sake alone.", "3749": "And after she had pro­ ceeded so far on her course that she could no longer be distin­ guished by us, the bearers of the sacred things again took what each had brought, and began joyfully to return to the temple, in an orderly manner, and in the same form of procession in which they had come.", "3750": "Now as soon as we arrived at the temple, the chief priest and those who carried the sacred images, and those who had already been initiated into the venerable mysteries, being admitted into the sanctuary of the Goddess, deposited in the accustomed form the breathing effigies.±+", "3751": "Then, one of these, whom all of them called the scribe, standing before the doors, whilst the company of the Pastophori,* which is the name of the brotherhood of this sacred college, convoked together as to a council, uttered from a high pulpit auspicious wishes, from a book in which was written:", "3752": "—\" To the great Prince, to the Senate, to theEquestrian order, in naval matters and in ships, and all those who are subject to our dominion ;", "3753": "\" and then he pronounced in the Greek language, and according to the Greek custom, the Λαοις ἄϕεσις, [the people may depart.] to which the people responded with a clamour which testified their general satisfaction.", "3754": "Then every one went home, full of joy, carrying branches of olive, sweet herbs, and garlands of flowers, and after kissing the feet of a silver image of the Goddess, which stood on the steps of the temple.", "3755": "But my feelings would not allow me to move so much as a nail's breadth from that place;", "3756": "but wi th my eyes intently fastened on the image of the Goddess, I recalled to memory my past misfortunes.", "3757": "Fleeting Fame, however, had not in the meantime let her wings remain idle, but had immediately circulated in all direc­ tions in my native country the adorable bounty of the provident Goddess, and my own memorable adventures.", "3758": "Accordingly, my domestics and servants, and those who were nearest to me by blood, laying aside the sorrow with which they had been afflicted at the false intelligence of my death, and elated with this sudden joy, hastened forthwith to see me, who had been divinely saved and brought back, as it were, from the shades below, and they presented me with gifts of various kinds.", "3759": "I, too, was delighted to see them, and returned them many thanks for their handsome presents, and the more especially, as my domestics had providently taken care to bring me what would be abundantly sufficient in the way of clothes and money.", "3760": "Having, therefore, spoken to each of them in such manner as I was in duty bound to do, and related to them my former sorrows and my present joyous prospects, I again re­ turned to what was to me the greatest subject of delight, the contemplation of the Goddess, and procured for myself a tem­ porary habitation within the enclosure of the temple, constantly taking part in the private services of the Goddess, and being inseparable from the brotherhood of the priests, and a constant adorer of the great Divinity.", "3761": "Nor did I pass a single night or ever close my eyes without some vision from this Divinity, in which she commanded me to be now initiated in her sacred mysteries, to which I had long since been destined.", "3762": "As for me, though prompted by eager inclination, I was still restrained by religious fear.", "3763": "For after diligent enquiry, I had found that the requirements of a religious life were full of difficulties;", "3764": "that the chastity required was a very difficult thing to observe, and that it needed extreme circumspection to preserve such a habit of life from casual defilements.", "3765": "Frequently pondering over these things, I somehow or other delayed being initiated, although hastening to that conclusion.", "3766": "One night I had a dream, in which I thought that the chief priest made his appearance, and presented to me his lap full of various things, and on my asking what they were, he answered me, that the things had been sent to me from Thessaly;", "3767": "for that a servant of mine, whose name was Candidus, had arrived from that province.", "3768": "When I awoke, I revolved in my mind over and over again what the vision portended, especially as I was certain that I never had any servant who was called by that name.", "3769": "Still, however, I believed that some profitable result was undoubtedly signified by the priest offering me the things.", "3770": "Thus, in a state of anxious and bewildered eagerness, I awaited the opening of the temple in the morning.", "3771": "The white curtains having been drawn aside, we prayed to the venerable presence of the Goddess;", "3772": "and the priest going round the altars, performed the sacred ceremonial with solemn supplications, and poured forth libations from a chalice of water drawn from a fountain in the precincts of the sanctuary.", "3773": "The sacred rites therefore, being now duly performed, the devotees, saluting the breaking dawn, in a loud voice announced tho first hour of the day.", "3774": "And now, behold!", "3775": "some servants arrived from my country whom I had left there at the time when Fotis, by her unfortu­ nate mistake, had fitted me for a halter;", "3776": "so recognizing them as my own servants, and finding that they had brought back that horse of mine, after it had been sold from place to place, and which I identified by a mark on its back;", "3777": "I was then especially struck with admiration at the fitness of my dream, because not only had it come true with respect to the gain it had promised, but it had also predicted to me the recovery of my horse, which was of a white colour, under the designation of my servant Candidus.", "3778": "I continued to apply myself wholly to attendance on the worship of the Goddess, perceiving that the hopes which I had conceived of future good were now confirmed by present benefits.", "3779": "And besides, my desire of receiving initiation in the sacred duties, increased daily more and more.", "3780": "Accordingly, I frequently went to the chief priest, and most earnestly en­ treated him to initiate me into the mysteries of the holy night;", "3781": "but he, who was a man of a grave disposition, and remarkable for his strict observance of that abstemious religion, checked my urgent importunity in a mild and gentle manner, and in the way in which parents are in the habit of moderating the inconsiderate requests of their children, while at the same time he soothed me with hopes for the better.", "3782": "For he said, that the day on which each aspirant might be initiated was indicated by tokens from the Goddess, and that by her providence the priest was selected who was to perform the sacred rites;", "3783": "and that in like manner by her mandate the expense necessary for the ceremonial was ordained.", "3784": "All these circumstances, he was of opinion, ought to be awaited with obsequious patience, since we ought, on every consideration, to avoid precipitation and contumacy, and neither be dilatory when called, nor pre­ cipitate when not called.", "3785": "Nor, indeed, was there a single one of their number who was so lost to a sense of propriety, or rather so bent on his own destruction, as to dare rashly and sacrilegiously to undertake the ministry of the Goddess, and so bring upon himself a deadly mischance, unless she especially ordered him so to do ;", "3786": "for the gates of the realms beneath, and the guardianship of life, are placed in the hands of the God­ dess, and the initiation into her mysteries is celebrated as bearing a close resemblance to a voluntary death, with a pre­ carious chance of recovery.", "3787": "Wherefore the divine will of the Goddess has been accustomed to choose for this purpose men who, having arrived at a great age, are now standing at the very utmost limit of life, to whom, however, the mighty secrets of her religion may be safely entrusted,* and whom, through her providence, being after a manner born again, she restores to the career of a new existence.", "3788": "Therefore it was requisite that I should await the celestial mandate, although by the clear and manifest favour of the great Deity I had already been marked and destined for her blessed ministry;", "3789": "and I ought thenceforth to abstain from profane and forbidden food, in com­ mon with the other devotees, in order that I might with the most scrupulous strictness proceed on my course to the secret mysteries of the most pure religion.", "3790": "Thus did the priest express himself, nor was my compliance interrupted by feelings of impatience;", "3791": "but I attentively per­ formed the daily duties of the sacred ministry, intent upon maintaining a calm demeanour and laudable silence.", "3792": "Nor did the salutary benevolence of the powerful goddess disappoint me, or torment me with a long delay;", "3793": "but she clearly admo­ nished me by no obscure mandates in the darksome night, that the day was now arrived that had always been the object of my desire, .and in which she would put me in possession of my extreme wishes.", "3794": "She also stated what sum of money would be requisite for the expenses of the ceremonial, and at the same time appointed for me, as the dispenser of the rites, the same Mithras, her own high priest, who, she said, was united to me by a certain conjunction of the stars.", "3795": "Refreshed in mind by these and other benevolent precepts of the supreme Goddess, and shaking off slumber, though it was not yet clear day, I hastened at once to the dwelling of the priest, and saluted him just as he was coming .out of his bed- chamber.", "3796": "I had now determined to request more earnestly than ever initiation into the sacred rites, as being a thing that was due to me.", "3797": "He, however, the instant that he saw me, was the first to speak:", "3798": "\"0 my Lucius, how happy and blessed are you, whom the august divinity has thus greatly honoured by her propitious will!", "3799": "And why,\" said he, \"do you now stand idle, or make any delay?", "3800": "The day you so earnestly prayed for has now arrived, in which you will be initiated into the most holy mysteries by these hands of mine, in obedience to the divine mandates of the many-titled Goddess.", "3801": "\"And the old man, taking me by the right hand, led me im­ mediately to the doors of the vast temple;", "3802": "and having performed the office of opening them in the accustomed solemn way, and celebrated the morning sacrifice, he drew forth from the secret recesses of the shrine certain books, written in unknown cha- racters, partly representing in compendious form the words ex­ pressive of their meaning by figures of animals of every kind, and partly fortified against the inquisitive perusal of the pro­ fane, by characters wreathed like knots, and twisting round in shape of a wheel, and with extremities twining one with an­ other, like the tendrils of a vine.", "3803": "From these books he in­ formed me what was necessary to be provided by me for the purpose of initiation.", "3804": "Immediately, therefore, I diligently set about purchasing and procuring requisites, and even on a more liberal scale than I was ordered to do, partly at my own expense, and partly through my friends.", "3805": "And when, now the time, as the priest said, required it, he led me to the nearest bath, accompanied by a crowd of devotees ;", "3806": "and after I had taken the customary bath, he himself washed and sprinkled me with the purest water, having first implored the pardon of the Gods.", "3807": "Then, again, he brought me back to the temple, and there placed me at the very feet of the Goddess, two-thirds of the day having now elapsed ;", "3808": "and giving certain secret instructions, which are too holy to be uttered, he distinctly ordered, before all who were present, that I should abstain from luxurious food for the ten succeeding days, and that I should eat the flesh of no animal, and should abstain from wine.", "3809": "These ten days having been duly passed by me in reverential abstinence, the day had now arrived for pledging myself to the sacred ministry, and the sun descending, was ushering in the evening.", "3810": "Then, behold, there was a concourse of the people flocking from every side, every one honouring me with various gifts, according to the ancient custom of these sacred rites.", "3811": "After this, the priest, all the profane being removed to a dis­ tance, taking hold of me by the hand, brought me into the inner recesses of the sanctuary itself, clothed in a new linen gar­ ment.", "3812": "Perhaps, curious reader, you may be eager to know what was then said and done ?", "3813": "I would tell you, were it lawful for me to tell you;", "3814": "you should know it, if it were lawful for you to hear.", "3815": "But both the ears that heard these things, and the tongue that told them, would reap the evil results of their rashness.", "3816": "Still, however, kept in suspense as you probably are with religious longing, I will not torment you with long- protracted anxiety.", "3817": "Hear, therefore, but believe what is the truth.", "3818": "I approached the confines of death, and having trod on the threshold of Proserpine, I returned therefrom, being borne through all the elements.", "3819": "At midnight I saw the sun shining with its brilliant light;", "3820": "and I approached the presence of the Gods beneath, and the Gods of heaven, and stood near, and worshipped them.", "3821": "Behold, I have related to you things of which, though heard of by you, you must ne­ cessarily remain ignorant.", "3822": "I will therefore only relate that which may be enunciated to the understanding of the un­ initiated without a crime.", "3823": "The morning came, and, the solemnities being performed, I came forth consecrated by being dressed in twelve stoles, an habiliment no doubt of most religious character, but of which I am not forbidden by any obligation to speak, because it was seen by many who were present on the occasion.", "3824": "For, by order of the priest, I ascended a wooden pulpit, which was in the very middle of the sacred dwelling, and placed before the image of the Goddess, 'full in view, in a garment which was of linen, but elegantly coloured.", "3825": "A precious scarf also descended from my shoulders behind my back down to my ankles, and to whatever part of me you directed your view, you would have seen something to arrest your attention in the animals which were painted round my vestment in various colours.", "3826": "Here were Indian serpents, there Hyperborean griffins, which the other hemisphere generates in the form of a bird wearing wings.", "3827": "The persons devoted to the service of the divinity call this the Olympic stole.", "3828": "Then, in my right hand I carried a burning torch;", "3829": "while a graceful chaplet encircled my head, the shining leaves of the palm tree projecting from it like rays of light.", "3830": "Thus arrayed like the sun, and placed so as to resemble a statue, on a sudden, the curtains being drawn aside, I was ex­ posed to the gaze of the multitude.", "3831": "After this, I celebrated the most joyful day of my initiation, as my natal day, and there was a joyous banquet and mirthful conversation.", "3832": "The third day also was celebrated with the like rites and cere­ monies, and was accompanied by a religious breakfast, and the due termination of the ceremonial.", "3833": "After this, having stayed for some days in that place, I enjoyed the inexplicable pleasure of viewing the holy image, being indebted to it for a benefit which can never be sufficiently rewarded.", "3834": "At length, how­ ever, through the admonition of the Goddess, having suppli­ antly given her thanks, not such as she deserved, but still, to the best of my ability, I prepared myself, though very slowly, to return home.", "3835": "With difficulty did I rend asunder the ties of my most ardent affection.", "3836": "At last I prostrated myself in the presence of the Goddess, and having for a long time watered her feet with my tears, interrupting my words by frequent sobs, and, as it were, half swallowing my voice, I thus addressed her:", "3837": "—“ Thou, 0 holy and perpetual preserver of the human race, always munificent in cherishing mortals, dost bestow the sweet affec­ tion of a mother on the misfortunes of the wretched.", "3838": "Nor is there any day or night, nor so much as the minutest particle of time, which passes unattended by thy bounties.", "3839": "Thou dost protect men both by sea and land, and, dispersing the storms of life, dost extend thy health-giving right hand, by which thou dost unravel the inextricably entangled threads of the Fates, and dost assuage the tempests of fortune, and restrain the malignant influences of the stars.", "3840": "The gods of heaven adore thee, those in the shades below do homage unto thee;", "3841": "thou dost roll the sphere of the universe round the steady poles, thou dost illuminate the sun, thou dost govern the universe, thou dost tread the realms of Tartarus.", "3842": "The stars move re­ sponsive to thy command, the Gods rejoice in thy divinity, the seasons return by thy appointment, and the elements are thy servants.", "3843": "At thy nod the breezes blow, the clouds are nur­ tured, the seeds germinate, and the blossoms increase.", "3844": "The birds as they hover through the air, the wild beasts as they roam on the mountains, the serpents that hide in the earth, and the monsters that swim in the sea, are terrified at the ma­ jesty of thy presence.", "3845": "But I, so weak in capacity for cele­ brating thy praises, and possessing such slender means for offering sacrifices, have far from eloquence sufficient to express all that I conceive of thy majesty;", "3846": "not a thousand mouths, and tongues as many, not an eternal flow of unwearied speech, would be equal to the task.", "3847": "I will, therefore, use my utmost endeavours to do what, poor as I am, still one truly religious may do—I will figure to myself thy divine countenance, and will ever preserve this most holy divinity locked up in the deepest recesses of my breast.", "3848": "\"After this manner, having offered up my prayer to the supreme Goddess, I embraced the priest Mithras, who was now my parent, and hanging on his neck, and giving him many kisses, I begged him to forgive me, that I could not remunerate him in a manner adequate to such mighty benefits.", "3849": "At length, after having been long engaged in giving him thanks, I de­ parted, and prepared to journey directly to my paternal abode, in order to revisit it after an absence so prolonged.", "3850": "A few days after, having hastily tied up my packages, through the admonition of the powerful Goddess, embarking on board a ship, I set sail for Rome.", "3851": "Being sure of a favourable wind during my voyage, I very speedily entered into port, and tra­ velling by chariot* with the greatest rapidity, arrived at the holy city, † on the day before the Ides of December in the evening.", "3852": "Thenceforward no study was there of such primary importance with me, as that of daily supplicating the supreme divinity of Queen Isis;", "3853": "who is there propitiated with the greatest veneration under the name of Campensis,‡ which ap­ pellation she derives from the situation of her temple.", "3854": "In fine, I became a constant worshipper, a foreigner indeed as to her temple, but indigenous as to her religion.", "3855": "§Behold the mighty sun, having passed through the sign- bearing circle of the zodiac, had completed the year, when the vigilant care of the beneficent Goddess again interrupted my sleep, and again reminded me of initiation and sacred rites.", "3856": "On this I wondered what object she had in view, and what future event she announced.", "3857": "For how could I do otherwise ?", "3858": "as I considered myself to have been most fully initiated already.", "3859": "While, therefore, I revolved my religious doubts in my own mind, and availed myself of the counsels of the priest, I as­ certained a thing that was novel and quite wonderful to me;", "3860": "that I was only inititated into the mysteries of the goddess, but that I had not yet been admitted to the knowledge of the rites of the great God, and supreme parent of the Gods, the invincible Osiris.", "3861": "For though the essence of their divine nature and religion is connected, or rather, is tran­ scendently united, nevertheless, there is a very considerable difference in the initiations into their mysteries.", "3862": "Hence, it was for me to know that I was called upon by the great God to become one of his servants.", "3863": "Nor did the matter long remain am­ biguous.", "3864": "For on the following night, I saw in a dream one of the devotees, who, clothed in linen garments, and bearing in his hands thyrsi and ivy, and certain other things which I am not permitted to mention, placed them before my household Gods, and then seating himself in my chair, announced to me that I must prepare a plentiful religious banquet.", "3865": "He also walked gently with a hesitating step, the ancle of his left foot being slightly bent, in order no doubt that he might afford me some sign, by which I might recognize him.", "3866": "All the mists of am­ biguity were therefore removed, after such a manifest declara.", "3867": "tion of the will of the gods.", "3868": "Accordingly, the instant I had performed the morning salu­ tations to the goddess, I made a most careful examination of each, to see whether there was any one of the priests resem­ bling him whom I had seen in the dream.", "3869": "Nor was he wanting.", "3870": "For I immediately beheld one of the Pastophori, exactly cor­ responding with the nocturnal vision, not only' with regard to the mark of his foot.", "3871": "but also in his stature and general ap­ pearance ;", "3872": "whose name I afterwards learnt to be Asinius Mar­ cellus, an appellation not without some degree of reference* to my transformation.", "3873": "Without delay, therefore, I addressed this priest, who was himself very far from ignorant of what I intended to say, because he had already been admonished by a similar mandate, that he should initiate me into the mysteries of Osiris.", "3874": "For on the preceding night, while he was placing chaplets on the statue of the great God, he imagined that he had also heard from that mouth of his by which he pronounces the destinies of all things, that he should send to him a native of Madaura, to whom, though he was very poor, he must im­ mediately impart the sacred mysteries.", "3875": "That, through his pro­ vidence, glory would accrue to that person from his religious exercises, and great profit for himself.", "3876": "After this manner, being affianced to the sacred mysteries, I was retarded, contrary to my inclination, by reason of the slenderness of my means.", "3877": "For the expense to which I had been put in my journey had frittered away the small substance of my property;", "3878": "and the sums I was obliged to expend in the city, exceeded those which had been disbursed in the provinces.", "3879": "Rigid poverty, consequently, greatly interfering with my wishes, I was much afflicted, being placed, as the old proverb says, between the altar and the stone. *", "3880": "Nor yet was I less urged from time to time by the present mandates of the God.", "3881": "At last, after being repeatedly reminded, and finally com­ manded, not without considerable perturbation, taking off my back my garment, small as it was, I scraped together a suf­ ficient sum.", "3882": "And this very thing I had been expressly com­ manded to do.", "3883": "For the God said to me, \" Would you hesitate in the least to part with your garments, if you were attempting to procure any thing which might administer to your pleasures ?", "3884": "and are you now, when you are going to enter upon so great a ceremonial, doubtful whether you shall commit yourself to a poverty of which you will never have to repent?", "3885": "\"All things, therefore, being abundantly prepared, again being satisfied for ten days with other than animal food, and besides this, being also admitted to the nocturnal orgies of Serapis, a god of the first rank, I now applied myself to the service of the god, full of that confidence which my knowledge of a kin­ dred ritual produced.", "3886": "This event afforded me the greatest consolation for my sojourn in a foreign country, and at the same time supplied me more plentifully with the means of sub­ sistence.", "3887": "For, under favour of the deity of Good Event, I sup­ ported myself on a little gain which I made in the forum by pleading causes in the Latin tongue.", "3888": "A short time after, I was again addressed by the unexpected and perfectly miraculous mandates of the gods, and was com­ pelled to undergo a third initiation.*", "3889": "This caused me no slight anxiety, and much was I perplexed to know what could be the meaning of this new and unusual expression of the will of the gods;", "3890": "and what could still remain to be added by way of supplement to an initiation that had been already twice re­ peated.", "3891": "Surely, thought I, both the priests have advised me either wrongly or less fully than they ought to have done.", "3892": "And, by Hercules, I now began even to entertain a bad opinion of their fidelity.", "3893": "While, however, I was thus fluctuating amid a stormy tide of thought, and agitated to the verge of insanity, the benevolent figure of the divinity instructed me by a noc­ turnal vision.", "3894": "\"There is no reason,\" said he, \"that you should be terrified by the repeated series of religious rites, as if any thing had been previously omitted;", "3895": "but you ought rather ex­ ceedingly to rejoice on account of these reiterated marks of favour on the part of the divinities, and to exult that you will thrice obtain that which is scarcely even once granted to others.", "3896": "And you may confidently believe from that number that you will always be blessed.", "3897": "Besides, you will find that this cere­ monial is most necessary for you, if you will only now consider with yourself, that the stole of the goddess with which you were invested in the province, still remains deposited in the same spot, and that you cannot so much as supplicate at Home on solemn days in a garment of this kind, or be ennobled by that auspicious apparel, when you are commanded to assume it.", "3898": "In order, then, that you may enjoy health, happiness, and prosperity, once again with joyous feelings be initiated in the sacred mysteries, the mighty gods being your advisers.", "3899": "\"Thus far did the persuasive majesty of the hallowed vision announce to me what was requisite to be done.", "3900": "Nor did I, after this, neglect the matter, or defer it;", "3901": "but immediately relating what I had seen to my priest, I forthwith submitted to the yoke of abstinence from animal food, and having of my own accord extended my abstinence beyond those ten days prescribed by a perpetual law, I bought what was requisite for my initiation, spending more largely from pious zeal than with reference to the measure of the things provided.", "3902": "Nor, by Hercules, did I at all repent of my trouble and expense.", "3903": "And why should I ?", "3904": "for by the bounteous providence of the gods, I was sufficiently enriched -by my forensic emoluments.", "3905": "At length, after a very few days had elapsed, the God Osiris, who is the chief of the great gods, the highest among the greatest, the greatest among the highest, and the ruler of the greatest, not now veiling himself under some figure other than his own, but deigning to address me in his own person, and in his own divine words, seemed in my sleep to declare, that I should forthwith become renowned through my pleading causes in the forum, and that I should not fear the slanders of the malevolent, to which the learning I had acquired by laborious study had rendered me liable.", "3906": "Besides this, in order that I might minister to his sacred rites, mingling with the throng of devotees, he chose me to be a member of the college of his Pastophori, and still more, to be one of the quinquennial Decurions.", "3907": "Finally, therefore, my hair being closely shaved off, I joyfully fulfilled the duties of that most ancient college, which had been established in the days of Sylla, not shading or covering my baldness, but freely exposing it to the public gaze, whithersoever I went.", "3908": "END OF THE GOLDEN ASS.", "3909": "MAXIMUS CLAUDIUS, and you who are sitting here in judgment,* I felt fully assured, that Sicinius Æmilianus, † an old man, notorious for audacity, would, for want of substantial charges, fill up with nothing but abuse the accusation he undertook to make against me, before he had well considered the matter.", "3910": "Now any innocent person may be accused, but no one can be proved guilty unless he is so.", "3911": "Relying especially on this con­ sideration, by the Gods of heaven!", "3912": "I do rejoice that, with you for my judge, the power and the opportunity have fallen to my lot, of exculpating Philosophy in the eyes of the ignorant, and defending myself.", "3913": "And yet these charges- serious-looking charges at first new-were made with a suddenness that tended to embarrass my defence.", "3914": "For, as you remember, five or six days ago, when I was beginning to plead the cause of my wife,‡ Pudentilla, against the Granii, the advocates of this Æmilianus, by a con­ certed plan, and at a moment when I least expected it, assailed me with abuse, and accused me of magical practices, and even of the death of my step-son Pontianus.", "3915": "As I saw that these were not so much charges brought forward for judicial en­ quiry, as imputations for the mere purpose of abuse, I chal­ lenged them of my own accord, urgently and repeatedly, to prefer their accusation.", "3916": "But then Æmilianus, seeing that you too, Maximus, were considerably moved, and that a judicial affair had arisen out of his words, began, in distrust of his cause, to look about for some subterfuge from the consequences of his temerity.", "3917": "Accordingly, when he, who shortly before had been crying out that Pontianus, his brother's son, had been murdered by me, was compelled to sign his name to the accusation, he in­ stantly forgot all about the death of his young kinsman, and all of a sudden was mute as to the specification of a crime of such extreme atrocity.", "3918": "Still, that he might not seem altogether to have abandoned his charges, he selected this accusation of magical practices-an accusation more easily made than proved-as the only one in which he should persist.", "3919": "And even that he did not dare do openly;", "3920": "but, on the day after, he gave in an indictment, in the name of my son-in-law, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and annexed his own name thereto as his supporter ;", "3921": "thus adopting a new fashion of making an attack in another's name;", "3922": "no doubt, in order that, by putting for­ ward one so young, he himself might be screened from due punishment for his false accusation.", "3923": "When you, with great sagacity, perceived this to be the case, and thereupon com­ manded him again to support in his own name the accusation he had originally made, he promised that he would ;", "3924": "but after all, he could not be prevailed upon to do so.", "3925": "While you are urging him to come to close action with me, he, in his contu­ macy, shoots his calumnious missiles even against yourself.", "3926": "Thus ever shunning the danger of making an open accusation, he persevered in the safe course of seconding it.", "3927": "Accordingly, before the trial had even commenced, it was easy for any one to understand what would be the nature of the prosecution, the framer and contriver of which feared to under­ take its responsibility.", "3928": "This was more especially the case, since the person in question was Sicinius Æmilianus;", "3929": "who, if he had ascertained anything substantial against me, would certainly never have manifested any such hesitation in im­ peaching one who was a stranger to himself, of crimes so numerous and so heinous-he who, well knowing that his uncle's will was genuine, denounced it as a forgery;", "3930": "and with such obstinacy, that when Lollius Urbicus, the pro-consul, with men of consular dignity sitting as his assessors, had pronounced that it was proved genuine, and ought to be held valid, still that madman persisted, with his voice raised to the loudest pitch, in swearing that the will was a forgery;", "3931": "so that Lol­ lius Urbicus hardly refrained from visiting him with capital punishment.", "3932": "Relying on your justice and my own innocence, I trust that on this trial also he will have occasion to burst forth into exclamations of a similar nature.", "3933": "For he knowingly accuses one who is innocent;", "3934": "and does so, no doubt, with the greater readiness, because, as I have said, he has already, on a trial of the greatest importance, been convicted of uttering falsehoods before the Prætor of the city.", "3935": "For, as after having once committed a fault, every good man is the more careful to avoid it;", "3936": "so one who is evil-dis­ posed repeats his offence with increased audacity;", "3937": "and, from that time forward, the more frequently he offends, the more undisguisedly he does so.", "3938": "For it is with shame as with a gar­ ment—the more it is worn, the less it is cared for.", "3939": "For this reason, then, I deem it necessary, in order to main­ tain the integrity of my character, to refute all his malevolent aspersions before I come to the main charge.", "3940": "For I am un­ dertaking not only my own defence, but that of philosophy also, whose high character spurns the least slur as though it were the weightiest of charges;", "3941": "for as much as the ad­ vocates of Æmilianus have been just now babbling forth with their mercenary loquacity, many things trumped up against myself individually, and many others that are commonly ut­ tered by the ignorant against philosophers in general.", "3942": "Now, although it may be manifest that these charges arc gabbled by them, in order to gain their fees, and to earn a premium for their impudence, according to a sort of usage now univer­ sally established among pettifogging pleaders of this sort-a race who are in the habit of letting out the venom of their viperous tongues to give pain to others-still, even for my own sake, they must be briefly rebutted;", "3943": "lest I, who am exert­ ing all ray energies, that I may not appear to admit of any stain or any blemish upon my character, might seem to some, in case I should pass by any of these frivolous charges, rather to have admitted them than to have held them in contempt.", "3944": "For, according to my way of thinking, it is the part of a modest and honorable spirit to be incensed even by a false accusation;", "3945": "seeing that even those who are conscious to them­ selves of the commission of any offence, are still greatly excited and angered by reproach ;", "3946": "although from the very moment that they began to do wrong, they may have been accustomed to hear themselves ill-spoken of.", "3947": "Nay, even if silence is observed by others, they are still fully conscious that they may with justice be censured.", "3948": "On the other hand, every man who is virtuous and without guile, whose ears are utterly unused to the language of obloquy, and who, from re­ peatedly hearing himself praised, is unprepared for reproach, is the more grieved at heart on hearing those things said un­ deservedly against him, which he could with truth allege against others.", "3949": "If then, perchance, I shall appear disposed to defend myself against charges that are absurd and utterly frivolous, that circumstance ought, in fairness, to be imputed as a fault to those who are disgraced by having even uttered them against me;", "3950": "and no blame ought to attach to me, in whom it will be becoming to have refuted even such things.", "3951": "You heard, then, a short time since, at the commencement of the accusation, words to the following effect:", "3952": "\"We accuse before you a handsome philosopher, and a man of distinguished eloquence,”—oh, monstrous!—“ both in the Greek and in the Latin tongues.\"", "3953": "For, unless I am mistaken, it was in these self-same words that Tannonius Pudens, a man most certainly not of distinguished eloquence, commenced his harangue against me.", "3954": "How I wish he had good grounds for making such weighty charges against me—of being possessed of good looks and of eloquence—I should have had no difficultv in answer.", "3955": "ing him, as Paris does Hector, in Homer :", "3956": "* \"", "3957": "Man may not reject", "3958": "The glorious bounty by the Gods bestowed, Nor follows their beneficence our choice.", "3959": "\"Such would have been my answer to the charge of goo.l looks:", "3960": "and I would have told him besides, that it has been deemed allowable even for philosophers to be of graceful ap­ pearance ;", "3961": "I would have shown that Pythagoras, who was the first to call himself a philosopher, was the handsomest person of his age;", "3962": "that Zeno, of ancient times, the native of Elea, he who was the first of all, with truly critical skill, to divide speech into two departments,† that this same Zeno, too, Was, as Plato affirms, most remarkable for the graces of his person.", "3963": "I would also have told him that many other philosophers have been handed down to memory as most remarkable for the beauty of their features, and who have set off the graces of their persons by the virtues of their lives.", "3964": "This mode of defence, however, as I have already observed, but ill becomes me;", "3965": "for, whereas naturally I had but small pretensions to good looks, unremitting application to learned labours has effaced from me all comeliness, has made me thin, dried up my natural juices, expunged my healthy colour, and impaired my vigour.", "3966": "This hair, which they, with falsehood so manifest, affirmed that I had allowed to grow to such a length, in order to add to the allurements of my beauty—you see how far it is from being handsome and neatly arranged- all clogged and matted together, like a rope of twisted tow, shaggy and uneven, lumped and felted;", "3967": "its knots inextricable through prolonged neglect, not only of combing, but even of disentangling and separating it.", "3968": "The charge, then, as to my hair, which they have made as it were a capital count in the indictment, has, I fancy, been sufficiently refuted.", "3969": "And then, as to eloquence, if I had been possessed of any, it ought not to appear surprising, or a ground for envy, if, after devoting myself, with all my energies, from my earliest years up to the present moment, to the cultivation of litera­ ture alone, in contempt of all other pleasures, I had succeeded in acquiring it, after expending upon it an amount of labour, by night and by day, exceeding, probably, that employed by any other man, and at the cost of a total disregard and sacrifice of my health.", "3970": "However, let them stand in no fear of my eloquence, an accomplishment which I am rather in hopes of acquiring, than able to display at present, if, indeed, I have made any progress at all.", "3971": "And yet, if the words are true which Statius Cæcilius is said to have written in his poems, that \" Innocence is elo­ quence,\" then, on that principle, I am ready to admit, and I do boldly assert, that in eloquence I will yield the palm to no man whatever.", "3972": "For, taking this view, what man living is there more eloquent than myself, who have never so much as entertained a thought to which I did not dare give utterance ?*", "3973": "I affirm, that I am most truly eloquent, for all guiltiness I have ever esteemed as a thing not to be named;", "3974": "I affirm that I am most ready in argument, for no deed or saying of mine is there which I am not able, before all the world, by argu­ ment to support.", "3975": "For instance, I will now take up the argu­ ment with reference to the lines, which they put forward as compositions of mine, of which I ought to be ashamed ;", "3976": "when you saw me smiling at them in scorn, because they delivered them in so uncouth and illiterate a manner.", "3977": "In the first place, then, they read out of my book of jokes,* a short letter, the subject of which was dentifrices;", "3978": "this was written in verse, to one Calpurnianus, who, no doubt, when he produced that letter against me, did not perceive, in his eager­ ness to injure me, that if there was anything criminal in it, he himself was affected thereby in an equal degree with me.", "3979": "Now, that he had asked me for something to be used for the purpose of cleaning his teeth, the lines themselves bear wit­ ness- \"", "3980": "In hurried verse, I bid Calpurnian hail.", "3981": "I've sent, as you required, the dentifrice, Arabian produce, brightener of the mouth, A fine choice

acknowledge as his own composition ?", "3985": "Unless, perchance, I was deserving of reprehension for sending to Calpurnianus a powder made of Arabian drugs, seeing that he was a person who might have with much more propriety, after the filthy manner of the Ibe­ rians, \" With his own water washed his teeth and rusty gums,\" as Catullus says.", "3986": "I perceived just now some who could hardly controul his laughter, when the orator inveighed with such asperity against cleaning of the teeth, and pronounced the word \" dentifrice\" with more indignation than any body else would speak

would declare in his usual manner, that from him above all men who has any care for the art of speaking, the mouth requires more sedulous at­ tention than all the rest of the body, seeing that it is the vesti­ bule of the mind, the gateway of speech, and the outer court of the thoughts.", "3994": "At all events, according to my way of thinking, I should say that nothing so ill becomes a man who is of free birth and liberal education as inattention to the appearance of the mouth.", "3995": "For this portion of the person is elevated in position, exposed full in view, and in continual use.", "3996": "On the other hand, with wild beasts and cattle the mouth is low- seated, and brought down on a level with the legs;", "3997": "it lies close to the feet and to the grass on which they feed,

feet, or whether, if he does not deny the fact, he would contend that greater care ought to be bestowed upon the cleanliness of the feet than of the teeth ?", "4001": "If, indeed, a person, like yourself, Æmilianus, will hardly ever open his mouth except to utter calumnies and revilings, I am clearly of opinion that he ought to bestow no attention whatever on his mouth, nor to clean his teeth with powders brought from abroad, when he might much more appropriately rub them with charcoal snatched from the funeral pile;", "4002": "and that he ought not so much as to rinse them with common water.", "4003": "On the contrary, let his malignant tongue, the caterer of falsehoods and of bitter abuse, for ever lie amid the stench and foulness which so well become it.", "4004": "For how, in the name of misfortune, is it consistent with reason that one should have a clean and purified tongue, and at the same time a loath­ some and offensive voice ?", "4005": "that he should, like the viper, instil black venom from teeth white as snow ?", "4006": "On the other hand, in the case of him who knows he is going to utter language* that is neither, inappropriate nor unpleasing, it is with

Semi-Getulian;", "4258": "I do not see what I have to be ashamed of in that respect, any more than the elder Cyrus, because he was of mingled parentage, being a Semi-Median and a Semi-Persian.",

truthfully alleged against philosophers, but that nothing even can be falsely devised against them, which they would not prefer to rebut, although they could deny it, in full reliance on their innocence.", "4346": "First, then, I will meet their arguments, and will prove that they bear no relation whatever to the practice of magic;", "4347": "and, after that,.", "4348": "I will show that, even if I had been a magician of first-rate ability, still, no cause or opportunity has existed for them to detect me in any mal­ practice whatever.", "4349": "I will at the same time discuss more

of the marriage between.", "4351": "myself and Pudentilla:", "4352": "and I will show that I entered into that alliance more from a sense of duty than for gain.", "4353": "And, really, what a mighty cause of torment and uneasi­ ness has this marriage of ours.", "4354": "proved to Æmilianus!", "4355": "Hence all that anger, and rage, and absolute frenzy,, which have found a vent in the present prosecution.", "4356": "And if I shall succeed in proving all these points clearly and distinctly, then I shall call upon you, Claudius Maximus, and all you who are here present, to bear witnessthat

and his superior in character, departed this life;", "4357": "and I will show that he has been thus nefa­ riously worked upon against myself and his mother, through no fault of mine;", "4358": "and that, having forsaken the pursuits of literature, and abandoned all studies, he is likely, if we may form a judgment from the wicked plans betrayed in this accu­ sation, to turn out much more like his uncle Æmilianus than his brother Pontianus.", "4359": "I will now proceed, as I originally purposed, to all the frantic conceptions of Æmilianus here, and I will begin with that one which you heard him state at the outset as affording the strongest grounds for suspecting me of the practice of magic- the fact, I mean, that I have purchased various kinds of fish of some fishermen.", "4360": "Which, now, of these circumstances is it that is to lead to a suspicion of magic ?", "4361": "Is it the fact that fishermen have endeavoured to procure these fish for me ?", "4362": "I suppose, then, this task ought to have been entrusted to some dyers or carpenters;", "4363": "and that, on the same principle, the pur­ suit of every art ought to have changed hands, so that the carpenter should have netted fish for me, and the fisherman have planed wood.", "4364": "Or, is it that you feel satisfied that fishes must be sought for unlawful practices, because they are sought on the terms of purchase ?", "4365": "If I had wanted them to set on table, I should have tried to get them for nothing, no doubt.", "4366": "Why, then, do you not accuse me in like manner on many other points ?", "4367": "For many a time have I, for money, purchased wine, vegetables, fruit, and bread.", "4368": "Why, if you carry out this prin­ ciple, you prescribe starvation to all purveyors of dainties.", "4369": "For who will dare to make purchase of them, if it is looked upon as a matter of course, that all eatables that are procured with money are wanted, not for food, but for the purposes of magic ?", "4370": "But if there is no suspicion whatever existing, either in con­ sequence of the fact of fishermen being induced, for a sum of money, to do that which they are in the general habit of do- in-, namely, catching fish—(they have taken care, however, to summon none of these fishermen as witnesses, for the best of reasons, because none such there were )-nor yet of the fact of a price being given for a marketable commodity—(the amount of which price, however, they have taken care not to state, for fear lest, if they had named a moderate price, their story might have met with contempt, and, if an exorbitant one, it might not have been believed) ;", "4371": "if, on these points, I say, no ground for suspicion exists, then let JEmilianus answer me, on what evident grounds was he induced to make this charge of magical practices ? \"", "4372": "You endeavoured to procure some fish,\" says he.", "4373": "I do not wish to deny the fact.", "4374": "But tell me, I beg of you, is he who endeavours to procure some fish a magician ?", "4375": "For my own part, I don't think he is a bit the more so than if he were in search of hares, or boars, or fowl.", "4376": "Or is it that fishes alone are in possession of certain pro­ perties that are hidden from other people, but known to ma­ gicians ?", "4377": "If you know what this property is, then it is clear that you yourself are a magician;", "4378": "but if you do not know it, then you must, of necessity, confess that you are accusing a person of a thing about which you know nothing whatever.", "4379": "Are you, then, so unversed in all literature, Day, in all the stories of the vulgar, that you cannot so much as coin these fictions of yours with some air of probability ?", "4380": "For how should a lumpish and chilly fish, or anything that is found in the sea, be able to kindle the flames of desire ?", "4381": "But perhaps you were induced to frame this falsehood from the circum­ stance that Venus is said to have arisen from the sea.", "4382": "Take note, if you please, Tannonius Pudens, of how much you were ignorant, when you undertook to prove the practice of magic from the procuring of fish.", "4383": "Had you been a reader of Virgil, you certainly would have known that other things are usually sought for such purposes.", "4384": "For, so far as I recollect, that poet enumerates fillets of soft wool, unctuous vervain, male frank­ incense, and threads of various colours;", "4385": "besides crackling laurel, clay that hardens, and wax that liquefies, as well as some other things, which he has described in his more serious work.* “ She sprinkles round, With feign'd Avernian drops, the hallow'd ground, Culls hoary simples, found by Phœbe's light, With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of

able to read the letter of Pudentilla, because it was written in Greek.", "4394": "I will therefore just dip into one more Latin poet:", "4395": "here are the lines, which those will easily recognise

consequence of the stories so universally spread about them, some credit would have then attached to your mention of these particulars.", "4405": "But when a fish is caught, what is it good for except to be cooked and served up at table ?", "4406": "but for magic it is of no avail.", "4407": "I will state to you my reasons for thinking so.", "4408": "Many have supposed that Pythagoras was a follower of Zoroaster, and was, like him, skilled in magic, and have informed us in their writings, that when in the vicinity of Metapontum, on the shores of his own part of Italy which he had made a kind of second Greece, § he saw a seine drawn up by certain fisher- men, whereupon he purchased the chances of the haul;", "4409": "and that after he had paid the money, he immediately gave orders that the fish which had been caught should be released from the nets, and returned to the deep.", "4410": "Now, I suppose, he would not have let them go out of his hands, if he had found in them anything useful for magical purposes.", "4411": "For this man, so well versed in all learning, and so close an imitator of the ancients, remembered full well that Homer, a poet gifted with universal knowledge, had, in his writings, attributed all the power of drugs to the earth, and not to the sea;", "4412": "for when speaking of a certain enchantress, he writes thus:", "4413": "\" These drugs, so friendly to the joys of life, Bright Helen learned from Thone's imperial wife, Who swayed the sceptre, where prolific Nile With various simples clothes the fatten'd soil;", "4414": "With wholesome herbage mix'd, the direful bane Of vegetable venom taints the plain.\"*", "4415": "And so likewise in another passage:", "4416": "\" Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew, Where on th' all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew.\"t", "4417": "While, on the other hand, you will never find in his writings either that Proteus drugged his changing figure with any marine and fishy substance, or Ulysses the trench, J Bolus the bag, Helen the goblet, Circe the cup, or Venus her girdle.", "4418": "Why, you are the only people to be found in the memory of man who, forming, as it were, a kind of hodge-podge of the productions of nature, make nothing of transferring the virtues of herbs, and roots, and suckers, and pebbles from the tops of mountains to the depths of the sea, and there sewing them up in the bellies of fishes.", "4419": "Hence, just as Mercury, the con­ veyer of incantations, Venus, the charmer of the soul, Luna, the looker-on in the night, and Trivia, the mistress of the shades, used to be summoned to the ceremonies of the magi­ cians ;", "4420": "so, according to your account, henceforth Neptune, in company with Salacia, and Portumnus, and the whole throng of the Nereids, will have been transferred from the surging agi­ tations of the waves to the agitations of passionate desire.", "4421": "I have now stated why, in my opinion, there is nothing in common between magicians and fishes.", "4422": "But now, if you think proper, let us believe, Æmilianus, that fishes really are in the habit of promoting magical influences.", "4423": "Does it, then, follow, as a necessary consequence, that whoever seeks for a fish is a magician ?", "4424": "By the same rule, the person who tries to procure a light cutter is a pirate, he who looks for a crow-bar is a housebreaker, and he who seeks a sword is a cut-throat.", "4425": "Nothing of ever so harmless a nature can you mention, but may possibly be used to man's disadvantage;", "4426": "and nothing, of ever so pleasing a tendency, but may be taken in bad part.", "4427": "Yet it is not, for all that, a necessary consequence that all things should obtain an utterly bad reputation;", "4428": "as, for instance, that you should suppose that frankincense, and cassia, and myrrh, and such other aromatics, are only bought for the pur­ pose of being used at funerals, seeing that they are also used in medical preparations, and in sacrifices.", "4429": "But, according to this mode of reasoning about fish, you would suppose that the companions of Menelaiis, too, were magicians, inasmuch as the greatest of poets says that at the island of Pharos they banished hunger by using curved hooks.", "4430": "In the same class, too, you will have to place sea-gulls, dol­ phins, and cray-fish;", "4431": "and then all epicures, too, who pur­ chase largely of fishermen;", "4432": "and even the fishermen them­ selves, who, in pursuit of their calling, seek for all kinds of fish. \"", "4433":

things a man may lose his life ?", "4438": "Let us see, however, what were the different kinds of fishes which were so necessary for me to possess, and so rarely to be met with, as to deserve to be sought for on the promise of a reward.", "4439": "Three only have they named;", "4440": "in one they were mistaken, while the other two they invented.", "4441": "They were mistaken in saying thaf the fish was a sea-hare, for it was quite a different kind of fish altogether;", "4442": "one which my servant Themiso, a person by no means ignorant of the medical art, as you have heard from his own lips, brought to me quite unasked, for me to look at;", "4443": "for the fact is, that he has not even yet managed to find a sea-hare.", "4444": "Still, I am ready to admit that I have been in search of other kinds besides, and that I have given a commission not only to fishermen, but to my friends also, wherever a person meets with a fish of any unusual kind, either to describe to me the form of it, or else to show it me alive, or, if he cannot do so, dead.", "4445": "Why I have done this, I will presently proceed to inform you.", "4446": "But these accusers of mine, so extremely clever, as they fancy themselves to be, were guilty of a falsehood, when, to­ wards the end of their charge, they invented the story that I had been in search of two marine productions with indelicate names.",

make a laughing-stock of Claudius Maximus, a man of such exalted station, and to per­ secute me with your calumnious charges?", "4674": "But if, perchance, your advocate did make a slip, and if you have no.", "4675": "such boys to produce, at all events employ, fot some purpose or other, the fourteen servants whom I have brought here;", "4676": "or else why was it that you required such a large household to be brought into court ?", "4677": "Accusing me of magic, you have given me notice to produce fifteen servants.", "4678": "If you had accused me of acts of violence, how many servants, pray, would you have demanded ?", "4679": "Is it, then, that the fifteen servants know all about it, and yet it is a secret ?", "4680": "or is it no secret at all, and yet an affair of magic ?", "4681": "One of these two things you must necessarily confess;", "4682": "either that what I did was not unlawful, since I did not fear to allow so many per­ sons to be privy to it, or else that if it was unlawful, so many witnesses ought not to have been privy to it.", "4683": "This magic, from all I can learn, is a thing denounced by the laws, and from the remotest times forbidden by the Twelve Tables, in consequence of the incredible blasting of standing corn by means of incantations.", "4684": "Consequently, it is a thing no less secret in its practices than foul and abominable;", "4685": "it is gene­ rally carried on by night, hidden in deep gloom, removed from all observation, and effected by whispered spells:", "4686": "a process at which few, not to say slaves, but even free men, are allowed to be present.", "4687": "Do you want to make out that fifteen servants were present as spectators ?", "4688": "Was it a wedding, then, or some other cere­ monial, or an afternoon carousal ?", "4689": "Fifteen servants are here taking part in these magic rites, just like so many Quinde­ cemvirs,* elected for the performance of sacred duties.", "4690": "But to what end should I have employed so large a number, if the privity of but one is far more than is requisite ?", "4691": "Fifteen free men!", "4692": "why, that makes a whole borough.t", "4693": "That amount of servants !", "4694": "'tis a whole household;", "4695": "the same number, if placed in chains, would fill a whole gaol;", "4696": "t or was it that such a multitude as this was necessary to hold the victims for sacrifice ?", "4697": "But all the while you have mentioned no victims except hens.", "4698": "Or were they required to count the grains of frankincense t or to knock down Thallus ?", "4699": "You stated, besides, that a free-born woman had been brought to my house, afflicted with the same malady as Thallus;", "4700": "that I promised to cure her, and that she, too, fell to the ground enchanted by me.", "4701": "So far as I can see, you have come here to charge me with being a wrestler, and not a magician, seeing that you assert in this fashion that all who have come near me have been levelled with the ground.", "4702": "How­ ever, upon being questioned by you, Maximus, Themiso, the doctor, by whom the woman was brought for me to examine, denied that anything whatever happened to her, except that I put the question, whether there was a ringing in her ears, and if so, in which of them in the greatest degree?", "4703": "upon which she made answer, that her right ear was very much dis­ turbed by it, and immediately after took her departure.", "4704": "And here, Maximus, although at the present moment I am careful to refrain from praising you, that I may not appear to flatter you with a view to this trial, still I cannot forbear from praising your acuteness in cross-examination.", "4705": "For just now, when these matters were discussed, and they asserted that the woman was enchanted, whilst the doctor, who was present, denied it, you very sagaciously enquired, what I was to gain by thus bewitching her;", "4706": "on which they answered, that the woman should fall to the ground. \"", "4707": "Well, what then?\" you asked, \" did she die ?\"", "4708": "They said no. \" How then,\" say you, \" what advantage would it have been to Apuleius if she fell?\"", "4709": "For to this effect did you fairly and perseveringly put the question to them as many as three several times, be­ cause you well knew that the motives for all actions ought most carefully to be enquired into, and that often, when facts are admitted, the causes of them become subjects for enquiry;", "4710": "and you were aware that for this very reason the advocates of persons engaged in suits at law have the name given to them of \" causidici,\" because it is their province to explain the causes for which each thing has been done.", "4711": "But, on the other hand, to deny that a thing has been done is an easy matter, and needs the services of no advocate whatever;", "4712": "while to show that it has been done rightfully or wrongfully is a most arduous and difficult task.", "4713": "It is useless, then, to enquire whether a thing has been done, which has had no evil cause to prompt its being done.", "4714": "Hence it is, that he who is accused before a conscientious judge of having done a thing, is free from all fears of enquiry, if he has had no reason for doing what was wrong.", "4715": "Now, since they have neither proved that the woman was enchanted, nor yet that she was thrown to the ground, and as I do not deny that, at the request of a medical man, she was examined by me, I will tell you, Maximus, why I did make the enquiry about the ringing in the ears ;", "4716": "and I shall do so, not so much for the sake of exculpating myself in this affair, which you have already pronounced to have nothing in it of faultiness or criminality, as because I would not wish to be silent on any matter that is suited to your ears and your learn­ ing.", "4717": "I will state it, then, as succinctly as possible, seeing that you are to be put in mind only, not instructed by me.", "4718": "The philosopher Plato, in that most celebrated dialogue of his, entitled \" Timæus,\" after having, with a sort of celestial eloquence, explained the structure of the entire universe, most ingeniously discussed the threefold powers of our mind, and aptly shown why our several parts were formed by the Divine Providence, proceeds to range the causes of all maladies under three heads.", "4719": "The first cause he attributes to the elements of our bodies, in cases where the qualities of those elements, being the moist and the cold, and the two qualities that are their opposites, do not agree the one with the other;", "4720": "and this takes place when any one of them has exceeded its limits, or has shifted from its proper locality.", "4721": "The next cause of maladies exists in the corruption of those parts which are formed by a coalition of simple elements, united so as to form a single sub­ stance ;", "4722": "these are, for instance, blood, flesh, bones, and marrow;", "4723": "and then those parts, which are formed from a mixture of these several substances.", "4724": "In the third place, there are in the body collections of various coloured bile, and of restless and flatulent wind, and gross humours, all which are most frequent causes of diseases.", "4725": "In the number of these last is especially to be found the primary cause of the falling-sickness, about which I purposed to speak.", "4726": "For the flesh, through a noxious degree of heat, sometimes deliquesces into a moist state, that is, dense and cloggy, and a certain flatulency rises therefrom, in consequence of the heat of the compressed air, and a corrupt matter of whitish and frothy appearance flows from it.", "4727": "Now, this cor rupt matter, if it can find a vent to ooze forth from the body, is ejected with more unseemliness than danger.", "4728": "For it marks the exterior of the skin with leprosy, and variegates it with all kinds of spots;", "4729": "the person, however, to whom this happens is never afterwards attacked by epilepsy;", "4730": "and thus it is that a most afflicting malady of the mind is compensated by a slight disfigurement of the body.", "4731": "But, on the other hand, if these pernicious secretions are held in check, and become united with the black bile, these, raging at large, penetrate through all the vessels;", "4732": "and when they have done this, making their way towards the crown of the head, they mingle their destructive humours with the brain;", "4733": "and instantly affect that regal portion of the under­ standing which, all-important as it is in the reasoning facul­ ties, has fixed its seat in the head of man as its citadel and its palace.", "4734": "For its divers passages and its paths that lead to wis­ dom, these humours clog up and overwhelm;", "4735": "this, however, they do with less work during the hours of sleep, as at such times the patient, being filled with food and drink, only suffers from a slight attack of impeded respiration, which is a symptom of epilepsy.", "4736": "But if the humours increase to such a degree as even to attack the head while the patient is awake, then, a cloud suddenly comes across the spirit, he becomes torpid, the breath ceases, and the body falls to the ground, like that of a dead person.", "4737": "This our forefathers styled, not only the \"major\" and the \" comitial,\" but also the \" divine\" disease;", "4738": "just as the Greeks, with good reason, have styled it ίερα νοσὸς, inasmuch as it attacks especially the reasoning parts of the mind, which are by far its most holy portion.", "4739": "You see, then, Maximus, what is the theory of Plato, which I have explained as perspicuously as I could, considering the time allowed me;", "4740": "and as I believe with him, that the Divine disease [or epilepsy] proceeds from these bad humours mounting to the head, it is clear I had good reason to make the enquiry, did this woman's head ache, was her neck torpid and stiff, and was there a throbbing in her temples, and a tingling in her ears ?", "4741": "And, what is still more, inasmuch as she admitted that she had a repeated ring­ ing in the right ear, that was a clear sign that the malady had taken a deep root.", "4742": "For as the right side of the body is the strongest, the less hope of recovery is there left, when even that gives way to disease.", "4743": "Aristotle has also left it written in his Problems, that, in the case especially of those who are epileptic, and are attacked by the disease on the right side, the cure will be most difficult.", "4744": "It would take a long time if I were to repeat the opinions stated by Theophrastus also with reference to the same malady;", "4745": "but there is in existence an excellent book of his, written on the subject of epilepsy.", "4746": "Persons afflicted with this disease, are told in another book which he has written IOn animals that envy,\" that the sloughs- of newts (which those animals, like the rest of the serpent tribe, cast aside at stated periods, like a sort of old age,) are very useful as a remedy ;", "4747": "but if you do not quickly take them' away, these animals will instantly turn round and devour them, whether it is that they act through a malignant pre­ sage [of their possible usefulness], or through a natural appetite.", "4748": "These matters I have mentioned, and have been careful to name both the points discussed and the books written by these celebrated philosophers, while, at the same time, I have not thought of giving any of the physicians or poets, in order that these people may cease to wonder, if philosophers, by the aid of those studies which are peculiar to themselves, gain some knowledge of the causes and remedies of diseases.", "4749": "Ad. mitted, then, that an afflicted woman was brought to me to examine for the purpose of effecting a cure, and that, by the;", "4750": "confession of the medical man who brought her, I acted rightly, then I think, they must either come to the conclusion that it is the part of a magician, and of a man guilty of malpractices, to heal diseases, or else, if they do not dare to make such an assertion, they must confess that, in the case of the boy and the woman afflicted with epilepsy, they have uttered frivolous and abortive calumnies.", "4751": "Nay, if you wish to hear the truth, Æmilianus, you yourself are much afflicted with the falling-sickness, having fallen flat so often in attempts to calumniate me.", "4752": "For it is not a more grievous thing to fail in body than in spirit, to be found giving way rather in the feet than in the mind, and to be defiled with spittle in a private chamber, than to be execrated in this most illustrious assembly.", "4753": "However, you fancy, perhaps, that you are sane in mind, because you are not confined at home, but follow your mad fit just where it may chance to lead you.", "4754": "Still, if you compare your own madness with that of Thallus, you will find that there is no such great difference between them, except that Thallus attacks himself, while you go so far as to attack others.", "4755": "Besides,", "4756": "Thallus distorts his eyes, you the truth;", "4757": "Thallus screws his hands, you your advocates;", "4758": "Thallus falls flat on the pavement, you before the tribunal.", "4759": "In fine, whatever he does, he does through infirmity;", "4760": "he offends in ignorance, while you, wretched man, knowingly and advi­ sedly, are guilty.", "4761": "So extreme is the violence of the disease that holds its sway over you, that you accuse me of what is false as though it were the truth;", "4762": "a thing that was never done, you charge me with doing;", "4763": "one whom you know, beyond a doubt, to be innocent, you still accuse as though he were guilty.", "4764": "I have omitted, besides, to say that there are some things of which you con­ fess yourself ignorant, and yet persist in charging me with, just as though you were fully acquainted with them.", "4765": "For you assert that I kept something wrapped up in a napkin in the same room with the Lares of Pontianus.", "4766": "What these things were, thus wrapped up, and what was their nature, you con­ fess you know not, and you admit there is no one who has seen them;", "4767": "and yet, at the same time, you assert that they were appliances of magic..", "4768": "Let no one flatter you, AEmilianus.", "4769": "This is no proof of your skill in framing an accusation, nor of your effrontery even;", "4770": "so don't you suppose that it is.", "4771": "What is it then ?", "4772": "It is the unhappy frenzy of an embittered spirit, the wretched insanity of a soured old age.", "4773": "For, almost in these very words did you plead before a judge so distinguished for his gravity and his shrewdness:", "4774": "\" Apuleius kept certain articles wrapped up in a linen cloth in the same room with the Lares of Pon­ tianus.", "4775": "As I do not know what these articles were, I assert that they were for magical purposes ;", "4776": "believe me, therefore, in what I assert, because I am asserting what I know no­ thing about.\"", "4777": "An excellent argument, and one that so con­ vincingly proves my guilt!", "4778": "\" Such and such it was, because I know not what it was.\"",

folly!", "4781": "While, on the one hand, the ablest and most sagacious of philosophers have asserted that we must not so much as place confidence in those things even which we see ;", "4782": "you, on the other hand, go so far as to assert the existence of things that you have never so much as seen or heard of.", "4783": "If Pontianus were alive, and you were to ask him what was within that cover, he would tell you he did not know.", "4784": "The freed man, too, who has kept the keys of that place up to this very day, and is one of your supporters, declares that he never looked into it, although, as being the keeper of the books which were put away there, he opened and shut the place nearly every day.", "4785": "Many a time has he gone into the room with me, and much more frequently alone, and has seen a linen cloth lying upon the table, without any seal, without any fastening upon it.", "4786": "And why so ?", "4787": "Magical imple­ ments were concealed in it--that was the reason why I kept them in such a careless manner.", "4788": "Still more, I needlessly exposed them for him to pry into and examine, and even, if he had thought fit, to take them away;", "4789": "I entrusted them to the care of another person, I left them at the mercy of another.", "4790": "What, then, is it that you now want to be believed ?", "4791": "That a thing about which Pontianus, who lived on terms of inse­ parable intimacy with me, knew nothing at all, you are fully acquainted with, you, whom, before I met you in this court of justice, I never in my life set eyes upon ?", "4792": "Or is it that, when a freedman was there at all times and seasons, and had every opportunity of examining, you, who never went there, saw a thing which that same freedman never saw?", "4793": "In short, do you wish it to be believed that a thing which you never saw, is just what you affirm it to have been ?", "4794": "But, you blockhead, if you, this very day, had gained possession of that same nap- in, whatever you might have produced therefrom, I could have denied that it was ever employed for magical purposes.", "4795": "However, I give you full permission ;", "4796": "invent whatever you please, plan, devise anything that may possibly appear appli­ cable to magical practices, I could still dispute the question with you ;", "4797": "I could either say that it had been surreptitiously placed there, or that it was employed as a remedy, or that it had been entrusted to me for the performance of sacred rites, or had been recommended to me in a dream.", "4798": "There are a thousand other means by which I could, after the most ordi­ nary methods in use, truthfully rebut your assertions.", "4799": "Now, this is what you require, that the very thing which, if made known and discovered, would not prejudice me before an up­ right judge, may, while it remains undiscovered and un­ known, lead to my condemnation, upon an idle suspicion.", "4800": "I don't know whether you will again say, as usual with you,—\"What was it, then, that you kept covered up with a linen cloth, and so carefully put away in the same room with the Lares ?\"", "4801": "Is it so,

up, and kept there;", "4818": "all these things, by the same line of reasoning, will be said to be of a magical nature, or else will have to be transferred from the store-room to the forum, and into a court of justice.", "4819": "For my own part, Maximus, I could discuss at very considerable length the value to be set upon such points as these, what their character is, how large a field for calumnious charges is opened by this course adopted by Æmilianus, and what an enormous amount of trouble* and vexation has been caused to innocent persons by this one single napkin.", "4820": "I will do, however, as I originally purposed, even where there is no necessity that I should do so;", "4821": "I will give him the benefit of an admission, and, as I have been interro­ gated by Æmilianus, I will give him an answer.", "4822": "You ask, Æmilianus, what it was I had in the napkin.", "4823": "Now, although I might utterly deny that any napkin belong- in- to me was ever placed in the library of Pontianus, I will grant, by all means, that such was the case, as it still remains in my power to say, that nothing whatever was wrapped up in that napkin.", "4824": "And if I do say so, by the testi­ mony of no one, by no proof can I be refuted.", "4825": "For there is not a person who ever touched it, and only a single freed man, according to your own story, who saw it.", "4826": "Still I tell you, so far as I am concerned, I am quite ready to admit that it was stuffed full of something ;", "4827": "think so, if you like, just as in days of yore the companions of Ulysses fancied that they had found a treasure when they fingered the leather bag that was blown out with the winds.", "4828": "t", "4829": "Would you like me to tell you what the things were, thus wrapped up in the napkin which I entrusted to the charge of the Lares of Pontianus ?", "4830": "You shall be indulged.", "4831": "I have been initiated into most of the sacred rites of Greece.", "4832": "Certain of

members of the college of that single God, father Bacchus, who are here present, you, I say, know full well what it is you keep so carefully trea­ sured up at home, and what it is that, after excluding the uninitiated, you venerate in silence.", "4835": "Well, then, I, as I was saying, in my eagerness for truth and in performance of my duty towards the Gods, have become acquainted with mani­ fold rites, usages, and ceremonials.", "4836": "I do not invent this to suit the present occasion;", "4837": "for nearly three years since, when, at the very earliest period after my arrival at Oea, I was de­ livering a public lecture on the majestic attributes of AEscu­ lapius, I mentioned the very same thing with reference to my­ self, and reckoned up the number of sacred mysteries with which I was acquainted.", "4838": "That lecture of mine is very well known;", "4839": "every body reads it;", "4840": "it is in the hands of all;", "4841": "being recommended to the religious of Oëa,

"4850": "Can it, then, seem wonderful to any man who has any thought or regard whatever for religion, that a person who has been initiated into so many sacred mysteries of the Gods, keeps in his house certain tokens connected with those sacred rites, and that he wraps them up in woven linen, a substance that forms.", "4851": "the purest of all coverings for things of a holy nature?", "4852": "For wool, being an excrement of a most inert body, and taken from an animal's back, has ever been held to be an im­ pure covering, in conformity with the dicta of Orpheus and Pythagoras;", "4853": "while, on the other hand, flax, the purest pro­ duction of the earth, and one that springs up from the ground among the choicest of its fruits, is employed by the most holy of the priests of the Egyptians, not only for their dress, but also for the purpose of covering things of a sacred nature.", "4854": "Still, I am quite aware that there are some, and Æmilianus here especially, who make a joke of sacred matters, and laugh them to scorn.", "4855": "For, from what I can learn from some of the people of Oëa, who are acquainted with him, up to this pre.", "4856": "sent advanced period of life, he has offered his supplications to no deity, crossed the threshold of no temple.", "4857": "If he chances to pass by any holy place, he holds it an abomination to move his hand to his lips for the purpose of shewing venera­ tion.", "4858": "Not even to the Gods of husbandry, who feed him and clothe him, does this man offer any first-fruits of his crops, or his vines, or his flocks:", "4859": "no shrine is there built on his estate, no consecrated spot or grove is there to be found.", "4860": "But why do I talk about groves and shrines ?", "4861": "Those who have been there, declare that they never so much as saw a single anointed stone within the boundaries of his estate, or one branch crowned with garlands.", "4862": "Hence it is, that two nicknames have been given him, Charon, as I have mentioned already, in consequence of the unseemliness of his features and his dis­ position ;", "4863": "and another, which he likes better, and which is given him on account of his contempt for the Gods, namely, that of Mezentius.*", "4864": "For this reason, I can very easily un­ derstand that these initiations into so many sacred rites will appear to him to be mere nonsense;", "4865": "and perhaps, in his con­ tempt for things divine, he will persuade himself not to be­ lieve me, when I say that I most religiously preserve these tokens and reminiscences of so many sacred ceremonials.", "4866": "But what Mezentius may choose to think of me, not one snap of a finger do I care.", "4867": "To the rest, however, who are around me, in my loudest voice I give notice, that if any one happens to be present who has been initiated into the samt rites as myself, if he will give me the sign, he shall then be at liberty to hear what it is I keep with such care.", "4868": "For, so far as I am concerned, by no peril will I ever be compelled to dis­ close to the uninitiated the things that I have had entrusted to me on condition of silence.", "4869": "I have now then, Maximus, to my thinking, fully satisfied the mind of any man, even the most unreasonable;", "4870": "and, so far as the napkin is concerned, have wiped away every stain of suspicion;", "4871": "and I believe I may now pass on in perfect security from the suspicions of Æmili­ anus to the testimony of Crassus, which, next to the preceding matters, they adduced as of the greatest importance.", "4872": "You heard read in the information, the testimony of a cer- tain glutton and desperate debauchee, Junius Crassus by name, who stated that I had been in the habit of performing sacred rites at night in his house, together with my friend Appius Quintianus, who had paid a sum for the hire of that house.", "4873": "This Crassus affirms, too, that although at that very time he.", "4874": "was at Alexandria, he still knows this for a fact, from the smoke left by the torches and from the feathers of birds which were found there.", "4875": "I suppose he means to say, that while he was celebrating his orgies at Alexandria, (for this, you must know, is that same Crassus who delights to creep at midday into his dens of brothels,) he caught, amid the steams of the kitchen, the feathers that had been wafted thither all the way from his abode, and that he recognized the smoke of his own house, as it curled afar from his paternal roof.", "4876": "If he really did manage to see it with his eyes, he certainly is blessed with a power of sight that far transcends the wishes and as­ pirations of Ulysses himself.", "4877": "Ulysses, for many a year, looked out in the distance from the sea-shore, and longed in vain to espy the smoke as it ascended from his native land.*", "4878": "Crassus, in the few months during which he was absent, without the slightest trouble, espied that smoke while seated in a wine- shop.", "4879": "And if, too, he managed to snuff up with his nostrils the fumes that arose from his house, why, then, he outdoes even dogs and vultures in the keenness of his scent.", "4880": "For by what dog, by what vulture, under the Alexandrian sky, can any­ thing possibly be smelt all the way from the confines of Oea ?", "4881": "No doubt this Crassus is an inordinate glutton, and far from unskilled in all kinds of fumes;", "4882": "but really, considering his fondness for drinking, the only thing for which he has become distinguished, it would be much more easy for the fumes of wine, than the smell of smoke to reach him at Alexandria.", "4883": "Even he himself was sensible that this would not be easily be­ lieved.", "4884": "For the report is, that before the second hour of the day, with an empty stomach, and before he had taken a drop of wine, he made sale of this same testimony of his;", "4885": "upon which, he wrote down that he had made this discovery in the follow­ ing manner.", "4886": "Upon his return from Alexandria, he straightway repaired to his own house, which Quintianus had just quitted:", "4887": "in the vestibule of it he found a great many feathers of birds, and perceived that the walls were black with soot.", "4888": "On enquiring of his servant, whom he had left at Oëa, what was the reason of this, the servant informed him of the nocturnal rites cole.", "4889": "brated by me and Quintianus.", "4890": "How very cleverly invented !", "4891": "What a very likely story, that, if I had wanted to do anything of that kind, I should not have done it at my own house in preference.", "4892": "That Quintianus here, who is now standing by me, (whose name, in consideration of the strictest ties of friendship which exist between him and me, of his extraordi­ nary learning and his most consummate eloquence, I here men­ tion for the purpose of honouring and extolling him,) that this same Quintianus, I say, if he was going to have any fowls for his dinner, or if, as they say, he required them to be killed for magical purposes, could find no servant to pluck the feathers and throw them away!", "4893": "Moreover, that the smoke was in such volumes, that it quite blackened the walls!", "4894": "and that Quin­ tianus was willing to put up with this dirty appearance in his room, all the time that he was residing there !", "4895": "You make no answer to this, Æmilianus;", "4896": "it is not likely you would;", "4897": "but perhaps Crassus, on his return, did not direct his steps to the chamber, but, consistently with his usual prac­ tice, made straight for the kitchen-stove.", "4898": "But on what ground did the servant of Crassus form this suspicion of his, that the walls got blackened in the night time precisely ?", "4899": "or why, that it was smoke with which they were discoloured ?", "4900": "It is, I sup­ pose, because smoke that escapes by night, is blacker than the smoke of the daytime, and so differs from it in its effect!", "4901": "And then, why should a servant, so full of his suspicions, and so notable a person, allow Quintianus to leave, without having the house cleaned out?", "4902": "Why did those feathers, just like so many lumps of lead, lie there all that time, even till Crassus had returned ?", "4903": "Ought not Crassus to scold his servant for this ?", "4904": "No, he has preferred to trump up this falsehood about the soot and the feathers, because, even in giving his evidence, he can­ not tear himself from the kitchen.", "4905": "And then, why did you read his evidence from the record ?", "4906": "Where is Crassus himself?", "4907": "Has he got tired of his house, and returned to Alexandria ?", "4908": "Is he busily engaged in cleaning down those walls of his ?", "4909": "Or, what is much more likely, is that gormandizer at this moment laid up with a fit of in-- digestion?", "4910": "For I, my own self, AEmilianus, saw him no longer ago than yesterday, here at Sabrata,* publicly enough, hiccupping away to you, in the middle of the market-place.", "4911": "Make enquiry then, Maximus, of your clerks of court, although, no doubt, he is better known to cookshop-keepers than to clerks of court;", "4912": "still, ask them, I say, whether they have seen here Junius Crassus, a native of Oea ;", "4913": "they will not say no.", "4914": "There­ fore, let AEmilianus bring before us this most worthy youth, in whose testimony he places such confidence.", "4915": "You see what time of the day it is.", "4916": "I am ready to affirm, that long before this hour, Crassus has been snoring away dead drunk, or else, that he is at this moment taking his second bath, and sweat­ ing off his wine, that he may be ready for a second drinking bout after dinner.", "4917": "This fellow, though he is quite close at hand, speaks through the record :", "4918": "not but that he is so utterly void of shame, that if even he were in your presence, he would lie, without changing colour in the slightest;", "4919": "but very prp- bably, from his drunken habits, he has not been able to exer­ cise even such a slight degree of control over himself, as to keep sober and await this hour.", "4920": "Or else it is, that Æmilianus has done this designedly, in order that he might not have to place him before such scrutinizing eyes as yours;", "4921": "his object being that you might not, from his appearance, form a bad opinion of the brute, with his lank jaws, and his sinister aspect;", "4922": "when you saw his head despoiled of beard and hair, though he is still a young man, his eyes distilling rheum, his eyelids swollen, his lips bedewed with slaver, his voice quite cracked, his hands shaking, as he grinst and belches by turns.", "4923": "All his patrimony he has long ago devoured, and nothing of his family possessions is there now left, except one solitary house, for the purpose of affording him an opportunity of making sale of his false evidence;", "4924": "and which he has never let at a more remunerating rate, than in affording this bit of testimony.", "4925": "For this drunken fabrication of his, he has bartered to JEmilianus for three thousand pieces of money, a fact of which there is not a person in Oea who is ignorant.", "4926": "Before the bar­ gain was concluded, we all knew of it, and by giving timely information, I might have put a stop to it, if I had not been well aware that so silly a lie would do far more harm to JEmi­ lianus, who was making purchase of it to no purpose, than to myself, who could well afford to hold it in contempt.", "4927": "I was willing that Æmilianus should have to suffer a loss, and that Crassus should be exposed for the disgraceful character of his evidence.", "4928": "Why, it is no longer ago than the day before yesterday, that, without the slightest attempt at concealment, the transaction was concluded, at the house of one Rufinus, of whom I shall just now have to make mention, the said Rufinus and Calpur­ nianus acting as the go-betweens and promoters of the trans­ action.", "4929": "And this part Rufinus was the more ready to act, because he felt very sure that Crassus would bring by no means the smallest part of his bribe to his own wife, at whose intrigues he purposely connives.", "4930": "I perceived you too, Maxi­ mus, the very moment that the information was produced, showing, by your looks, that you regarded the whole matter with contempt;", "4931": "for, with your usual wisdom, you suspected their plot, and saw that it was a conspiracy got up against me.", "4932": "And yet, after all, possessed though they are of unbridled auda­ city and insolent effrontery, not even they have dared to read through the evidence of Crassus, for they saw that it stunk in your nostrils, nor have they ventured to place any reliance upon it.", "4933": "INow this is why I have mentioned these things, not that with you for my judge, I was frightened by their feathers and their smoke stains, but that Crassus might not escape unpu­ nished for his offence in selling smoke* to a country clown like Æmilianus.", "4934": "Then there was a charge made by them, when they read the letters of Pudentilla.", "4935": "It was about a certain little image, which they say I ordered to be secretly made, of the most costly wood, for purposes of magic.", "4936": "They assert, too, that, although it was the figure of a skeleton, something quite shocking and horrible, I was in the habit of paying the greatest veneration to it, and calling it by the Greek name of βασιλευς, or \" king.\"", "4937": "If I am not mistaken, I am following their steps in regular order, and unravelling the whole tex­ ture of their calumnies piecemeal.", "4938": "How can the fabrication of the image have possibly been secret, as you allege, when you know so well who was the maker of it, that you have given him notice to appear ?", "4939": "Look, here is Cornelius Saturninus, the carver, a man praised among his fellow-citizens for his skill and esteemed for his character;", "4940": "the same person, Maximus, who, a short time since, when you carefully enquired into all the circumstances of the transaction, recounted them with the strictest fidelity and veracity.", "4941": "He stated that, after I had seen at his house a number of geometrical figures made of box- wood, in a very clever and workmanlike manner, I was induced by his skill to request him to make for me some mechanical implements, and at the same time gave him a commission to carve for me the figure of any god he might think fit, and out of any material, so long as it was wood, that I might address my prayers to it, after my usual practice.", "4942": "Accordingly, he tried boxwood first.", "4943": "He also stated that, in the meantime, while I was in the country, my son-in-law, Sicinius Pontianus, who made it his study how to gratify me, having obtained from a most respectable lady, Capitolina by name, some boxes made of ebony, brought them to him, and requested him to make the implements of that material in preference, as being rarer and more durable;", "4944": "remarking that I should be especially gratified by such a present.", "4945": "In conformity with my son-in-law's request, he made the articles, as far as the wood of the boxes sufficed, and was able to complete besides a small figure of Mercury, by putting the layers of ivory piece by piece one upon another, in order to give it the requisite thickness.", "4946": "As I say, all these particulars you heard from him:", "4947": "added to which, on examining the son of Capitolina, a most worthy young man, who is now present, you were told to the same effect;", "4948": "how that Pontianus asked for the boxes, and how that Pontianus took them to the artist, Saturninus.", "4949": "The fact, too, is not denied, that Pontianus received the image when completed from Saturninus, and afterwards made a present of it to me.", "4950": "All these matters being clearly and distinctly proved, what remains after aH this, in which any ground for suspicion of magical practices can lurk ?", "4951": "Or rather, what is there in the whole matter that does not convict you of a manifest lie ?", "4952": "You declared that the image was made secretly, while the fact is, that Pontianus, an illustrious knight, had it made ;", "4953": "and that Saturninus, a man of respectability and of high character among his fellow-citizens, seated in his own workshop, carved it openly and without concealment;", "4954": "while a lady of the highest reputation aided the work by the present she made ;", "4955": "num­ bers, too, both of my own servants and of my friends, who were in the habit of visiting me, knew that it was about to be made, and that it was made.", "4956": "Were you not ashamed to invent such a lie, and to assert that I had gone all the city over in search of the wood, and that I had taken the greatest trouble in so doing, whereas you knew full well that at that very time I was absent, and had given orders, as was fully proved, that it was to be made of any kind of material ?", "4957": "Your third lie was, that the figure was made to resemble a frightful corpse, all lean, or rather fleshless, quite horrible and spectre-like.", "4958": "Now, if you were aware of the existence of such an evident proof of magic, why did you not give me notice to produce it ?", "4959": "Was it that you might be at liberty to lie as you pleased about a thing that was not be­ fore the court ?", "4960": "Thanks, however, to a certain habit of mine, you cannot make this falsehood pass.", "4961": "For it is my custom, wherever I go, to carry with me the image of some god or other stowed away among my books, and to address my prayers to it on festive days, together with offerings of frankincense and wine, and sometimes victims.", "4962": "Accordingly, when I heard just now that most impudent fabrication of yours about a ske­ leton, I requested a person to go, post haste, and fetch from my lodgings the little image of Mercury which Saturninus had made for me at Oëa.", "4963": "Come, let them see it;", "4964": "handle it, examine it.", "4965": "There it is before you—the thing that this scoundrel has called a ske­ leton.", "4966": "Do you not hear the expressions of displeasure so loudly uttered by all present ?", "4967": "Do you not hear their con­ demnation of your falsehood ?", "4968": "Are you not at last utterly ashamed of so many calumnious charges ?", "4969": "Is this a skeleton?", "4970": "Is this the figure of a spectre ?", "4971": "Is this a thing that you will persist in calling a demon ?", "4972": "Is this an image adapted to ma gical practices, or is it one of the usual and ordinary kind ?", "4973": "Take it, pray, Maximus, and look at it:", "4974": "to hands so pure and so holy as yours a sacred thing is well entrusted.", "4975": "There, now, just look at it;", "4976": "how beauteous its figure, and how replete with stalwart vigour;", "4977": "how smiling are the features of the god;", "4978": "how becomingly does the first growth of down overspread the cheeks, and how gracefully do the crisped locks peep forth upon the head from beneath the shelving brim of the cap!", "4979": "How charmingly do the wings shoot forth above his temples !", "4980": "How smartly, too, is the garment laid down in plaits about the shoulders !", "4981": "Any one who dares to call this a skeleton, it is clear that he never sees an image of the Gods;", "4982": "or if he does, he passes them all in heedless contempt.", "4983": "Any one who takes this to be the figure of a spectre, is a spectre-stricken being himself.", "4984": "In return, Æmilianus, for this lie of yours, may this Di­ vinity, who visits the Deities above and the shades below, bring upon you the enmity of the Gods who dwell in either realm, and may he thrust upon your vision phantoms of the dead, all the shades of hell, all the Lemurs, all the Manes, all the hobgoblins, all the apparitions of the night, all the spectres of the sepulchres, all the terrors of the tombs-from making a more intimate acquaintance with which, you are not very far distant, both in age and in deserts.", "4985": "But as for us, the dis­ ciples of Plato, of nothing do we .know, except that which is festive and joyous, consistent with propriety, divine and heavenly.", "4986": "Nay, more, in its aspirations for what is exalted, this sect has even explored things loftier than the very heavens, and has taken up its abode on the convex side* of the firma­ ment.", "4987": "Maximus knows that I speak the truth, for he has attentively read in the Phædrus of \" the place\" which Plato mentions as \"being above the heavens, and upon the back thereof.\"", "4988": "Maximus, too, understands full well (to answer you in relation to the namet) who it is that was called first of all, not by me but by Plato, by the title of \" Basileus,\" the first cause, and reason, and primitive origin of universal nature, the supreme father of the mind, the eternal preserver of ani­ mated beings, the ever-watchful artificer of his universe.", "4989": "And, indeed, he is an artificer who knows not labour, a preserver devoid of anxiety, a father without generation, one compre- hended by no space, by no time, by no name, and therefore to be conceived by few, to be expressed by none.", "4990": "See, then, I volunteer to add to your suspicions of my magical pursuits.", "4991": "I do not answer you, Æmilianus, as to who it is I worship under the name of \" Basileus.\"", "4992": "Nay, more, even if the proconsul himself were to ask me who my God is, I should be silent.", "4993": "With reference to the name, for the present I have said enough;", "4994": "as for the rest, I am not unaware that some who stand around me are anxious to hear why I wished the image to be made not of silver or gold, but of wood especially;", "4995": "and this I be­ lieve they desire to know, not so much for the purpose of en­ suring my acquittal as of gaining information, so that they may have their minds set at ease even upon this little matter, when they have seen every ground for suspicion abundantly confuted.", "4996": "Listen, then, you who wish to know;", "4997": "listen with the closest attention, as though you heard the very words of the sage Plato, which are found in his last book, \"On the Laws.\"", "4998": "\"It is right that a moderate man should present offerings in mo­ deration to the Gods.", "4999": "But as the earth, like the domestic hearth, is sacred to all the Gods, let no one dedicate that a second time to the Gods.\"", "5000": "He gives this prohibition in order that no private person may presume to erect a temple on his own property.", "5001": "For he thinks that public temples are sum- cient for the citizens for the purpose of immolating victims.", "5002": "He then subjoins, \" For gold and silver, both in other cities and in our own, employed in temples, is an odious thing.", "5003": "Ivory, too, as proceeding from a body deprived of life, is not a becoming offering.", "5004": "Again, iron and copper are instruments of warfare.", "5005": "But of wood, let each person consecrate as much as he pleases, so long as it is of a single kind, and the same as to stone, in the temples that are common to all.", "5006": "\"The expressions of assent on all sides, and yours especially who sit here in judgment, show that I have most fortunately employed Plato not only as the guide of my life, but as my ad­ vocate in this trial, whose directions you see me so ready to obey.", "5007": "It is now time* to turn to the letters of Pudentilla, or, in- deed, to go a little further back, and retrace all these events, in order that it may be palpable to all, that if I, who, they persist in saying, effected an entrance into the house of Puden­ tilla from motives of cupidity, had thought of any thing like gain, I ought rather to have always shunned that house, and an alliance that in other respects has turned out for me so far from fortunate.", "5008": "It is one, indeed, that would have proved disastrous to me, had it not been that my wife in herself, by her many virtues, makes ample amends for disadvantages so numerous ;", "5009": "for really nothing can you find but disappointed envy as the prompter of this accusation, and the source of many previous perils to which I have been exposed.", "5010": "But why, even if he really had found me to be a magician, should AEmilianus have been moved to indignation, when not only has he never been injured by any act, but not by the slightest word even of mine, so as to give him a pretext for taking umbrage and entertaining a desire for revenge ?", "5011": "Nor yet is it for the sake of renown that he accuses me;", "5012": "the ruling motive when M.

pleading causes an aged man with one foot in the grave;", "5022": "unless it is, perchance, that AEmilianus, in ac­ cordance with nis severity of manners, has wished to set an example, and from the very hostility that he entertains to vice itself, has, in conformity with the unblemished character of his morals, taken upon himself to make this charge.", "5023": "But this I could hardly have believed even of Æmilianus, not this African one, but him who was called Africanus* Numantinus, and who had held, too, the office of censor;", "5024": "much less can I entertain the notion that in this stick here there is any hatred of crimes, or even so much as a comprehension of what they are.", "5025": "What is the reason, then ?", "5026": "To any one it is as clear as day that it is nothing else but envy that has instigated him and his prompter, Herennius Rufinus (of whom I shall have to speak presently), and the rest of my enemies, to frame these calumnious charges of magical practices.", "5027": "There are five points, then, which it is incumbent upon me to discuss ;", "5028": "for so many, if I remember aright, have they objected against me in relation to Pudentilla.", "5029": "Now, the first point is, their assertion that after her first husband's decease she would never have married again, had she not been forced by my incantations;", "5030": "the second concerns her letters, which they consider to be an admission of magical practices;", "5031": "then, in the third and fourth places, they have made the objection that in the sixtieth year of her age she was married to gratify lustful propensities, and that the marriage contract was signed not in town, but at her country house.", "5032": "The last and the most odious charge is that which bears reference to her fortune.", "5033": "Into that they have with all their might discharged their whole venom;", "5034": "upon that point they were most especially anxious, and this is what they have alleged;",

will prove to be so false, so worthless, so unfounded, and will so easily and beyond all question refute them, that truly, Maximus, and you councillors, I do very much fear you will think that the accuser has been engaged and suborned by me, to give me an opportunity publicly to extinguish the rancor­ ous hatred with which I have been pursued.", "5037": "Believe me when I say it, and the event will prove my words true, that I shall have to take all possible pains that you may not suppose rather that I have in my craftiness devised, than that they have in their folly undertaken so frivolous a prosecution.", "5038": "Now, while I briefly recount the circumstances of the case in their order, and force AEmilianus himself to own on what false grounds he has been induced to hate me, and that he has wan- dered far indeed from the truth, I beg that you will as carefully as you have already done, or even more so, if possible, consider cne very origin and foundation of this trial.", "5039":

of their paternal grandfather (for it so hap­ pened that Amicus died, leaving his father surviving him), on which she manifested the most exemplary affection, and brought them up with the greatest care for a period of four­ teen years.", "5041": "Still, however, it was by no inclination of hers that, in the flower of her age, she remained so long in a state of widowhood ;", "5042": "but the grandfather of the children used all his endeavours to unite her, much against her wish, to Sicinius Clarus, another son of his, and for that reason he kept all other suitors at a distance, while at the same time he threatened that if she should marry a stranger, he would by his will leave no portion of their paternal property to her sons.", "5043": "Being a woman endowed with prudence and of ex­ emplary affection, and seeing this match so perseveringly proposed to her, she complied, and executed a marriage con­ tract with Sicinius Clarus, that she might not, through any con­ duct of hers, be the cause of detriment to her children.", "5044": "How­ ever, by resorting to various pretexts, she put off the nuptials until such time as the grandfather of the children had de­ parted this life, leaving her sons his heirs, and upon the under­ standing that Pontianus, who was the elder, should be the guar- than of his brother.", "5045": "On being thus set free from this state of perplexity, she was sought in marriage by men of the highest rank, and she accord­ ingly made up her mind no longer to remain in a state of widowhood;", "5046": "for, although she might have been able to endure

without an aspersion on her character, with her system torpid from her prolonged disuse of the married state, afflicted with a protracted inactivity of the vital parts, the interior of her womb disordered—she was often brought by her sufferings to extreme peril of her life.", "5048": "Both doctors and midwives agreed that the disease had taken its rise through disuse of the married state, that the malady would gain strength every day, and her weakness become still greater;", "5049": "and they strongly suggested that while some hopes of life were still re­ maining, recourse ought to be had to marriage.", "5050": "Other persons, too, approved of this advice, Æmilianus here, in especial, the very man who, a short time since, asserted with most audacious falsehood, that Pudentilla never enter­ tained a thought about marriage, until she was coerced by me through magical practices ;", "5051": "and that I was the only one found to violate the flower of her widowhood, a kind of virginity, as it were, by means of my charms and drugs.", "5052": "I have many a time heard it said, with very good reason too, that \" A liar ought to have a good memory.\"", "5053": "Now, did it not occur to your recollection, Æmilianus, that before I even came to Oëa, you had gone so far as to write a letter to her son, Pontianus, who was then grown up, and residing at Rome, in which you recommended that she should marry?", "5054": "Give me the letter, will you, or rather hand it to him;", "5055": "let him read it;", "5056": "by his own voice and by his own words let him convict

malignity, only thought proper to inform you of the fact, but said nothing at all about a suitor.", "5069": "You, however, deluded by vain hopes that she would marry your brother Clams, even went so far as to advise her son Pontianus to consent to her marriage.", "5070": "Consequently, if she had made choice of Clarus, a clownish* and decrepit old man, you would have been ready to assert that, quite spontaneously, and without any magical practices whatever, she had long been anxious to marry;", "5071": "but as she has made choice of such a youth as you talk of, you affirm that it was by compulsion she did so, and that, otherwise she always entertained an aversion to marriage.", "5072": "You little thought, dishonest man, that your letter on this matter had been preserved;", "5073": "you little thought that you were going to be convicted on your own testimony.", "5074": "Pu­ dentilla, however, knowing full well how fickle and change­ able you were, and how untruthful and shameless to boot, thought it better to keep this letter than to part with it, as an evidence of your own wishes on the subject.", "5075": "Besides, she herself wrote to her son, Pontianus, while he was at Rome, on the same subject, and entered very fully too upon the causes that prompted her to take this resolution.", "5076": "She mentioned to him all the matters connected with her health, that besides there was no reason why she should per­ sist any longer in remaining unmarried;", "5077": "she reminded him, how that, disregarding her own welfare, she had, by her pro­ longed state of widowhood;", "5078": "obtained for them their grand­ father's property, and had with the most scrupulous carefulness increased the same;", "5079": "that, thanks to the Gods, he himself was now of

fact, not even AEmilianus can deny.", "5090": "For Pontianus, on receiving his mother's letter, instantly flew hither with all haste from Rome, being greatly afraid, if she should take some greedy

covered my health, and at the request of my friends I gave a public lecture.", "5111": "All who were present in the thronged basilica,* the place appointed for its delivery, cried out with one accord,

for my wife, than if I had sought her of my own accord.", "5125": "Pontianus, too, had prevailed upon his mother to choose me in preference to all others, and showed incredible anxiety to bring it about as soon as possible.", "5126": "It was with difficulty we obtained of him even a short respite, until such time as he himself should have married, and his brother have assumed the manly gown;",

obliged next to mention, that I might not appear now to accuse Pontianus of fickleness, whom I forgave freely and with­ out reserve, when he asked forgiveness for his error.", "5130": "For I am ready to confess a thing that has been brought forward as a charge against me, that, after he was married, he was guilty of a breach of that fidelity which he had pledged to me, and that, suddenly changing his mind, he endeavoured with equal pertinacity to prevent that which he had before endea­ voured with the greatest zeal to promote--that, in fact, he was ready to submit to anything, to do anything, in order that our marriage might not take place.", "5131": "And still, all this unbecoming change of mind on his part, and this ill-will against his mo­ ther, ought not to be imputed as a fault to

himself.", "5132": ",In a very few words, as I am necessitated so to do, I will describe the man, but still in language as moderate as I pos­ sibly can;", "5133": "lest, if I should be altogether

through his machinations that I have been accused.", "5141": "And, no doubt, he has in these matters very good grounds for congra­ tulating himself.", "5142": "For he is the base contractor of all litigation, the inventor of all falsehoods, the framer of all pretences, the hot­ bed of all mischiefs;", "5143": "he, too, is a very haunt, a den, a brothel for lusts and debaucheries;", "5144": "from his very earliest age he has been universally notorious for his disgraceful vices.", "5145": "Formerly, in his boyhood, before he was disfigured by that baldness of his, he was subservient to his corruptors in the perpetration of every infamous crime;", "5146": "after that, in his youth, as a dancer on the stage, he was so pliant in body as to seem to be utterly with­ out bones and nerves

"At his present age, too, the years at which he has now arrived-may the Gods confound him!—high commen­ dations these to be uttered in his hearing-his whole house is a brothel, his entire household a mass of corruption, himself devoid of all shame, his wife a prostitute, his sons just like himself.", "5150": "His door, a sport, day and night, for the young men of the place, is battered by their heels, his windows serenaded by their ditties, his dining-room kept in an uproar by revellers, and his bed-chamber a common thoroughfare for adulterers ;", "5151": "nor, in fact, has any one the least fear to enter it, with the ex­ ception of, him who has brought no admission-fee to the hus­ band.", "5152": "In this way is the dishonor of his bed a source of in­ come to him.", "5153": "Formerly he

really what was the wretched man to do when he had lost a very handsome fortune-one, however, which he had quite unexpectedly picked up through his father's fraudulent proceedings ?", "5161": "This father of his, being eaten up by usurious debts due to a great number of creditors, preferred to save his money rather than his honor.", "5162": "For when he was dunned on all sides on his bonds, and clutched hold of by all who met him, just as though he had been a madman—\"Have patience,\" he exclaimed;", "5163": "and then he declared it was not in his power to pay his debts;", "5164": "laid aside his gold rings and all the insignia of his rank, and made a composition with his creditors.", "5165": "But, by a most artful fraud, he managed to trans­ fer the greater part of his property into the name of his wife ;", "5166": "and so, himself in want, and stripped naked, though covered with his ignominy, he left to Rufinus here—I am telling no falsehood in so saying-three millions of sesterces for him to devour.", "5167": "For fully that sum came to him as his mother's pro­ perty, free and unencumbered, besides all that his wife has earned for him by her marriage-portions* from day to day.", "5168": "All these sums, however, this gluttonous wretch has so care­ fully stowed away in his paunch, and squandered upon his orgies of all kinds, that you would really suppose he was afraid lest it might be said that he retained possession of anything that was the result of his father's frauds.", "5169": "This man, so just and so pure in his morals, used his utmost endeavours that what was so badly gotten should be as badly lost;", "5170": "and, from being the possessor of this enormous fortune, he has nothing left, except a wretched ambition and an insatiate appetite.",

insti­ gation of her mother, gone the round of all the rich young men, and after having been lent even to some of her suitors for them to make trial of her, if she had not fallen in with the good-natured, easy tempered Pontianus, she would perhaps have been still sitting at home a widow before she was a wife.", "5173": "Although we most strongly dissuaded him from doing so, Pontianus con­ ferred on her the false and misplaced name of wife, not being unaware that, shortly before he married her, she had been de­ serted by a young man of the highest respectability, who had become tired of her, and to whom she had been previously engaged.", "5174": "Accordingly, his new-married wife came home to him full of assurance, and unabashed, with her chastity rifled, her vir­ ginity lost, her nuptial veil all sullied;", "5175": "after her so recent re­ pudiation, a virgin once more, but bringing with her rather the name than the unblemished character of a maid.", "5176": "In a litter

this fellow, whose circumstances are as limited as his hopes are inordinate, his avarice being commensurate with his neediness, had in his vain anticipations gulped up the whole four million sesterces belonging to Pudentilla;", "5181": "and therefore, as he thought that I ought to be got out of the way, in order that he might more easily practise upon the pliable disposition of Pontianus and the solitary state of Pudentilla, he began to rate his son-in-law for having engaged his mother to me;", "5182": "prompted him, while yet he had the opportunity, as speedily as possible, to extricate her

determination:", "5190": "that, finally, she declared she was by no means unaware that it was through the advice of Rufinus he expostulated with her, for which reason she should be all the more in- dined to obtain the protection of a husband against his despe­ rate avarice.", "5191": "On hearing these words, this pander to his wife so swelled with anger, so blazed with rage, that in the presence of her own son he said things against this lady, a woman of most chaste and modest character, which would have been far more befitting his own chamber, and shouted out that she was a love-sick creature, and I was a magician and sorcerer;", "5192": "and this in the hearing of many persons, whom, if you desire it, I will name ;", "5193": "and declared that with his own hand he would put an end to me.", "5194": "Hardly, by Hercules!", "5195": "can I moderate my anger, so great is the indignation which rises in my mind.", "5196": "What, you, you most effeminate wretch!", "5197": "do you

further, when Pudentilla saw that her son was corrupted contrary to her expectations, she went into the country, and there wrote to him that famous letter of hers, in which, as they said, she admitted that she had been bereft of her senses and induced to love me through my magical practices.", "5204": "And yet this very letter, by your order, Maximus, I copied at length the day before yesterday, in pre­ sence of the public registrar, and before witnesses, Æmilianus taking a copy at the same time;", "5205": "and in every point it is found to tell in my favour, and against their accusations.",

absurdly who says that he is silent, because in the very act of saying that he is silent, he is not silent, and by his very affirmation he contradicts what he affirms:", "5235": "so, even more

qualities, of which she had heard an account from Pontianus, and his re­ commendation that she should marry me in preference to any one else.", "5245": "Thus far has now been read;", "5246": "there remains the other portion of the letter, which, though written in like manner in my favour, has been made to turn its horns against me, and which, while it was sent for the very purpose of removing from me all suspicion of magical practices, has, to the transcendent glory of Rufus, changed sides, and gone so far as to gain for me a quite opposite character in the eyes of certain persons in Oëa, as though I really were a magician.", "5247": "Much in the inter­ change of conversation, Maximus, you have heard, still more in reading you have learned, and no little knowledge by expe­ rience you

the earth below, through whom our aspirations and our deserts are conveyed to the Gods.", "5742": "These the Greeks call by name 11 dæmons,\" and, being placed as messengers between the inhabitants of earth and those of heaven, they carry from tho one to the other, prayers and bounties, supplications and as­ sistance, being a kind of interpreters and message carriers for both.", "5743": "Through these same demons, as Plato says in his Sym­ posium, all revelations, the various miracles of magicians, and all kinds of presages, are carried on.", "5744": "For specially appointed individuals of this number, administer everything according to the province assigned to each;", "5745": "either by framing dreams, or caus­ ing ominous fissures in entrails, or governing the flights of some birds, or instructing others in song, or inspiring prophets, or by launching thunders, or causing the lightning to flash in the clouds, or other things to take place means of which we obtain a know­ ledge of future events.", "5746": "And we have reason to believe that all these particulars are by the will, the power, and the authority of the celestial Gods, but through the obedience, aid, and ser­ vices of demons;", "5747": "for it was through the employment, the ser­ vices, and the care of these, that dreams forewarned Hannibal of the loss of one of his eyes;", "5748": "that inspection of the entrails foretold to Flaminius a perilous carnage;", "5749": "and that auguries assured to Attius Navius the miracle of the whetstone.", "5750": "Just in the same manner, tokens of future empire are imparted be­ forehand to certain persons;", "5751": "as, for instance, an eagle hovered over the cap on the head of Tarquinius Priscus, and a-flame shone from the head of Servius Tullius.", "5752": "And lastly, to these are owing all the presages of diviners, the expiatory sacrifices of the Etrurians, the sacrificial enclosure of places struck by light­ ning, and the verses of the Sibyls;", "5753": "all which, as I have said, are effected by certain influences that carry on the communica­ tion between men and Gods.", "5754": "Nor, indeed, would it be conformable to the majesty of the celestial Gods, that any one of them should either frame a dream for Hannibal, or withdraw the victim from Flaminius, or direct the flight of the bird for Attius Navius, or form in verse the predictions of the Sibyl, or be willing to snatch the hat from the head of Tarquin, and restore it, or place a splendid flame upon the head of Servius, but so as not to burn him.", "5755": "It is not becoming that the Gods of heaven should condescend to things of this nature.", "5756": "This is the pro­ vince of the intermediate Gods, who dwell in the regions of the air, which are adjacent to the earth, and on the confines of the heavens, just as in each part of the world there are animals peculiarly adapted to it, those which fly living in the air, and those which walk, on the earth.", "5757": "For since there are four ele­ ments universally known, nature being as it were divided into four grand portions, and there are animals peculiar to earth, water, and flame;", "5758": "(for Aristotle informs us that certain animals pecu­ liar thereto, and furnished with wings, fly about in burning furnaces, and pass the whole period of their existence in fire,* come to life therein, and with it die), and besides this, since, as we have already observed, so many stars are beheld floating above in æther, that is to say, in the very brightest heat of fire,†—since this is the case, why should nature suffer this fourth element, the air, which is so widely extended, to be the only one void of every thing, and destitute of its own inhabitants ?", "5759": "Why should not animated beings be generated in this air in the same manner as animals that exist in flame are generated in fire, animals that float, in water, and those of an earthly nature, on earth ?", "5760": "For you have every reason to pronounce his opinion false who assigns the birds to the air;", "5761": "for not one of them raises itself above the summit of Mount Olympus, which, though it is said to be the highest of all mountains, yet if you measure its height in a straight line, the distance to its summit is not equal, according to the opinions of geometricians, to ten stadia;", "5762": "whereas the immense mass of air extends as far as the nearest portion of the cycle of the moon, beyond which æther takes its rise in an upward direction.", "5763": "What, then, are we to say of such a vast body of air, which ranges in extent from the nearest part of the revo­ lutions of the moon as far as the highest summit of Mount Olympus ?", "5764": "Will that, pray, be destitute of its own appropriate animated beings, and will this part of nature be without life, and impotent?", "5765": "Moreover, if you attentively consider the matter, birds themselves may, with greater propriety, be said to be terrestrial than aerial animals;", "5766": "for their whole living is always on the earth;", "5767": "there they procure food, and there they rest;", "5768": "and they only make a passage through that part of the air in flying which lies nearest to the earth.", "5769": "But, when they are wearied by the rowing motion of their wings, the earth is to them as a harbour.", "5770": "If, therefore, reason evidently requires that its appropriate animals must also be admitted to exist in the air, it remains for us to consider what they arc, and what is their nature.", "5771": "They are then by no means animals of an earthly nature, for such have a downward tendency, through their gravity.", "5772": "But neither are they of a fiery nature, lest they should be carried aloft by their heat.", "5773": "A certain middle nature, there­ fore, must be conceived by us, in conformity to the middle position of their locality, that so the nature of the inhabitants may be conformable to the nature of the region.", "5774": "Well, then, let us form in our mind and generate in our ideas bodies so constituted as neither to be so sluggish as terrestrial, nor so light as ethereal, but in a certain measure distinct from both, or else composed of a mixture of both, either removed from, or modified by, a participation of both.", "5775": "They will, however, be more easily conceived, if admitted to be a mixture of both, than if they assumed to be mingled with neither.", "5776": "The bodies of these demons, therefore, must have some little weight, in order that they may not be carried aloft;", "5777": "and they must also have some lightness, in order that they may not be precipitated to the realms below.", "5778": "However, that I may not appear to you to be devising things that are incredible, after the manner of the poets, I will just give you an example of this equipoised middle nature.", "5779": "We see the clouds unite in a way not much different from this tenuity of body;", "5780": "but if these were equally light as those bodies which are entirely devoid of weight, they would never cap the heights of a lofty mountain with, as it were, certain wreathed chains, depressed beneath its ridges, as we frequently perceive they do.", "5781": "On the other hand, if they were naturally so dense and so ponderous that no union with a more active levity could elevate them, they would certainly strike against the earth, of their own tendency, just like a mass of lead and stone.", "5782": "As it is, however, being pendulous and moveable, they are guided in this direction and in that by the winds amid the sea of air, in the same manner as ships, shift- in- sometimes in proximity and remoteness;", "5783": "for, if they are teeming with the moisture of water, they are depressed downward, as though for the purpose of bringing forth.", "5784": "And on this account it is that clouds that are more moist descend lower, in dusky masses, and with a slower motion, while those that are serene ascend higher, and are impelled like fleeces of wool, in white masses, and with a more rapid flight.", "5785": "Have you not heard how Lucretius most eloquently expresses himself concerning thunder in his Sixth Book ? \"", "5786": "The azure heavens with dreadful thunders shake.", "5787": "Because th' ethereal clouds, ascending high, Dash on each other, driven by adverse winds.\"", "5788": "But if the clouds fly aloft, all of which originate from the earth, and again flow downward to it, pray what should you conclude as to the bodies of demons, which are so much more attenuated in their composition ?", "5789": "For they are not heaped up from feculent vapours and dense mists, as is the nature of clouds, but they are formed of the most pure liquid and serene element of air, and on this account they are not visible on every occasion to the human eye, but only when by divine command they allow themselves to be seen.", "5790": "For in them no earthly density occupies the place of light, so as to encounter our perception, and necessarily to arrest our visual ray by that solidity;", "5791": "but the lineaments of the bodies which they have are rare, shining, and attenuated, to such a degree, that they allow all the rays of our vision to pass through them in consequence of their rarity, refract them by their bright­ ness, and baffle them by their subtlety.", "5792": "Hence that de­ scription of Minerva, in Homer, presenting herself in the midst of the assembly of the Greeks, for the purpose of check­ ing the wrath of Achilles.", "5793": "If you will wait a moment I will give you the Geeek line in Latin, and here it is on the spur of the moment.", "5794": "Minerva, then, as I said, by the command of Juno came, in order to moderate the wrath of Achilles, \" Seen by him only, by the rest unseen.\" * Hence, also, Virgil's Juturna, when in the midst of many thou­ sands of men, for the purpose of aiding her brother, \" With soldiers mingled, though by none perceived,\" t fully accomplishing that which the captain in Plautus boasted of having effected by his shield, \" Which dazzled by its light the vision of his foes.\"", "5795": "And not to discuss prolixly the rest of the instances, the poets, from this multitude of demons, are accustomed, in a way by no means remote from the truth, to feign the Gods to be haters and lovers of certain men, and to give prosperity and promotion to some, and to oppose and afflict others.", "5796": "Hence, they are in­ fluenced by pity, moved by indignation, racked with vexation, elated with joy, and are subject to all the affections of the human mind;", "5797": "and are agitated by all the fluctuations of human thought, with similar commotions of the spirit and agitations of the feelings.*", "5798": "All which storms and tempests are far alien from the tranquil state of the celestial Gods.", "5799": "For all the celestials always enjoy the same state -of mind, with an eternal equanimity, which in them is never driven from its own fixed state either in the direction of pleasure or of pain;", "5800": "nor is it moved by any thing from its own everlasting rule, towards any sudden line of conduct;", "5801": "neither by any external force, because there is nothing more powerful than deity;", "5802": "nor of their own impulse, because nothing is more perfect than deity.", "5803": "And furthermore, how can he appear to have been per­ fect, who moves from a former condition of being to another condition which is better ?", "5804": "And this the more especially, as no one spontaneously embraces any thing new, unless he is tired of what he had before;", "5805": "for a new mode of proceeding cannot be adopted, without disapproving the preceding modes.", "5806": "Hence, it follows, that a God ought not to be employed in any temporal functions either of beneficence or love;", "5807": "and, therefore, is neither to be influenced by indignation nor by pity, nor to be disquieted by any anxiety, nor elated by any hilarity;", "5808": "but he is free from all the passions of the mind, so as never either to grieve or to rejoice, nor on sudden impulse to will or unwill.", "5809": "†But all these, and other qualities of the like kind, properly accord with the middle nature of demons.*", "5810": "For they are in­ termediate between us and the Gods, both in the place of their habitation, and in their nature ;", "5811": "having immortality in common with the Gods of heaven, and passions in common with sub­ ordinate beings.", "5812": "For they are capable, just as we are, of being affected by all that soothes as well as all that moves the mind;", "5813": "so as to be stimulated by anger, influenced by pity, allured by gifts, appeased by prayers, exasperated by affronts, soothed by ho­ nours, and swayed by all other circumstances, just in the same way that we are.", "5814": "For, to embrace the nature of them in a de­ finition, demons are as to genus animated beings, as to mind rational, as to feelings passive, as to body aerial, as to duration eternal.", "5815": "Of these five characteristics which I have mentioned, the three first are the same as those which we possess, the fourth is peculiar to themselves, and the last they possess in common with the immortal Gods, from whom they differ in being subject to passion.", "5816": "Hence, according to my idea, I have not absurdly called demons passive, because they are subject to the same perturbations as we are:", "5817": "and on this account it is that we may place some confidence in the different observances of religions, and the various propitiatory offerings made in sacred rites.", "5818": "There are likewise some among this number of Gods who rejoice in victims, or ceremonies, or observances, nocturnal or diurnal, public or performed in secret, replete with the greatest joy or marked with extreme sadness.", "5819": "Thus, the Egyptian deities are almost all of them delighted with lamentations, the Grecian in general with dances, and those of the Barbarians with the sound produced by cymbals, tambourines, and pipes.", "5820": "So. in like manner, other points relating to sacred rites present consider­ able diversities, according to different regions;", "5821": "as, for instance, the crowds that swell the sacred processions, the mysteries, the duties performed by the priests, and the observances per- formed by the devotees:", "5822": "and then, again, the images of the Gods, and their insignia, the rites performed in, and the situa­ tions of, their temples, and the variety of blood and colour in their victims.", "5823": "All these particulars are regulated and set forth in the accustomed form peculiar to the usage of each place, so much so that we have frequently ascertained by means of dreams, oracles and prophecies especially, that the Divinities have been indignant, if anything in their sacred rites has been neglected through slothfulness or contumacy;", "5824": "of which cir­ cumstances I have an abundance of examples.", "5825": "They are, how­ ever, so universally mentioned, and so generally known, that no one could attempt to recount them, without omitting a great number more than he mentioned.", "5826": "On this account, I shall desist for the present from expending words upon these parti.", "5827": "culars, which if they have not obtained assured credit with all men, still, at least, are universally within the knowledge of all.", "5828": "It will be more advisable, therefore, to discuss this point in the Latin tongue, that there are kinds of demons enumerated by the philosophers, in order that you may more clearly and more fully come to an understanding on the presage of Socrates, and his familiar demon.", "5829": "Now, according to a certain signification, the human soul, even when it is still situate in the body, is called a demon. \" 0 say, Euryalus, do Gods inspire", "5830": "In minds this ardour, or does fierce desire Rule as a God in its possessor's breast ?\"*", "5831": "If, then, this is the case, a longing of the soul that is of gooa tendency is a good demon.", "5832": "Hence it is that some think, as we have already observed, that the blessed are called ἐυδαίμονες, eudæmones, the demon of whom is good, that is, whose mind is perfect in virtue.", "5833": "You may call this demon in our language, according to my mode of interpretation, by the name of \" Genius,\" whether quite correctly I am not altogether sure, but at all events, at any risk you may so call it;", "5834": "because this God, who is the mind of every one,† though immortal, is never- theless, after a certain manner, generated with man;", "5835": "so that those prayers in which we implore the Genius, and which we employ when we embrace the knees [genua] of those whom we supplicate, seem to me to testify this connexion and union, since they comprehend in two words the body and the mind, through the communion and conjunction of which we exist.", "5836": "There is also another species of demons, according to a se­ cond signification, and this is the human soul, after it has per­ formed its duties in the present life, and quitted the body:", "5837": "I find that this is called in the ancient Latin language by the name of Lemur.", "5838": "Now, of these Lemures, the one who, under­ taking the guardianship of his posterity, dwells in a house with propitious and tranquil influence, is called the \"familiar\" Lar.", "5839": "But those who, having no fixed habitation of their own, are punished with vague wandering, as with a kind of exile, on account of the evil deeds of their life, are usually called \"Larvæ,\" thus becoming a vain terror to the good, but a source of punishment to the bad.", "5840": "But when it is uncertain what is the allotted condition of any one of these, and whether it is Lar or Larva, it is called a God Manes ;", "5841": "the name of God being added for the sake of honor.", "5842": "For those only are called Gods, who being of the number of the Lemures, and having regulated the course of their life justly and prudently, have afterwards been celebrated by men as divinities, and are uni­ versally worshipped with temples, and religious rites;", "5843": "such, for instance, as Amphiaraus in Boeotia, Mopsus in Africa, Osiris in Egypt, and others in other nations, but Esculapius every­ where.", "5844": "All this distribution, however, has been made of those demons, who once existed in a human body.", "5845": "But there is another species of demons, more exalted and august, not fewer in number, but far superior in dignity, who, being for ever liberated from the bonds and conjunction of the body, preside over certain powers.", "5846": "In the number of these are Sleep and Love, who possess powers of a different nature;", "5847": "Love, of exciting to wakefulness, Sleep of lulling to rest.", "5848": "From this more elevated order of demons, Plato is of opinion that a peculiar demon is allotted to every man, to be a witness and a guardian* of his conduct in life, who, without being visible to any one, is always present, and is an overseer not only of his actions, but even of his thoughts.", "5849": "But when life is finished, and THE SOUL has to return to its judges, then the demon who has presided over it immediately seizes, and leads it as his charge to judgment, and is there present with it while it pleads its cause;", "5850": "and censures it if it is guilty of any un­ truthfulness ;", "5851": "corroborates what it says, if it asserts what is true;", "5852": "and conformably to its testimony, sentence is passed.", "5853": "All you, therefore, who hear this divine opinion of Plato, as ex­ plained by me, so adapt your minds to whatever you may have to do, or to whatever may be the subject of your meditation, as men who know that there is nothing concealed from those guardians either within the mind or external to it;", "5854": "but that the demon scrupulously takes part in all these matters, sees all things, understands all things, and dwells in the most profound recesses of the mind, in the place of conscience. †", "5855": "He of whom I speak is entirely our guardian, our individual keeper, our watcher at home, our own proper regulator, a searcher into our inmost fibres, our constant observer, our in­ separable witness, a reprover of our evil actions, an approver of our good ones;", "5856": "if he is becomingly attended to, sedulously examined and devoutly worshipped, in the way in which he was worshipped by Socrates in justice and in innocence;", "5857": "he is our forewarner in uncertainty, our monitor in matters of doubt, our defender in danger, and our assistant in need.", "5858": "He is able also by dreams, and by tokens, and perhaps even openly, when necessity demands it, to avert from you evil, to increase your blessings, to aid you when depressed, to support you when falling, to lighten your darkness, to regulate your prosperity, and modify your adversity.", "5859": "What wonder, then, if Socrates, who was a man perfect in the highest degree, and wise even by the testimony of Apollo, should know and venerate this his God;", "5860": "and that hence, this Lar, his keeper, and nearly, as I may say, his co-mate and his domestic associate, should repel from him everything which ought to be repelled, foresee what ought to be foreseen, and forewarn him of what he ought to be forewarned of, if at any time, the functions of wisdom falling short, he stood in need, not of counsel, but foreknowledge;", "5861": "in order that when he was vacillating through doubt, he might take a firm stand through being forewarned.", "5862": "For there are many things respecting which even wise men have recourse to diviners and oracles.", "5863": "Do you not very clearly perceive in Homer, as in a kind of large mirror, these two properties of divination and of wisdom separated widely from each other ?", "5864": "For when those two pillars of the whole expedition disagreed, Agamemnon potent in sway, and Achilles powerful in battle, and a man famed for his elo­ quence and renowned for his skill, was wanting, who might allay the pride of the son of Atreus, and curb the anger of the son of Peleus, command the attention of both by the weight of his character, admonish them by examples, and soothe them by his words;", "5865": "who, then, on such an occasion undertook to speak ?", "5866": "Why, Ne8tor, the Pylian orator, who was so bland in his elo­ quence, wary through experience, and venerable for his age ;", "5867": "who was known by all to have a body weakened by years, but a mind vigorous in counsel, and words flowing with honeyed sweetness.", "5868": "In like manner, when in dubious and adverse circumstances, spies are to be chosen, to penetrate into the camp of the enemy at midnight, are not Ulysses and Diomedes selected for that purpose, as counsel and aid, mind and hand, spirit and sword ?", "5869": "But, on the other hand, when the Greeks are detained in Aulis, kept back by the winds, and through weariness are shrinking from the difficulties of the war;", "5870": "when the means of proceeding, the tranquillity of the sea, and the clemency of the winds, have to be ascertained by means of the indications of the entrails, the courses taken by birds, and the food de­ voured by serpents ;", "5871": "* then were those two supreme summits of the Grecian wisdom, the Ithacan and the Pylian, both of them silent;", "5872": "but Calchas, who was far more skilful in divining, as soon as he had surveyed the birds, and the altars, and the tree, immediately through his divination appeased the tempests, brought the fleet out to the sea, and foretold a war which should last ten years.", "5873": "Just so in the Trojan army also, when affairs required the aid of divination, that wise senate is silent, nor does either Hicetaon, Lampus, or Clytius, presume to give any opinion;", "5874": "but all of them listen in silence, either to the distasteful auguries of Helenus, or to the discredited predic­ tions of Cassandra.", "5875": "After the same manner, Socrates too, if at any time advice not within the province of wisdom was re­ quisite, was then governed by the prophetic power of his dmeon;", "5876": "and he was sedulously attentive to his admonitions, and on that account was acceptable in a far higher degree to his God.", "5877": "The reason also, has been in some measure already stated, why the demon of Socrates was generally in the habit of for­ bidding him to do certain things, but never exhorted him to the performance of any act.", "5878": "For Socrates, being of himself a man exceedingly perfect, and prompt to the performance of all requisite duties, never stood in need of any one to exhort him;", "5879": "though sometimes he required one to forbid him, if danger happened to lurk in any of his undertakings;", "5880": "in order that, being admonished, he might use due precaution, and desist for the present from his attempt, either to resume it more safely at a future period, or enter upon it in some other way.", "5881": "On occasions of this kind, he used to say, \" That he heard a cer­ tain voice, which proceeded from the divinity.\"", "5882": "For so it is asserted by Plato;", "5883": "and let no one suppose that he was in the habit of deriving omens from the ordinary conversation of men.", "5884": "Once, for example, when he was with Phsedrus, beyond the precincts of the city, under the covering of a shady tree, and at a distance from all overlookers, he perceived a sign which announced to him that he must not pass over the small stream of the river llissus, until he had appeased Love, who was indignant at his censure of him, by a recantation.*", "5885": "And then, besides, if he had been an observer of omens, he would sometimes also have received positive encouragement from them, as we see frequently the case with many of those, who, through a too superstitious observance of omens, are not directed by their own minds, but by the words of others;", "5886": "and who creeping about the lanes, gather counsel from the remarks of strangers, and, if I may use the expression, do not think with the under­ standing, but with the ears.", "5887": "But be this as it may, it is certain that those who hear.", "5888": "the words of soothsayers, generally receive a voice with their ears, concerning the nature of which they have no doubt, and which they know to proceed from the human mouth.", "5889": "But Socrates did not simply say that he heard a voice, but a 11 certain voice,\" transmitted to him:", "5890": "by which addition, you must certainly understand, that neither an ordinary nor a human voice is signified;", "5891": "for had it been so, it would have been no use to say a \" certain\" voice, but rather 11 a voice,\" \" or the.", "5892": "voice of some one,\" as the courtesan in Terence says, \" I thought just now I heard the captain's voice.\"t", "5893": "But he who says that he heard a certain voice, is either igno­ rant whence that voice originated, or is in some doubt con­ cerning it, or shows that it had something unusual and mys­ terious about it, as Socrates did of that voice, which he said was transmitted to him opportunely and from a divine source.", "5894": "And, indeed, I think that he used to perceive indications of his demon, not only with his ears, but even with his eyes;", "5895": "for he very frequently declared that not a voice, but a divine sign, had been presented to him.", "5896": "This sign too might have been the form of his demon, which Socrates alone beheld, just as, in Homer, Achilles beheld Minerva.", "5897": "I suppose that most of you will with difficulty believe what I have just said, and will greatly wonder what was the form of the demon Socrates was in the habit of seeing.", "5898": "Aristotle, however, who is a pretty good authority, I think, informs us that it was usual with the Pythagoreans to express great surprise if any one denied that he had ever seen a demon.", "5899": "If, there­ fore, the power of beholding a divine form may be possessed by any one, why might it not, in an especial degree, fall to the lot of Socrates, whom the dignity of wisdom rendered equal to the very highest divinity?", "5900": "For nothing is more similar and more acceptable to Deity, than a man intellectually good in a perfect degree, for he as much excels other men as he himself is surpassed by the immortal Gods.", "5901": "Do we not, then, ourselves feel elevated by the example and mention of Socrates ?", "5902": "And ought we not to devote ourselves to the feli­ citous study of a like philosophy, and stand in awe of like Divinities ?", "5903": "A study from which we allow ourselves to be drawn away, for what reason I know not.", "5904": "And nothing is there which excites in me so much surprise, as that all men should desire to live most happily, and should know that they cannot so live in any other way than by cultivating the mind, and yet leave their minds uncultivated.", "5905": "Just so, if any one wishes to see clearly, it is requisite that he should pay atten­ tion to his eyes by which he sees ;", "5906": "if he desires to run swiftly, attention must be paid to the feet by which he runs;", "5907": "and so, too, if you wish to be a stout pugilist, your arms must be strengthened with which you engage in that exercise.", "5908": "So it is with all the other members;", "5909": "the care of each must be made your study.", "5910": "And, as all men may easily see that this is true, I cannot sufficiently account to myself, and wonder to the extent that the thing deserves, why they do not, with the aid of reason, cultivate their minds.", "5911": "For this art of living is equally necessary for all;", "5912": "whereas the same is not the case with the art of painting, nor with the art of singing, which any worthy man may despise, without any censure upon his understanding, without baseness, and without disgrace.", "5913": "I know not how to play on the flute like Ismenias, still I feel no shame that I am not a player on the flute :", "5914": "I know not how to paint in colours like Apelles, nor to carve like Lysip­ pus, still I am not, ashamed that I am not an artist;", "5915": "and the same as to other arts, not to recount them all individually;", "5916": "you are at liberty to be ignorant of them, and yet not to feel ashamed.", "5917": "But, on the other hand, be good enough to say, I know not how to live aright as Socrates, as Plato, and as Pythagoras lived, and I feel no shame that I know not how to live aright.", "5918": "This you will never dare to say.", "5919": "It is, however, especially to be wondered at, that people should still neglect to learn those things of which they by no means wish to appear ignorant, and shun at one and the same moment, both acquaintance with and ignorance of the same art.", "5920": "Hence, if you examine their daily outlay, you will find that they are prodigally profuse in their ordinary ex­ penditure, but bestow nothing on themselves;", "5921": "I mean on proper attention to their demon, which proper attention is nothing else than the secret obligations of philosophy.", "5922": "They

far from being the statue of Pythagoras, the philosopher.", "6262": "The latter was by birth a Samian, most remarkable for beauty, deeply versed in minstrelsy and all kinds of music, and he lived about the time when Polycrates ruled in Samos.", "6263": "But the philosopher was by no means a favourite with the tyrant.", "6264": "Just after the latter had began to rule, Pythagoras fled privily

say that Pythagoras was at that time conveyed to Egypt among the captives of king Cambyses, and that he had for teachers the Persian magi, and especially Zo­ roaster, the adept in every divine mystery;", "6266": "and that he was afterwards received by a certain Gillus, a leading man among the inhabitants of Crotona.", "6267": "But the more generally received story is, that he went of his own accord to acquire the learn­ ing of Egypt, and that he was there taught by the priests the incredible powers of ceremonies, the wonderful commutations of numbers, and the most ingenious figures of geometry;", "6268": "but that not satisfied with these mental accomplishments, he afterwards visited the Chaldæans and the Brahmins, and among the latter the Gymnosophists.", "6269": "The Chaldæans taught him the stars, the definite orbits of the planets, and the various effects of both kinds of stars upon the nativity of men;", "6270": "as also, for much money, the remedies for human use derived from the earth, and the air, and the sea.", "6271": "But the Brahmins taught him the greater part of his philosophy:", "6272": "what are the rules and principles of the understanding;",

various fountains of knowledge all over the world, this man of surpassingly mighty genius, and of more than human grandeur of soul, the first namer and founder of philosophy, taught his disciples nothing in the first place but to be silent.", "6282": "With him the first study imposed upon the future sage was to hold his tongue altogether, and as for the words which poets call winged, to pluck their plumes and shut them up within the walls of his white teeth.", "6283": "This was, I say, absolutely the first rudiment of wisdom, to learn to think, and unlearn to prate.", "6284": "But they did not abstain from speaking all their lives long, nor did all follow their master in silence during an equally long period;", "6285": "but silence observed during a short space of time was thought enough for men of graver disposition, whilst the more talkative were punished by a silence of five years, their voice being sent, as it were, into exile.", "6286": "Now our master, Plato, imitates Pythagoras, differing in little or no de­ gree from his sect.", "6287": "I, too, among a great many men, having been admitted into his sect by my teachers, have learned both these things in academic

obtained credit from all your predecessors, not less for my opportune silence, than for my timely speaking.", "6291": "Before I begin, noblemen of Africa, to thank you for the statue which you did me the honour to propose during my pre­ sence here, and which you kindly decreed to erect to me during my absence, I wish first to acquaint you with the reason why I have not been seen by this assembly for a good many days, having betaken myself to the Persian waters, so pleasant to healthy bathers, and so curative to the sick.", "6292": "For I have made it my resolution thus to submit the whole course of my time to your approval, to whom I have perpetually dedicated myself.", "6293": "Never will I do anything, great or small, of which I will not make you cognizant and judges.", "6294": "That

unforeseen dangers suddenly befal men.", "6295": "You who know enough of his genius, hear a few words about his death.", "6296": "Do you wish me to say a few words also about his genius ?", "6297": "This Philemon was a poet, and a writer of the middle comedy.", "6298": "He produced pieces for the stage along with Menander, and con­ tended with him, being perhaps inferior to him, but at all events his rival.", "6299": "For that he was often victorious over him is a shameful thing to tell.", "6300": "Nevertheless, we find in him much wit;", "6301": "plots ingeniously involved;", "6302": "recognitions clearly made out;", "6303": "personages suited to the matter;", "6304": "phrases appropriate, to each character;", "6305": "gaieties not beneath the sock;", "6306": "gravities not quite up to the buskin.", "6307": "Impurities are rare in his works, and amours are admitted as errors.", "6308": "Nevertheless, you find in him the perjured pimp, the hot lover, the cunning slave, the wheedling mistress, the peremptory wife, the indulgent mo­ ther, the scolding uncle, the helpful friend, and the fighting soldier, together with various parasites, and stingy parents, and wanton harlots.", "6309": "Distinguished by these merits as a comic writer, it hap­ pened that he recited part of a play he had recently com­ posed.", "6310": "When he had come to the third act, and was exciting those pleasant emotions which comedy delights in, a sudden shower of rain coming on, as very lately happened to myself when speaking before you, compelled him to dismiss his audi­ ence and suspend his reading.", "6311": "But many persons calling for the remainder, he promised that he would deliver it on the following day without interruption.", "6312": "Next day, accordingly, a great concourse assembled, extremely eager for what was to come, and every one took the nearest seat he could find oppo­ site the reader's place.", "6313": "The late comer nodded to his friends, who found sitting room for him.", "6314": "The whole theatre being crammed, the pressure was great, and they began to complain of each other.", "6315": "All those who were so late as to be excluded from the benches were pitied.", "6316": "Those who had not been pre­ sent at the first day's reading enquired what had then been de­ livered ;", "6317": "those who had been.", "6318": "present recalled to mind what they had heard, and knowing all that had gone before, began to look for what was to come.", "6319": "Meanwhile the day was passing away, and Philemon did not keep his appointment.", "6320": "Some murmured at the poet's delay, many defended him.", "6321": "But when the audi­ ence had waited an unreasonable time and no Philemon ap­ peared, some of the readiest were sent to fetch him, and found him dead in his bed.", "6322": "He had just stiffened after giving up the ghost, and lay resting on his elbow on the bed as if think­ ing.", "6323": "His hand was still inserted in the scroll;", "6324": "his face was turned toward the book which he held straight before him;", "6325": "but he was already senseless, unconscious of the book, and re­ gardless of his audience.", "6326": "Those who had entered stood still awhile, struck with wonder at so unexpected an event, so beautiful a death.", "6327": "They then returned and announced to the people that Philemon, who was expected to finish his fictitious plot in the theatre, had concluded the real comedy at home.", "6328": "He had said to human affairs, 11 Farewell and applaud,\" but to his friends, lament and wail;", "6329": "that shower of yesterday had boded him tears;", "6330": "his comedy had arrived sooner at the fune­ ral than the nuptial torch.", "6331": "And since this excellent poet had made his exit from life, it was meet that the audience should proceed straightway to his obsequies;", "6332": "that his bones should now be collected, and by and by his poems.", "6333": "I learned long ago, that these facts occurred as I have re­ lated ;", "6334": "but I have been reminded of them to-day by my own mischance.", "6335": "For, as you remember, when my recitation was interrupted by the rain, I postponed it at your desire to the following day;", "6336": "and certainly after Philemon's example;", "6337": "for the very same day I so violently sprained my ankle in the palæstra, that I all but broke off the joint from the leg.", "6338": "It was put out of place, however, and is still infirm from the dis­ location ;", "6339": "and when I reduced it at first with great force, I sweated profusely and had long rigors.", "6340": "Then I suffered acute pain of the intestines, which hardly ceased until its vio­ lence had destroyed me, and compelled me, after the manner of Philemon, to be dead before I had read;", "6341": "to finish what was written for me in the book of fate sooner than what I had written;", "6342": "to end my life sooner than my history.", "6343": "As soon, then, as I had recovered the power of walking at the Persian waters, by their mild temperature and their no less useful than soothing warmth, not, indeed, so as to be able to tread firmly, but as much as seemed to me sufficient for my haste to return to you, I came to perform what I had promised;", "6344": "whilst you in the meantime had, by your kindness, not only taken away my lameness, but even added speed to my feet.", "6345": "Had I not good cause to hasten, that I might return you many thanks for that honour for which I had not petitioned you ?", "6346": "Not but that the grandeur of Carthage is worthy

neither does he who prays buy the object of his prayers for a cheap consi­ deration, nor does he who is solicited accept a small price, so that you would rather buy all kinds of commodities than beg for them.", "6349": "This, I think, is especially to be considered a matter of honour:", "6350": "he who obtains with much pains and solici­ tation on his own part, owes one debt of gratitude to himself for as much as he has succeeded in his suit;", "6351": "but he who has received it without the trouble of a canvass, owes a double debt of gratitude to the grantors;", "6352": "both because he has not sought, and he has obtained.", "6353": "I therefore owe you twofold thanks, nay, manifold thanks, as I shall always and every­ where declare.", "6354": "But now for the present time I will publicly profess it, as is my wont, in this book composed by me, on ac­ count of this honour.", "6355": "For there is a certain method in which a philosopher ought to return thanks for a statue

will join in extolling him to-day with me.", "6357": "For he so excels in studies, that he is much more illustrious by his own genius than by his father's consulship.", "6358": "In what words,

exult than to extol.", "6363": "What shall I do ?", "6364": "I wish to appear grateful, but joy will not leave me free to express gratitude.", "6365": "Let no one, let no one of those morose censors

consular man, to whom it is a high honour to be merely known, has borne testimony for me in the equally illustrious and most benign senate of Carthage.", "6368": "He has also been in a manner my panegyrist before the chief men of Africa.", "6369": "For as I learn, in a memorial he sent in the day before yesterday, in which he asked for a frequented site for the erection of my statue, he mentioned in the first place the rights of friendship honestly cemented between us through our companionship in study under the same masters;", "6370": "and then he enumerated all my vows for his successive advancement in public honours.", "6371": "That is in itself a first kindness, that he records his having been my fellow-student.", "6372": "And this is another, that a man of his eminence declares that he is be­ loved reciprocally by me.", "6373": "Moreover, he has mentioned that statues and other honours have been decreed to me in other countries and cities.", "6374": "What can be added to these encomiums by a man of consular dignity?", "6375": "Nay, he proved from the priesthood I have taken upon me, that the highest honour in Carthage was before me.", "6376": "This is a capital service he has con­ ferred on me, and far excelling the rest, that he, a most influ­ ential witness, commends me to you even by his own suffrage.", "6377": "Finally, he has promised that he will erect a statue to me in Carthage at his own expense, he to whom all provinces delight every where to erect equestrian statues, with chariots of four and of six horses.", "6378": "What more, then,

to be proconsul, pro­ nounced his opinion concerning the honours to be paid to me in the senate of the Carthaginians:", "6381": "all followed his lead.", "6382": "Does not this seem to you tantamount to a decree of the senate ?", "6383": "What ?", "6384": "that all the Carthaginians who were present in that most august senate, so willingly appointed a place for my statue as to make it apparent, as I hope, that they only postponed to the next senate a motion for another statue to me, in order that, saving the veneration and reverence due to their consular member, they might seem not to have rivalled but followed his act:", "6385": "that is to say, that a public testimonial should be conferred on me on a fresh day.", "6386": "Moreover, those excellent magistrates and most obliging nobles remembered that what they desired was prescribed to them by you.", "6387": "Could I be ignorant of this ?", "6388": "Should I fail to vaunt it ?", "6389": "I should be ungrateful.,", "6390": "Truly, I feel and profess the greatest possible thanks to your whole order for your exceeding kindness to me, you who have dignified me with the most flattering acclamations in that senate-house, in which to be named merely is the highest honour.", "6391": "So, then, what was hard to do, and what I thought truly arduous, to be pleasing to the people, acceptable to the order, and approved by the magistrates and chief men;", "6392": "this—fascination apart*—has some how befallen me.", "6393": "What, then, remains that I should enjoy the honour of a statue, but the price of the bronze and the pay of the artist ?", "6394": "things which never failed me even in small cities, not to speak of Carthage, where the most illustrious order is wont rather to decree than to compute the cost even in greater affairs.", "6395": "But of these things I will speak more when you shall have done more.", "6396": "Also to you, noble senators, famous citizens, worthy friends, I will express my thanks more at large in the book I will presently compose for the dedication of my statue;", "6397": "and I will incontinently bid that book go through all the provinces, and publish abroad the praises of your bounty throughout the whole world, in all time to come, among all nations, through­ out all years.", "6398": "Let those who are in the habit of obtruding themselves upon the leisure moments of governors, consider how they promote the fame of their genius by the immoderate volubility of their tongue, and glorify themselves in a pretended appearance of your friendship.", "6399": "Both these faults are far alien from me, Scipio Orfitus.", "6400": "For whatever be my little genius, it is already in its degree too well known to the world to need new com­ mendation;", "6401": "and I desire

angry with them when they stay away, to praise him who is constant in his attendance, to feel the loss of him who stays away;", "6409": "for it is certain that he must be liked whose absence gives pain.", "6410": "But a voice bound down to perpetual silence, would be of no more use than nostrils stuffed with rheum, ears closed by wind, eyes veiled by cataract.", "6411": "What if the hands be
