decision to their instincts and habits as not to be talked over and impartial ?", "415": "Or is it a general charge against human in­ firmity that, having different opinions on the most necessary and important things, we seek in horses and dogs and birds how to marry and beget and rear children, as though we had no means of making our own nature known, and appeal to the habits and instincts of the brute creation, and call them in to bear witness against the many deviations from nature in onr lives, which from the first are confused and disorderly.", "416": "For among the brutes nature remains ever the same, pure and simple, but in men, owing to reason and habit, like oil in the hands of the perfumers, being mixed up with many added opinions, it becomes various and loses its original simplicity.", "417": "And let us not wonder that the brutes follow nature more closely than human beings, for in that respect even they are outstripped by inanimate things, which, being dowered neither with imagi­ nation nor any appetite or inclination contrary to nature, ever continue in the one path which nature has prescribed for them, as if they were tied and bound.", "418": "But in brutes the gentleness of mood inspired by reason, the subtlety, the love of freedom, are not qualities found in excess, but they have unreasonable appetites and desires, and act in a roundabout way

not go with the female at all times;", "424": "for its aim is not pleasure but procreation:", "425": "so in the season of spring, the most appropriate time for such pairings,1 the female being

of nuts ?", "639": "But we have known even such turn out intoler­ able tyrants, Syrian flute-girls and ballet-dancers, as Aria­ tonica, and Œnanthe with her tambourine, and Agatho­ clea, who have lorded it over kings' diadems.", "640": "2", "641": "Why Syrian Semiramis was only the servant and concubine of one of king Ninus's slaves, till Ninus the great king seeing and falling in love with her, she got such power over him that she thought so cheap of him, that she asked to be allowed one day to sit on the royal throne, with the royal diadem on her head, and to transact state affairs.", "642": "And Ninus having granted her permission, and having ordered all his subjects to obey her as himself, sibe first gave several very moderate orders to make trial of the guards;", "643": "but when she raw that they obeyed her without the slightest hesitation, she ordered them to seize Ninus and put him in fetters, and at last put him to death ;", "644": "and all her commands being obeyed, she ruled over Asia for a long time with great lustre.", "645": "And was not Belestiche a foreign woman off the streets, although at Alexandria she has shrines and temples, with an inscription as Aphrodite Belestiche, which she owes to the king's love ?", "646": "And she who has in this very town1 a temple and rites in common with Eros, and at Delphi stands in gold among kings and queens, by what dowry got she her lovers ?", "647": "But just as the lovers oi Semiramis, Belestiche, and Phryne, became their prey un­ consciously through their weakness and effeminacy, so on the other hand poor and obscure men, having contracted alliances with rich women of rank, have not been thereby spoilt nor merged their personality, but have lived with their wives on a footing of kindness, yet still kept their position as heads of the house.", "648": "But he that abases his wife and makes her small, like one who tightens the ring on a finger too small for it fearing it will come off,2 is like those who cut their mares'tails off and then take them to a river or pond to drink, when they say that sorrowfully dis­ cerning their loss of beauty these mares lose their self-respect and allow themselves to be covered by asses.", "649": "3", "650": "To select a wife for wealth rather than for her excellence or family is dishonourable and illiberal;", "651": "but it is silly to reject wealth when it is accompanied by excellence and family.", "652": "Anti­ gonus indeed wrote to his officer who had garrisoned Munychia4 to make not only the collar strong but the dog lean, that he might undermine the strength of the Athenians;", "653": "but it becomes not the husband of a rich or handsome woman to make his wife poor or ugly, but by his self-con- trol and good sense, and by not too extravagantly showing his admiration for her, to exhibit himself as her equal not her slave, and (to borrow an illustration from the scales) to add just so much weight to his character as shall over­ balance her, yet only just.", "654": "Moreover, both Ismenodora and Baccho are of a suitable age for marriage and pro­ creation of children;", "655": "Ismenodora, I hear, is still in her prime, and \" (here my father smiled slily at Pisias) \" she is certainly not a bit older than her rivals, and has no grey hairs, as some of those who consort with Baccho have.", "656": "And if their union is seasonable, who knows but that she may be a better partner for him than any young woman?", "657": "For young couples do not blend and mix well together, and it takes a long time and is not an easy process for them to divest themselves of their pride and spirit, and at first there's a good deal of dirty weather and they don't pull well together, and this is oftenest the case when there's love on both sides, and, just as a storm wrecks the ship if no pilot is on board, so their marriage is trouble and confusion, neither party knowing how either to rule or to give way properly.", "658": "And if the baby is under the nurse, and the boy under the master, and the lad under the master of the gymnasium, and the youth under his lover, and the full-grown man under the law and magistrate, and no one is his own master and exempt from obedience to someone, what wonder would it be if a sensible woman rather older than her husband would direct well the life of a young man, being useful to him by reason of her superior wisdom, and acceptable to him for her sweetness and gentleness ?", "659": "And to sum up the whole matter,\" said he, \" we Bœotians ought to revere Hercules, and so find no fault in any in­ equality of age in marriages, seeing that he gave his own wife Megara in marriage to Iolaus, though he was only sixteen and she three-and-thirty.\"", "660": "1§ x.", "661": "As the conversation was going on, our father said that a friend of Pisias came galloping up from the town to report an act of marvellous audacity.", "662": "Ismenodora, it appears, thinking Baccho had no personal dislike to the match, but only stood in awe of his friends who tried to dissuade him from it, determined that she would not let the young fellow slip through her fingers.", "663": "Accordingly, she sent for the most active and intimate 1 of her male friends, and for some of her female cronies, and instructed them as to what part they should play, and waited for the hour when Baccho was accustomed regularly to pass by her house on his way to the wrestling-school.", "664": "And as he passed by on this occasion with two or three of his companions, anointed for the exercise, Ismenodora met him at the door and just touched his cloak, and her friends rushed out all together and prettily seized the pretty fellow as he was in his cloak and jersey,2 and hurried him into the house and at once locked the doors.", "665": "And the women inside at once divested him of his cloak and put on him a bridal robe;", "666": "and the servants ran about the town and put olive wreaths and laurel garlands at the doors of Baccho's house as well as Ismenodora's, and a flute-girl went up and down the street playing and singing the wedding-song.", "667": "And some of the inhabitants of Thespiæand the strangers laughed, others were indignant and tried to make the superintendents of the gymnasium move in the matter, for they have great power in Thespiæ over the youths, and pay great attention to their actions.", "668": "And now there was no more talk about the sports, but everyone left the theatre for the neighbour­ hood of Ismenodora's house, and there stood in groups talking and disputing about what had happened.§", "669": "XI.", "670": "Now when Pisias' friend had come up like an aide­ de-camp in war, \" bloody with spurring, fiery red with haste,\" to report this news that Ismenodora had seized Baccho, my father said that Zeuxippus smiled, and being a great lover of Euripides repeated the line, \" Lady, though rich, thou hast thy sex's feelings.\"", "671": "But Pisias jumped up and cried out, \"Ye gods, what will be the end of license like this which will overthrow our town ?", "672": "Already we are fast tending to lawlessness through our independence.", "673": "And yet it is perhaps ridicu- Ions to be indignant about law and justice, when nature itself is trampled upon by being thus subjected to women ?", "674": "Saw even Lemnos ever the like of this ?", "675": "1 Let us go,\" he continued, \" let us go and hand over to the women the gymnasium and council-hall, if the townsmen have lost all their nerve.\"", "676": "Pisias then left the company, and Protogenes went with him, partly sympathizing with his indignation, but still endeavouring to cool him.", "677": "And Anthemion said, \" 'Twas a bold deed and certainly does savour somewhat of Lemnos—I own it now we are alone-this Ismenodora must be most violently in love.\"", "678": "Hereupon Soclarus said, with a sly smile, \" You don't think then that this rape and de­ tention was an excuse and stratagem on the part of a wily young man to escape from the clutches of his lovers, and fly of his own volition to the arms of a rich and handsome widow ? \" \"", "679": "Pray don't say so, Soclarus,\" said Anthemion, \" pray don't entertain any such suspicions of Baccho, for even if he were not by nature most simple and naive, he would not have concealed the matter from me to whom he divulges all his secrets, especially as he knows that I have always been very anxious he should marry Ismenodora.", "680": "But as Heraclitus says truly, It is more difficult to control love than anger;", "681": "for whatever love has a fancy to, it will buy even at the cost of life, money, and reputation.", "682": "Who lives a more quiet life in our town than Ismenodora ?", "683": "When did ever any ugly rumour attach itself to her ?", "684": "When did ever any breath of suspicion sully her house ?", "685": "Some divine inspiration, beyond human calculation, seems now to have possessed her.\"§ XII.", "686": "Then Pemptides laughed and said, \" Of course you know that there is a certain disease of the body called the sacred diseased", "687": "It is no wonder, therefore, if some call the greatest and most insane passion of the soul sacred and divine.", "688": "However, as in Egypt I once saw two neighbours disputing when a serpent passed by them on the road, both calling it a good omen, but each claiming the blessing as his alone ;", "689": "so seeing lately that some of you drag Love to the men's apartments, while others confine it to the women's side of the house, while all of you regard it as a divine and superlative blessing, I do not wonder, since it is a passion that has such power and honour, that those who ought to banish it from every quarter and clip its wings do them­ selves add to its influence and power.", "690": "And hitherto I held my peace, for I saw that the discussion turned rather on private than public interests, but now that we have got rid of Pisias, I would gladly hear from you to what they had an eye who first called Love a god.\"§ XIII.", "691": "Just as Pemptides had left off, and our father was about to answer his question, another messenger came from the town, sent by Ismenodora to summon Anthemion, for the tumult had increased, and there was a difference of opinion between the superintendents of the gymnasium, one thinking they ought to demand the liberation of Baccho, the other thinking they ought not to interfere.", "692": "Anthemion got up at once and went off.", "693": "And our father, addressing Pemp­ tides especially, said, \" You seem to me, my dear Pemptides, to be handling a great and bold matter, or rather to be discussing things that ought not to be discussed, in asking for a reason in each case for our opinion about the gods.", "694": "Our ancient and hereditary faith is sufficient, a better argument than which we cannot either utter or find, ' Not e'en if wisdom in our brains resides ;", "695": "'1 but if this common foundation and basis of all piety be dis­ turbed, and its stability and time-honoured ideas be un­ settled, it becomes undermined and is suspected by every­ body.", "696": "You have heard, of course, what hot water Euri­ pides got into, when he wrote at the beginning of his ' Melanippe,' ' Zeus, whosoe'er he is, I do not know Except by hearsay,'2 but if he changed the opening line, he had confidence, it seems, that his play would go down with the public un­ commonly well,' so he altered it into 'Zeus the divine, as he is truly called.' 2", "697": "And what difference is there between calling in question the received opinion about Zeus or Athene, and that about Love ?", "698": "For it is not now for the first time that Love asks for an altar and sacrifices, nor is he a strange god intro­ duced by foreign superstition, as some Attis or Adonis, far­ tively smuggled in by hermaphrodites and women, and secretly receiving honours not his own, to avoid an indict­ ment among the gods for coming among them under false pretences.", "699": "And when, my friend, you hear the words of Empedocles, ' Friendship is there too, of same length and breadth, But with the mind's eye only can you see it, Till with the sight your very soul is thralled,' you must suppose that they refer to Love.", "700": "For this god is in­ visible, but to be extolled by -as as one of the very oldest gods.", "701": "And if you demand proofs about everyone of the gods, laying a profane band on every temple, and bringing a learned doubt to every altar, you will scrutinize and pry into every­ thing.", "702": "But we need not go far to find Love's pedigree.", "703": "'", "704": "See you how great a goddess Aphrodite is ?", "705": "She 'tis that gave us and engendered Love, Whereof come all that on the earth do live.'3", "706": "And so Empedocles calls Aphrodite Life-giving,4 and Sophocles calls her Fruitful, both very appropriate epithets.", "707": "And though the wonderful act of generation belongs to Aphrodite only, and Love is only present in it as a subor­ dinate, yet if he be absent the whole affair becomes unde­ sirable, and low, and tame.", "708": "For a loveless coition brings only satiety, as the satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and has nothing noble resulting from it, whereas by Love Aphrodite removes the cloying element in pleasure, and produces harmonious friendship.", "709": "And so Parmenides de­ clares Love to be the oldest of the creations of Aphrodite, writing in his Cosmogony, 'Of all the gods first Love she did contrive.'", "710": "But Hesiod, more naturally in my opinion, makes Love the most ancient of all, so that all things derive their existence from him.", "711": "1", "712": "If we then deprive Love of his an­ cient honours, those of Aphrodite will be lost also.", "713": "For we cannot argue that, while some revile Love, all spare Aphro­ dite, for on the same stage we hear of Love, 'Love is an idle thing and for the idle :", "714": "'2 and again of Aphrodite, 'Cypris, my boys, is not her only name, For many names has she.", "715": "She is a hell, A power remorseless, nay a raging madness.\"", "716": "3", "717": "Just as in the case of the other gods there is hardly one that has not been reviled, or escaped the scurrility of ig­ norance.", "718": "Look, for example, at Ares, who may be con­ sidered as it were the counterpart of Love, what honours he has received from men, and again what abuse, as 'Ares is blind, ye women, has no eyes, And with his pig's snout roots up all good things,'4.", "719": "And Homer calls him 'blood-stained' and 'fickle.'5", "720": "And Chrysippus brings a grievous charge against him, in defining his name to mean destroyer,6 thereby giving a handle to those who think that Ares is only the fighting, wrangling, and quarrelsome instinct among mankind.", "721": "Others again will tell us that Aphrodite is simply desire, and Hermes eloquence, and the Muses the arts and sciences, and Athene wisdom.", "722": "You see what an abyss of impiety opens up before us, if we describe each of the gods, as only a passion, a power, or a virtue !", "723": "\"§ XIV. \" I see it,\" said Pemptides, \" and it is impious either to make the gods passions, or to do just the con- trait, and make the passions gods.\" \" What then ? \" said my father, \" do you consider", "724": "Ares a god, or only a human passion ? \"", "725": "And Pemptides, answering that he looked on Ares as god of the passionate and manly element in man­ kind, \" What,\" cried my father, \" shall the passionate and warlike and antagonistic instincts in man have a god, but the affectionate and social and clubable have none ?", "726": "Shall Ares, under his names of Enyalius and Stratius, pre­ side over arms and war and sieges and sacks of cities, and shall there be no god to witness and preside over, to direct and guide, conjugal affection, that friendship of closest union and communion ?", "727": "Why even those who hunt gazelles and hares and deer have a silvan deity who harks and halloos them on, for to Aristæus1 they pay their vows when in pitfalls and snares they trap wolves and bears, ' For Aristæus first set traps for animals.'", "728": "And Hercules invoked another god, when he was about to shoot at the bird, as the line of Æschylus shows, ' Hunter Apollo, make my bolt go straight!' 2", "729": "And shall no god or good genius assist and prosper the man who hunts in the best chase of all, the chase of friend­ ship ?", "730": "For I cannot for my part, my dear Daphnæus, consider man a less beautiful or important plant than the oak, or sacred olive, or the vine which Homer glorifies,3 seeing that man too has his growth and glorious prime alike of soul and body.\"§ xv.", "731": "Then said Daphnæus, \" In the name of the gods, who thinks differently ? \" \"", "732": "All those certainly must,\" answered my father, \" who think that the gods care only about ploughing and planting and sowing.", "733": "Have they not Nymphs attending upon them, called Dryads, ' whose age is coeval with the trees they live in :", "734": "and Dionysus the mirth-giving does he not increase the yield of the trees, the sacred splendour of Autumn,' as Pindar says ? 4", "735": "And if they care about all this, is there no god or genius who is interested in the nurture and growth of boys and youths in all their glorious flower ?", "736": "is there no one that cares that the growing man may be upright and virtuous, and that the nobility of his nature may not be warped and corrupted, either through want of a guardian or by the depravity of those he associates with?", "737": "Is it not monstrous and thankless to say so, seeing that we enjoy the divine bounty, which is dealt out to us richly, and never abandons us in our straits?", "738": "And yet some of these same straits have more necessity than beauty.", "739": "For example, our birth, in spite of the unpleasant circumstances attending it, is witnessed by the divine Ilithyia and Artemis :", "740": "and it would be better not to be born at all than to become bad through want of a good guardian and guide.", "741": "Moreover in sickness the god who is over that province does not desert us, nor even in death :", "742": "for even then there is a conductor and guide for the de­ parted, to lay them to sleep, and convey their souls to Hades,1 as the poet says, ' Night bore me not to be lord of the lyre, Nor to be seer, or healer of diseases, But to conduct the souls of the departed.'", "743": "And yet these duties involve much unpleasantness, whereas we cannot mention a holier work, nor any struggle or con­ test more fitting for a god to attend and play the umpire in, than the guidance of the young and beautiful in the prose­ cution of their love-affairs.", "744": "For there is here nothing of an unpleasant nature, no compulsion of any kind, but persua­ sion and grace, truly making toil sweet and labour delight­ ful, lead the way to virtue and friendship, and do not arrive at that desired goal without the deity, for they have as their leader and lord no other god than Love, the com­ panion of the Muses and Graces and Aphrodite.", "745": "For Love 4 sowing in the heart of man the sweet harvest of desire,' to borrow the language of Melanippides, mixes the sweetest and most beautiful things together.", "746": "But per­ haps you are of a different opinion, Zeuxippus.\"§ xvi. \" Not I, by Zeus,\" replied Zeuxippus. \"", "747": "To have a different opinion would be ridiculous.\" \" Then,\" con­ tinued my father, \" is it not also ridiculous, if there are four kinds of friendship, for so the ancients distinguished, the natural first, the second that to one's

god of the family, or a god of the race,1 whereas the friendship of love only, as something altogether unholy, is left without any patron god, and that, too, when it needs most of all atten­ tive direction ? \"", "749": "\"It is,\" said Zeuxippus, \" highly ridicu­ lous.\"", "750": "My father continued, \" The language of Plato is very suggestive here, to make a slight digression.", "751": "One kind of madness (he says) is conveyed to the soul from the body through certain bad temperaments or mixtures, or through the prevalence of some noxious spirit, and is harsh, difficult to cure, and baneful.", "752": "Another kind of madness is not un­ inspired or from within, but an afflatus from without, a deviation from sober reason, originated and set in motion by some higher power, the ordinary characteristic of which is called enthusiasm.", "753": "For, as one full of breath is called ἔμπνοος, and as one full of sense is called so the name enthusiasm is given to the commotion of the soul caused by some Divine agency.", "754": "2", "755": "Thus there is the pro­ phetic enthusiasm which proceeds from Apollo, and the Bacchic enthusiasm which comes from Dionysus, to which Sophocles alludes where he says, ' Dance with the Corybantes;", "756": "' for the rites of Cybele and Pan have great affinities to the orgies of Bacchus.", "757": "And the third madness proceeds from the Muses, and possesses an impressionable and pure soul, and stirs up the poetry and music in a man.", "758": "As to the martial and warlike madness, it is well known from what god it proceeds, namely, Ares, 'kindling tear­ ful war, that puts an end to the dance and the song, and exciting civic strife.'3", "759": "There remains, Daphnæus, one more kind of madness in man, neither obscure nor tranquil, as to which I should like to ask Pemptides here, -' What god it is that shakes the fruitful thyrsus ?'", "760": "I refer to that love-fury for modest boys and chaste women, which is far the keenest and fiercest passion of all.", "761": "For have you not observed how the soldier, when he lays aside his arms, ceases from his warlike fury, as the poet says, ' Then from him Right gladly did his squires remove the armoury and sits down a peaceful spectator of others ?", "762": "2", "763": "The Bacchic and Cory ban tic dances one can also modulate and quell, by changing the metre from the trochaic and the measure from the Phrygian.", "764": "Similarly, too, the Pythian priestess, when she descends from her tripod, possesses her soul in peace.", "765": "Whereas the love-fury, when once it has really seized on a man and inflamed him, can be laid by no Muse, no charm or incantation, no change of place ;", "766": "but present they burn, absent they desire, by day they follow their loves about, by night they serenade them, sober call for them, and drunken sing about them.", "767": "And he who said that poetic fancies, owing to their vividness, were dreams of people awake, would have more truly spoken so of the fancies of lovers, who, as if their loves were present, converse with them, greet them, chide them.", "768": "For sight seems to paint all other fancies on a wet ground, so soon do they fade and recede from the memory, but the images of lovers, painted by the fancy as it were on encaustic tiles, leave impressions on the memory, that move, and live, and speak, and are permanent for all time.", "769": "The Roman Cato, indeed, said that the soul of the lover resided in the soul of the loved one, and I should extend the remark to the appearance, the character, the life, and the actions, conducted by which he travels a long journey in a short time, as the Cynics say they have found a short cut and, as it were, forced march to virtue, for there is also a short cut to friendship and love when the god is propitious.", "770": "To sum up, the enthusiasm of lovers is not a thing uninspired, and the god that guides and governs it is none other than the god whose festival we are now keeping, and to whom we are now sacrificing.", "771": "Nevertheless, as we judge of a god mainly from his power and usefulness (as among human advantages we reckon and call these two the most divine, dominion and virtue), it is high time to consider, before we proceed any further, whether Love yields to any of the gods in power.", "772": "Certainly, as Sophocles says, ' Wonderful is the power which the Cyprian Queen exerts so as always to win the victory:", "773": "'1 great also is the might of Ares;", "774": "and in some sort we see the power of all the other gods divided among these two;", "775": "for Aphrodite has most intimate con­ nection with the beautiful, and Ares is in our souls from the first to combat against the sordid, to borrow the idea of Plato.", "776": "Let us consider, then, to begin with, that the venereal delight can be purchased for six obols, and that no one ever yet put himself into any trouble or danger about it, unless he was in love.", "777": "And not to mention here such famous courtesans as Phryne or Lais, Gnathænium,' kind­ ling her lamp at evening time,' on the look-out for lovers and inviting them, is often passed by;", "778": "'yet, if some sud­ den whiff arise ' of mighty love and desire, it makes this very delight seem equal to the fabled wealth of Tantalus and his domains.", "779": "So feeble and cloying is the venereal indulgence, if Love inspires it not.", "780": "And you will see this more plainly still from the following consideration.", "781": "Many have allowed others to share in their venereal enjoyments, prostituting not only their mistresses but their wives, like that Roman Galba, who used to ask Mæcenas to dinner, and when he saw from his nods and winks that he had a mind to do with his wife, turned his head gently aside as if asleep;", "782": "but when one of his slaves came up to the table and stole some wine, his eyes were wide open enough, and he said, ' Villain, don't you know that I am asleep only for Maecenas ?

that city, Phayllus thought if he prostituted his wife, who was very handsome, to the King, he would get from him some important office or place.", "786": "And Nicos­ tratus getting wind of this, and walking about the doors of Phayllus' house with some of his servants on the qui vive, Phayllus made his wife put on men's boots, and a military cloak, and a Macedonian broad-brimmed bat, and so smug­ gled her into the King, without being detected, as one of the King's young men.", "787": "But, of all the multitude of lovers, did you ever hear of one that prostituted his boy-love even for the honours of Zeus ?", "788": "I think not.", "789": "Why, though no one will generally either speak or act against tyrants, many will who find them their rivals and are jealous about their handsome minions.", "790": "You must have heard how Aristogiton of Athens, and Antileon of Metapontum, and Melanippus of Agrigentum, rose not against tyrants, although they saw how badly they managed affairs,

diffi­ culty in repelling the enemy's cavalry.", "802": "So they begged that high-souled hero Cleomachus to charge the Eretrian cavalry first.", "803": "And he asked his boy-love, who was by, if he would be a spectator of the fight, and he saying he would, and affectionately kissing him and putting his helmet on his head, Cleomachus with a proud joy put himself at the head of the bravest of the

that so ' Spear should be next to spear, helmet to helmet,'1 seeing that Love is the only invincible general.", "813": "2", "814": "For men in battle will leave in the lurch clansmen and friends, aye, and parents and sons, but what warrior ever broke through or charged through lover and love, seeing that even when there is no necessity lovers frequently display their bravery and contempt of life.", "815": "As There the Thessalian, who put his left hand on a wall, and drew his sword, and chopped off his thumb, and challenged his rival to do the same.", "816": "And another in battle falling on his face, as his enemy was about to give him the coup-de-grace, begged him to wait a little till he could turn round, that his love should not see him with a wound in his back.", "817": "And not only are the most warlike nations most amorous, as the Bœotians the Lacedæmonians and the Cretans, but also of the old heroes, who were more amorous than Meleager, Achilles, Aristomenes, Cimon, and Epaminondas.", "818": "Why, Epaminon­ das had as his boy-loves Asopichus and Cephisodorus, the latter of whom fell with him at Mantinea, and is buried near him.", "819": "As to , who was most formidable and a source of terror to the enemy, Eucnamus of Amphissa, who first stood up against him and smote him, received hero honours from the Phocians for his exploit.", "820": "And as to all the loves of Hercules, it would take up too much time to enumerate them, but those who think that Iolaus was one of them do up to this day worship and honour him, and make their loves swear fidelity at his tomb.", "821": "Hercules is also said, having understood the art of healing, to have preserved the life of Alcestis, when she was given up by the doctors, to gratify Admetus, who passionately loved his wife, and was Hercules' minion.", "822": "They say also in legend that Apollo was enamoured of Admetus, ' And was his hired slave for one long year.'", "823": "It was a happy thought our remembering Alcestis, for though women have not much of Ares in them, yet when possessed by Love they are bold even to the death, beyond what one would expect from their nature.", "824": "For if we may credit legendary lore, the stories about Alcestis, and Protesilaus, and Eurydice the wife of Orpheus, show that the only one of the gods that Hades pays attention to is Love ;", "825": "although to everybody else, as Sophocles says, \" he knows of no forbearance or favour, or anything but strict justice;", "826": "\" yet before lovers his genius stands rebuked, and they alone find him neither implacable nor relentless.", "827": "Wherefore although, my friend, it is an excellent thing to be initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, yet I see that the votaries and initiated of Love have a better time of it in Hades than they have, * * 1 though in regard to legendary lore I stand in the position of one who neither altogether believes nor altogether disbelieves.", "828": "For legendary lore speaks well, and by a certain wonderful good fortune lights upon the truth, in saying that lovers have a return from Hades to the light of day, but it knows not by what way or how, having as it were got benighted on the road which Plato first discovered by philosophy.", "829": "There are, indeed, some slender and obscure particles of truth scattered about in the mythology of the Egyptians, but they require a clever man to hunt them out, a man capable of getting great results from small data.", "830": "Wherefore let that matter pass.", "831": "And now next to the mighty power of Love let us consider its good will and favour to mankind, I do not mean as to whether it bestows many gifts on its votaries­ that is palpable to all-but whether they derive any fur­ ther advantage from it.", "832": "For Euripides, though very amorous, admired a very small matter, when he wrote the line­ e Love teaches letters to a man unlearn'd.'2", "833": "For it makes one previously sluggish quick and intelligent, and, as has been said before, it makes the coward brave, as people harden wood in the fire and make it strong from being weak.", "834": "And every lover becomes liberal and genuine and generous, even if he was mean before, his littleness and miserliness melting away like iron in the fire, so that they rejoice to give to their loves more than they do to receive themselves from others.", "835": "You know of course that Anytus, the son of Anthemion, was in love with Alcibiades, and was on one occasion sumptuously entertaining several of his friends, when Alcibiades broke in and took from the table half the cups and went away again ;", "836": "and when some of the guests were indignant and said, ‛The stripling has used you most insolently and contemptuously,' Anytus replied, 'Nay, rather, he has dealt kindly with me, for when he might have taken all he has left me half.' \"§ XVIII.", "837": "Zeuxippus was pleased with this story, and said, \" 0 Hercules, you have been within an ace of making me forget my hereditary hatred to Anytus for his behaviour to Socrates and philosophy,1 since he was so mild and noble to his love.\" \" Be it so,\" said my father, \" Love also makes peevish and gloomy persons kind and agreeable to those they live with ;", "838": "for as ‛when the fire blazes the house looks brighter,'2 so man, it seems, becomes more cheerful through the beat of love.", "839": "But most people are affected rather curiously;", "840": "if they see by night a light in a house, they look on it with admiration and wonder ;", "841": "but if they see a little, mean, and ignoble soul suddenly filled with noble-mindedness, freedom, dignity, grace, and liberality, they do not feel constrained to say with Telemachus,' Surely, some god is there within.’3", "842": "And is it not wonderful, Daphnæus,” continued my father,' \" in the name of the Graces, that the lover who cares about hardly anything, either his companions and friends, or even the laws and magistrates and kings, who fears nothing, admires nothing, courts nothing, but can even endure to gaze on ‛the forked lightnjng,’5 yet directly he looks on his love he crouches like a cock with drooping feathers,' and his boldness is broken and his pride is cowed.", "843": "And among the Muses it would not be amiss to mention Sappho ;", "844": "for as the Romans say Cacus the son of Hephæstus vomited out of his mouth fire and flames, so she really speaks words that burn like fire, and in her songs shows the warmth of her heart, as Philoxenus puts it, 4 by euphonious songs assuag­ ing the pains of love.'", "845": "And if you have not in your love for Lysandra forgot all your old love-songs, do repeat to us, Daphnæus, the lines in which beautiful Sappho says that 4 when her love appeared her voice failed and her body burned, and she was seized with paleness and trembling and vertigo.' \"", "846": "And when Daphnæus had repeated the lines, my father resumed, “In the name of Zeus, is not this plainly a divine seizure P Is not this a wonderful com­ motion of soul ?", "847": "Why, the Pythian priestess on the tripod is not moved so much as this !", "848": "Who of those inspired by Cybele are made beside themselves to this extent by the flute and the kettledrum ?", "849": "Moreover, while many see the same body and the same beauty, only the lover is taken by it.", "850": "Why is this the case?", "851": "We get no light on it from Menander's words, ‘Love is opportunity;", "852": "and he that is smitten is the only one wounded.'", "853": "But the god is the cause of it, striking one and letting another go scot-free.", "854": "But I will not pass over now, 4 since it has come into my mouth,' as Æschylus says, what perhaps would have been better spoken before, for it is a very important point.", "855": "Perhaps, my friend, of all other things which we do not perceive through the senses, some got believed through legend, some through the law, some through reason ;", "856": "whereas we owe our conception of the gods altogether to the poets and legislators and philosophers:", "857": "all alike teach­ ing the existence of gods, but greatly differing as to their number and order, nature and power.", "858": "For the gods of the philosophers ‘know nothing of disease or old age or pain, and have not to cross the resounding Acheron;", "859": "' nor do the philosophers accept as gods Strifes, or Prayers, which are found in poetry;", "860": "1 nor will they admit Terror and Fear as gods or as the sons of Ares.", "861": "And on many points also they are at variance with the legislators, as Xenophanes bade the Egyptians, if they regarded Osiris as mortal, not to honour him as a god ;", "862": "but if they thought him a god not to mourn for him.", "863": "And, again, the poets and legislators will not listen to, nor can they understand, the philosophers who make gods of ideas and numbers and units and spirits.", "864": "And their views generally are very different.", "865": "As there were formerly three parties at Athens, the Parali, the Epacrii, and the Pediei, all at variance with one another, yet all agreed to vote for Solon, and chose him with one accord as their mediator and ruler and lawgiver, as he seemed indis­ putably to hold the first place in merit;", "866": "so the three parties that entertain different views about the gods are all unani­ mous on one point, for poets legislators and philosophers all alike register Love as one of the gods, loudly singing his praises with one voice,' as Alcæus says the people of Mitylene chose Pittacus as their monarch.", "867": "But our king and ruler and governor, Love, is brought down crowned from Helicon to the Academy by Hesiod and Plato and Solon, and in royal apparel rides in a chariot drawn by friendship and intimacy (not such as Euripides speaks of in the line, 'he has been bound in fetters not of brass,’1 shamefully throwing round him cold and heavy necessity), and soars aloft to the most beautiful and divine things, about which others have spoken better than I can.\"§ xix.", "868": "When my father had spoken thus much, Soclarus began, \" Do you see that a second time you have committed the same fault, not cancelling your debts as you ought to do -for I must speak my mind-but evading them on purpose, and not delivering to us your promised ideas on a sacred subject ?", "869": "For as some little time back you only just touched on Plato and the Egyptians as if unwilling to enter on the subject more fully, so now you are doing again.", "870": "However, as to what has been 1 eloquently told '2 by Plato, or rather by the Muses through Plato's mouth, do not tell us that, my good friend, even if we ask for it;", "871": "but as to your hint that the Egyptian legend about Love corre­ sponded with Plato's views, you need not discuss it fully and minutely, we shall be satisfied if we hear a little of such mighty matters.\"", "872": "And as the rest of the company made the same request, my father said, “The Egyptians, (like the Greeks) recognize two Loves, the Pandemian and the Celestial, to which they add the Sun, they also highly venerate Aphrodite.", "873": "We also see much similarity between Love and the Sun, for neither is a fire, as some think, but a sweet and productive radiance and warmth, the Sun bringing to the body nourishment and light and growth, and Love doing the same to the soul.", "874": "And as the heat of the Sun is more powerful when it emerges from clouds and after mist, so Love is sweeter and hotter after a jealous tiff with the loved one,1 and moreover, as some think the Sun is kindled and extinguished, so also do people conceive of Love as mortal and uncertain.", "875": "Moreover, just as without training the body cannot easily bear the heat of the Sun, so neither can the untrained soul easily bear the yoke of Love, but both are equally out of tune and suffer, for which they blame the deity and not their own weakness.", "876": "But in this respect they seem to differ, in that the Sun exhibits to the eye things beautiful and ugly alike, whereas Love throws its light only on beautiful things, and persuades lovers to concentrate their attention on these, and to neglect all other things.", "877": "As to those that call Aphrodite the Moon, they, too, find some points in common between them;", "878": "for the Moon is divine and heavenly and a sort of halfway­ house between mortal and immortal, but inactive in itself and dark without the presence of the Sun, as is the case with Aphrodite in the absence of Love.", "879": "So we may say that Aphrodite resembles the Moon, and Love the Sun, more than any other deities, yet are not Love and the Sun altogether the same, for just as body and soul are not the same, but something different, so is it with the Sun and Love, the former can be seen, the latter only felt.", "880": "And if it should not seem too harsh a saying, one might argue that the Sun acts entirely opposite to Love, for it turns the mind away from the world of fancy to the world of reality, beguiling us by its grace and splendid appearance, and persuading us to seek for truth and everything else in and round it and nowhere else.", "881": "For as Euripides says, ‘Too passionately do we love the Sun, Because it always shines upon the earth, From inexperience of another life,’1 or rather from forgetfulness of those things which Love brings to our remembrance.", "882": "For as when we are woke by a great and bright light, everything that the soul has seen in dreams is vanished and fled, so the Sun is wont to banish the remembrance of past changes and chances, and to be­ witch the intelligence, pleasure and admiration causing this forgetfulness.", "883": "And though reality is really there, yet the soul cleaves to dreams and is dazzled by what is most beautiful and divine.", "884": "‘For round the soul are poured sweet yet deceiving dreams,' so th it the soul thinks every­ thing here good and valuable, unless it obtain divine and chaste Love as its physician and preserver.", "885": "For Love brings the soul through the body to truth and the region of truth, where pure and guileless beauty is to be found, kindly befriending its votaries like an initiator at the mysteries.", "886": "And it associates with the soul only through the body.", "887": "And as geometricians, in the case of boys who can­ not yet be initiated into the perception of incorporeal and impassive substance, convey their ideas through the medium of spheres, cubes, and dodecahedrons, so celestial Love has contrived beautiful mirrors of beautiful things, and ex­ hibits them to us glittering in the shapes colours and appearances of youths in all their flower, and calmly stirs the memory which is inflamed first by these.", "888": "Consequently some, through the stupidity of their friends and intimates, who have endeavoured by force and against reason to ex­ tinguish the flame, have got no advantage from it, but filled themselves with smoke and confusion, or have rushed into secret and lawless pleasures and ingloriously wasted their prime.", "889": "But as many as by sober reason and modesty have abated the extravagance of the passion, and left in the soul only a bright glow-not exciting a tornado of pas­ sion, but a wonderful and productive diffusion, as in a growing plant, opening the pores of complaisance and friendliness—these in no long time cease to regard the per­ sonal charms of those they love, and study their inward characters, and gaze at one another with unveiled eyes, and associate with one another in words and actions, if they find in their minds any fragment or image of the beautiful;", "890": "and if not they bid them farewell and turn to others, like bees that only go to those flowers from which they can get honey.", "891": "But wherever they find any trace or emanation or pleasing resemblance of the divine, in an ecstasy of pleasure and delight they indulge their memory, and revive to whatever is truly lovely and felicitous and admired by everybody.\"§ xx.", "892": "“The poets indeed seem for the most part to have written and sung about Love in a playful and merry manner, but have sometimes spoken seriously about him, whether out of their own mind, or the god helping them to truth.", "893": "Among these are the lines about his birth, ‘Well-sandalled Iris bare the most powerful of the gods to golden-haired Zephyr.’1", "894": "But perhaps the learned have persuaded you that these lines are only a fanciful illustration of the variety and beauty of love.\" \" Certainly,\" said Daphnæus, “what else could they mean ? \" \" Hear me,\" said my father, \" for the heavenly phenomenon compels us so to speak.", "895": "The rainbow2 is, I suppose, a reflection caused by the sun's rays falling on a moist cloud, making us think the appearance is in the cloud.", "896": "Similarly erotic fancy in the case of noble souls causes a reflection of the memory, from things which here appear and are called beautiful, to what is really divine and lovely and felicitous and wonder­ ful.", "897": "But most lovers pursuing and groping after the semblance of beauty in boys and women, as in mirrors,3 can derive nothing more certain than pleasure mixed with pain.", "898": "And this seems the love-delirium of Ixion, who instead of the joy he desired embraced only a cloud, as children who desire to take the rainbow into their hands, clutching at whatever they see.", "899": "But different is the be- haviour of the noble and chaste lover:", "900": "for he reflects on the divine beauty that can only be felt, while he uses the beauty of the visible body only as an organ of the memory, though he embraces it and loves it, and associating with it is still more inflamed in mind.", "901": "And so neither in the body do they sit ever gazing at and desiring this light, nor after death do they return to this world again, and skulk and loiter about the doors and bedchambers of newly-married people, disagreeable ghosts of pleasure-loving and sensual men and women, who do not rightly deserve the name of lovers.", "902": "For the true lover, when he has got into the other world and associated with beauties as much as is lawful, has wings and is initiated and passes his time above in the presence of his Deity, dancing and waiting upon him, until he goes back to the meadows of the Moon and Aphrodite, and sleeping there commences a new existence.", "903": "But this is a subject too high for the present occasion.", "904": "However, it is with Love as with the other gods, to borrow the words of Euripides, ' he rejoices in being honoured by mankind,’1 and vice versa, for be is most propitious to those that receive him properly, but visits his displeasure on those that affront him.", "905": "For neither does Zeus as god of Hospi­ tality punish and avenge any outrages on strangers or sup­ pliants, nor as god of the family fulfil the curses of parents, as quickly as Love hearkens to lovers unfairly treated, being the chastiser of boorish and haughty persons.", "906": "Why need I mention the story of Euxynthetus and Leucomantis, the latter of whom is called The Peeping Girl to this day in Cyprus ?", "907": "But perhaps you have not heard of the punishment of the Cretan Gorge, a somewhat similar case to that of Leucomantis, except that she was turned into stone as she peeped out of window to see her lover carried out to burial.", "908": "For this Gorge had a lover called Asander, a proper young man and of a good family, but reduced in fortune, though he thought himself worthy to mate with anybody.", "909": "So he wooed Gorge, being a relation of hers, and though he bad many rivals, as she was much run after for her wealth belike, yet he had won the esteem of all the guardians and relations of the young girl.", "910": "2 * * * *§ xxi. * * *", "911": "Now the origins and causes of Love are not peculiar to either sex, but common to both.", "912": "For those attractions that make men amorous may as well proceed from women as from boys.", "913": "1", "914": "And as to those beautiful and holy reminiscences and invitations to the divine and genuine and Olympian beauty, by which the soul soars aloft, what hinders but that they may come either from boys or lads, maidens or grown women, whenever a chaste and orderly nature and beauteous prime are associated together (just as a neat shoe exhibits the shapeliness of the foot, to borrow the illustration of Aristo), whenever connoisseurs of beauty descry in beautiful forms and pure bodies clear traces of an upright and unenervated soul.", "915": "2", "916": "For if3 the man of pleasure, who was asked whether \" he was most given to the love of women or boys,\" and answered, \" I care not which so beauty be but there,\" is considered to have given an appropriate answer as to his erotic desires, shall the noble lover of beauty neglect beauty and nobility of nature, and make love only with an eye to the sexual parts ?", "917": "Why, the lover of horses will take just as much pleasure in the good points of Podargus, as in those of Æthe, Agamemnon's mare,4 and the sportsman rejoices not only in dogs, but also rears Cretan and Spartan bitches,5 and shall the lover of the beautiful and of humanity be unfair and deal unequally with either sex, and think that the difference between the loves of boys and women is only their different dress?", "918": "And yet they say that beauty is a flower of virtue5 and it is ridiculous to assert that the female sex never blossoms nor make a goodly show of virtue, for as AEschylus truly says, ‘I never can mistake the burning eye Of the young woman that has once known man.’8", "919": "Shall the indications then of a forward wanton and corrupt character be found in the faces of women, and shall there be no gleam of chastity and modesty in their appearance?", "920": "Nay, there are many such, and shall they not move and provoke love ?", "921": "To doubt it would be neither sensible nor in accordance with the facts, for generally speaking, as has been pointed out, all these attractions are the same in both sexes ...", "922": "But, Daphnæus, let us combat those views which Zeuxippus lately advanced, making Love to be only irregular desire carrying the soul away to licentiousness, not that this was so much his own view as what he had often beard from morose men who knew nothing of love :", "923": "some of whom marry unfortunate women for their dowries, and force on them economy and illiberal saving, and quarrel with them every day of their lives:", "924": "while others, more desirous of children than wives, when they have made those women they come across mothers, bid farewell to mar­ riage, or regard it not at all, and neither care to love nor be loved.", "925": "Now the fact that the word for conjugal lovo differs only by one letter from the word for endurance, the one being στέργειν the other στέγειν, seems to empha­ size the conjugal kindness mixed by time and intimacy with necessity.", "926": "But that marriage which Love has inspired will in the first place, as in Plato's Republic, know nothing of Meum and Tuum, for the proverb, 4 whatever belongs to a friend is common property,’1 is especially true of married persons who, though disunited in body, are perforce one in soul, neither wishing to be two, nor thinking themselves so.", "927": "In the second place there will be mutual respect, which is a vital necessity in marriage.", "928": "For as to that external respect which has in it more of compulsion than choice, being forced by the law and shame and fear, “Those needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,” 2 that will always exist in wedlock.", "929": "But in Love there is such self-control and decorum and constancy, that if the god but once enter the soul of a licentious man, he makes him give up all his amours, abates his pride, and breaks down his haughtiness and dissoluteness, putting in their place modesty and silence and tranquillity and decorum, and makes him constant to one.", "930": "You have heard of course of the famous courtesan Lais,1 how she set all Greece on fire with her charms, or rather was contended for by two seas,2 and how, when she fell in love with Hippolochus the Thessalian, ‘she left Acro-Corinthus washed by the green sea,’3 and deserted all her other lovers, that great army, and went off to Thessaly and lived faithful to Hippo­ lochus.", "931": "But the women there, envious and jealous of her for her surpassing beauty, dragged her into the temple of Aphrodite, and there stoned her to death, for which reason probably it is called to this day the temple of Aphrodite the Murderess.'", "932": "We have also heard of servant girls who have refused the embraces of their masters, and of private individuals who have scorned an amour with queens, when Love has had dominion in their hearts.", "933": "For as in Rome, when a dictator is proclaimed, all other magistrates lay down their offices, so those over whom Love is lord are free henceforward from all other lords and masters, and pass the rest of their lives dedicate to the god and slaves in his temple.", "934": "For a noble woman united by Love to her lawful husband would prefer the embraces of bears and dragons to those of any other man.\"§ XXII.", "935": "\"Although there are plenty of examples of this virtue of constancy, yet to you, that are the festive votaries of the god,5 it will not be amiss to relate the story of the Galatian Gamma.", "936": "She was a woman of most remarkable beauty, and the wife of the tetrarch Sinatus, whom Sinorix, one of the most influential men in Galatia, and desperately in love with Gamma, murdered, as he could neither get her by force or persuasion in the lifetime of her husband.", "937": "And Gamma found a refuge and comfort in her grief in discharging the functions of hereditary priestess to Artemis, and most of her time she spent in her temple, and, though many kings and potentates wooed her, she refused them all.", "938": "But when Sinorix boldly proposed marriage to her, she declined not his offer, nor blamed him for what he had done, as though she thought he had only murdered Sinatus out of excessive love for her, and not in sheer villany.", "939": "He came, therefore, with confidence, and asked her hand, and she met him and greeted him and led him to the altar of the goddess, and pledged him in a cup of poisoned mead, drinking half of it herself and giving him the rest.", "940": "And when she saw that he had drunk it up, she shouted aloud for joy, and calling upon the name of her dead husband, said, ' Till this day, dearest husband, I have lived, deprived of you, a life of sorrow:", "941": "but now take me to yourself with joy, for I have avenged you on the worst of men, as glad to share death with him as life with you.'", "942": "Then Sinorix was removed out of the temple on a litter, and soon after gave up the ghost, and Camma lived the rest of that day and following night, and is said to have died with a good courage and even with gaiety.", "943": "\"1§ XXIII.", "944": "\"As many similar examples might be adduced, both among ourselves and foreigners, who can feel any patience with those that reproach Aphrodite with hinder­ ing friendship when she associates herself with Love as a partner?", "945": "Whereas any reflecting person would call the love of boys wanton and gross lasciviousness, and say with the poet:", "946": "' This is an outrage, not an act of love.'", "947": "All willing pathics, therefore, we consider the vilest of man­ kind, and credit them with neither fidelity, nor modesty, nor friendship, for as Sophocles says:", "948": "‘Those who shall lose such friends may well be glad, And those who have such pray that they may lose them.", "949": "’2But as for those who, not being by nature vicious, have been seduced or forced, they are apt all their life to despise and hate their seducers, and when an opportunity has presented itself to take fierce vengeance.", "950": "As Crateus, who murdered Archelaus, and Pytholaus, who murdered Alexander of Pherme.", "951": "And Periander, the tyrant of the Ambraciotes, having asked a most insulting question of his minion, was murdered by him, so exasperated was he.", "952": "But with women and wives all this is the beginning of friendship, and as it were an initiation into the sacred mysteries.", "953": "And pleasure plays a very small part in this, but the esteem and favour and mutual love and constancy that result from it, proves that the Delphians did not talk nonsense in giving the name of Arma1 to Aphrodite, nor Homer in giving the name of friendship2 to sexual love, and testifies to the fact that Solon was a most experienced legislator in conjugal matters, seeing that he ordered husbands not less than thrice a month to associate with their wives, not for pleasure, but as states at certain intervals renew their treaties with one another, so he wished that by such friendliness marriage should, as it were, be renewed after any intervening tiffs and differences.", "954": "But you will tell me there is much folly and even madness in the love of women.", "955": "Is there not more extravagance in the love of boys ?", "956": "‘Seeing my many rivals I grow faint.", "957": "The lad is beardless, smooth and soft and handsome, O that I might in his embraces die, And have the fact recorded on my tomb.'", "958": "Such extravagant language as this is madness not love.", "959": "And it is absurd to detract from woman's various ex­ cellence.", "960": "Look at their self-restraint and intelligence, their fidelity and uprightness, and that bravery courage and magnanimity so conspicuous in many!", "961": "And to say that they have a natural aptitude for all other virtues, but are deficient as regards friendship alone, is monstrous.", "962": "For they are fond of their children and husbands, and generally speaking the natural affection in them is not only, like a fruitful soil, capable of friendship, but is also accompanied by persuasion and other graces.", "963": "And as poetry gives to words a kind of relish by melody and metre and rhythm, making instruction thereby more in­ teresting, but what is injurious more insidious, so nature, investing woman with beautiful appearance and attractive voice and bewitching figure, does much for a licentious woman in making her wiles more formidable, but makes a modest one more apt thereby to win the goodwill and friendship of her husband.", "964": "And as Plato advised Xeno­ crates, a great and noble man in all other respects, but too austere in his temperament, to sacrifice to the Graces, so one might recommend a good and modest woman to sacrifice to Love, that her husband might be a mild and agreeable partner, and not run after any other woman, so as to be compelled to say like the fellow in the comedy, ' What a wretch I am to ill-treat such a woman!'", "965": "For to love in marriage is far better than to be loved, for it prevents many, Day all, of those offences which spoil and mar marriage.", "966": "§ xxiv.", "967": "As to the passionate affection in the early days of marriage,1 my dear Zeuxippus, do not fear that it will leave any sore or irritation, though it is not wonderful that there should be some friction at the commencement of union with a virtuous woman, just as at the grafting of trees, as there is also pain at the beginning of conception, for there can be no complete union without some suffering.", "968": "Learning puts boys out somewhat when they first go to school, as philosophy does young men at a later day, but the ill effects are not lasting, either in their cases or in the case of lovers.", "969": "As in the fusion of two liquors, love does indeed at first cause a simmering and commotion, but eventually cools down and settles and becomes tranquil.", "970": "For the union of lovers is indeed a complete union, whereas the union of those that live together without love resembles only the friction and concussion of Epicurus' atoms in collision and recoil, forming no such union as Love makes, when he presides over the conjugal

for itself unlawful meats, and abstains from no action what- ever,\" and enjoys lawlessness as far as is practicable in visions and phantasies, that end in no complete pleasure or satisfaction, but

cheerfulness and fearlessness and courage supply a calm serenity free from storms;", "1361": "for otherwise, even if hope or delight smile on the soul, it is soon confused and dis­ turbed by care

honey to a man who is bilious, and laying out a sumptuous banquet for people who are suffering from dysentery, and can neither retain their food nor get any benefit from it, but are made even worse by it.", "1364": "Have you never observed how sick persons turn against and spit out and refuse the daintiest and most costly viands, though people offer them and almost force them down their throats, but on another occasion, when their condition is different, their respiration good, their blood in a healthy state, and their natural warmth restored, they get up, and enjoy and make a good meal of

live daintily and be a king in poverty, and enjoy a quiet and private life as much as the public life of general or states­ man.", "1368": "By the aid of philosophy you will live not unplea­ santly,

I propose to discuss what is called and appears to be moral virtue (which differs mainly from contemplative virtue in that it has emotion for its matter, and reason for its form), what its nature is, and how it subsists, and whether that part of the soul which takes it in is furnished with reason of its own, or participates in something foreign, and if the latter, whether as things that are mixed with something better than themselves, or rather as that which is subject to superintendence and command, and may be said to share in the power of that which commands.", "1374": "For I think it is clear that virtue can exist and continue alto­ gether free from matter and mixture.", "1375": "My best course will be to run briefly over the views of others, not so much to display my research as because, when their ideas have been set forth, mine will become more clear and be on a firmer basis.§ II.", "1376": "Menedemus of Eretria took away the number and differences of virtues, on the ground that virtue was one though it had many names;", "1377": "for that just as mortal is synonymous with man, so temperance and bravery and justice were the same thing.", "1378": "And Aristo of Chios also made virtue one in substance, and called it soundness of mind :", "1379": "its diversities and varieties only existing in certain relations, as if one called our sight when it took in white objects white-sight, and when it took in black objects black-sight, and so on.", "1380": "For virtue, when it considers what it ought to do and what it ought not to do, is called prudence ;", "1381": "and when it curbs passion, and sets a fit and proper limit to pleasure, it is called self-control;", "1382": "and when it is associated with our dealings and covenants with one another, it is called justice ;", "1383": "just as a knife is one article, though at different times it cuts different things in half :", "1384": "and so, too, fire acts on different matter though it has but one property.", "1385": "And Zeno of Cittium seems to incline somewhat to the same view, as he defines prudence in dis­ tribution as justice, in choice as self-control, in endurance is fortitude:", "1386": "and those who defend these views maintain that by the term prudence Zeno means knowledge.", "1387": "But Jhrysippus, thinking each particular virtue should be arranged under its particular quality, unwittingly stirred up, to use Plato's language, \"a whole swarm of virtues,” 1 unusual and unknown.", "1388": "For as from brave we get bravery, and from mild mildness, and from just justice, so from acceptable he got acceptableness, and from good good­ ness, and from great greatness, and from the honourable honourableness, and he made virtues of many other such clevernesses, affabilities, and versatilities, and filled philo­ sophy, which did not at all require it, with many strange names.§ III.", "1389": "Now all these agree in supposing virtue to be a disposition and faculty of the governing part of the soul set in motion by reason, or rather to be reason itself con­ formable and firm and immutable.", "1390": "They think further that the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is not by any natural difference distinct from the reasoning part, but that that same part of the soul, which they call intel­ lect and the leading principle of action, being altogether diverted and changed by the passions, and by the alterations which habit or disposition have brought about, becomes either vice or virtue, without having in itself any unreason­ ing element, but that it is called unreasoning when, by the strong and overpowering force of appetite, it launches out into excesses contrary to the direction of reason.", "1391": "For passion, according to them, is only vicious and intemperate reason, getting its strength and power from bad and faulty judgement.", "1392": "But all of those philosophers seem to have been ignorant that we are all in reality two-fold and com­ posite, though they did not recognize it, and only saw the more evident mixture of soul and body.", "1393": "And yet that there is in the soul itself something composite and two-fold and dissimilar (the unreasoning part of it, as if another body, being by necessity and nature mixed up with and united to reason), seems not to have escaped the notice even of Pythagoras, as we infer from his zeal for music, which be introduced to calm and soothe the soul, as knowing that it was not altogether amenable to precept and instruction, or redeemable from vice only by reason, but that it needed some other persuasion and moulding and softening influence to co-operate with reason, unless it were to be altogether intractable and refractory to philosophy.", "1394": "And Plato saw very plainly and confidently and decidedly that the soul of this universe is not simple or uncomposite or uniform, but is made up of forces that work uniformly and differently, in the one case it is ever marshalled in the same order and moves about in one fixed orbit, in the other case it is divided into motions and orbits contrary to each other and changing about, and thus generates differences in things.", "1395": "So, too, the soul of man, being a part or portion of the soul of the universe, and compounded upon similar principles and proportions, is not simple or entirely uniform, but has one part intelligent and reasoning, which is intended by nature to rule and dominate in man, and another part un­ reasoning, and subject to passion and caprice, and dis­ orderly, and in need of direction.", "1396": "And this last again is divided into two parts, one of which, being most closely connected with the body, is called desire, and the other, sometimes taking part with the body, sometimes with reason, lending its influence against the body, is called anger.", "1397": "And the difference between reason and sense on the one hand, and anger and desire on the other, is shown by their antipathy to one another, so that they are often at variance with one another as to what is best.", "1398": "1", "1399": "These were at first2 the views of Aristotle, as is clear from his writings, though afterwards he joined anger to desire, as if anger were nothing but a desire and passion for revenge.", "1400": "How­ ever, he always considered the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul as distinct from the reasoning, not that it is altogether unreasoning as the perceptive, or nutritive, or vegetative portions of the soul, for these are always deaf and disobedient to reason, and in a certain sense are off­ shoots from the flesh, and altogether attached to the body;", "1401": "but the emotional, though it is destitute of any reason of its own, yet is naturally inclined to listen to reason and sense, and turn and submit and mould itself accordingly, unless it be entirely corrupted by brute pleasure and a life of indulgence.", "1402": "§ IV.", "1403": "As for those who wonder that what is unreasoning should obey reason, they do not seem to me to recognize the power of reason, how great it is, and how far-reaching its dominion is-a power not gained by harsh and repelling methods, but by attractive ones, as mild persuasion which always accomplishes more than compulsion or violence.", "1404": "For even the spirit and nerves and bones, and other parts of the body, though devoid of reason, yet at any instigation of reason, when she shakes as it were the reins, are all on the alert and compliant and obedient, the feet to run, and the hands to throw or lift, at her bidding.", "1405": "Right excel­ lently has the poet set forth in the following lines the sympathy and accordance between the unreasoning and reason :", "1406": "­ “", "1407": "Thus were her beauteous cheeks diffused with tears, Weeping her husband really present then.", "1408": "But though Odysseus pitied her in heart, His eyes like horn or steel impassive stood Within their lids, and craft his tears repressed.”", "1409": "1", "1410": "So completely under the control of judgement did he keep his spirit and blood and tears.", "1411": "The same is shown by the subsidence of our passions, which are laid to rest in the presence of handsome women or boys, whom reason and the law forbid us to touch ;", "1412": "a case which most frequently happens to lovers, when they hear that they have unwit­ tingly fallen in love with a sister or daughter.", "1413": "For at once passion is laid at the voice of reason, and the body exhibits its members as subservient to decorum.", "1414": "And fre­ quently in the case of dainty food, people very much attracted by it, if they find out at the time or learn after­ wards that they have eaten what is unclean or unlawful, not only suffer distress and grief in their imagination, but even their very body is upset by the notion, and violent retchings and vomitings follow.", "1415": "1", "1416": "I fear I should seem to be introducing merely novel and enticing arguments, if I 1 were to enumerate stringed instruments and lyres, and harps and flutes, and other harmonious musical instruments, which, although inanimate, yet speak to man's passions, rejoicing with him, and mourning with him, and chiming in with him, and rioting with him,—in a word, falling in with the vein and emotions and characters of those that play on them.", "1417": "And they say that Zeno on one occasion, going into the theatre when Amœbeus 2 was playing on the harp, said to the pupils, \" Let us go and learn what music can be produced by guts and nerves and wood and bones, when they preserve proportion and time and order.\"", "1418": "But passing these things over, I would gladly learn from them, if, when they see dogs and horses and birds domes­ ticated, and by habit and training uttering sounds that can be understood, and making obedient movements and gestures, and acting quietly and usefully to us, and when they notice that Achilles in Homer cheers on horses as well as men to the fight,3 they still wonder and doubt, whether the passionate and emotional and painful and pleasurable elements in us are by nature obedient to the voice of reason, and influenced and affected by it, seeing that those elements are not apart from us or detached from us, or formed from outside, or hammered into us by force, but are innate in us, and ever associate with us, and are nourished within us, and abound in us through habit.", "1419": "Accordingly moral character is well called by the Greeks ἡ̃θος, for it is, to speak generally, a quality of the unrea­ soning element in man, and is called ἡ̃θος because the un­ reasoning element moulded by reason receives this quality and difference by habit, which is called ἔθος.4", "1420": "Not that reason wishes to expel passion altogether (that is neither possible, nor advisable), but only to keep it within bounds and order, and to engender the moral virtues, which are not apathetic, but hold the due proportion and mean in regard to passion.", "1421": "And this she does by reducing the power of passion to a good habit.", "1422": "For there are said to be three things existing in the soul, power, passion, and habit.", "1423": "Power is the principle or matter of passion, as power to be angry, ashamed, or confident:", "1424": "and passion is the actual setting in motion of that power, being itself anger, con­ fidence, or shame;", "1425": "and habit is the strong formation of power in the unreasoning element engendered by use, being vice if the passions are badly tutored by reason, virtue if they are well tutored.", "1426": "§ v.", "1427": "But since they do not regard every virtue as a mean, nor call it moral, we must discuss this difference by approaching the matter more from first principles.", "1428": "Some things in the world exist absolutely, as the earth, the sky, the stars, and the sea;", "1429": "others have relation to us, as good and evil, as what is desirable or to be avoided, as pleasant and painful:", "1430": "and since reason has an eye to both of these classes, when it considers the former it is scientific and contempt dive, when it considers the latter it is deliberative and practical.", "1431": "And prudence is the virtue in the latter case, as knowledge in the former.", "1432": "And there is this diffe­ rence between prudence and knowledge, prudence consists in applying the contemplative to the practical and emotional so as to make reason paramount.", "1433": "On which account it often needs the help of fortune;", "1434": "whereas knowledge needs neither the help of fortune nor deliberation to gain its ends:", "1435": "for it considers only things which are always the same.", "1436": "And as the geometrician does not deliberate about the triangle, as to whether its interior angles are together equal to two right angles, for he knows it as a fact-and deliberation only takes place in the case of things which differ at different times, not in the case of things which are certain and unchangeable—so the contemplative mind having its scope in first principles, and things that are fixed, and that ever have one nature which does not admit of change, has no need for deliberation.", "1437": "But prudence, which has to enter into matters full of obscurity and confusion, frequently has to take its chance, and to deliberate about things which are uncertain, and, in carrying the deliberation into practice, has to co- operate with the unreasoning element, which comes to its help, and is involved in its decisions, for they need an impetus.", "1438": "Now this impetus is given to passion by the moral character, an impetus requiring reason to regulate it, that it may render moderate and not excessive help, and at the seasonable time.", "1439": "For the emotional and unreasoning elements are subject to motions sometimes too quick and vehement, at other times too remiss and slow.", "1440": "And so everything we do may be a success from one point of view, but a failure from many points of view ;", "1441": "as to hit the mark one thing only is requisite, but one may miss it in various ways, as one may shoot beyond or too short.", "1442": "This then is the function of practical reason following nature, to prevent our passions going either too far or too short.", "1443": "For where from weakness and want of strength, or from fear and hesitation, the impetus gives in and abandons what is good, there reason is by to stir it up and rekindle it;", "1444": "and where on the other hand it goes ahead too fast and in disorder, there it represses and checks its zeal.", "1445": "And thus setting bounds to the emotional motions, it engenders in the un­ reasoning part of the soul moral virtues, which are the mean between excess and deficiency.", "1446": "Not that we can say that all virtue exists in the mean, but knowledge and prudence being in no need of the unreasoning element, and being situated in the pure and unemotional part of the soul, is a complete perfection and power of reason, whereby we get the most divine and happy fruit of understanding.", "1447": "But that virtue which is necessary because of the body, and needs the help of the passions as an instrument towards the practical, not destroying or doing away with but ordering and regulating the unreasoning part of the soul, is per­ fection as regards its power and quality, but in quantity is is a mean correcting both excess and deficiency.", "1448": "§ vi.", "1449": "But since the word mean has a variety of meanings -for there is one kind of mean compounded of two simple extremes, as grey is the mean between white and black;", "1450": "and there is another kind of mean, where that which con­ tains and is contained is the mean between the containing and contained, as eight is the mean between twelve and four;", "1451": "and there is a third kind of mean which has part in neither extreme, as the indifferent is the mean between good and bad,-virtue cannot be a mean in any of these ways.", "1452": "For neither is it a mixture of vices, nor containing that which is defective is it contained by that which is excessive, nor is it again altogether free from emotional storms of passion, wherein are excess and deficiency.", "1453": "But it is, and is commonly so called, a mean like that in music and harmony.", "1454": "For as in music there is a middle note between the highest and lowest in the scale, which being perfectly in tune avoids the sharpness of the one and the flatness of the other;", "1455": "so virtue, being a motion and power in the unreasoning part of the soul, takes away the remiss­ ness and strain, aud generally speaking the excess and defect of the appetite, by reducing each of the passions to a state of mean and rectitude.", "1456": "For example, they tell us that bravery is the mean between cowardice and foolhardi­ ness, whereof the former is a defect, the latter an excess of anger :", "1457": "and that liberality is the mean between stinginess and prodigality :", "1458": "and that meekness is the mean between insensibility and savageness :", "1459": "and so of temperance and justice, that the latter, being concerned with contracts, is to assign neither too much nor too little to litigants, and that the former ever reduces the passions to the proper mean between apathy (or insensibility) and gross intemperance.", "1460": "This last illustration serves excellently to show us the radical difference between the unreasoning and reasoning parts of the soul, and to prove to us that passion and reason are wide as the poles asunder.", "1461": "For the difference would not be discernible between temperance and conti­ nence, nor between intemperance and incontinence, in pleasure and desires, if the appetite and judgement were in the same portion of the soul.", "1462": "Now temperance is a state, wherein reason holds the reins, and manages the passions as a quiet and well-broken-in animal, finding them obedient and submissive to the reins and masters over their desires.", "1463": "Continence on the other hand is not driven by reason without some trouble, not being docile but jibbing and kicking, like an animal compelled by bit and bridle and whip and backing, being in itself full of struggles and com­ motion.", "1464": "Plato explains this by his simile of the chariot- horses of the soul, the worse one of which ever kicking against the other and disturbing the charioteer, he is obliged ever to hold them in with all his might, and to tighten the reins, lest, to borrow the language of Simonides, \" he should drop from his hands the purple reins.\"", "1465": "And so they do not consider continence to be an absolute virtue, but something less than a virtue;", "1466": "for no mean arises from the concord of the worse with the better, nor is the excess of the passion curtailed, nor does the appetite obey or act in unison with reason, but it both gives and suffers trouble, and is constrained by force, and is as it were an enemy in a town given up to faction. \"", "1467": "The town is full of incense, and at once Resounds with triumph-songs and bitter wailing.\"", "1468": "1 Such is the state of soul of the continent person owing to his conflicting condition.", "1469": "On the same grounds they con­ sider incontinence to be something less than vice, but intemperance to be a complete vice.", "1470": "For it, having both its appetite and and reason depraved, is by the one carried away to desire disgraceful things,2 by the other, through bad judgement consenting to desire, loses even the percep­ tion of wrongdoing.", "1471": "But incontinence keeps its judgement sound through reason, but is carried away against its judge­ ment by passion which is too strong for reason, whence it differs from intemperance.", "1472": "For in the one case reason is mastered by passion, in the other it does not even make a fight against it, in the one case it opposes its desires even when it follows them, in the other it is their advocate and even leader, in the one case it gladly participates in what is wrong, in the other sorrowfully, in the one case it willingly rushes into what is disgraceful, in the other it abandons the honourable unwillingly.", "1473": "And as there is a difference in their deeds, so no less manifest is the difference in their language.", "1474": "For these are the expressions of the intemperate. \"", "1475": "What grace or pleasure in life is there without golden Aphrodite ?", "1476": "May I die, when I care no longer for these things !”", "1477": "And another says, \" To eat, to drink, to enjoy the gifts of Aphrodite is everything, for all other things I look upon as supplementary,\" as if from the bottom of his soul he gave himself up to pleasures, and was completely subverted by them.", "1478": "And not less so he who said, \" Let me be ruined, it is best for me,\" had his judgement diseased through his passion.", "1479": "But the sayings of incontinence are quite different, as \"", "1480": "My nature forces me against ray judgement,”1 and \" Alas!", "1481": "it is poor mortals' plague and bane, To know the good, yet not the good pursue.\"", "1482": "2 And again­", "1483": "“My anger draws me on, has no control, 'Tis but a sandy hook against a tempest.\"", "1484": "Here he compares not badly to a sandy hook, a sorry kind of anchor, the soul that is unsettled and has no steady reason, but surrenders judgment through flabbiness and feebleness.", "1485": "And not unlike this image are the lines, “ As some ship moored and fastened to the shore, If the wind blows, the cables cannot hold it.\"", "1486": "By cables he means the judgement which resists what is disgraceful, though sometimes it gives way under a tre­ mendous storm of passion.", "1487": "For indeed it is with full sail that the intemperate man is borne on to pleasure by his desires, and surrenders himself to them, and even plays the part of pilot to the vessel ;", "1488": "whereas the incontinent Yuan is dragged sidelong into the disgraceful, and is its vic­ tim, as it were, while he desires eagerly to resist and over­ come his passion, as Timon bantered Anaxarchus :", "1489": "\"", "1490": "The recklessness and frantic energy of Anaxarchus to rush any­ where seemed like a dog's courage, but he being aware of it was miserable, so people said, but his voluptuous nature ever plunged him into excesses again, nature which even most sophists are afraid of.\"", "1491": "For neither is the wise man continent but temperate, nor the fool incontinent but intem­ perate ;", "1492": "for the one delights in what is good, and the other is not vexed at what is bad.", "1493": "Incontinence, therefore, is a mark of a sophistical soul, endued with reason which can­ not abide by what it knows to be right.§ VII.", "1494": "Such, then, are the differences between inconti­ nence and intemperance, and continence and temperance have their counterpart and analogous differences;", "1495": "for re­ morse and trouble and annoyance are companions of con­ tinence, whereas in the soul of the temperate person there is everywhere such equability and calm and soundness, by which the unreasoning is adjusted and harmonized to reason, being adorned with obedience and wonderful mild­ ness, that looking at it you would say with the poet, \"", "1496": "At once the wind was laid, and a wondrous calm ensued, for the god alloyed the fury of the waves,”1 reason having ex­ tinguished the vehement and furious and frantic motions of the desires, and making those which nature necessarily requires sympathetic and obedient and friendly and co­ operative in carrying purposes out in action, so that they do not outrun or come short of reason, or behave disorderly and disobediently, but that every appetite is tractable, \" as sucking foal runs by the side of its dam.”", "1497": "2", "1498": "And this con­ firms the saying of Xenocrates about true philosophers, that they alone do willingly what all others do unwillingly at the compulsion of the Jaw, as dogs are turned away from their pleasures by a blow, or cats by a noise, looking at nothing but their danger.", "1499": "It is clear then that there is in the soul a perception of such a generic and specific difference in relation to the desires, as of something fight­ ing against and opposing them.", "1500": "But some say that there is no radical distinction difference or variance between reason and passion, but that there is a shifting of one and the same reason from one to the other, which escapes our notice owing to the sharpness and quickness of the change, so that we do not see at a glance that desire and repent­ ance, anger and fear, giving way to what is disgraceful through passion, and recovery from the same, are the same natural property of the soul.", "1501": "For desire and fear and anger and the like they consider only depraved opinions and judgements, not in one portion of the soul only but in all its leading principles, inclinations and yieldings, and assents and impulses, and generally speaking in its energies soon changed, like the sallies of children, whose fury and excessive violence is unstable by reason of their weakness.", "1502": "But these views are, in the first place, contrary to evidence and observation;", "1503": "for no one observes in himself a change from passion to judgement, and from judgement back to passion ;", "1504": "nor does anyone cease from loving when he reflects that it would be well to break the affair off and strive with all his might against it;", "1505": "nor again, does he put on one side reflection and judgement, when he gives way and is over­ come by desire.", "1506": "Moreover, when he resists passion by reason, he does not escape passion altogether;", "1507": "nor again, when he is mastered by passion does he fail to discern his fault through reason :", "1508": "so that neither by passion does he abolish reason, nor does he by reason get rid of passion, but is tossed about to and fro alternately between passion and reason.", "1509": "And those who suppose that the leading principle in the soul is at one time desire, and at another time reason in opposition to desire, are not unlike people who would make the hunter and the animal he hunts one and the same person, but alternately changing from hunter to animal, from animal to hunter.", "1510": "As their eyesight is plainly defi­ cient, so these are faulty in regard to their perceptions, seeing that they must perceive in themselves not a change of one and the same thing, but a difference and struggle between two opposing elements. \"", "1511": "What then,\" say they, “ does not the deliberative element in a man often hold different views, and is it not swayed to different opinions as to expediency, and yet it is one and the same thing ?\"", "1512": "Certainly, I reply;", "1513": "but the case is not similar.", "1514": "For the rational part of the soul does not fight against itself, but though it has only one faculty, it makes use of different reasonings;", "1515": "or rather the reasoning is one, but employs itself in different subjects as on different matter.", "1516": "And so there is neither pain in reasonings without passion, nor are men compelled, as it were, to choose something contrary to their judgement, unless indeed some passion, as in a balance, secretly predominates in the scale.", "1517": "For this often happens, reason not opposing reason, but ambition, or contention, or favour, or jealousy, or fear opposing reason, that we do but think there is a difference between two reasons, as in the line, \" They were ashamed to refuse, and feared to accept,”1 or, \" To die in battle is dreadful but glorious;", "1518": "but not to die, though cowardly, is more pleasant.\"", "1519": "Moreover, in judge­ ments about contracts passions come in and cause the greatest delay;", "1520": "and in the councils of kings those who speak to ingratiate themselves do not favour either of the two cases, but give themselves up to passion without re­ gard to what is expedient;", "1521": "and so those that rule in aris­ tocracies do not allow orators to be pathetic in their plead­ ings.", "1522": "For reasoning without passion has a direct tendency to justice, while if passion is infused, a contest and diffe­ rence is excited between pleasure and pain on the one hand, and judgement and justice on the other.", "1523": "For otherwise how is it that in philosophical speculations people are with little pain frequently induced by others to change their opinions, and even Aristotle himself and Democritus and Chrysippus have rejected without trouble or pain, and even with pleasure, some of the opinions which they for­ merly advocated ?", "1524": "For no passion stands in the way in the theoretic and scientific part of the soul, and the un­ reasoning element is quiet and gives no trouble therein.", "1525": "And so reason gladly inclines to the truth, when it is evident, and abandons error;", "1526": "for in it, and not in passion, lies a willingness to listen to conviction and to change one's opinions on conviction.", "1527": "But the deliberations and judgements and arbitrations of most people as to matters of fact being mixed up with passion, give reason no easy or pleasant access, as she is held fast and incommoded by the unreasonable, which assails her through pleasure, or fear, or pain, or desire.", "1528": "And the decision in these cases lies with sense which has dealings with both passion and reason, for if one gets the better of the other the other is not destroyed, but only dragged along by force in spite of its resistance.", "1529": "For he who is dissatisfied with himself for falling in love calls in reason to his aid to overcome his passion, for both reason and passion are in his soul, and he perceives they are contrary one to the other, and violently represses the inflammatory one of the two.", "1530": "On the other hand, in deliberations and speculations without passion (such as the contemplative part of the soul is most con. versant with), if they are evenly balanced no decision takes place, but the matter is left in doubt, which is a sort of stationary position of the mind in conflicting arguments.", "1531": "But should there be any inclination to one of the two sides, the most powerful opinion carries the day, yet without giv­ ing pain or creating hostility.", "1532": "And, generally speaking, when reason seems opposed to reason, there is no percep­ tion of two distinct things, but only of one under different phases, whereas when the unreasoning has a controversy with reason, since there can be no victory or defeat with­ out pain, forthwith they tear the soul in two,1 and make the difference between them apparent.§ VIlI.", "1533": "And not only from their contest, but quite as much from their agreement, can we see that the source of the passions is something quite distinct from that of reason.", "1534": "For since2 one may love either a good and excellent child or a bad and vicious one, and be unreasonably angry with one's children or parents, yet in behalf of them show a just anger against enemies or tyrants ;", "1535": "as in the one case there is the perception of a difference and struggle between pas­ sion and reason, so in the other there is a perception of persuasion and agreement inclining, as it were, the scale, and giving their help.", "1536": "Moreover a good man marrying a wife according to the laws is minded to associate and live with her justly and soberly, but as time goes on, his intercourse with her having engendered a strong passion for her, he perceives that his love and affection are increased by reason.", "1537": "Just so, again, young fellows falling in with kindly teachers at first submit themselves to them out of necessity and emulation for learning, but end by loving them, and instead of being their pupils and scholars become and get the titleof their lovers.", "1538": "The same is the case in cities in respect to good magistrates, and neighbours, and connections by marriage;", "1539": "for beginning at first to associate with one another from necessity and propriety, they afterwards go on to love almost insensibly, reason drawing over and persuading the emotional element.", "1540": "And he who said­ \"", "1541": "There are two kinds of shame, the one not bad, The other a sad burden to a family,”1 is it not clear that he felt this emotion in himself often contrary to reason and detrimental by hesitation and delay to opportunities and actions ?§ ix.", "1542": "In a certain sense yielding to the force of these arguments, they call shame modesty, pleasure joy, and timidity caution;", "1543": "nor would anyone blame them for this euphemism, if they only gave those specious names to the emotions that are consistent with reason, while they gave other kinds of names to those emotions that resist and do violence to reason.", "1544": "But whenever, though convicted by their tears and tremblings and changes of colour, they avoid the terms pain and fear, and speak of bitings and states of excitement, and gloss over the passions by calling them inclinations, they seem to contrive evasions and flights from facts by names sophistical, and not philosophical.", "1545": "And yet again they seem to use words rightly when they call those joys and wishes and cautions not apathies but good conditions of the mind.", "1546": "For it is a happy disposition of the soul when reason does not annihilate passion, but orders and arranges it in the case of temperate persons.", "1547": "But what is the condition of worthless and incontinent persons, who, when they judge they ought to love their father and mother better than some boy or girl they are enamoured of, yet cannot, and yet at once love their mistress or flat­ terer, when they judge they ought to hate them ?", "1548": "For if passion and judgement were the same thing, love and hate would immediately follow the judging it right to love and hate, whereas the contrary happens, passion following some judgements, but declining to follow others.", "1549": "Wherefore they acknowledge, the facts compelling them to do so, that every judgement is not passion, but only that judgement that is provocative of violent and excessive impulse:", "1550": "ad- mitting that judgement and passion in us are something different, as what moves is different from what is moved.", "1551": "Even Chrysippus himself, by his defining in many places endurance and continence to be habits that follow the lead of reason, proves that he is compelled by the facts to admit, that that element in us which follows absolutely is some­ thing different from that which follows when persuaded, but resists when not persuaded.", "1552": "§ x. Now as to those who make all sins and offences equal, it is not now the occasion to discuss if in other respects they deviate from truth:", "1553": "but as regards the pas­ sions 1 they seem to go clean contrary to reason and evi­ dence.", "1554": "For according to them every passion is a sin, and everyone who grieves, or fears, or desires, commits sin.", "1555": "But in good truth it is evident that there are great diffe­ rences between passions, according as one is more or less affected by them.", "1556": "For who would say that the craven fear of Dolon 2 was not something very different from the fear of Ajax, \" who retreated with his face to the enemy and at a foot's pace, drawing back slowly knee after knee \" ? 3", "1557": "Or who would say that the grief of Plato at the death of Socrates was identical with the grief of Alexander at the death of Clitus, when he attempted to lay violent hands on himself ?", "1558": "For grief is beyond measure intensified by falling out against expectation :", "1559": "and the calamity that comes un­ looked for is more painful than that we may reasonably fear:", "1560": "as if when expecting to see one's friend basking in pros­ perity and admiration, one should hear that he had been put to the torture, as Parmenio heard about Philotas.", "1561": "And who would say that the anger of Magas against Philemon was equal to that of Nicocreon against Anaxarchus ?", "1562": "Both Magas and Nicocreon had been insulted, but whereas Nicocreon brayed Anaxarchus to death with iron pestles and made mincemeat of him, Magas contented himself with bidding the executioner lay his naked sword on Philemon's neck, and then let him go.'", "1563": "And so Plato called anger the nerves of the mind, since it can be both intensified by bitterness, and slackened by mildness.", "1564": "To evade these and similar arguments, they deny that intensity and excess of passion are according to judgement, wherein is the pro­ pensity to fault, but maintain that they are bites and con­ tractions and diffusings capable of increase or diminution through the unreasoning element.", "1565": "And yet it is evident that there are differences as regards judgements;", "1566": "for some judge poverty to be no evil, while others judge it to be a great evil, and others again the very greatest evil, insomuch that they even throw themselves headlong down rocks and into the sea on account of it.", "1567": "Again as to death, some think it an evil only in depriving us of good things, whereas others think it so in regard to eternal punishments and awful torments in the world below.", "1568": "Health again is valued by some as natural and advantageous, while to others it seems the greatest blessing of life, in comparison with which they reckon little either of wealth or children or \" royal power that makes one equal to the gods,\" and at last come to think even virtue useless and unprofitable, if health be absent.", "1569": "Thus it is clear that even with regard to judge­ ments themselves some err more, some less.", "1570": "But I shall bring no further proof of this now, but this one may assume therefrom, that they themselves concede that the unreason­ ing element is something different from judgement, in that they allow that by it passion becomes greater and more violent, and while they quarrel about the name and word they give up the thing itself to those who maintain that the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is distinct from the reasoning and judging element.", "1571": "And in his treatise on Anomaly,1 Chrysippus, after telling us that anger is blind, and frequently does not let one see what is obvious, frequently also obscures what we do get a sight of, goes on to say, \" The encroachment of the passions blots out reason, and makes things look different to what they should look, violently forcing people on unreasonable acts.\"", "1572": "And he quotes as witness Menander, who says, \" Alas !", "1573": "poor me, wherever were my brains in my body at the time when I chose that line of conduct, and not this ? \"", "1574": "And Chrysippus proceeds, \" Though every living creature en­ dowed with reason is naturally inclined to use reason and to be governed by it on every occasion, yet often do we reject it, being borne away by a more violent impulse;", "1575": "\" thus admitting what results from the difference between passion and reason.", "1576": "For otherwise it is ridiculous, as Plato says, to argue that a man is sometimes better than himself, sometimes worse, sometimes master of himself, sometimes not master of himself.", "1577": "§ xi.", "1578": "For how is it possible that the same person can be both better and worse than himself, both master of himself and not master, unless everyone is in some way twofold, having in himself both a better and worse self ?", "1579": "For so he that makes the baser element subject to the better has self- control and is a superior man, whereas he who allows the nobler element of the soul to follow and be subservient to the incorrigible and unreasoning element, is inferior to what he might be, and is called incontinent, and is in an unnatural condition.", "1580": "For by nature it appertains to reason, which is divine, to rule and govern the unreasoning ele­ ment, which has its origin from the body, which it also naturally resembles and participates in its passions, being placed in it and mixed up with it, as is proved by the im­ pulses to bodily delights, which are always fierce or languid according to the changes of the body.", "1581": "And so it is that young men are keen and vehement in their desires, being red hot and raging from their fulness of blood and animal heat, whereas with old men the liver, which is the seat of desire, is dried up and weak and feeble, and reason has more power with them than passion which decays with the body.", "1582": "This principle also no doubt characterizes the nature of animals as regards the sexual appetite.", "1583": "For it is not of course from any fitness or unfitness of opinions, that some animals are so bold and resolute in the presence of danger, while others are helpless and full of fear and trembling;", "1584": "but this difference of emotion is produced by the workings of the blood and spirit and body, the emotional part growing out of the flesh, as from a root, and carrying along with it its quality and temperament.", "1585": "And that the body of man sympathizes with and is affected by the emotional impulses is proved by pallors, and blushings, and tremblings, and palpitations of the heart, as on the other hand by an all­ pervading joy in the hope and expectation of pleasures.", "1586": "But whenever the mind is by itself and unmoved by pas­ sion, the body is in repose and at rest, having no partici­ pation or share in the working of the intellect, unless it involve the emotional, or the unreasoning element call it in.", "1587": "So that it is clear that there are two distinct parts of the soul differing from one another in their faculties.", "1588": "§ XII.", "1589": "And generally speaking of all existing things, as they themselves admit and is clear, some are governed by nature, some by habit, some by an unreasoning soul, some by a soul that has reason and intelligence.", "1590": "Man too par­ ticipates in all this, and is subject to all those differences here mentioned, for he is affected by habit, and nourished by nature, and uses reason and intelligence.", "1591": "He has also a share of the unreasoning element, and has the principle of passion innate in him, not as a mere episode in his life but as a necessity, which ought not therefore to be entirely rooted out, but requires care and attention.", "1592": "For the function of reason is no Thracian or Lycurgean one to root up and destroy all the good elements in passion indis­ criminately with the bad, but, as some genial and mild god, to prune what is wild, and to correct disproportion, and after that to train and cultivate the useful part.", "1593": "For as those who are afraid to get drunk do not pour on the ground their wine, but mix it with water, so those who are afraid of the disturbing element in passion do not eradicate passion altogether but temper it.", "1594": "Similarly with oxen and horses people try to restrain their mad bounds and restive­ ness, not their movements and powers of work, and so reason makes use of the passions when they have become tame and docile, not by cutting out the sinews or altogether mutilating the serviceable part of the soul.", "1595": "For as Pindar says, “ The horse to the chariot, and the ox to the plough, while he that meditates destruction for the boar must find a staunch hound.”", "1596": "1", "1597": "But much more useful than these are the whole tribe of passions when they wait on reason and run parallel to virtue.", "1598": "Thus moderate anger is useful to courage, and hatred of evil to uprightness, and righteous indignation against those who are fortunate beyond their deserts, when they are inflamed in their souls with folly and insolence and need a check.", "1599": "And no one if they wished could pluck away or sever1 natural affection from friend­ ship, or pity from philanthropy, or sympathy both in joy and grief from genuine good-will.", "1600": "And if those err who wish to banish love because of erotic madness, neither are they right who blame all desire because of love of money, but they act like people who refuse to run because they might stumble, or to throw because they might throw wide of the mark, or object to sing altogether because they might make a false note.", "1601": "For as in sounds music does not create melody by the banishment of sharps and flats, and as in bodies the art of the physician procures health not by the doing away of cold and heat but by their being blended in due proportions and quantities, so is victory won in the soul by the powers and motions of the passions being reduced by reason to moderation and due proportion..", "1602": "For excessive grief or fear or joy in the soul (I speak not of mere joy grief or fear), resembles a body swollen or inflamed.", "1603": "And Homer when he says excellently, “ The brave man's colour never changes, nor Is he much frightened,”1 does not take away all fear but only excessive fear, that bravery may not become recklessness, nor confidence fool­ hardiness.", "1604": "So also in regard to pleasure we must do away with excessive desire, and in regard to vengeance with excessive hatred of evil.", "1605": "For so in the former case one will not be apathetic but temperate, and in the latter one will not be savage or cruel but just.", "1606": "But if the passions were entirely removed, supposing that to be possible, reason would become in many duller and blunter, like the pilot in the absence of a storm.", "1607": "And no doubt it is from having noticed this that legislators try to excite in states ambition and emulation among their townsmen, and stir up and increase their courage and pugnacity against enemies by the sound of trumpets and flutes.", "1608": "For it is not only in poems, as Plato says, that he that is inspired by the Muses, and as it were possessed by them, will laugh to shame the plodding artist, but also in fighting battles passion and en­ thusiasm will be irresistible and invincible, such as Homer makes the gods inspire men with, as in the line, “ Thus speaking he infused great might in Hector, The shepherd of the people.", "1609": "1 and, “ He is not mad like this without the god,\"2 as if the god had added passion to reason as an incitement and spur.", "1610": "And you may see those very persons, whose opinions I am combating, frequently urging on the young by praises, and frequently checking them by rebukes, though pleasure follows the one, pain the other.", "1611": "For rebukes and censure produce repentance and shame, the one bringing grief, the other fear, and these they mostly make use of for purposes of correction.", "1612": "And so Diogenes, when Plato was being praised, said, \" What has he to vaunt of, who has been a philosopher so long, and yet never gave pain to anyone ? \"", "1613": "For one could not say, to use the words of Xenocrates, that the mathematics are such handles to philosophy as are the emotions of young men, such as shame, desire, repentance, pleasure, pain, ambition, whereon reason and the law laying a suitable grip succeed in putting the young man on the right road.", "1614": "So that it was no bad remark of the Lacedæmonian tutor, that he would make the boy entrusted to his charge pleased with what was good and displeased with what was bad,3 for a higher or nobler aim cannot be proposed in the education fit for a freeborn lad.§", "1615": "I. What amount of argument, Sossius Senecio, will make a man know that he is improving in respect to virtue, if his advances in it do not bring about some diminution in folly, but vice, weighing equally with all his good inten­ tions, \" acts like the lead that makes the net go down ?", "1616": "”1 For neither in music nor grammatical knowledge could anyone recognize any improvement, if he remained as unskilful in them as before, and had not lost some of his old ignorance.", "1617": "Nor in the case of anyone ill would medical treatment, if it brought no relief or ease, by the disease somewhat yielding and abating, give any perception of improvement of health, till the opposite condition was corn - pletely brought about by the body recovering its full strength.", "1618": "But just as in these cases there is no improve­ ment unless, by the abatement of what weighs them down till they rise in the opposite scale, they recognize a change, so in the case of those who profess philosophy no improvement or sign of improvement can be supposed, unless the soul lay aside and purge itself of some of its imperfection, and if it continue altogether bad until it become absolutely good and perfect.", "1619": "For indeed a wise man cannot in a moment of time change from absolute badness to perfect goodness, and suddenly abandon for ever all that vice, of which he could not during a long period of time divest himself of any portion.", "1620": "And yet you know, of course, that those who maintain these views fre­ quently give themselves much trouble and bewilderment about the difficulty, that a wise man does not perceive that he has become wise, but is ignorant and doubtful that in a long period of time by little and little, by remov­ ing some things and adding others, there will be a secret and quiet improvement, and as it were passage to virtue.", "1621": "But if the change were so great and sudden that the worst man in the morning could become the best man at night, or should the change so happen that he went to bed vicious and woke up in the morning wise, and, having dismissed from his mind all yesterday's follies and errors, should say, \"False dreams, away, you had no meaning then!\"2 who on earth could be ignorant of so great a change happening to himself, of virtue blazing forth so completely all at once P I myself am of opinion that anyone, like Caeneus,1 who, according, to his prayer, got changed from a woman into a man, would sooner be ignorant of the transformation, than that a man should become at once, from a cowardly and senseless person with no powers of self-control, brave and sensible and perfect master of him­ self, and should in a moment change from a brutish life to a divine without being aware of it.", "1622": "§ II.", "1623": "That was an excellent observation, Measure the stone by the mason's rule, not the rule by the stoned But the Stoics, not applying dogmas to facts but facts to their own preconceived opinions, and forcing things to agree that do not by nature, have filled philosophy with many difficulties, the greatest of which is that all men but the perfect man are equally vicious, which has produced the enigma called progress, one little short of extreme folly, since it makes those who have not at once under its guidance given up all passions and disorders equally un­ fortunate as those who have not got rid of a single vile propensity.", "1624": "However they are their own confuters, for while they lay down in the schools that Aristides was as unjust as Phalaris, and Brasidas as great a craven as Dolon, and Plato actually as senseless as Meletus, in life and its affairs they turn away from and avoid one class as implac­ able, while they make use of the others and trust them in most important matters as most worthy people.§ III.", "1625": "But we who see that in every kind of evil, but especially in a disordered and unsettled state of mind, there are degrees of more and less (so that the progress made differs in different cases, badness abating, as a shadow flees away, under the influence of reason, which calmly illuminates and cleanses the soul), cannot consider it un­ reasonable to think that the change will be perceived, as people who come up out of some ravine can take note of the progress they make upwards.", "1626": "Look at the case from the following point of view first.", "1627": "Just as mariners sailing with full sail over the gaping3 ocean measure the course they have made by the time they have taken and the force of the wind, and compute their progress accordingly, so anyone can compute his progress in philosophy by his con­ tinuous and unceasing course, by his not making many halts on the road, and then again advancing by leaps and bounds, but by his quiet and even and steady march forward guided by reason.", "1628": "For the words of the poet, \"If to a little you keep adding a little, and do so frequently, it will soon be a lot, are not only true of the increase of money, but are universally applicable, and especially to increase in virtue, since reason invokes to her aid the enormous force of habit.", "1629": "On the other hand the inconsistencies and dul­ nesses of some philosophers not only check advance, as it were, on the road, but even break up the journey altogether, since vice always attacks at its leisure and forces back whatever yields to it.", "1630": "2", "1631": "The mathematicians tell us that planets, after completing their course, become stationary;", "1632": "but in philosophy there is no such intermission or stationary position from the cessation of progress, for its nature is ever to be moving and, as it were, to be weighed in the scales, sometimes being overweighted by the good preponderating, sometimes by the bad.", "1633": "If, therefore, imitating the oracle given to the Amphictyones by the god, \" to fight against the people of Cirrha every day and every night,”3 you are con­ scious that night and day you ever maintain a fierce fight against vice, not often relaxing your vigilance, or long off your guard, or receiving as heralds to treat of peace' the pleasures, or idleness, or stress of business, you may reason­ ably go forward to the future courageously and confidently.", "1634": "§ IT.", "1635": "Moreover, if there be any intermissions in philo­ sophy, and yet your later studies are firmer and more con­ tinuous than your former ones, it is no bad indication that your sloth has been expelled by labour and exercise ;", "1636": "for the contrary is a bad sign, when after a short time your lapses from zeal become many and continuous, as if your zeal were dying away.", "1637": "For as in the growth of a reed, which shoots up from the ground finely and beautifully to an even and con- . tinuous height, though at first from its great intervals it is hindered and baffled in its growth, and afterwards through its weakness is discouraged by any breath of air, and though strengthened by many and frequent joints, yet a violent wind gives it commotion and trembling, so those who at first make great launches out into philosophy, and after­ wards find that they are continually hindered and baffled, and cannot perceive that they make any progress, finally get tired of it and cry off.", "1638": "\"", "1639": "But he who is as it were winged,\" 1 is by his simplicity borne along to his end, and by his zeal and energy cuts through impediments to his progress, as merely obstacles on the road.", "1640": "As it is a sign of the growth of violent love, not so much to rejoice in the presence of the loved one, for everyone does that, as to be distressed and grieved at his absence,2 so many feel a liking for philosophy and seem to take a wonderful interest in the study, but if they are diverted by other matters and business their passion evaporates and they take it very easily. \"", "1641": "But whoever is strongly smitten with love for his darling ” 3 will show his mildness and agreeableness in the presence of and joint pursuit of wisdom with the loved one, but if he is drawn away from him and is not in his company you will see him in a stew and ill at ease and peevish whether at work or leisure, and unreasonably for­ getful of his friends, and wholly impelled by his passion for philosophy.", "1642": "For we ought not to rejoice at discourses only when we hear them, as people like perfumes only when they smell them, and not to seek or care about them in their absence, but in the same condition as people who are hungry and thirsty are in if torn away from food and drink, we ought to follow after true proficiency in philosophy, whether marriage, or wealth, or friendship, or military ser­ vice, strike in and produce a separation.", "1643": "For just as more is to be got from philosophy, so much the more does what we fail to obtain trouble us.", "1644": "§ v.", "1645": "Either precisely the same as this or very similar is Hesiod's1 very ancient definition of progress in virtue, namely, that the road is no longer very steep or arduous, but easy and smooth and level, its roughness being toned down by exercise, and casting the bright light of philosophy on doubt and error and regrets, such as trouble those who give themselves to philosophy at the outset, like people who leave a land they know, and do not yet descry the land they are sailing to.", "1646": "For by abandoning the common and familiar, before they know and apprehend what is better, they frequently flounder about in the middle and are fain to return.", "1647": "As they say the Roman Sextius, giving up for philosophy all his honours and offices in Rome, being after­ wards discontented with philosophy from the difficulties he met with in it at first, very nearly threw himself out of window.", "1648": "Similarly they relate of Diogenes of Sinope,2 when he began to be a philosopher, that the Athenians were celebrating a festival, and there were public banquets and shows and mutual festivities, and drinking and re­ velling all night, and he, coiled up in a corner of the market- place intending to sleep, fell into a train of thought likely seriously to turn him from his purpose and shake his resolution, for he reflected that he had adopted without any necessity a toilsome and unusual kind of life, and by his own fault sat there debarred of all the good things.", "1649": "At that moment, however, they say a mouse stole up and be­ gan to munch some of the crumbs of his barley-cake, and he plucked up his courage and said to himself, in a railing and chiding fashion, \"What say you, Diogenes?", "1650": "Do your leavings give this mouse a sumptuous meal, while you, the gentleman, wail and lament because you are not getting drunk yonder and reclining on soft and luxurious couches ? \"", "1651": "Whenever such depressions of mind are not frequent, and the mind when they take place quickly recovers from them, after having put them to flight as it were, and when such annoyance and distraction is easily got rid of, then one may consider one's progress in virtue as a certainty.", "1652": "§ vi.", "1653": "And since not only the things that in themselves shake and turn them in the opposite direction are more powerful in the case of weak philosophers, but also the serious advice of friends, and the playful and jeering objec­ tions of adversaries bend and soften people, and have ere now shaken some out of philosophy altogether, it will be no slight indication of one's progress in virtue if one takes all this very calmly, and is neither disturbed nor aggravated by people who tell us and mention to us that some of our former comrades are flourishing in kings' courts, or have married wives with dowries, or are attended by a crowd of friends when they come down to the forum to solicit some office or advocateship.", "1654": "He that is not moved or affected by all this is already plainly one upon whom philosophy has got a right hold;", "1655": "for it is impossible that we should cease to be envious of what most people admire, unless the admiration of virtue was strongly im­ planted in us.", "1656": "For over-confidence may be generated in some by anger and folly, but to despise what men admire is not possible without a true and steady elevation of mind.", "1657": "And so people in such a condition of mind, comparing it with that of others, pride themselves on it, and say with Solon, \" We would not change virtue for wealth, for while virtue abides,wealth changes hands, and now one man, now another, has it.\"", "1658": "1 And Diogenes compared his shifting about from Corinth to Athens, and again from Thebes to Corinth, to the different residences of the King of Persia, as his spring residence at Susa, his winter residence at Babylon, and his summer residence in Media.", "1659": "And Agesilaus said of the great king, \" How is he better than me, if he is not more upright ? ”", "1660": "And Aristotle, writing to Antipater about Alexander, said, \" that he ought not to think highly of himself because he had many subjects, for anyone who had right notions about the gods was entitled to think quite as highly of himself.,, And Zeno, observing that Theo­ pbrastus was admired for the number of his pupils,2 said, \" His choir is, I admit, larger than mine, but mine is more harmonious.\"§ VII.", "1661": "Whenever then, by thus comparing the advantages of virtue with external things, you get rid of envies and jealousies and those things which fret and depress the minds of many who are novices in philosophy, this also is a great indication of your progress in virtue.", "1662": "Another and no slight indication is a change in the style of your discourses.", "1663": "For generally speaking all novices in philosophy adopt most such as tend to their own glorification;", "1664": "some, like birds, in their levity and ambition soaring to the height and brightness of physical things ;", "1665": "others like young puppies, as Plato1 says, rejoicing in tearing and biting, betake themselves to strifes and questions and sophisms;", "1666": "but most plunging themselves into dialectics immediately store themselves for sophistry ;", "1667": "and some collect sentences3 and histories and go about (as Anacharsis said he saw the Greeks used money for no other purpose but to count it up), merely piling up and comparing them, but making no practical use of them.", "1668": "Applicable here is that saying of Antiphanes, which someone applied to Plato's pupils.", "1669": "Antiphanes said playfully that in a certain city words were frozen directly they were spoken, owing to the great cold, and were thawed again in the summer, so that one could then hear what had been said in the winter.", "1670": "So he said of the words which were spoken by Plato to young men, that most of them only understood them late in life when they were become old men.", "1671": "And this is the condition people are in in respect to all philoso­ phy, until the judgement gets into a sound and healthy state, and begins to adapt itself to those things which can produce character and greatness of mind, and to seek discourses whose footsteps turn inwards rather than outwards, to borrow the language of Æsop.", "1672": "3", "1673": "For as Sophocles said he had first toned down the pompous style of Æschylus, then his harsh and over-artificial method, and had in the third place changed his manner of diction, a most important point and one that is most intimately connected with the character, so those who go in for philosophy, when they have passed from flattering and artificial discourses to such as deal with character and emotion, are beginning to make genuine and modest progress in virtue.", "1674": "§ vInI.", "1675": "Furthermore, take care, in reading the writings of philosophers or hearing their speeches, that you do not attend to words more than things, nor get attracted more by what is difficult and curious than by what is serviceable and solid and useful.", "1676": "And also, in studying poems or history, let nothing escape you of what is said to the point, which is likely either to correct the character or to calm the passions.", "1677": "For as Simonides says the bee hovers among the flowers \" making the yellow honey,”1 while others value and pluck flowers only for their beauty and fragrance, so of all that read poems for pleasure and amusement he alone that finds and gathers what is valuable seems capable of knowledge from his acquaintance with and friendship for what is noble and good.", "1678": "2", "1679": "For those who study Plato and Xenophon only for their style, and cull out only what is pure and Attic, and as it were the dew and the bloom, do they not resemble people who love drugs for their smell and colour, but care not for them as anodynes or purges, and are not aware of those properties ?", "1680": "Whereas those who have more proficiency can derive benefit not from dis­ courses only, but from sights and actions, and cull what is good and useful, as is recorded of Æschylus and other similar kind of men.", "1681": "As to AEschylus, when he was watching a contest in boxing at the Isthmus, and the whole theatre cried out upon one of the boxers being beaten, he nudged with his elbow Ion of Chios, and said, \" Do you observe the power of training ?", "1682": "The beaten man holds his peace, while the spectators cry out.\"", "1683": "And Brasidas having caught hold of a mouse among some figs, being bitten by it let it go, and said to himself, \" Hercules, there is no creature so small or weak that it will not fight for its life !", "1684": "\"", "1685": "And Diogenes, seeing a lad drinking water out of the palm of his hand, threw away the cup which he kept in his wallet.", "1686": "So much does attention and assiduous practice make people perceptive and receptive of what contributes to virtue from any source.", "1687": "And this is the case still more with those who mix discourses with actions, who not only, to use the language of Thucydides,1 it exercise themselves in the presence of danger,\" but also in regard to pleasures and strifes, and judgements, and advocateships, and magis­ trateships make a display of their opinions, or rather form their opinions by their practice.", "1688": "For we can no more think those philosophers who are ever learning and busy and in­ vestigating what they have got from philosophy, and then straightway publish it in the market-place or in the haunt of young men, or at a royal supper-party, any more than we give the name of physicians to those who sell drugs and mixtures.", "1689": "Nay rather such a sophist differs very little at all from the bird described in Homer,2 offering his scholars like it whatever he has got, and as it feeds its callow young from its own mouth, \" though it goes ill with itself,\" so he gets no advantage or food from what he has got for himself.", "1690": "§ ix.", "1691": "We must therefore see to it that our discourse be serviceable to ourselves, and that it may not appear to others to be vain-glorious or ambitious, and we must show that we are as willing to listen as to teach, and especially must we lay aside all disputatiousness and love of strife in controversy, and cease bandying fierce words with one another as if we were contending with one another at boxing, and leave off rejoicing more in smiting and knock­ ing down one another than in learning and teaching.", "1692": "For in such cases moderation and mildness, and to commence arguing without quarrelsomeness and to finish without get­ ting into a rage, and neither to be insolent if you come off best in the argument, nor dejected if you come off worst, is a sufficient sign of progress in virtue.", "1693": "Aristippus was an ex­ cellent example of this, when overcome in argument by the sophistry of a man, who had plenty of assurance, but was generally speaking mad or balf-witted.", "1694": "Observing that he was in great joy and very puffed up at his victory, he said, \"I who have been vanquished in the argument shall have a better nights rest than my victor.\"", "1695": "We can also test ourselves in regard to public speaking, if we are not timid and do not shrink from speaking when a large audience has unexpectedly been got together, nor dejected when we have only a small one to harangue to, and if we do not, when we have to speak to the people or before some magistrate, miss the opportunity through want of proper preparation;", "1696": "for these things are recorded both of Demosthenes and Alci­ biades.", "1697": "As for Alcibiades, though he possessed a most excellent understanding, yet from want of confidence in speaking he often broke down, and in trying to recall a word or thought that slipped his memory had to stop short.", "1698": "1", "1699": "And Homer did not deny that his first line was unmetrical,2 though he had sufficient confidence to follow it up by so many other lines, so great was his genius.", "1700": "Much more then ought those who aim at virtue and what is noble to lose no opportunity of public speaking, paying very little attention to either uproar or applause at their speeches.", "1701": "§ x.", "1702": "And not only ought each to see to his discourses but also to his actions whether he regards utility more than show, and truth more than display.", "1703": "For if a genuine love for youth or maiden seeks no witnesses, but is con­ tent to enjoy its delights privately, far more does it become the philosopher and lover of the beautiful, who is con­ versant with virtue through his actions, to pride himself on his silence, and not to need people to praise or listen to him.", "1704": "As that man who called his maid in the house, and cried out to her, “ See, Dionysia, I am angry no longer,”3 so he that does anything agreeable and polite, and then goes and spreads it about the town, plainly shows that he looks for public applause and has a strong propensity to vain-glory, and as yet has no acquaintance with virtue as a reality but only as a dream, restlessly roving about amid phantoms and shadows, and making a display of whatever he does as painters display a picture.", "1705": "It is therefore a sign of progress in virtue not merely to have given to a friend or done a good turn to an acquaintance without mention­ ing it to other people, but also to have given an honest vote among many unjust ones, and to have withstood the dis­ honourable request of some rich man or of some man in office, and to have been above taking bribes, and, by Zeus, to have been thirsty all night and not to have drunk, or, like Agesilaus,1 to have resisted, though strongly tempted, the kiss of a handsome youth or maiden, and to have kept the fact to oneself and, been silent about it.", "1706": "For one's being satisfied with one's own good opinion2 and not despising it, but rejoicing in it and acquiescing in it as competent to see and decide on what is honourable, proves that reason is rooted and grounded within one, and that, to borrow the language of Democritus, one is accustomed to draw one's delights from oneself.", "1707": "And just as farmers behold with greater pleasure those ears of corn which bend and bow down to the ground, while they look upon those that from their lightness stand straight upright as empty pretenders, so also among those young men who wish to be philosophers those that are most empty and without any solidity show the greatest amount of assurance in their appearance and walk, and a face full of haughtiness and contempt that looks down on everybody, but when they begin to grow full and get some fruit from study they lay aside their proud and vain3 bearing.", "1708": "And just as in vessels that contain water the air is excluded, so with men that are full of solid merit their pride abates, and their estimate of themselves becomes a lower one, and they cease to plume themselves on a long beard and threadbare cloak,4 and transfer their training to the mind, and are most severe and austere to themselves, while they are milder in their intercourse with everybody else;", "1709": "and they do not as before eagerly snatch at the name and reputation of philosopher, nor do they write themselves down as such, but even if he were addressed by that title by anyone else, an ingenuous young man would say, smiling and blushing, \"I am not a god:", "1710": "why do you liken me to the immortals ? \"", "1711": "1 For as AEschylus says, \" I never can mistake the burning eye", "1712": "Of the young woman that has once known man,”2 so to the young man who has tasted of true progress in philo­ sophy the following lines of Sappho are applicable, \"My tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth, and a fire courses all over my lean body,\" and his eye will be gentle and mild, and you would desire to hear him speak.", "1713": "For as those who are initiated come together at first with confusion and noise and jostle one another, but when the mysteries are being performed and exhibited, they give their attention with awe and silence, so also at the commencement of philosophy you will see round its doors much confusion and assurance and prating, some rudely and violently jostling their way to reputation, but be who once enters in, and sees the great light, as when shrines are open to view, assumes another air and is silent and awe-struck, and in humility and decorum follows reason as if she were a god.", "1714": "And the playful remark of Menedemus seems to suit these very well.", "1715": "He said that the majority of those who went to school at Athens became first wise, and then philosophers, after that orators, and as time went on became ordinary kind of people, the more they had to do with learning, so much the more laying aside their pride and high estimate of themselves.§ XI.", "1716": "Of people that need the help of the physician some, if their tooth ache or even finger smart, run at once to the doctor, others if they are feverish send for one and implore his assistance at their own home, others who are melan­ choly or crazy or delirious will not sometimes even see the doctor if he comes to their house, but drive him away, or avoid him, ignorant through their grievous disease that they are diseased at all.", "1717": "Similarly of those who have done what is wrong some are incorrigible, being hostile and in­ dignant and furious at those who reprove and admonish them, while others are meeker and bear and allow reproof.", "1718": "Now, when one has done what is wrong, to offer one­ self for reproof, toexpose the case and reveal one's wrong­ doing, and not to rejoice if it lies hid, or be satisfied if it is not known, but to make confession of it and ask for inter­ ference and admonishment, is no small indication of pro­ gress in virtue.", "1719": "And so Diogenes said that one who wished to do what was right ought to seek either a good friend or red-hot enemy, that either by rebuke or mild entreaty he might flee from vice.", "1720": "But as long as anyone, making a display of dirt or stains on his clothes, or a torn shoe, prides himself to outsiders on his freedom from arrogance, and, by Zeus, thinks himself doing something very smart if be jeers at himself as a dwarf or hunchback, but wraps up and conceals as if they were ulcers the inner vileness of his soul and the deformities of his life, as his envy, his malignity, his littleness, his love of pleasure, and will not let anyone touch or look at them from fear of disgrace, such a one has made little progress in virtue, yea rather none.", "1721": "But he that joins issue with his vices, and shows that he himself is even more pained and grieved about them than anyone else, or, what is next best, is able and willing to listen patiently to the reproof of another and to correct his life accordingly, he seems truly to be disgusted at his depravity and resolute to divest himself of it.", "1722": "We ought certainly to be ashamed of and shun every appear­ ance of vice, but he who is more put about by his vice itself than by the bad reputation that ensues upon it, will not mind either hearing it spoken against or even speaking against it himself if it make him a better man.", "1723": "That was a witty remark of Diogenes to a young man, who when seen in a tavern retired into the kitchen :", "1724": "\"", "1725": "The more,\" said he, \"you retire, the more are you in the tavern.\"", "1726": "1", "1727": "Even so the more a vicious man denies his vice, the more does it insinuate itself and master him :", "1728": "as those people really poor who pretend to be rich get still more poor from their false display.", "1729": "But he who is really making progress in virtue imitates Hippocrates, who confessed publicly and put into black and white that he had made a mistake about the sutures of the skull,1 for he will think it monstrous, if that great man declared his mistake, that others might not fall into the same error, and yet he himself for his own deliverance from vice cannot bear to be shown he is in the wrong, and to confess his stupidity and ignorance.", "1730": "Moreover the sayings of Bion and Pyrrho will test not so much one's progress as a greater and more perfect habit of virtue.", "1731": "Bion maintained that his friends might think they had made progress, when they could listen as patiently to abuse as to such language as the following, \" Stranger, you look not like a bad or foolish person,\" 2 \" Health and joy go with you, may the gods give you happiness!\"", "1732": "8", "1733": "While as to Pyrrho they say, when he was at sea and in peril from a storm, that he pointed out a little pig that was quietly enjoying some grain that had been scattered about, and said to his companions that the man who did not wish to be disturbed by the changes and chances of life should attain a similar composedness of mind through reason and philosophy.", "1734": "§", "1735": "XII.", "1736": "Look also at the opinion of Zeno, who thought that everybody might gauge his progress in- virtue by his dreams, if he saw himself in his dreams pleasing himself with nothing disgraceful, and neither doing nor wishing to do anything dreadful or unjust, but that, as in the clear depths of a calm and tranquil sea, his fancy and passions were plainly shown to be under the control of reason.", "1737": "And this had not escaped the notice of Plato,4 it seems, who had earlier expressed in form and outline the part that fancy and unreason played in sleep in the soul that was by nature tyrannical, \" for it attempts incest,\" he says, \" with its mother, and procures for itself unlawful meats, and gives itself up to the most abandoned desires, such as in daytime the law through shame and fear debars people from.\"", "1738": "As then beasts of burden that have been well-trained do not, even if their driver let go the reins, attempt to turn aside and leave the proper road, but go forward orderly as usual, pursuing their way without stumbling, so those whose un­ reason has become obedient and mild and tempered by reason, will not easily wish, either in dreams or in illnesses, to deal insolently or lawlessly through their desires, but will keep to their usual habits, which acquire their power and force by attention.", "1739": "For if the body can by training make itself and its members so subject to control, that the eyes in sorrow can refrain from tears, and the heart from pal­ pitating in fear, and the passions can be calm in the presence of beautiful youths and maidens, is it not far more likely that the training of the passions and emotions of the soul will allay, tame down, and mould their propensities even in dreams ?", "1740": "A story is told about the philosopher Stilpo,l that he thought he saw in a dream Poseidon angry with him because he had not sacrificed an ox to him, as was usual among the Megarians:", "1741": "2 and that he, not a bit fright­ ened, said, \" What are you talking about, Poseidon ?", "1742": "Do you come here as a peevish boy, because I have not with borrowed money filled the town with the smell of sacrifice, and have only sacrificed to you out of what I had at home on a modest scale ? \"", "1743": "Then he thought that Poseidon smiled at him, and held out his right hand, and said that for his sake he would give the Megarians a large shoal of anchovies.", "1744": "Those, then, that have such pleasant, clear, and painless dreams, and no frightful, or harsh, or malignant, or untoward apparition, may be said to have reflections of their progress in virtue;", "1745": "whereas agitation and panics and ignoble flights, and boyish delights, and lamentations in the case of sad and strange dreams, are like the waves that break on the coast, the soul not having yet got its proper com­ posure, but being still in course of being moulded by opinions and laws, from which it escapes in dreams as far as possible, so that it is once again set free and open to the passions.", "1746": "Do you investigate all these points too, as to whether they are signs of progress in virtue, or of some.", "1747": "habit which has already a settled constancy and strength through reason.", "1748": "§ XIII.", "1749": "Now since entire freedom from the passions is a great and divine thing, and progress in virtue seems, as we say, to consist in a certain remissness and mildness of the passions, we must observe the passions both in them­ selves and in reference to one another to gauge the diffe­ rence :", "1750": "in themselves as to whether desire, and fear, and rage are less strong in us now than formerly, through our quickly extinguishing their violence and heat by reason;", "1751": "and in reference to one another as to whether we are ani­ mated now by modesty more than by fear, and by emulation more than by envy, and by love of glory rather than by love of riches, and generally speaking whether—to use the language of musicians-it is in the Dorian more than in the Lydian measures that we err either by excess or de­ ficiency,1 whether we are plainer in our manner of living or more luxurious, whether we are slower in action or quicker, whether we admire men and their discourses more than we should or despise them.", "1752": "For as it is a good sign in diseases if they turn aside from vital parts of the body, so in the case of people who are making progress in virtue, when vice seems to shift to milder passions, it is a sign it will soon die out.", "1753": "When Phrynis added to the seven chords two chords more, the Ephors asked him which he preferred to let them cut off, the upper or lower ones ;", "1754": "2 so we must cut off both above and below, if we mean to attain to the mean and to due proportion :", "1755": "for progress in virtue first diminishes the excess and sharpness of the passions, ‟ That sharpness for which madmen are so vehement,\" as Sophocles says.§ xiv.", "1756": "I have already said that it is a very great indica­ tion of progress in virtue to transfer our judgement to action, and not to let our words remain merely words, but to make deeds of them.", "1757": "A manifestation of this is in the first place emulation as regards what we praise, and a zeal to do what we admire, and an unwillingness either to do or allow what we censure.", "1758": "To illustrate my meaning by an example, it is probable that all Athenians praised the daring and bravery of Miltiades;", "1759": "but Themistocles alone said that the trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep, but woke him up of a night, and not only praised and admired him, but manifestly emulated and imitated his glorious actions.", "1760": "Small, therefore, can we think the progress we have made, as long as our admiration for those who have done noble things is barren, and does not of itself incite us to imitate them.", "1761": "For as there is no strong love without jealousy, so there is no ardent and energetic praise of virtue, which does not prick and goad one on, and make one not envious but emulous of what is noble, and desirous to do something similar.", "1762": "For not only at the discourses of a philosopher ought we, as Alcibiades said,1 to be moved in heart and shed tears, but the true proficient in virtue, comparing his own deeds and actions with those of the good and perfect man, and grieved at the same time at the knowledge of his own deficiency, yet rejoicing in hope and desire, and full of impulses that will not let him rest, is, as Simonides says, \" Like sucking foal running by side of dam,\" a being desirous all but to coalesce with the good man.", "1763": "For it is a special sign of true progress in virtue to love and admire the disposition of those whose deeds we emulate, and to resemble them with a good-will that ever assigns due honour and praise to them.", "1764": "But whoever is steeped in contentiousness and envy against his betters, let him know that he may be pricked on by a jealous desire for glory or power, but that he neither honours nor admires virtue.", "1765": "§ xv.", "1766": "Whenever, then, we begin so much to love good men that we deem happy, \"not only,\" as Plato 3 says, \" the temperate man himself, but also the man who hears the words that flow from his wise lips,\" and even admire and are pleased with his figure and walk and look and smile, and desire to adapt ourselves to his model and to stick closely to him, then may we think that we are making genuine progress.", "1767": "Still more will this be the case, if we admire the good not only in prosperity, but like lovers who admire even the lispings and paleness of those in their flowery as the tears and dejection of Panthea in her grief and affliction won the affections of Araspes,2 so we fear neither the exile of Aristides, nor the prison of Anaxagoras, nor the poverty of Socrates, nor the condemnation of Phocion, but think virtue worthy our love even under such trials, and join her, ever chanting that line of Euripides, \" Unto the noble everything is good.\"", "1768": "3", "1769": "For the enthusiasm that can go so far as not to be dis­ couraged at the sure prospect of trouble, but admires and emulates what is good even so, could never be turned away from what is noble by anybody.", "1770": "Such men ever, whether they have some business to transact, or have taken upon them some office, or are in some critical conjuncture, put before their eyes the example of noble men, and consider what Plato would have done on the occasion, what Epaminondas would have said, how Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have dealt;", "1771": "that so, adjusting and re-modelling themselves, as it were, at their mirrors, they may correct any ignoble expression, and repress any ignoble passion.", "1772": "For as those that have learnt the names of the Idæan Dactyli4 make use of them to banish their fear by quietly repeating them over, so the bearing in mind and remembering good men, which soon suggests itself forcibly to those who have made some progress in virtue in all their emotions and difficulties, keeps them upright and not liable to fall.", "1773": "Let this also then be a sign to you of progress in virtue.", "1774": "§ xvi.", "1775": "In addition to this, not to be too much disturbed, nor to blush, nor to try and conceal oneself, or make any change in one's dress, on the sudden appearance of a man of distinction and virtue, but to feel confident and go and meet such a one, is the confirmation of a good conscience.", "1776": "It is reported that Alexander, seeing a mes­ senger running up to him full of joy and holding out his right hand, said, \" My good friend, what are you going to tell me?", "1777": "Has Homer come to life again?\"",

pride and pleasure in the company of good and noble men, and to display his house, his table, his wife, his amusements, his serious pur­ suits, his spoken or written discourses;", "1781": "insomuch that he is grieved when he remembers that his father or guardian died without seeing him in that condition in life, and would pray for nothing from the gods so much, as that they could come to life

nothing of any importance to bring disgrace upon, makes people inclined to what is little and careless.", "1790": "1", "1791": "To those who are building a stone wall or coping it matters not if they

progress in virtue, whose life \" has been wrought on a golden base,” 2 like the foundation of some holy or royal building, undertake nothing carelessly, but lay and adjust everything by the line and

our guard against ?", "2005": "The one who neither seems to be nor acknowledges himself to be one:", "2006": "whom you will not always find in the vicinity of your kitchen, who is not to be caught watching the dial to see how near it is to dinner­ time,1 nor gets so drunk as to throw himself down anyhow, but one who is generally sober, and a busybody, and thinks he ought to have a hand in your affairs, and wishes to share in your secrets, and as to friendship plays rather a tragic than a satyric or comic part.", "2007": "For as Plato says, \" it is the height of injustice to appear to be just when you are not really so,\"2 so we must deem the most dangerous kind of flattery not the open but the secret, not the playful but the serious.", "2008": "For it throws suspicion even upon a genuine friendship, which we may often confound with it, if we are not careful.", "2009": "When Gobryas pursued one of the Magi into a dark room, and was on the ground wrestling with him, and Darius came up and was doubtful how he could kill one without killing both, Gobryas bade him thrust his sword boldly through both of them;", "2010": "3 but we, since we give no assent to that saying, \" Let friend perish so the enemy perish with him,\" 4 in our endeavour to dis­ tinguish the flatterer from the friend, seeing that their resemblances are so many, ought to take great care that we do not reject the good with the bad, nor in sparing what is beneficial fall in with what is injurious.", "2011": "For as wild grains mixed up with wheat, if very similar in size and appearance, are not easily kept apart, for if the sieve have small holes they don't pass through, and if large holes they pass with the corn, so flattery is not easily distin.", "2012": "guished from friendship, being mixed up with it in feeling and emotion, habit and custom.", "2013": "§ v.", "2014": "Because however friendship is the most pleasant of all things, and nothing more glads the heart of man, therefore the flatterer attracts by the pleasure he gives, pleasure being in fact his field.", "2015": "And because favours and good services accompany friendship, as the proverb says \"a friend is more necessary than fire or water,”5 therefore the flatterer volunteers all sorts of services, and strives to show himself on all occasions zealous and obliging and ready.", "2016": "And since friendship is mainly produced by a simi­ larity of tastes and habits, and to have the same likes and dislikes first brings people together and unites them through sympathy,l the flatterer observing this moulds himself like material and demeans himself accordingly, seeking com­ pletely to imitate and resemble those whom he desires to ingratiate himself with, being supple in change, and plausible in his imitations, so that one would say, “Achilles’ son, 0 no, it is himself.”2", "2017": "But his cleverest trick is that, observing that freedom of speech is both spoken of and reckoned as the peculiar and natural voice of friendship, while not speaking freely is considered unfriendly and disingenuous, he has not failed to imitate this trait of friendship also.", "2018": "But just as clever cooks infuse bitter sauces and sharp seasoning to prevent sweet things from cloying, so these flatterers do not use a genuine or serviceable freedom of speech, but merely a winking and tickling innuendo.", "2019": "He is therefore difficult to detect, like those creatures which naturally change their colour and take that of the material or place near them.", "2020": "3", "2021": "But since he deceives and conceals his true character by his imitations, it is our duty to unmask him and detect him by the diffe­ rences between him and the true friend, and to show that he is, as Plato says, \"tricked out in other people's colours and forms, from lack of any of his own.”4§ vi.", "2022": "Let us examine the matter then from the beginning.", "2023": "I said that friendship originated in most cases from a similar disposition and nature, generally inclined to the same habits and morals, and rejoicing in the same pursuits, studies, and amusements, as the following lines testify:", "2024": "\" To old man the voice of old man is sweetest, to boy that of boy, to woman is most acceptable that of woman, to the sick person that of sick person, while he that is overtaken by misfortune is a comforter to one in trouble.\"", "2025": "The flatterer knowing then that it is innate in us to delight in, and enjoy the company of, and to love, those who are like ourselves, attempts first to approach and get near a person in this direction, (as one tries to catch an animal in the pastures,) by the same pursuits and amusements and studies and modes of life quietly throwing out his bait, and disguising himself in false colours, till his victim give him an opportunity to catch him, and become tame and tractable at his touch.", "2026": "Then too he censures the things and modes of life and persons that he knows his victim dislikes, while he praises those he fancies immoderately, overdoing it indeed 1 with his show of surprise and exces­ sive admiration, making him more and more convinced that his likes and dislikes are the fruits of judgement and not of caprice.", "2027": "§ VII.", "2028": "How then is the flatterer convicted, and by what differences is he detected, of being only a counterfeit, and not really like his victim ?", "2029": "We must first then look at the even tenor and consistency of his principles, if he always delights in the same things, and always praises the same things, and directs and governs his life after one pattern, as becomes the noble lover of consistent friendship and familiarity.", "2030": "Such a person is a friend.", "2031": "But the flatterer having no fixed character of his own,2 and not seeking to lead the life suitable for him, but shaping and modelling himself after another's pattern, is neither simple nor uni­ form, but complex and unstable, assuming different appear­ ances, like water poured from vessel to vessel, ever in a state of flux and accommodating himself entirely to the fashion of those who entertain him.", "2032": "The ape indeed, as it seems, attempting to imitate man, is caught imitating his movements and dancing like him, but the flatterer himself attracts and decoys other men, imitating not all alike, for with one he sings and dances, with another he wrestles and gets covered with the dust of the palæstra, while he follows a third fond of hunting and the chase all but shouting out the words of Phædra, \" How I desire to halloo on the dogs, Chasing the dappled deer,\"1 and yet he has really no interest in the chase, it is the hunter himself he sets the toils and snares for.", "2033": "And if the object of his pursuit is some young scholar and lover of learning, he is all for books then, his beard flows down to his feet,!", "2034": "he's quite a sight with his threadbare cloak, has all the indifference of the Stoic, and speaks of nothing but the rectangles and triangles of Plato.", "2035": "But if any rich and careless fellow fond of drink come in his way, “Then wise Odysseus stript him of his rags,\"* his threadbare cloak is thrown aside, his beard is shorn off like a fruitless crop, he goes in for wine-coolers and tankards, and laughs loudly in the streets, and jeers at philosophers.", "2036": "As they say happened at Syracuse, when Plato went there, and Dionysius was seized with a furious passion for philo­ sophy, and so great was the concourse of geometricians that they raised up quite a cloud of dust in the palace, but when Plato fell out of favour, and Dionysius gave up philosophy, and went back again headlong to wine and women and trifles and debauchery, then all the court was metamorphosed, as if they all had drunk of Circe's cup, for ignorance and oblivion and silliness reigned rampant.", "2037": "I am borne out in what I say by the behaviour of great flatterers and demagogues, the greatest of whom Alcibiades, a jeerer and horse-rearer at Athens, and living a gay and merry life, wore his hair closely shaven at Lacedæmon, and washed in cold water, and attired himself in a threadbare cloak;", "2038": "while in Thrace he fought5 and drank;", "2039": "and at Tissaphernes' court lived delicately and luxuriously and in a pretentious style;", "2040": "and thus curried favour and was popular with everybody by imitating their habits and ways.", "2041": "Such was not the way however in which Epaminondas or Agesilaus acted, for though they associated with very many men and states and different modes of life, they maintained everywhere their usual demeanour, both in dress and diet and language and behaviour.", "2042": "So Plato1 at Syracnse was exactly the same man as in the Academy, the same with Dionysius as with Dion.§ VIII.", "2043": "As to the changes of the flatterer, which resemble those of the polypus,2 a man may most easily detect them by himself pretending to change about frequently, and by censuring the kind of life he used formerly to praise, and anon approving of the words actions and modes of life that he used to be displeased with.", "2044": "He will then see that the .", "2045": "flatterer is never consistent or himself, never loving hating rejoicing grieving at his own initiative, but like a mirror, merely reflecting the image of other people's emotions and manners and feelings.", "2046": "Such a one will say, if you censure one of your friends to him, \"You are slow in finding the fellow out, he never pleased me from the first.\"", "2047": "But if on the other hand you change your language and praise him, he will swear by Zeus that he rejoices at it, and is himself under obligations to the man, and believes in him.", "2048": "And if you talk of the necessity of changing your mode of life, of retiring from public life to a life of privacy and ease, he says, \" We ought long ago to have got rid of uproar3 and envy.\"", "2049": "But if you think of returning again to public life, he chimes in, \" Your sentiments do you honour:", "2050": "retire­ ment from business is pleasant, but inglorious and mean.\"", "2051": "One ought to say at once to such a one, \" ' Stranger, quite different now you look to what you did before.’4", "2052": "I do not need a friend to change his opinions with me and to assent to me in everything, my shadow will do that better, but I need one that will speak the truth and help me with his judgement.\"", "2053": "This is one way of detecting the flatterer.", "2054": "§ ix.", "2055": "We must also observe another difference in the resemblance between the friend and flatterer.", "2056": "The true friend does not imitate you in everything, nor is he too keen to praise, but praises only what is excellent, for as Sophocles says, \"He is not born to share in hate but love,”1 yes, by Zeus, and he is born to share in doing what is right and in loving what is noble, and not to share in wrong-doing or misbehaviour, unless it be that, as a running of the eyes is catching, so through companionship and intimacy be may against his will contract by infection some vice or in habit, as they say Plato's intimates imitated his stoop, Aristotle's his lisp, and king Alexander's his holding his head a little on one side, and rapidity of utterance in con­ versation,2 for people mostly pick up unawares such traits of character.", "2057": "But the flatterer is exactly like the chameleon,3 which takes every colour but white, and so he, though unable to imitate what is worth his while, leaves nothing that is bad unimitated.", "2058": "And just as poor painters unable to make a fine portrait from inefficiency in their craft, bring out the likeness by painting all the wrinkles, moles and scars, so the flatterer imitates his friend's intemperance, superstition, hot temper, sourness to domestics, suspicion of his friends and relations.", "2059": "For he is by nature inclined to what is worst, and thinks that imitation of what is bad is as far as possible removed from censure.", "2060": "For those are suspected who have noble aims in life, and seem to be vexed and dis­ gusted at their friends' faults, for that injured and even ruined Dion with Dionysius, Samins with Philip, and Cleo­ menes with Ptolemy.", "2061": "But he that wishes to be and appear at the same time both agreeable and trustworthy pretends to rejoice more in what is bad, as being through excessive love for his friend not even offended at his vices, but as one with him in feeling and nature in all matters.", "2062": "And so they claim to share in involuntary and chance ailments, and pretend to have the same complaints, in flattery to those who suffer from any, as that their eyesight and sense of hearing are deficient, if their friends are somewhat blind or deaf, as the flatterers of Dionysius, who was rather short- sighted, jostled one another at a dinner party, and knocked the dishes off the table, as if from defect of vision.", "2063": "1", "2064": "And some to make their cases more similar wind themselves in closer, and dive even into family secrets for parallels.", "2065": "For seeing that their friends are unfortunate in marriage, or suspicions about the behaviour of their sons or relations, they do not spare themselves, but make quite a Jeremiad about their own sons, or wife, or kinsfolk, or relations, pro­ claiming loudly their own family secrets.", "2066": "For similarity in situation makes people more sympathetic, and their friends having received as it were hostages by their con­ fessions, entrust them in return with their secrets, and having once made confidants of them, dare not take back their confidence.", "2067": "2", "2068": "I actually know of a man who turned his wife out of doors because his friend had put away his;", "2069": "but as he secretly visited her and sent messages to her, he was detected by his friend's wife noticing his conduct.", "2070": "So little did he know the nature of a flatterer that thought the following lines more applicable to a crab than a flatterer, \" His whole body is belly, his eye is on every­ thing, he is a creature creeping on his teeth,\" for such is a true picture of the parasite, \" friends of the frying-pan, hunting for a dinner,\" to borrow the language of Eupolis.§ x. However let us put off all this to its proper place in the discourse.", "2071": "But let us not fail to notice the wiliness of the flatterer's imitation, in that, even if he imitates any good points in the person he flatters, he always takes care to give him the palm.", "2072": "Whereas among real friends there is no rivalry or jealousy of one another, but they are satisfied and contented alike whether they are equal or one of them is superior.", "2073": "But the flatterer, ever remembering that he is to play second fiddle,1 makes his copy always fall a little short of the original, for he admits that he is everywhere outstripped and left behind, except in vice.", "2074": "For in that alone he claims pre-eminence, for if his friend is peevish, he says he is atrabilious;", "2075": "if his friend is superstitious, he says he is a fanatic ;", "2076": "if his friend is in love, he says he is madly in love;", "2077": "if his friend laughs, he will say, \"You laughed a little unseasonably, but I almost died of laughter.\"", "2078": "But in regard to any good points his action is quite the oppo­ site.", "2079": "He says he can run quickly, but his friend flies;", "2080": "he says he can ride pretty well, but his friend is a Centaur on horseback.", "2081": "He says \" I am not a bad poet, and don't write very bad lines, “‘But your sonorous verse is like Jove'a thunder.'\"", "2082": "Thus he shows at once that his friend's aims in life are good, and that his friend has reached a height he cannot soar to.", "2083": "Such then are the differences in the resemblances between the flatterer and the friend.", "2084": "§ xi.", "2085": "But since, as has been said before, to give plea­ sure is common to both, for the good man delights in his friends as much as the bad man in his flatterers, let us con­ sider the difference between them here too.", "2086": "The difference lies in the different aim of each in giving pleasure.", "2087": "Look at it this way.", "2088": "There is no doubt a sweet smell in per­ fume.", "2089": "So there is also in medicine.", "2090": "But the difference is that while in perfume pleasure and nothing else is de­ signed, in medicine either purging, or warming, or adding flesh to the system, is the primary object, and the sweet smell is only a secondary consideration.", "2091": "Again painters mix gay colours and dyes:", "2092": "there are also some drugs which are gay in appearance and not unpleasing in colour.", "2093": "What then is the difference between these ?", "2094": "Manifestly we dis­ tinguish by the end each aims at.", "2095": "So too the social life of friends employs mirth to add a charm to some good and useful end, and sometimes makes joking and a good table and wine, aye, and even chaff and banter, the seasoning to noble and serious matters, as in the line, \" Much they enjoyed talking to one another,”1 and again, \" Never did ought else Disturb our love or joy in one another.\"", "2096": "2", "2097": "But the flatterer's whole aim and end is to cook up and season his joke or word or action, so as to produce pleasure.", "2098": "And to speak concisely, the flatterer's object is to please in everything he does, whereas the true friend always does what is right, and so often gives pleasure, often pain, not wishing the latter, but not shunning it either, if he deems it best.", "2099": "For as the physician, if it be expedient, infuses saffron or spikenard, aye, or uses some soothing fomenta­ tion or feeds his patient up liberally, and sometimes orders castor, \" Or poley,3 that so strong and foully smells,\" or pounds hellebore and compels him to drink it,-neither in the one case making unpleasantness, nor in the other pleasantness, his end and aim, but in both studying only the interest of his patient,-so the friend sometimes by praise and kindness, extolling him and gladdening his heart, leads him to what is noble, as Agamemnon, \"Teucer, dear head, thou son of Telamon, Go on thus shooting, captain of thy men ;", "2100": "”4 or Diomede, \" How could I e'er forget divine Odysseus ? \"5 But where on the other hand there is need of correction, then he rebukes with biting words and with the freedom worthy of a friend, \" Zeus-cherished Menelaus, art thou mad, And in thy folly tak'st no heed of safety ?", "2101": "\"", "2102": "6 Sometimes also he joins action to word, as Menedemus sobered the profligate and disorderly son of his friend Asclepiades, by shutting him out of his house, and not speaking to him.", "2103": "And Arcesilaus forbade Bato his school, when he wrote a line in one of his plays against Cleanthes, and only got reconciled with him after he repented and made his peace with Cleanthes.", "2104": "For we ought to give our friend pain if it will benefit him, but not to the extent of breaking off our friendship;", "2105": "but just as we make use of some biting medicine, that will save and preserve the life of the patient.", "2106": "And so the friend, like a musician, in bringing about an improvement to what is good and ex­ pedient, sometimes slackens the chords, sometimes tightens them, and is often pleasant, but always useful.", "2107": "But the flatterer, always harping on one note, and accustomed to play his accompaniment only with a view to please and to ingratiate himself, knows not how either to oppose in deed, or give pain in word, but complies only with every wish, ever chiming in with and echoing the senti­ ments of his patron.", "2108": "As then Xenophon says Agesilaus took pleasure in being praised by those who would also censure him,l so ought we to think that to please and gratify us is friendly in the person who can also give us pain and oppose us, but to feel suspicion at an intercourse which is merely for pleasure and gratification, and never pungent, aye and by Zeus to have ready that saying of the Lacedæmonian, who, on hearing king Charillus praised, said, \" How can he be a good man, who is not severe even to the bad ?", "2109": "\"§ XII.", "2110": "They say the gadfly attacks bulls, and the tick dogs, in the ear:", "2111": "so the flatterer besieges with praise the ears of those who are fond of praise, and sticks there and is hard to dislodge.", "2112": "We ought therefore here to make a wide-awake and careful discrimination, whether the praise is bestowed on the action or the man.", "2113": "It is bestowed on the action, if people praise the absent rather than the present, if also those that have the same aims and aspirations praise not only us but all that are similarly disposed, and do not evidently say and do one thing at one time, and the direct contrary at another;", "2114": "and the greatest test is if we are conscious, in the matters for which we get the praise, that we have not regretted them, and are not ashamed at them, and would not rather have said and done differently.", "2115": "For our own inward judgement, testifying the contrary and not admitting the praise, is above passion, and impregnable and proof against the flatterer.", "2116": "But I know not how it is that most people in misfortune cannot bear exhortation, but are captivated more by condolence and sympathy, and when they have done something wrong and acted amiss, he that by censure and blame implants in them the stings of repentance is looked upon by them as hostile and an accuser, while they welcome and regard as friendly and well-dis­ posed to them the person who bestows praise and pane­ gyric on what they have done.", "2117": "Those then that readily praise and join in applauding some word or action on the part of someone whether in jest or earnest, only do temporary harm for the moment, but those who injure the character by their praise, aye, and by their flattery undermine the morals, act like those slaves who do not steal from the bin, but from the seed corn.", "2118": "1", "2119": "For they pervert the disposition, which is the seed of actions, and the character, which is the principle and fountain of life, by attaching to vice names that belong properly only to virtue.", "2120": "For as Thucy­ dides says,2 in times of faction and war people change the accustomed meaning of words as applied to acts at their will and pleasure, for reckless daring is then con­ sidered bravery to one's comrades, and prudent delay specious cowardice, and sober-mindedness the cloak of the coward, and taking everything into account before action a real desire to do nothing.\"", "2121": "So too in the case of flattery we must observe and be on our guard against wastefulness being called liberality, and cowardliness pru­ dence, and madness quick-wittedness, and meanness fru­ gality, and the amorous man called social and affectionate, and the term manly applied to the passionate and vain man, and the term civil applied to the paltry and mean man.", "2122": "As I remember Plato3 says the lover is a flatterer of the beloved one, and calls the snub nose graceful, and the aquiline nose royal, and swarthy people manly, and fair people the children of the gods, and the olive complexion is merely the lover's phrase to gloss over and palliate excessive pallor.", "2123": "And yet the ugly man persuaded he is handsome, or the short man persuaded he is tall, cannot long remain in the error, and receives only slight injury from it, and not irreparable mischief:", "2124": "but praise applied to vices as if they were virtues, so that one is not vexed but delighted with a vicious life, removes all shame from wrong­ doing, and was the ruin of the Sicilians, by calling the savage cruelty of Dionysius and Phalaris detestation of wickedness and uprightness.", "2125": "It was the ruin of Egypt, by styling Ptolemy's effeminacy, and superstition, and bowlings, and beating of drums, religion and service to the gods.", "2126": "1", "2127": "It was nearly the overthrow and destruction of the ancient manners of the Romans, palliating the luxury and intemperance and display of Antony as exhibitions of jollity and kindliness, when his power and fortune were at their zenith.", "2128": "What else invested Ptolemy3 with his pipe and fiddle ?", "2129": "What else brought Nero3 on the tragic stage, and invested him with the mask and buskins ?", "2130": "Was it not the praise of flatterers ?", "2131": "And are not many kings called Apollos if they can just sing a song,4 and Dionysuses if they get drunk, and Herculeses if they can wrestle, and do they not joy in such titles, and are they not dragged into every kind of disgrace by flattery ?§ XIII.", "2132": "Wherefore we must be especially on our guard against the flatterer in regard to praise;", "2133": "as indeed he is very well aware himself, and clever to avoid suspicion.", "2134": "If he light upon some dandy, or rustic in a thick leather garment, he treats him with nothing but jeers and mocks,5 as Struthias insulted Bias, ironically praising him for his stupidity, saying, \"You have drunk more than king Alex- ander,”1 and, it that he was ready to die of laughing at his tale about the Cyprian.”", "2135": "2", "2136": "But when he sees people more refined very much on their guard, and observing both time and place, he does not praise them directly, but draws off a little and wheels round and approaches them noiselessly, as one tries to catch a wild animal.", "2137": "For sometimes he reports to a man the panegyric of other persons upon him, (as orators do, introducing some third person,) saying that he had a very pleasant conversation in the market with some strangers and men of worth, who mentioned how they admired his many good points.", "2138": "On another occasion he concocts and fabricates some false and trifling charges against him, pretending he has heard them from other people, and runs up with a serious face and inquires, where he said or did such and such a thing.", "2139": "And upon his deny­ ing he ever did, he pounces on him at once3 and com­ pliments his man with, \" I thought it strange that you.", "2140": "should have spoken ill of your friends, seeing that you don't even treat your enemies so:", "2141": "and that you should have tried to rob other people, seeing that you are so lavish with your own money.\"", "2142": "A§ xiv.", "2143": "Other flatterers again, just as painters heighten the effect of their pictures by the combination of light and shade, so by censure abuse detraction and ridicule of the opposite virtues secretly praise and foment the actual vices of those they flatter.", "2144": "Thus they censure modesty as merely rustic behaviour in the company of profligates, and greedy people, and villains, and such as have got rich by evil and dishonourable courses;", "2145": "and contentment and uprightness they call having no spirit or energy in action;", "2146": "and when they associate with lazy and idle persons who avoid all public duties, they are not ashamed to call the life of a citizen wearisome meddling in other people's affairs, and the desire to bold office fruitless vain-glory.", "2147": "And some ere now to flatter an orator have depreciated a philosopher, and others won favour with wanton women by traducing those wives who are faithful to their husbands as constitutionally cold and country bred.", "2148": "And by an acme of villainy flatterers do not always spare even themselves.", "2149": "For as wrestlers stoop that they may the easier give their adversaries a fall, so by censuring themselves they glide into praising others.", "2150": "\" I am a cowardly slave,\" says such a one, \" at sea, I shirk labour, I am madly in rage if a word is said against me ;", "2151": "but this man fears nothing, has no vices, is a rare good fellow, patient and easy in all circumstances.”", "2152": "But if a person has an excellent idea of his own good sense, and desires to be austere and self-opinionated, and in his moral rectitude is ever spouting that line of Homer, \" Tydides, neither praise nor blame me much,”1 the artistic flatterer does not attack him as he attacked others, but employs against such a one a new device.", "2153": "For he comes to him about his own private affairs, as if desirous to have the advice of one wiser than himself;", "2154": "he has, he says, more intimate friends, but he is obliged to trouble him ;", "2155": "\"for whither shall we that are deficient in judgement go ? whom shall we trust?\"", "2156": "And having listened to his utterance he departs, saying he has received an oracle not an opinion.", "2157": "And if he notices that somebody lays claim to experience in oratory, he gives him some of his writings, and begs him to read and correct them.", "2158": "So, when king Mithri­ dates took a fancy to play the surgeon, several of his friends offered themselves for operating upon, as for cutting or cauterizing, flattering in deed and not in word, for his being credited by them would seem to prove his skill.2 \" For Providence has many different aspects.\"", "2159": "3 But .", "2160": "we can test this kind of negative praise, that needs more wary caution, by purposely giving strange advice and suggestions, and by adopting absurd corrections.", "2161": "For if he raises no objection but nods assent to everything, and approves of everything, and is always crying out, \" Good!", "2162": "How admirable !", "2163": "\" he is evidently “Asking advice, but seeking something else,\" wishing by praise to puff you up.§ xv.", "2164": "Moreover, as some have defined painting to be silent poetry,1 so is there praise in silent flattery.", "2165": "For as hunters are more likely to catch the objects of their chase unawares, if they do not openly appear to be so engaged, but seem to be walking, or tending their sheep, or looking after the farm, so flatterers obtain most success in their praise, when they do not seem to be praising but to be doing something else.", "2166": "For he who gives up his place or seat to the great man when he comes in, and while making a speech to the people or senate breaks off even in the middle, if he observes any rich man wants to speak, and gives up to him alike speech and platform, shows by his silence even more than he would by any amount of vocife­ ration that he thinks the other the better man, and superior to him in judgement.", "2167": "And consequently you may always see them occupying the best places at theatres and public assembly rooms, not that they think themselves worthy of them, but that they may flatter the rich by giving up their places to them ;", "2168": "and at public meetings they begin speaking first, and then make way as for better men, and most readily take back their own view, if any influential or rich or famous person espouse the contrary view.", "2169": "And so one can see plainly that all such servility and drawing back on their part is a lowering their sails, not to experience or virtue or age, but to wealth and fame.", "2170": "Not so Apelles the famous painter, who, when Megabyzus sat with him, and wished to talk about lines and shades, said to him, \" Do you see my lads yonder grinding colours,

noble, and a king;", "2176": "but flatterers declare that the rich man is at once orator and poet, and (if he likes) painter, and flute-player, and swift-footed, and strong, falling down if he wrestles with them, and if contending with him in running letting him win the race, as Crisso of Himera purposely allowed Alexander to outrun him, which vexed the king very much when he heard of it.",

burden of friendship, \"heavy, huge, strong.”3", "2186": "But since flatterers, to avoid the blame they incur by their buffoonery, and drinking, and gibes, and jokes, sometimes work their ends by

by itself an antidote against hemlock, with it and so offer it, they make the poison quite deadly, being rapidly carried to the heart by the warmth,5 so ill-disposed men, knowing that outspokenness is a great antidote to flattery, make it a means of flattering.", "2229": "And so it was rather a bad answer Bias6 made, to the person who inquired what was the most formidable animal, \" Of wild animals the tyrant, and of tame the flatterer.\"", "2230": "For it would have been truer to observe that tame flatterers are those that are found round the baths and table, but the one that intrudes into the interior of the house and into the women's apartments with his curiosity and calumny and malignity, like the legs and arms of the polypus, is wild and savage and unmanageable.§ xx.", "2231": "Now one kind of caution against his snares is to know and ever remember that, whereas the soul contains true and noble and reasoning elements, as also unreasoning and false and emotional ones, the friend is always a coun­ sellor and adviser to the better instincts of the soul, as the physician improves and maintains health, whereas the flatterer works upon the emotional and unreasoning ones, and tickles and titillates them and seduces them from reason, employing sensuality as his bait.", "2232": "As then there are some kinds of food which neither benefit the blood or spirit, nor brace up the nerves and marrow, but stir the passions, excite the lower nature, and make the flesh un­ sound and rotten, so the language of the flatterer adds nothing to soberness and reason, but encourages some love passion, or stirs up foolish rage, or incites to envy, or produces the empty and burdensome vanity of pride, or joins in bewailing woes, or ever by his calumnies and hints makes malignity and illiberality and suspicion sharp and timid and jealous, and cannot fail to be detected by those that closely observe him.", "2233": "For he is ever anchoring himself upon some passion, and fattening it, and, like a bubo, fastens himself on some unsound and inflamed parts of the soul.", "2234": "Are you angry ?", "2235": "Have your revenge, says he.", "2236": "Do you desire anything ?", "2237": "Get it.", "2238": "Are you afraid ?", "2239": "Let us flee.", "2240": "Do you suspect?", "2241": "Entertain no doubts about it.", "2242": "But if he is difficult to detect in thus playing upon our passions, since they often overthrow reason by their in­ tensity and strength, he will give a handle to find him out in smaller matters, being consistent in them too.", "2243": "For if anyone feels a little uneasy after a surfeit or excess in drink, and so is a little particular about his food and doubts the advisability of taking a bath, a friend will try and check him from excess, and bid him be careful and not indulge, whereas the flatterer will drag him to the bath, bid him serve up some fresh food, and not starve himself and so injure his constitution.", "2244": "And if he see him reluctant about a journey or voyage or some business or other, he will say that there is no hurry, that it's all one whether the business be put off, or somebody else despatched to look after it.", "2245": "And if you have promised to lend or give some money to a friend, but have repented of your offer, and yet feel ashamed not to keep your promise, the flatterer will throw his influence into the worse scale, he will confirm your desire to save your purse, he will destroy your reluctance, and will bid you be careful as having many expenses, and others to think about besides that person.", "2246": "And so, unless we are entirely ignorant of our desires, our shamelessness, and our timidity, the flatterer cannot easily escape our detection.", "2247": "For he is ever the advocate of those passions, and outspoken when we desire to repress them.", "2248": "1", "2249": "But so much for this matter.§ xxi.", "2250": "Now let us pass on to useful and kind services, for in them too the flatterer makes it very difficult and confusing to detect him from the friend, seeming to be zealous and ready on all occasions and never crying off.", "2251": "For, as Euripides says,2 a friend's behaviour is, \" like the utterance of truth, simple,\" and plain and inartificial, while that of the flatterer “is is in itself unsound, and needs wise remedies,\" aye, by Zeus, and many such, and not ordinary ones.", "2252": "As for example in chance meetings the friend often neither speaks nor is spoken to, but merely looks and smiles, and then passes on, showing his inner affection and good­ will only by his countenance, which his friend also re­ ciprocates, but the flatterer runs up, follows, holds out his hand at a distance, and if he is seen and addressed first, frequently protests with oaths, and calls witnesses to prove, that he did not see you.", "2253": "So in business friends neglect many unimportant points, are not too punctilious and officious, and do not thrust themselves upon every service, but the flatterer is persevering and unceasing and in­ defatigable in it, giving nobody else either room or place to help, but putting himself wholly at your disposal, and if you will not find him something to do for you, he is troubled, nay rather altogether dejected and lamenting loudly.", "2254": "3§ XXII.", "2255": "To all sensible people all this is an indication, not of true or sober friendship, but of a meretricious one, that embraces you more warmly than there is any occasion for.", "2256": "Nevertheless let us first look at the difference between the friend and flatterer in their promises.", "2257": "For it has been well said by those who have handled this subject before us, that the friend's promise is, \"If I can do it, and 'tis to be done,\" but the flatterer's is, “Speak out your mind, whatever it is, to me.”1", "2258": "And the comic dramatists put such fellows on the stage, “Nicomachus, pit me against that soldier, See if I beat him not into a jelly, And make his face e'en softer than a sponge.\"", "2259": "2", "2260": "In the next place no friend participates in any matter, unless he has first been asked his advice, and put the matter to the test, and set it on a suitable and expedient basis.", "2261": "But the flatterer, if anyone allows him to examine a matter and give his opinion on it, not only wishes to gratify him by compliance, but also fearing to be looked upon with suspicion as unwilling and reluctant to en­ gage in the business, gives in to and even urges on his friend's desire.", "2262": "For there is hardly any king or rich man who would say, “0 that a beggar I could find, or worse Than beggar, if, with good intent to me, He would lay bare his heart boldly and honestly ;", "2263": "”3 but, like the tragedians, they require a chorus of sympa­ thizing friends, or the applause of a theatre.", "2264": "And so Merope gives the following advice in the tragedy, “Choose you for friends those who will speak their mind, For those bad men that only speak to please See that you bolt and bar out of your house.”", "2265": "4", "2266": "But they act just the contrary, for they turn away with horror from those who speak their mind, and hold different views as to what is expedient, while they welcome those bad and illiberal impostors (that only speak to please them) not only within their houses, but also to their affections and secrets.", "2267": "Now the simpler of these do not think right or claim to advise you in important matters, but only to assist in the carrying out of them :", "2268": "but the more cunning one stands by during the discussion, and knits his brows, and nods assent with his head, but says nothing, but if his friend express an opinion, he then says, \" Hercules, you only just anticipated me, I was about to make that very remark.\"", "2269": "For as the mathematicians tell us that surfaces and lines neither bend nor extend nor move of themselves, being without body and only perceived by the mind, but only bend and extend and change their position with the bodies whose extremities they are:", "2270": "so you will catch the flatterer ever assenting with, and agreeing with, aye, and feeling with, and being angry with, another, so easy of detection in all these points of view is the difference between the friend and the flatterer.", "2271": "Moreover as regards the kind of good service.", "2272": "For the favour done by a friend, as the principal strength of an animal is within, is not for display or ostentation, but frequently as a doctor cures his patient imperceptibly, so a friend benefits by his interven­ tion, or by paying off creditors, or by managing his friend's affairs, even though the person who receives the benefit may not be aware of it.", "2273": "Such was the behaviour of Arcesilaus on various occasions, and when Apelles1 of Chios was ill, knowing his poverty, he took with him twenty drachmae when he visited him, and sitting down beside him he said, \" There is nothing here but those elements of Empedocles, ‘fire and water and earth and balmy expanse of air,' but you don't lie very comfortably,\" and with that he moved his pillow, and privately put the money under it.", "2274": "And when his old housekeeper found it, and wonderingly told Apelles of it, he laughed and said, \" This is some trick of Arcesilaus.\"", "2275": "And the saying is also true in philosophy that children are like their parents.”", "2276": "2", "2277": "For when Cephisocrates had to stand his trial on a bill of indictment, Lacydes (who was an intimate friend of Arce­ silaus) stood by him with several other friends, and when the prosecutor asked for his ring, which was the principal evidence against him, Cephisocrates quietly dropped it on the ground, and Lacydes noticing this put his foot on it and so hid it.", "2278": "And after sentence was pro­ nounced in his favour, Cephisocrates going up to thank the jury, one of them who had seen the artifice told him to thank Lacydes, and related to him all the matter, though Lacydes had not said a word about it to anybody.", "2279": "So also I think the gods do often perform benefits secretly, taking a natural delight in bestowing their favours and bounties.", "2280": "1", "2281": "But the good service of the flatterer has no justice, or genuineness, or simplicity, or liberality about it;", "2282": "but is accompanied with sweat, and running about, and noise, and knitting of the brow, creating an impression and appearance of toilsome and bustling service, like a painting over-curiously wrought in bold colours, and with bent folds wrinkles and angles, to make the closer re­ semblance to life.", "2283": "Moreover he tires one by relating what journeys and anxieties he has had over the matter, how many enemies he has made over it, the thousand bothers and annoyances he has gone through, so that you say, \" The affair was not worth all this trouble.\"", "2284": "For being reminded of any favour done to one is always unpleasant and disagreeable and insufferable:", "2285": "2 but the flatterer not only reminds us of his services afterwards, but even during the very moment of doing them upbraids us with them and is importunate.", "2286": "But the friend, if he is obliged to mention the matter, relates it modestly, and says not a word about himself.", "2287": "And so, when the Lacedæmonians sent corn to the people of Smyrna that needed it, and the people of Smyrna wondered at their kindness, the Lacedæ­ m'onians said, \" It was no great matter, we only voted that we and our beasts of burden should go without our dinner one day, and sent what was so saved to you.”", "2288": "1", "2289": "Not only is it handsome to do a favour in that way, but it is more pleasant to the receivers of it, because they think those who have done them the service have done it at no great loss to themselves.", "2290": "§", "2291": "XXIII.", "2292": "But it is not so much by the importunity of the flatterer in regard to services, nor by his facility in making promises, that one can recognize his nature, as by the honourable or dishonourable kind of service, and by the regard to please or to be of real use.", "2293": "For the friend is not as Gorgias defined him, one who will ask his friend to help him in what is right, while he will himself do many services for his friend that are not right.", "2294": "“For friend should share in good not in bad action.”", "2295": "2", "2296": "He will therefore rather try and turn him away from what is not becoming, and if he cannot persuade him, good is that answer of Phocion to Antipater, \"You cannot have me both as friend and flatterer,”3 that is, as friend and no friend.", "2297": "For one must indeed assist one's friend but not do anything wrong for him, one must advise with him but not plot with him, one must bear witness for him but not join him in fraud, one must certainly share adversity with him but not crime.", "2298": "For since we should not wish even to know of our friends' dishonourable acts, much less should we desire to share their dishonour by acting with them.", "2299": "As then the Lacedæmonians, when conquered in battle by Antipater, on settling the terms of peace, begged that he would lay upon them what burdens he pleased, provided he enjoined nothing dishonourable, so the friend, if any necessity arise involving expense or danger or trouble, is the first to desire to be applied to and share in it with alacrity and without crying off, but if there be anything disgraceful in connection with it he begs to have nothing to do with it.", "2300": "The flatterer on the contrary cries off from toilsome and dangerous employments, and if you put him to the test by ringing him,1 he returns a hollow and spurious sound, and finds some excuse ;", "2301": "whereas use him in disgraceful and low and disreputable service, and trample upon him, he will think no treatment too bad or igno­ minious.", "2302": "Have you observed the ape ?", "2303": "He cannot guard the house like the do,,,, nor bear burdens like the horse, nor plough like the ox, so he has to bear insult and ribaldry, and put up with being made sport of, exhibiting himself as an instrument to produce laughter.", "2304": "So too the flatterer, who can neither advocate your cause, nor give you useful counsel, nor share in your contention with anybody, but shirks all labour and toil, never makes any excuses in underhand transactions, is sure to lend a helping hand in any love affair, is energetic in setting free some harlot, and not careless in clearing off the account of a drinking score, nor remiss in making preparations for banquets, and obse­ quious to concubines, but if ordered to be uncivil to your relations, or to help in turning your wife out of doors, he is relentless and not to be put out of countenance.", "2305": "So that he is not hard to detect here too.", "2306": "For if ordered to do anything you please disreputable or dishonourable, he is ready to take any pains to oblige you.", "2307": "§", "2308": "XXIV.", "2309": "One might detect again how greatly the flatterer differs from the friend by his behaviour to other friends.", "2310": "For the friend is best pleased with loving and being beloved by many, and also always tries to contrive for his friend that he too may be much loved and honoured, for he believes in the proverb \" the goods of friends are common property,\" 2 and thinks it ought to apply to nothing more than to friends;", "2311": "but the false and spurious and counterfeit friend, knowing how much he debases friendship, like debased and spurious coin, is not only by nature envious, but shows his envy even of those who are like himself, striving to outdo them in scurrility and gossip, while he quakes and trembles at any of his betters, not by Zeus \" merely walking on foot by their Lydian chariot,\" but, to use the language of Simonides, \" not even having pure lead by comparison with their refined gold.”", "2312": "1", "2313": "Whenever then, being light and counterfeit and false, he is put to the test at close quarters with a true and solid and cast-iron friend­ ship, he cannot stand the test but is detected at once, and imitates the conduct of the painter that painted some wretched cocks, for he ordered his lad to scare away all live cocks as far from his picture as possible.", "2314": "So he too scares away real friends and will not let them come near if he can help it, but if he cannot prevent that, he openly fawns upon them, and courts them, and admires them as his betters, but privately runs them down and spreads calumnies about them.", "2315": "And when secret detraction has produced a sore feeling,2 if he has not effected his end completely, he re­ members and observes the teaching of Medius, who was the chief of Alexander's flatterers, and a leading sophist in conspiracy against the best men.", "2316": "He bade people conn­ dently sow their calumny broadcast and bite with it, teaching them that even if the person injured should heal his sore, the scar of the calumny would remain.", "2317": "Con­ sumed by these scars, or rather gangrenes and cancers, Alexander put to death Callisthenes, and Parmenio, and Philotas;", "2318": "while he himself submitted to be completely out­ witted by such as Agnon, and Bagoas, and Agesias, and Demetrius, who worshipped him and tricked him up and feigned him to be a barbaric god.", "2319": "So great is the power of flattery, and nowhere greater, as it seems, than among the greatest people.", "2320": "For their thinking and wishing the best about themselves makes them credit the flatterer, and gives him courage.", "2321": "3", "2322": "For lofty heights are difficult of approach and hard to reach for those who endeavour to scale them, but the highmindedness and conceit of a person thrown off his balance by good fortune or good natural parts is easily reached by mean and petty people.", "2323": "§ xxv.", "2324": "And so we advised at the beginning of this dis­ course, and now advise again, to cut off self-love and too high an opinion of ourselves;", "2325": "for that flatters us first, and makes us more impressionable and prepared for external flatterers, But if we hearken to the god, and recognize the immense importance to everyone of that saying, \" Know thyself,”1 and at the same time carefully observe our nature and education and training, with its thousand shortcomings in respect to good, and the large proportion of vice and vanity mixed up with our words and deeds and feelings, we shall not make our­ selves so easy a mark for flatterers.", "2326": "Alexander said that he disbelieved those who called him a god chiefly in regard to sleep and the sexual delight, for in both those things he was more ignoble and emotional than in other respects.", "2327": "2", "2328": "So we, if we observe the blots, blemishes, shortcomings, and imperfections of our private selves, shall perceive clearly that we do not need a friend who shall bestow upon us praise and panegyric, but one that will reprove us, and speak plainly to us, aye, by Zeus, and censure us if we have done amiss.", "2329": "For it is only a few out of many that venture to speak plainly to their friends rather than gratify them, and even among those few you will not easily find any who know how to do so properly, for they think they are outspoken when they abuse and scold.", "2330": "And yet, just as in the case of any other medicine, to employ freedom of speech unseasonably is only to give needless pain and trouble, and in a manner to do so as to produce vexa­ tion the very thing the flatterer does so as to produce pleasure.", "2331": "For it does people harm not only to praise them unseasonably but also to blame them unseasonably, and es­ pecially exposes them to the successful attack of flatterers, for, like water, they abandon the rugged hills for the soft grassy valleys.", "2332": "And so outspokenness ought to be tempered with kindness, and reason ought to be called in to correct its excessive tartness, (as we tone down the too powerful glare of a lamp), that people may not, by being troubled and grieved at continual blame and rebuke, fly for refuge to the shade of the flatterer, and turn aside to him to free themselves from annoyance.", "2333": "For we ought, Philopappus, to banish all vice by virtue, not by the opposite vice, as some hold;", "2334": "by exchanging modesty for impudence, and countrified ways for town ribaldry, and by removing their character as far as possible from cowardice and effemi­ nacy, even if that should make people get very near to auda­ city and foolhardiness.", "2335": "And some even make superstition a plea for atheism, and stupidity a plea for knavery, per­ verting their nature, like a stick bent double, from inability to set it straight.", "2336": "But the basest disowning of flattery is to be disagreeable without any purpose in view, and it shows an altogether inelegant and clumsy unfitness for social intercourse to shun by unpleasing moroseness the suspicion of being mean and servile in friendship ;", "2337": "like the freedman in the comedy who thought railing only enjoying freedom of speech.", "2338": "Seeing then that it is equally disgrace­ ful to become a flatterer through trying only to please, as in avoiding flattery to destroy all friendship and intimacy by excessive freedom of speech, we must avoid both these extremes, and, as in any other case, make our freedom of speech agreeable by its moderation.", "2339": "So the subject itself seems next to demand that I should conclude it by dis­ cussing that point.", "2340": "§ xxvi.", "2341": "As then we see that much trouble arises from excessive freedom of speech, let us first of all detach from it any element of self-love, being carefully on our guard that we may not appear to upbraid on account of any private hurt or injury.", "2342": "For people do not regard a speech on the speaker's own behalf as arising from goodwill, but from anger, and reproach rather than admonition.", "2343": "For freedom in speech is friendly and has weight, but reproach is selfish and little.", "2344": "And so people respect and admire those that speak their mind freely, but accuse back and despise those that reproach them :", "2345": "as Agamemnon would not stand the moderate freedom of speech of Achilles, but submitted to and endured the bitter attack and speech of Odysseus, \" Pernicious chief, would that thou didst command Some sorry host, and not such men as these!", "2346": "” 1 for he was restrained by the carefulness and sobriety of his speech, and also Odysseus had no private motive of anger but only spoke out on behalf of Greece,2 whereas Achilles seemed rather vexed on his own account.", "2347": "And Achilles himself, though not sweet-tempered or mild of mood, but \" a terrible man, and one that would perchance blame an innocent person,” 3 yet silently listened to Patroclus bringing against him many such charges as the following, \" Pitiless one, thy sire never was Knight Peleus, nor thy mother gentle Thetis, But the blue sea and steep and rocky crags", "2348": "Thy parents were, so flinty is thy heart.”", "2349": "4 For as Hyperides the orator bade the Athenians consider not only whether he spoke bitterly, but whether he spoke so from interested motives,5 so the rebuke of a friend void of all private feeling is solemn and grave and what one dare not lightly face.", "2350": "And if anyone shows plainly in his free­ dom of speech, that he altogether passes over and dismisses any offences his friend has done to himself, and only blames him for other shortcomings, and does not spare him but gives him pain for the interests of others, the tone of his outspokenness is invincible, and the sweetness of his manner even intensifies the bitterness and austerity of his rebuke.", "2351": "And so it has well been said, that in anger and differences with our friends we ought more especially to act with a view to their interest or honour.", "2352": "And no less friendly is it, when it appears that we have been passed over and neglected, to boldly put in a word for others that are neglected too, and to remind people of them, as Plato, when he was out of favour with Dionysius, begged for an audience, and Dionysius granted it, thinking that Plato had some personal grievance and was going to enter into it, but Plato opened the conversation as follows, \" If, Dio­ nysins, you knew that some enemy had sailed to Sicily with a view to do you some harm, but found no opportunity, would you allow him to sail back again, and go off scot- free ? \" \"", "2353": "Certainly not, Plato,\" replied Dionysius, \" for we must not only hate and punish the deeds of our enemies, but also their intentions.\"", "2354": "\" If then,\" said Plato, \"anyone has come here for your benefit, and wishes to do you good, and you do not find him an opportunity, is it right to let him go away with neglect and without thanks ? \"", "2355": "And on Dionysius asking, who he meant, he replied, \" I mean AEschines, a man of as good a character as any of Socrates' pupils whatever, and able to improve by his conversation any with whom he might associate:", "2356": "and he is neglected, though he has made a long voyage here to discuss philosophy with you.\"", "2357": "This speech so affected Dionysius, that he at once threw his arms round Plato and embraced him, admiring his benevolence and loftiness of mind, and treated Æschines well and hand­ somely.", "2358": "§", "2359": "XXVII.", "2360": "In the next place, let us clear away as it were and remove all insolence, and jeering, and mocking, and ribaldry, which are the evil seasonings of freedom of speech.", "2361": "For as, when the surgeon performs an operation, a certain neatness and delicacy of touch ought to accompany his use of the knife, but all pantomimic and venturesome and fashionable suppleness and over-finicalness ought to be far away from his hand, so freedom of speech admits of dex­ terity and politeness, provided that a pleasant way of put­ ting it does not destroy the power of the rebuke, for impu­ dence and coarseness and insolence, if added to freedom of speech, entirely mar and ruin the effect.", "2362": "And so the harper plausibly and elegantly silenced Philip, who ven­ tured to dispute with him about proper playing on the harp, by answering him, “ God forbid that you should be so unfortunate, 0 king, as to understand harping better than me.\"", "2363": "But that was not a right answer of Epicharmus, when Hiero a few days after putting to death some of his friends invited him to supper, \" You did not invite me,\" he said, \"the other day, when you sacrificed your friends.\"", "2364": "Bad also was that answer of Antiphon, who, when Diony­ sius asked him \" which was the best kind of bronze,\" answered, \" That of which the Athenians made statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton.\"", "2365": "For this unpleasant and bitter kind of language profits not those that use it, nor does scurrility and puerile jesting please, but such kind of speeches are indications of an incontinent tongue inspired by hate, and full of malignity and insolence, and those who use such language do but ruin themselves, recklessly dancing on the verge of a well.", "2366": "1", "2367": "For Antiphon was put to death by Dionysius, and Timagenes lost the friendship of Augustus, not by using on any occasion too free a tongue, but at supper-parties and walks always declining to talk seriously, \"only saying what he knew would make the Argives laugh,” 2 and thus virtually charging friendship with being only a cloak for abuse.", "2368": "For even the comic poets have in­ troduced on the stage many grave sentiments well adapted to public life, but joking and ribaldry being mixed with them, like insipid sauces with food, destroy their effect and make them lose their nourishing power, so that the comic poets only get a reputation for malignity and coarseness, and the audience get no benefit from what is said.", "2369": "We may on other occasions jest and laugh with our friends, but let our outspokenness be coupled with seriousness and gravity, and if it be on important matters, let our speech be trustworthy and moving from its pathos, and animation, and tone of voice.", "2370": "And on all occasions to let an oppor­ tunity slip by is very injurious, but especially does it destroy the usefulness of freedom of speech.", "2371": "It is plain therefore that we must abstain from freedom of speech when men are in their cups.", "2372": "For he disturbs the harmony of a social gathering3 who, in the midst of mirth and jollity, introduces a topic that shall knit the brows and contract the face, and shall act as a damper to the Lysian4 god, who, as Pindar says, \" looses the rope of all our cares and anxieties.\"", "2373": "There is also great danger in such ill­ timed freedom of speech.", "2374": "For wine makes people easily slip into rage, and oftentimes freedom of speech in liquor makes enemies.", "2375": "And generally speaking it is not noble or brave but cowardly to conceal your ideas when people are sober and to give free vent to them at table, snarling like cowardly dogs.", "2376": "We need say no more therefore on this head.", "2377": "§ XXVIII.", "2378": "But since many people do not think fit or even dare to find fault with their friends when in prosperity, but think that condition altogether out of the reach and range of rebuke, but inveigh against them if they have made a slip or stumble, and trample upon them if they are in de­ jection and in their power, and, like a stream swollen above its banks, pour upon them then the torrent of all their elo­ quence,1 and enjoy and are glad at their reverse of fortune, owing to their former contempt of them when they were poor themselves, it is not amiss to discuss this somewhat, and to answer those words of Euripides, “ What need of friends, when things go well with us ? \"", "2379": "2 for those in prosperity stand in especial need of friends who shall be outspoken to them, and abate their excessive

anger to his grief, and exasperates his mental distress.", "2385": "For example anyone well is not at all angry or fierce with a friend, who blames him for his excesses with women and wine, his laziness and taking no exercise, his frequent baths, and his unseasonable surfeit­ ing :", "2386": "but to a person ill all this is unsufferable, and even worse than his illness to hear, \" All this

People in old times were well satisfied if they were not injured by strange and wild beasts, and that was the only motive of their fights with them, but those of later days have by now learnt to make use of them, for they feed on their flesh, and clothe themselves with their wool, and make medical use of their gall and beestings, and turn their hides into shields, so that we might reasonably fear, if beasts failed man, that his life would become brutish, and wild, and void of resources.", "2522": "Similarly since all others are satisfied with not being injured by their enemies, but the sensible will also (as Xenophon says) get profit out of them, we must not be incredulous, but seek a method and plan how to obtain this advantage, seeing that life without an enemy is impossible.", "2523": "The husbandman cannot cultivate every tree, nor can the hunter tame every kind of animal, so both seek means to derive profit according to their several necessities, the one from his barren trees, the other from his wild animals.", "2524": "Sea-water also is undrinkable and brackish, but it feeds fish, and is a sort of vehicle to convey and transport travellers anywhere.", "2525": "The Satyr,

injurious and intractable, he some­ how or other gives us a handle to make use of him by, and so is serviceable.", "2529": "And many things are unpleasant and detestable and antagonistic to those to whom they happen, but you must have noticed that some use even illnesses as a period of rest for the body, and others by excessive toil have strengthened and trained their bodily vigour, and some have made exile and the loss of money a passage to leisure and philosophy, as did Diogenes and Crates.", "2530": "And Zeno, when he heard of the wreck of the ship which con­ tained all his property, said, \" Thou hast done well, Fortune, to confine me to my threadbare cloak.”", "2531": "3For as those animals that have the strongest and healthiest stomachs eat and digest serpents and scorpions, and some

whole life, trying to get a handle against you somewhere, able not only to look through a tree, like Lynceus,4 or through stones and shells, but through your friend and domestic and every intimate acquaintance, as far as possible detecting your doings, and digging and ferreting into your designs.", "2535": "For our friends are ill and often die without our knowing anything about it through our delay and carelessness, but we almost pry into even the dreams of our enemies ;", "2536": "and our enemy knows even more than we do ourselves of our diseases and debts and differences with our

ones, so the diseases and vices and crimes of life attract the enemy, and on these those that hate us pounce, these they attack and tear to pieces.", "2540": "Is not this an advantage to us P Certainly it is.", "2541": "For it teaches us to live warily and be on our guard, and neither to do or say anything carelessly or without circumspection, but ever to be vigilant by careful mode of living that we give no handle to an enemy.", "2542": "For the cautiousness that thus represses the passions and follows reason implants a care and determination to live well and without reproach.", "2543": "For as those states that have been sobered by wars with their neighbours and continual campaigns love the blessings of order and peace, so those people who are compelled to lead a sober life owing to their enemies, and to be on their guard against carelessness and negligence, and to do every­ thing with an eye to utility, imperceptibly glide into a fault­ less mode of life, and tone down

instruments, and adjust their chords, and play on the flute with more care.", "2548": "Similarly whoever knows that his enemy is an­ tagonistic to his life and character, pays more attention to himself, and watches his behaviour more carefully, and regulates his life.", "2549": "For it is peculiar to vice to be more afraid of enemies than friends in regard to our faults.", "2550": "And so

suspected and feared the invitation, and pleaded as an excuse that he was not very well, Polysperchon called on him, and addressed him as follows, \" Imitate, my lad, your father's good- nature and kindness to his friends, unless indeed you fear us as plotting against you.\"", "3265": "The young man was ashamed to refuse any longer, so he went with him, and some of those at the supper-party strangled him.", "3266": "And so that line of Hesiod,2 “ Invite your friend to supper, not your enemy,\" is not ridiculous, as some say, or stupid advice, but wise.", "3267": "Show no bashfulness in regard to an enemy, and do not suppose him trustworthy, though he may seem so.", "3268": "3", "3269": "For if you invite you will be invited back, and if you entertain others you will be entertained back to your hurt, if you let the temper as it were of your caution be weakened by shame.", "3270": "§ v.", "3271": "As then this disease is the cause of much mischief, we must try and exterminate it by assiduous effort, begin­ ning first, as people are wont to do in other matters, with small and easy things.", "3272": "For example, if anyone pledge you to drink with him at a dinner when you have had enough, do not be bashful, or do violence to nature, but put the cup down without drinking.", "3273": "Again, if somebody else challenge you to play at dice with him in your cups, be not bashful or afraid of ridicule, but imitate Xenophanes, who, when Lasus of Hermione called him coward because he would not play at dice with him, admitted that he was a great coward and had no courage for what was ignoble.", "3274": "Again, if you meet with some prating fellow who attacks you and sticks to you, do not be bashful, but get rid of him, and hasten on and pursue your undertaking.", "3275": "For such flights and repulses, keeping you in practice in trying to overcome your bashfulness in small matters, will pre­ pare you for greater occasions.", "3276": "And here it is well to record a remark of Demosthenes.", "3277": "When the Athenians were going to help Harpalus, and to war against Alex­ ander, all of a sudden Philoxenus, who was Alexander's admiral, was sighted in the offing.", "3278": "And the populace being greatly alarmed, and speechless for fear, Demos­ thenes said, \" What will they do when they see the sun, if they cannot lift their eyes to face a lamp ? \"", "3279": "And what will you do in important matters, if the king desires anything, or the people importune you, if you cannot decline to drink when your friend asks you, or evade the onset of some prating fellow, but allow the trifler to waste all your time, from not having nerve to say, \" I will see you some other time, I have no leisure now.\"", "3280": "1§ vi.", "3281": "Moreover, the use and practice of restraining one's bashfulness in small and unimportant matters is advan­ tageous also in regard to praise.", "3282": "For example, if a friend's harper sings badly at a drinking party, or an actor hired at great cost murders 2 Menander, and most of the party clap and applaud, I find it by no means hard, or bad manners, to listen silently, and not to be so illiberal as to praise con­ trary to one's convictions.", "3283": "For if in such matters you are not master of yourself, what will you do if your friend reads a poor poem, or parades a speech stupidly and ridicu­ lously written ?3", "3284": "You will praise it of course, and join the flatterers in loud applause.", "3285": "But how then will you find fault with your friend if be makes mistakes in busi­ ness ?", "3286": "How will you be able to correct him, if he acts improperly in reference to some office, or marriage, or the state ?", "3287": "For I cannot indeed assent to the remark of Pericles to his friend, who asked him to bear false witness in his favour even to the extent of perjury, \" I am your friend as far as the altar.\"", "3288": "He went too far.", "3289": "But he that has long accustomed himself never to go against his con­ victions in praising a speaker, or clapping a singer, or laughing at a dull buffoon, will never go to this length, nor say to some impudent fellow in such matters, \" Swear on my behalf, bear false witness, pronounce an unjust verdict.\"§ VII.", "3290": "So also we ought to refuse people that want to borrow money of us, from being accustomed to say No in small and easily refused matters.", "3291": "Thus Archelaus, king of the Macedonians, being asked at supper for a gold cup by a man who thought Receive the finest word in the lan­ guage, bade a boy give it to Euripides,1 and gazing intently on the man said to him, \" You are fit to ask, and not to receive, and he is fit to receive without asking.\"", "3292": "Thus did he make judgement and not bashfulness the arbiter of his gifts and favours.", "3293": "Yet we oftentimes pass over our friends who are both deserving and in need, and give to others who continually and impudently importune us, not from the wish to give but from the inability to say No.", "3294": "So the older Antigonus, being frequently annoyed by Bion, said, “ Give a talent to Bion and necessity.\"", "3295": "Yet he was of all the kings most clever and ingenious at getting rid of such importunity.", "3296": "For on one occasion, when a Cynic asked him for a drachma, he replied, \" That would be too little for a king to give;", "3297": "\"2 and when the Cynic rejoined, “ Give me then a talent,\" be met him with, \" That would be too much for a Cynic to receive.”", "3298": "3 Diogenes indeed used to go round begging to the statues in the Ceramicus, and when people expressed their astonishment said he was practising how to bear refusals.", "3299": "And we must practise ourselves in small matters, and exercise ourselves in little things, with a view to refusing people who importune us, or would receive from us when inconvenient, that we may be able to avoid great miscarriages.", "3300": "For no one, as Demosthenes says,1 if he expends his resources on unne­ cessary things, will have means for necessary ones.", "3301": "And our disgrace is greatly increased, if we are deficient in what is noble, and abound in what is trivial.", "3302": "§ vInI.", "3303": "But bashfulness is not only a bad and inconsi­ derate manager of money, but also in more important matters makes us reject expediency and reason.", "3304": "For when we are ill we do not call in the experienced doctor, because we stand in awe of the family one;", "3305": "and instead of the best teachers for our boys we select those that importune us;", "3306": "2 and in our suits at law we frequently refuse the aid of some skilled advocate, to oblige the son of some friend or relative, and give him a chance to make a forensic display;", "3307": "and lastly, you will find many so-called philosophers Epi­ cureans or Stoics, not from deliberate choice or conviction, but simply from bashfulness, to have the same views as their friends and acquaintances.", "3308": "Since this is the case, let us accustom ourselves betimes in small and everyday matters to employ no barber or fuller merely from bash­ fulness, nor to put up at a sorry inn, when a better is at hand, merely because the innkeeper has on several occa­ sions been extra civil to us, but for the benefit of the habit to select the best even in a small matter;", "3309": "as the Pytha­ goreans were careful never to put their left leg across the right, nor to take an even number instead of an odd, all other matters being indifferent.", "3310": "We must accustom our­ selves also, at a sacrifice or marriage or any entertainment of that kind, not to invite the person who greets us and runs up to meet us, but the friend who is serviceable to us.", "3311": "For he that has thus practised and trained himself will be difficult to catch tripping, nay even unassailable, in greater matters.", "3312": "§ ix.", "3313": "Let so much suffice for practice.", "3314": "And of useful considerations the first is that which teaches and reminds us, that all passions and maladies of the soul are accom­ panied by the very things which we think we avoid through them.", "3315": "Thus infamy comes through too great love of fame, and pain comes from love of pleasure, and plenty of work to the idle, and to the contentious defeats and losses of lawsuits.", "3316": "And so too it is the fate of bashfulness, in fleeing from the smoke of ill-repute, to throw itself into the fire of it.", "3317": "1", "3318": "For the bashful, not venturing to say No to those that press them hard, afterwards feel shame at just rebuke, and, through standing in awe of slight blame, frequently in the end incur open disgrace.", "3319": "For if a friend asks some money of them, and through bashfulness they cannot refuse, a little time after they are disgraced by the facts becoming known;", "3320": "2 or if they have promised to help friends in a lawsuit, they turn round and hide their diminished heads, and run away from fear of the other side.", "3321": "Many also, who have accepted on behalf of a daughter or sister an unprofitable offer of marriage at the bidding of bashfulness, have afterwards been compelled to break their word, and break off the match.", "3322": "§ x. He that said all the dwellers in Asia were slaves to one man because they could not say the one syllable", "3323": "No, spoke in jest and not in earnest;", "3324": "but bashful persons, even if they say nothing, can by raising or dropping their eyebrows decline many disagreeable and unplea­ sant acts of compliance.", "3325": "For Euripides says, \" Silence is an answer to wise men,\"3 but we stand more in need of it to inconsiderate persons, for we can talk over the sensible.", "3326": "And indeed it is well to have at hand and frequently on our lips the sayings' of good and famous men to quote to those who importune us, as that of Phocion to Antipater, \" You cannot have me both as a friend and flatterer ;", "3327": "”or his remark to the Athenians, when they applauded him and bade him contribute to the expenses of a festival, \" I am ashamed to contribute anything to you, till I have paid yonder person my debts to him,\" pointing out his creditor Callicles.", "3328": "For, as Thucydides says, \" It is not disgraceful to admit one's poverty, but it is very much so not to try to mend it.\"", "3329": "1 But he who through stupidity or softness is too bashful to say to anyone that importunes him, “ Stranger, no silver white is in my caves,\" but goes bail for him as it were through his promises, \" Is bound by fetters not of brass but shame.”", "3330": "2 But Persæus,3 when he lent a sum of money to one of his friends, had the fact duly attested by a banker in the market-place, remembering belike that line in Hesiod,4 \" E'en to a brother, smiling, bring you witness.\"", "3331": "And he wondering and saying, \"Why all these legal forms, Persaeus ? \" he replied, \" Ay, verily, that my money may be paid back in a friendly way, and that I may not have to use legal forms to get it back.\"", "3332": "For many, at first too bashful to see to security, have afterwards had to go to law, and lost their friend.'§ xi.", "3333": "Plato again, giving Helicon of Cyzicus a letter for Dionysius, praised the bearer as a man of goodness and moderation, but added at the end of the letter, \" I write you this about a man, an animal by nature apt to change.\"", "3334": "But Xenocrates, though a man of austere character, was prevailed upon through his bashfulness to recommend to Polysperchon by letter, one who was no good man as the event showed;", "3335": "for when the Macedonian welcomed him, and inquired if he wanted any money, he asked for a talent, and Polyspercbon gave it him, but wrote to Xeno­ crates advising him for the future to be more careful in the choice of people he recommended.", "3336": "But Xenocrates knew not the fellow's true character;", "3337": "we on the other hand very often when we know that such and such men are bad, yet give them testimonials and money, doing ourselves injury, and not getting any pleasure for it, as people do get in the company of whores and flatterers, but being vexed and disgusted at the importunity that has upset and forced our reason.", "3338": "For the line \" I know that what I'm going to do is bad,”1 is especially applicable to people that importune us, when one is going to perjure oneself, or deliver an unjust verdict, or vote for a measure that is inexpedient, or borrow money for someone who will never pay it back.", "3339": "§ XII.", "3340": "And so repentance follows more closely upon bash­ fulness than upon any emotion, and that Dot afterwards but in the very act.", "3341": "For we are vexed with ourselves when we give, and ashamed when we perjure ourselves, and get ill-fame from our advocacies, and are put to the blush when we cannot fulfil our promises.", "3342": "For frequently, from inability to say No, we promise impossibilities to perse­ vering applicants, as introductions at court, and audiences with princes, from reluctance or want of nerve to say, \" The king does not know us, others have his regard far more.\"", "3343": "But Lysander, when he was out of favour with Agesilaus, though he was thought to have very great influence with him owing to his great reputation, was not ashamed to dismiss suitors, and bid them go and pay their court to others who had more influence with the king.", "3344": "For not to be able to do everything carries no disgrace with it, but to undertake and try and force your way to what you are unable to do, or unqualified by nature for, is in addition to the disgrace incurred a task full of trouble.", "3345": "§ XIII.", "3346": "To take another element into consideration, all seemly and modest requests we ought readily to comply with, not bashfully but heartily, whereas in injurious or unreasonable requests we ought ever to remember the con­ duct of Zeno, who, meeting a young man he knew walking very quietly near a wall, and learning from him that he was trying to get out of the way of a friend who wanted him to perjure himself on his behalf, said to him, \" 0 stupid fellow, what do you tell me ?", "3347": "Is he not afraid or ashamed to press you to what is not right ?", "3348": "And dare not you stand up boldly against him for what is right?\"", "3349": "For he that said \" villainy is no bad weapon against villainy \"1 taught people the bad practice of standing on one's defence against vice by imitating it;", "3350": "but to get rid of those who shame­ lessly and unblushingly importune us by their own effron­ tery, and not to gratify the immodest in their disgrace­ ful desires through false modesty, is the right and proper conduct of sensible people.", "3351": "§ xiv.", "3352": "Moreover it is no great task to resist disreputable and low and worthless fellows who importune you, but some send such off with a laugh or a jest, as Theocritus did, who, when two fellows in the public baths, one a stranger, the other a well-known thief, wanted to borrow his scraper,2 put them both off with a playful answer, \"You, sir, I don't know, and you I know too well.\"", "3353": "And Lysimache,3 the priestess of Athene Polias at Athens, when some muleteers that bore the sacred vessels asked her to give them a drink, answered, \" I hesitate to do so from fear that you would make a practice of it.\"", "3354": "And when a cer­ tain young man, the son of a distinguished officer, but himself effeminate and far from bold, asked Antigonus for promotion, he replied, \" With me, young man, honours are given for personal prowess, not for the prowess of an­ cestors.\"§ XV.", "3355": "But if the person that importunes us be famous or a man of power, for such persons are very hard to move by entreaty or to get rid of when they come to sue for your vote and interest, it will not perhaps be easy or even ne­ cessary to behave as Cato, when quite a young man, did to Catulus.", "3356": "Catulus was in the highest repute at Rome, and at that time held the office of censor, and went to Cato, who then held the office of quæstor, and tried to beg off some­ one whom he had fined, and was urgent and even violent in his petitions, till Cato at last lost all patience, and said, “ To have you, the censor, removed by my officers against your will, Catulus, would not be a seemly thing for you.\"", "3357": "So Callus felt ashamed, and went off in a rage.", "3358": "But see whether the answers of Agesilaus and Themistocles are not more modest and in better form.", "3359": "Agesilaus, when he was asked by his father to pronounce sentence contrary to the law, said, \" Father, I was taught by you even from my earliest years to obey the laws, so now I shall obey you and do nothing contrary to law.\"", "3360": "And Themistocles, when Simonides asked him to do something unjust, replied, it Neither would you be a good poet if your lines violated the laws of metre, nor should I be a good magistrate if I gave decisions contrary to law.\"§ XVI.", "3361": "And yet it is not on account of want of metrical harmony in respect to the lyre, to borrow the words of Plato, that cities quarrel with cities and friends with friends, and do and suffer the worst woes, but on account of deviations1 from law and justice.", "3362": "And yet some, who themselves pay great attention to melody and letters and measures, do not think it wrong for others to neglect what is right in magistracies and judicial sentences and business generally.", "3363": "One must therefore deal with them in the fol­ lowing manner.", "3364": "Does an orator ask a favour of you when you are acting as juryman, or a demagogue when you are sitting in council ?", "3365": "Say you will grant his request if he first utter a solecism, or introduce a barbarism into his speech;", "3366": "he will refuse because of the shame that would attach itself to him;", "3367": "at any rate we see some that will not in a speech let two vowels come together.", "3368": "If again some illustrious and distinguished person importune you to something bad, bid him come into the market-place dancing or making wry faces, and if he refuse you will have an opportunity to speak, and ask him which is more disgraceful, to utter a solecism and make wry faces, or to violate the Jaw and one's oath, and contrary to justice to do more for a bad than for a good man.", "3369": "Nicostratus the Argive, when Archidamus offered him a large sum of money and any Lacedæmonian bride he chose if he would deliver up Cromnum, said Archidamus could not be a descendant of Hercules, for he travelled about and killed evil-doers, whereas Archidamus tried to make evil-doers of the good.", "3370": "In like manner, if a man of good repute tries to force and importune us to something bad, let us tell him that he is acting in an ignoble way, and not as his birth and virtue would warrant.", "3371": "§ XVII.", "3372": "But in the case of people of no repute you must see whether you can persuade the miser by your impor­ tunity to lend you money without a bond, or the proud man to yield you the better place, or the ambitious man to surrender some office to you when he might take it him­ self.", "3373": "For truly it would seem monstrous that, while such remain firm and inflexible and unmoveable in their vicious propensities, we who wish to be, and profess to be, men of honour and justice should be so little masters of ourselves as to abandon and betray virtue.", "3374": "For indeed, if those who importune us do it for glory and power, it is absurd that we should adorn and aggrandize others only to get infamy and a bad name ourselves;", "3375": "like unfair umpires in the public games, or like people voting only to ingratiate themselves, and so bestowing improperly offices and prizes1 and glory on others, while they rob themselves of respect and fair fame.", "3376": "And if we see that the person who impor­ tunes us only does so for money, does it not occur to one that it is monstrous to be prodigal of one's own fame and reputation merely to make somebody else's purse heavier ?", "3377": "Why the idea must occur to most people, they sin with their eyes open ;", "3378": "like people who are urged hard to toss off big bumpers, and grunt and groan and make wry faces, but at last do as they are told.", "3379": "§ XVIII.", "3380": "Such weakness of mind is like a temperament of body equally susceptible to heat and cold ;", "3381": "for if such people are praised by those that importune them they are overcome and yield at once, whereas they are mortally afraid of the blame and suspicions of those whose desires they do not comply with.", "3382": "But we ought to be stout and resolute in either case, neither yielding to bullying nor cajolery.", "3383": "Thucydides indeed tells us, since envy necessarily follows ability, that \" he is well advised who incurs envy in matters of the highest importance.\"", "3384": "2", "3385": "But we, thinking it difficult to escape envy, and seeing that it is altogether impossible not to incur blame or give offence to those we live with, shall be well advised if we prefer the hatred of the perverse to that of those who might justly find fault with us for having iniquitously served their turn.", "3386": "And indeed we ought to be on our guard against praise from those who importune us, which is sure to be altogether in­ sincere, and not to resemble swine, readily allowing anyone that presses to make use of us from our pleasure at itching and tickling, and submitting ourselves to their will.", "3387": "For those that give their ears to flatterers differ not a whit from such as let themselves be tripped up at wrestling, only their overthrow and fall is more disgraceful;", "3388": "some for­ bearing hostility and reproof in the case of bad men, that they may be called merciful and humane and compas­ sionate ;", "3389": "and others on the contrary persuaded to take up unnecessary and dangerous animosities and charges by those who praise them as the only men, the only people that never flatter, and go so far as to entitle them their mouthpieces and voices.", "3390": "Accordingly Bio1 compared such people to jars, that you could easily take by the ears and turn about at your will.", "3391": "Thus it is recorded that the sophist Alexinus in one of his lectures said a good many bad things about Stilpo the Megarian, but when one of those that were present said, \" Why, he was speaking in your praise only the

Hercules in Antisthenes' gave, when he ordered his sons to be grateful to no one that praised them;", "3395": "which meant nothing else than that they should not be dumbfoundered at it, nor flatter again those who praised them.", "3396": "Very apt, I take it, was the remark of Pindar to one who told him that he praised him everywhere and to all persons, \" I am greatly obliged to you, and will

this infirmity, and against their judgement have erred and been confounded, let them fix it in their memories, and, remembering the pain and grief it gave them, let them recall it to their mind and be on their guard for a very long time.", "3399": "For as travellers that have stumbled against a stone, or pilots that have been wrecked off a headland, if they remember these occurrences, not only dread and are on their guard continually on those spots, but also on all similar ones;", "3400": "so those that frequently remember the disgrace and injury that bashfulness brought them, and its sorrow and anguish, will in similar cases be on their guard against their weakness, and will not readily allow themselves to be subjugated by it again.§ I. Sylla.", "3401": "Those painters, Fundanus, seem to me to do well who, before giving the finishing touches to their paintings, lay them by for a time and then revise them ;", "3402": "because by taking their eyes off them for a time they gain by frequent inspection a new insight, and are more apt to detect minute differences, that continuous familiarity would have hidden.", "3403": "Now since a human being cannot so separate himself from himself for a time, and make a break in his continuity, and then approach himself again-and that is perhaps the chief reason why a man is a worse judge of himself than of others-the next best thing will be for a man to inspect his friends after an interval, and likewise offer himself to their scrutiny, not to see whether he has aged quickly, or whether his bodily condition is butter or worse, but to examine his moral character, and see whether time has added any good quality, or removed any bad one.", "3404": "On my return then to Rome after an absence of two years, and having been with you now five months, I am not at all surprised that there has been a great increase and growth in those good points which you formerly had owing to your admirable nature;", "3405": "but when I see how gentle and obedient to reason your former excessive impetuosity and hot temper has become, it cannot but occur to me to quote the line, “ Ye gods, how much more mild is he become! ”1 And this mildness has not wrought in you sloth or weakness, but like cultivation of the soil it has produced a smoothness and depth fit for action, instead of the former impetuosity and vehemence.", "3406": "And so it is clear that your propensity to anger has not been effaced by any declining vigour or through some chance, but has been cured by good precepts.", "3407": "And indeed, for I will tell you the truth, when our friend Eros2 reported this change in you to me, I suspected that owing to goodwill he bare witness not of the actual state of the case, but of what was becoming to all good and virtuous men, although, as you know, he can never be persuaded to depart from his real opinion to in­ gratiate himself with anyone.", "3408": "But now he is acquitted of false witness, and do you, as your journey gives you leisure, narrate to me the mode of cure you employed to make your temper so under control, so natural, gentle and obedient to reason.", "3409": "Fundanus.", "3410": "Most friendly Sylla, take care that you do not in your goodwill and affection to me rest under any misconception of my real condition.", "3411": "For it is possible that Eros, not being able always himself to keep his temper in its place in the obedience that Homer speaks of,- but some­ times carried away by his hatred of what is bad, may think me grown milder than I really am, as in changes of the scale in music the lowest notes become the highest.", "3412": "Sylla.", "3413": "Neither of these is the case, Fundanus, but oblige me by doing as I ask.", "3414": "§ ii.", "3415": "Fundanus.", "3416": "One of the excellent precepts then of Musonius that I remember, Sylla, is this, that those who wish to be well should diet themselves all their life long.", "3417": "For I do not think we must employ reason as a cure, as we do hellebore, by purging it out with the disease, but we must retain it in the soul, to restrain and govern the judge­ ment.", "3418": "For the power of reason is not like physic, but wholesome food, which co-operates with good health in producing a good habit of body in those by whom it is taken.", "3419": "But admonition and reproof, when passion is at its height and swelling, does little or no good, but resem­ bles very closely those strong-smelling substances, that are able to set on their legs again those that have fallen in epileptic fits, but cannot rid them of their disease.", "3420": "For although all other passions, even at the moment of their acme, do in some sort listen to reason and admit it into the soul, yet anger does not, for, as Melanthius says, “ Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles,\" for it absolutely turns reason out of doors, and bolts it out, and, like those persons who burn themselves and houses together, it makes all the interior full of confusion and smoke and noise, so that what would be advantageous can neither be seen nor heard.", "3421": "And so an empty ship in a storm at open sea would sooner admit on board a pilot from without, than a man in a tempest of rage and anger would listen to another's advice, unless his own reason was first prepared to hearken.", "3422": "But as those who expect a siege get together and store up supplies, when they despair of relief from without, so ought we by all means to scour the country far and wide to derive aids against anger from philosophy, and store them up in the soul:", "3423": "for, when the time of need comes, we shall find it no easy task to import them.", "3424": "For either the soul doesn't hear what is said with­ out because of the uproar, if it have not within its own reason (like a boatswain as it were) to receive at once and understand every exhortation;", "3425": "or if it does hear, it despises what is uttered mildly and gently, while it is exasperated by harsh censure.", "3426": "For anger being haughty and self- willed and hard to be worked upon by another, like a fortified tyranny, must have someone born and bred within it1 to overthrow it.", "3427": "§ III.", "3428": "Now long-continued anger, and frequent giving way to it, produces an evil disposition of soul, which people call irascibility, and which ends in passionateness, bitter­ ness, and peevishness, whenever the mind becomes sore and vexed at trifles and querulous at everyday occurrences, like iron thin and beaten out too fine.", "3429": "But when the judgement checks and suppresses at once the rising anger, it not only cures the soul for the moment, but restores its tone and balance for the future.", "3430": "It has happened to myself indeed twice or thrice, when I strongly fought against anger, that I was in the same plight as the Thebans, who after they had once defeated the Lacedæmonians, whom they had hitherto thought invincible, never lost a battle against them again.", "3431": "I then felt confident that reason can win the victory.", "3432": "I saw also that anger is not only appeased by the sprinkling of cold water, as Aristotle attested, but is also extinguished by the action of fear ;", "3433": "aye, and, as Homer tells us, anger has been cured and has melted away in the case of many by some sudden joy.", "3434": "So that I came to the con­ clusion that this passion is not incurable for those who wish to be cured.", "3435": "For it does not arise from great and important causes, but banter and joking, a laugh or a nod, and similar trifles make many angry, as Helen by addressing her niece, \" Electra, maiden now for no short time,\" 2 provoked her to reply, “ Your wisdom blossoms late, since formerly", "3436": "You left your house in shame;", "3437": "\" 3 and Callisthenes incensed Alexander, by saying, when a huge cup was brought to him, “ I will not drink to Alex­ ander till I shall require the help of Æsculapius.”", "3438": "§ iv.", "3439": "As then it is easy to put out a flame kindled in the hair of hares and in wicks and rubbish, but if it once gets hold of things solid and thick, it quickly destroys and consumes them, “ raging amidst the lofty work of the carpenters,\" as Æschylus1 says ;", "3440": "so he that observes anger in its rise, and sees it gradually smoking and bursting forth into fire from some chatter or rubbishy scurrility, need have no great trouble with it, but can frequently smother it merely by silence and contempt.", "3441": "For as a person puts out a fire by bringing no fuel to it, so with respect to anger, he that does not in the beginning fan it, and stir up its rage in himself, keeps it off and destroys it.", "3442": "And so, though Hieronymus has given -as many useful sayings and precepts, I am not pleased with his remark that there is no perception of anger in its birth, but only in its actual developement, so quick is it.", "3443": "For none of the passions when stirred up and set in motion has so palpable a birth and growth as anger.", "3444": "As indeed Homer skilfully shows us, where he represents Achilles as seized at once with grief, when word was brought him of Patroclus' death, in the line, \" Thus spake he, and griefs dark cloud covered him ;", "3445": "” 2 whereas he represents him as waxing angry with Agamem­ non slowly, and as inflamed by his many words, which if either of them3 had abstained from, their quarrel would not have attained such growth and magnitude.", "3446": "And so Socrates, as often as he perceived any anger rising in him against any of his friends, \"setting himself like some ocean promontory to break the violence of the waves,\" would lower his voice, and put on a smiling countenance, and give his eye a gentler expression, by inclining in the other direction and running counter to his passion, thus keeping himself from fall and defeat.", "3447": "§ v.", "3448": "For the first way, my friend, to overcome anger, like the putting down of some tyrant, is not to obey or listen to it when it bids you speak loud, and look fierce, and beat yourself, but to remain quiet, and not to make the passion more intense, as one would a disease, by tossing about and crying out.", "3449": "In love affairs indeed, such things as revellings, and serenadings, and crowning the loved one's door with garlands, may indeed bring some pleasant and elegant relief.", "3450": "\" I went, but asked not who or whose she was, I merely kissed her door-post.", "3451": "If that be A crime, I do plead guilty to the same.”", "3452": "1", "3453": "In the case of mourners also giving up to weeping and wailing takes away with the tears much of the grief.", "3454": "But anger on the contrary is much more fanned by what angry persons do and say.", "3455": "It is best therefore to be calm, or to flee and hide ourselves and go to a haven of quiet, when we feel the fit of temper coming upon us as an epileptic fit, that we fall not, or rather fall not on others, for it is our friends that we fall upon most and most frequently.", "3456": "For we do not love all, nor envy all, nor fear all men ;", "3457": "but nothing is untouched or unassailed by anger;", "3458": "for we are angry with friends and enemies, parents and children, aye, and with the gods, and beasts, and even things inanimate, as was Thamyris, \" Breaking his gold-bound horn, breaking the music", "3459": "Of well-compacted lyrea;", "3460": "”2 and

drunkenness in the Helots.", "3467": "And in the first place, as Hippocrates tells us that disease is most dangerous in which the face of the patient is most unlike himself, so observing that people beside themselves with anger change their face, colour, walk, and voice, I formed an impression as it were of that aspect of passion, and was very disgusted with myself if ever I should appear so frightful and like one out of his mind to my friends and wife and daughters, not only wild and unlike oneself in appearance, but also with a voice savage and harsh, as I had noticed in some 1 of my acquaintance, who could neither preserve for anger their ordinary behaviour, or demea­ nour, or grace of language, or persuasiveness and gentle­ ness in conversation.", "3468": "Caius Gracchus, indeed, the orator, whose character was harsh and style of oratory impassioned, had a pitch-pipe made for him, such as musicians use to heighten or lower their voices by degrees, and this, when he was making a speech, a slave stood behind him and held, and used to give him a mild and gentle note on it, whereby he lowered his key, and removed from his voice the harsh and passionate element, charming and laying the heat of the orator, “ As shepherds' wax-joined reed sounds musically With sleep provoking strain.\"", "3469": "2", "3470": "For myself if I had some elegant and sprightly companion, I should not be vexed at his showing me a looking-glass in my fits of anger, as they offer one to some after a bath to little useful end.", "3471": "For to behold oneself unnaturally distorted in countenance will condemn anger in no small degree.", "3472": "The poets playfully tell us that Athene when play­ ing on the pipe was rebuked thus by a Satyr, \" That look no way becomes you, take your armour, Lay down your pipes, and do compose your cheeks,\" and though she paid no attention to him, yet afterwards when she saw her face in a river, she felt vexed and threw her pipes away, although art had made melody a compen­ sation for her unsightliness.", "3473": "And Marsyas, it seems, by a sort of mouthpiece forcibly repressed the violence of his breath, and tricked up and hid the contortion of his face, \" Around his shaggy temples put bright gold, And o'er his open mouth thongs tied behind.\"", "3474": "Now anger, that puffs up and distends the face so as to look ugly, utters a voice still more harsh and unpleasant, “ Moving the mind's chords undisturbed before.\"", "3475": "They say that the sea is cleansed when agitated by the winds it throws up tangle and seaweed;", "3476": "but the intem­ perate and bitter and vain words, which the mind throws up when the soul is agitated, defile the speakers of them first of all and fill them with infamy, as always having those thoughts within their bosom and being defiled with them, but only giving vent to them in anger.", "3477": "And so for a word which is, as Plato styles it, \" a very small matter,\" they incur a most heavy punishment, for they get reputed to be enemies, and evil speakers, and malignant in dis­ position.§ VII.", "3478": "Seeing and observing all this, it occurs to me to take it as a matter of fact, and record it for my own general use, that if it is good to keep the tongue soft and smooth in a fever, it is better to keep it so in anger.", "3479": "For if the tongue of people in a fever be unnatural, it is a bad sign, but not the cause of their malady;", "3480": "but the tongue of angry people, being rough and foul, and breaking out into unseemly speeches, produces insults that work irremediable mischief, and argue deep-rooted malevolence within.", "3481": "For wine drunk neat does not exhibit the soul in so ungovern­ able and hateful a condition as temper does:", "3482": "for the outbreaks of the one smack of laughter and fun, while those of the other are compounded with gall:", "3483": "and at a drinking-bout he that is silent is burdensome to the company and tiresome, whereas in anger nothing is more highly thought of than silence, as Sappho advises, \" When anger's busy in the brain Thy idly-barking tongue restrain.,,§ VIlI.", "3484": "And not only does the consideration of all this naturally arise from observing ourselves in the moments of anger, but we cannot help seeing also the other properties of rage, how ignoble it is, how unmanly, how devoid of dignity and greatness of mind !", "3485": "And yet to most people its noise seems vigour, its threatening confidence, and its obstinacy force of character ;", "3486": "some even not wisely entitle its savageness magnanimity, and its implacability firmness, and its morosity hatred of what is bad.", "3487": "For their actions and motions and whole demeanour argue great littleness and meanness, not only when they are fierce with little boys, and peevish with women, and think it right to treat dogs and horses and mules with harshness, as Ctesiphon the pancratiast thought fit to kick back a mule that had kicked him, but even in the butcheries that tyrants commit their littleness of soul is apparent in their savageness, and their suffering in their action, so that they are like the bites of serpents, that, when they are burnt and smart with pain, violently thrust their venom on those that have hurt them.", "3488": "For as a swelling is produced in the flesh by a heavy blow, so in softest souls the inclination to hurt others gets its greater strength from greater weakness.", "3489": "Thus women are more prone to anger than men, and people in than people well, and old men than men in their prime, and the unfortunate than the prosperous ;", "3490": "the miser is most prone to anger with his steward, the glutton with his cook, the jealous man with his wife, the vain man when he is spoken ill of ;", "3491": "and worst of all are those \" men who are too eager in states for office, or to head a faction, a manifest Borrow,\" to borrow Pindar's words.", "3492": "So from the very great pain and suffering of the soul there arises mainly from weakness anger, which is not like the nerves of the soul, as some one defined it, but like its strainings and convul­ sions when it is excessively vehement in its thirst for revenge.", "3493": "§ ix.", "3494": "Such bad examples as these were not pleasant to look at but necessary, but I shall now proceed to describe people who have been mild and easy in dealing with anger, conduct gratifying either to see or hear about, being utterly disgusted1 with people who use such language as, “ You have a man wronged :", "3495": "shall a man stand this ? ” and, \" Put your heel upon his neck, and dash his head against the ground,\" and other provoking expressions such as these, by which some not well have transferred anger from the woman's side of the house to the man's.", "3496": "For manliness in all other respects seems to resemble justice, and to differ from it only in respect to gentleness, with which it has more affinities.", "3497": "For it sometimes happens to worse men to govern better ones, but to erect a trophy in the soul against anger (which Heraclitus says it is difficult to contend against, for whatever it wishes is bought at the price of the soul), is a proof of power so great and victorious as to be able to apply the judgement as if it were nerves and sinews to the passions.", "3498": "So I always try to collect and peruse the remarks on this subject not only of the philosophers, who foolish1 people say had no gall in their composition, but still more of kings and tyrants.", "3499": "Such was the remark of Antigonus to his soldiers, when they were abusing him near his tent as if he were not listening, so he put his staff out, and said, \" What's to do ?", "3500": "can you not go rather farther off to run me down ?”", "3501": "And when Arcadio the Achæan, who was always railing against Philip, and ad­ vising people to flee “", "3502": "Unto a country where they knew not

had been cast on shore by a storm at Parætonium, he commanded one of his soldiers only to touch his neck with the naked sword and then to go away quietly, and dismissed him, after sending him a ball and some dice as if he were a silly boy.", "3509": "And Ptolemy on one occasion, flouting a grammarian for his ignorance, asked him who was the father of Peleus, and he answered, \" I will tell you,

Ptolemy said, “If it is not kingly to take a flout, neither is it kingly to give one.\"", "3512": "And Alexander was more savage than usual in his behaviour to Callisthenes and Clitus.", "3513": "So

they reach the goal they are hastening to.", "3520": "So that speech of the Rhodian to a lictor of the Roman prætor who was shouting and talking insolently was not inapt, \" It is no matter to me what

Cyrus and Pelopidas the Theban.", "3525": "But Agathocles bore mildly the revilings of those he was besieging, and when one of them cried out, \" Potter, how are you going to get money to pay your

shall tame and subdue their unreasoning and disobedient elements, yet there is none which we ought to keep under by such discipline so much as the exhibition of anger to our servants.", "3536": "For neither envy, nor fear, nor rivalry come into play between them and us;", "3537": "but our fre­ quent displays of anger to them, creating many offences and faults, make us to slip as if on slippery ground owing to our autocracy with our servants, which no one resists or prevents.", "3538": "For it is impossible to check irresponsible power so as never to break out under the influence of passion, unless one wields power with much meekness, and refuses to listen to the frequent complaints of one's wife and friends charging one with being too easy and lax with one's servants.", "3539": "And by nothing have I been more exasperated against them, as if they were being ruined for want of correction.", "3540": "At last, though late, I got to see that in the first place it is better to make them worse by forbearance, than by bitterness and anger to distort oneself for the correction of others.", "3541": "In the next place I observed that many for the very reason that they were not corrected were frequently ashamed to be bad, and made pardon rather than punish­ ment the commencement of their reformation, aye, and made better slaves to some merely at their nod silently and cheerfully than to others with all their beatings and brandings, and so I came to the conclusion that reason gets better obeyed than temper, for it is not as the poet said, \"", "3542": "Where there is fear, there too is self-respect,\" but it is just the other way about, for self-respect begets that kind of fear that corrects the behaviour.", "3543": "But perpetual and pitiless beating produces not so much repentance for wrong-doing as contrivances to continue in it without detection.", "3544": "In the third place, ever remembering and re­ fleeting within myself that, just as he that teaches us the use of the bow does not forbid us to shoot but only to miss the mark, so it will not prevent punishment altogether to teach people to do it in season, and with moderation, utility, and decorum, I strive to remove anger most espe­ cially by not forbidding those who are to be corrected to speak in their defence, but by listening to them.", "3545": "For the interval of time gives a pause to passion, and a delay that mitigates it, and so judgement finds out both the fit manner and adequate amount of punishment.", "3546": "Moreover he that is punished has nothing to allege against his cor­ rection, if he is punished not in anger but only after his guilt is brought home to him.", "3547": "And the greatest disgrace will not be incurred, which is when the servant seems to speak more justly than the master.", "3548": "As then Phocion, after the death of Alexander, to stop the Athenians from revolt­ ing and believing the news too soon, said to them, \" Men of Athens, if he is dead to-day, he will certainly also be dead to-morrow and the next day,\" so I think the man who is in a hurry to punish anyone in his rage ought to consider with himself, \" If this person has wronged you to-day, he will also have wronged you to-morrow and the next day;", "3549": "and there will be no harm done if he shall be punished somewhat late ;", "3550": "whereas if he shall be pun­ ished at once, he will always seem to you to have been innocent, as has often happened before now.\"", "3551": "For which of us is so savage as to chastise and scourge a slave because five or ten days before he over-roasted the meat, or upset the table, or was somewhat tardy on some errand ?", "3552": "And yet these are the very things for which we put ourselves out and are harsh and implacable, immediately after they have happened and are recent.", "3553": "For as bodies seem greater in a mist, so do little matters in a rage.", "3554": "We ought therefore to consider such arguments as these at once, and if, when there is no trace of passion left, the matter appear bad to calm and clear reason, then it ought to be taken in hand, and the punishment ought not to be neglected or abandoned, as we leave food when we have lost our appetites.", "3555": "For nothing causes people to punish so much when their anger is fierce, as that when it is appeased they do not punish at all, but forget the matter entirely, and resemble lazy rowers, who lie in harbour when the sea is calm, and then sail out to their peril when the wind gets up.", "3556": "So we, condemning reason for slackness and mildness in punishing, are in a hurry to punish, borne along by passion as by a dangerous gale.", "3557": "He that is hungry takes his food as nature dictates, but he that punishes should have no hunger or thirst for it, nor require anger as a sauce to stimulate him to it, but should punish when he is as far as possible from having any desire for it, and has to compel his reason to it.", "3558": "For we ought not, as Aristotle tells us slaves in his time were scourged in Etruria to the music of the flute, to go head­ long into punishing with a desire and zest for it, and to delight in punishing, and then afterwards to be sorry at it -for the first is savage, and the last womanish-but we should without either sorrow or pleasure chastise at the dictates of reason, giving anger no opportunity to interfere.", "3559": "§ XII.", "3560": "But this perhaps will not appear a cure of anger so much as a putting away and avoiding such faults as men commit in anger.", "3561": "And yet, though the swelling of the spleen is only a symptom of fever, the fever is assuaged by its abating, as Hieronymus tells us.", "3562": "Now when I contem­ plated the origin of anger itself, I observed that, though different persons fell into it for different reasons, yet in nearly all of them was the idea of their being despised and neglected to be found.", "3563": "So we ought to help those who try to get rid of anger, by removing as far as possible from them any action savouring of contempt or contumely, and by looking upon their anger as folly or necessity, or emotion, or mischance, as Sophocles says, \" In those that are unfortunate, 0 king, No mind stays firm, but all their balance lose.”", "3564": "1", "3565": "And so Agamemnon, ascribing to Ate his carrying off Briseis, yet says to Achilles, \" I wish to please you in return, and give Completest satisfaction.”", "3566": "a For suing is not the action of one who shews his contempt, and when he that has done an injury is humble he removes all idea of slighting one.", "3567": "But the angry person must not expect this, but rather take to himself the answer of Diogenes, who, when it was said to him, \" These people laugh at you,\" replied, \" But I am not one to be laughed .at,\" and not think himself despised, but rather despise the person who gave the offence, as acting from weakness, or error, or rashness, or heedlessness, or illiberality, or old age, or youth.", "3568": "Nor must we entertain such notions with regard to our servants and friends.", "3569": "For they do not despise us as void of ability or energy, but owing to our evenness and good-nature, some because we are mild, and others presuming on our affection for them.", "3570": "But as it is we not only fly into rages with wife and slaves and friends, as if we were slighted by them, but we also frequently, from forming the same idea of being slighted, fall foul of innkeepers and sailors and muleteers, and are vexed at dogs that bark and asses that are in our way:", "3571": "like the man who was going to beat an ass-driver, but when he cried out he was an Athenian, he said to the ass, \"You are not an Athenian anyway,\" and beat it with many stripes.§", "3572": "XIII.", "3573": "Moreover those continuous and frequent fits of anger that gather together in the soul by degrees, like a swarm of bees or wasps, are generated within us by selfish­ ness and peevishness, luxury and softness.", "3574": "And so nothing causes us to be mild to our servants and wife and friends so much as easiness and simplicity, and the learning to be content with what we have, and not to require a quantity of superfluities.", "3575": "\"", "3576": "He who likes not his meat if over-roast", "3577": "Or over-boiled, or under-roast or under-boiled, And never praises it however dressed,\" but will not drink unless he have snow to cool his drink, nor eat bread purchased in the market, nor touch food served on cheap or earthenware plates, nor sleep upon any but a feather bed that rises and falls like the sea stirred up from its depths, and with rods and blows hastens his servants at table, so that they run about and cry out and sweat as if they were bringing poultices to sores, be is slave to a weak querulous and discontented mode of life, and, like one who has a continual cough or various ailments, whether he is aware of it or not, he is in an ulcerous and catarrh-like condition as regards his prone­ ness to anger.", "3578": "We must therefore train the body to con­ tentment by plain living, that it may be easily satisfied:", "3579":

sage is to give an entertainment! \"", "3585": "And when Socrates once took Euthydemus home with him from the wrestling- school, Xanthippe was in a towering rage, and scolded, and at last upset the table, and Euthydemus rose and went away full of sorrow.", "3586": "But Socrates said to him, \" Did not a hen at your house the other day fly in and act in the very same way ?", "3587": "And we did not put ourselves out about it.\"", "3588": "We ought to receive our friends with gaiety and smiles and welcome, not knitting our brows, or inspiring fear and trembling in the attendants.", "3589": "We ought also to accustom ourselves to the use of any kind of ware at table, and not to stint ourselves to one kind rather than another, as some pick out a particular tankard or horn, as they say

and seals and precious stones:", "3592": "for if they are lost they put a man beside himself much more than the loss of ordinary and easily got things would do.", "3593": "And so when Nero had got an eight-cor­ nered tent constructed, a wonderful object both for its beauty and costliness, Seneca said to him, \"You have now shown yourself to be poor, for if you should lose this, you will not be able to procure such anotber.\"", "3594": "And indeed it did so happen that the tent was lost by shipwreck, but Nero bore its loss patiently, remembering what Seneca had said.", "3595": "Now this easiness about things generally makes a man also easy and gentle to his servants, and if to them, then it is clear he will be so to his friends also, and to all that serve under him in any capacity.",

never resist.", "3917": "We can, however, answer Menander's line, \" No one can say, I shall not suffer this or that,\" for a man can say, \" I will not do this or that, I will not lie, I will not play the rogue, I will not cheat, I will not scheme.\"", "3918": "For this is in our power, and is no small but great help to ease of mind.", "3919": "As on the contrary “The consciousness of having done ill deeds,” 2 like a sore in the flesh, leaves in the mind a regret which ever wounds it and pricks it.", "3920": "For reason banishes all other griefs, but itself creates regret when the soul is vexed with shame and self-tormented.", "3921": "For as those who shudder in ague-fits or burn in fevers feel more trouble and distress than those who externally suffer the same from cold or heat, so

shame felt.", "3922": "And so neither costly house, nor quantity of gold, nor pride of race, nor weighty office, nor grace of language, nor eloquence, impart so much calm and serenity to life, as a

the road at once for those who would follow up their villainy if it were successful.", "4214": "For no debt so much as that of justice paid behind time damps the hopes and dejects the mind of the

involved in these delays and longsuffering of the deity.", "4229": "For the slowness of punishment takes away belief in providence, and the wicked, observing that no evil follows each crime except long afterwards, attri­ bute it when it comes to mischance, and look upon it in the light more of accident than punishment, and so receive no benefit from it, being grieved indeed when the misfortune comes, but feeling no remorse for what they have done amiss.", "4230": "For, as in the case of a horse, the whip­ ping or spurring that immediately follows upon a stumble or some other fault is a corrective and brings him to his duty, but pulling and backing him with the bit and shouting at him long afterwards seems to come from some other motive than a desire to teach him, for he is put to pain without being shown his fault;", "4231": "so the vice which each time it stumbles or offends is at once punished and checked by correction is most likely2 to coma to itself and be humble and stand in awe of the deity, as one that beholds men's acts and passions and does not punish behind time;", "4232": "whereas that justice that, according to Euripides, \" steals on silently and with

anyone not a professional to conjecture why the surgeon performed an operation later rather than sooner, or why he ordered his patient to take a bath to-day rather than yesterday, how is it easy or safe for a mortal to say anything else about the deity than that he knows best the time to cure vice, and applies to each his punishment as the doctor administers a drug, and that a punishment not of the same magnitude, or applied at the same time, in all cases.", "4239": "For that the cure of the soul, which is called justice, is the greatest of all arts is testified by Pindar as well as by ten

be punished.", "4240": "And Plato says that Minos, the son of Zeus, was his father's pupil in this art, not thinking it possible that any one could succeed in justice, or understand how to succeed in it, without he had learned or somehow got that science.", "4241": "For the laws which men make are not always merely reasonable, nor is their meaning always apparent, but some injunctions seem quite

them.", "4242": "And the Romans lay a light rod on the bodies of those they make freemen, and when they make their wills, they nominate some as their heirs, while to others they sell the property,

some sort a resem­ blance to himself, to those who are able to follow him.", "4248": "For all nature, being in disorder, got the principle of change and became order1 by a resemblance to and participation in the nature and virtue of the deity.", "4249": "The same Plato also tells us that nature put eyesight into us, in order that the soul by beholding and admiring the heavenly bodies might accustom itself to welcome and love harmony and order, and might hate disorderly and roving propensities, and avoid aimless reliance on chance, as the parent of all vice and error.", "4250": "For man can enjoy no greater blessing from god than to attain to virtue by the earnest imitation of the noblest qualities of the divine nature.", "4251": "And so he punishes the wicked leisurely and long after, not being afraid of error or after repentance through punishing too hastily, but to take away from us that eager and brutish thirst for revenge, and to teach us that we are not to reta­ liate on those that have offended us in anger, and when the soul is most inflamed and distorted with passion and almost beside itself for rage, like people satisfying fierce thirst or hunger, but to imitate the mildness and long-suffering of the deity, and to avenge ourselves in an orderly and decent manner, only when we have taken counsel with time long enough to give us the least possible likelihood of after repentance.", "4252": "For it is a smaller evil, as Socrates said, to drink dirty water when excessively thirsty, than, when one's mind is disturbed and full of rage and fury, before it is settled and becomes pure, to glut our revenge on the person of a relation and kinsman.", "4253": "For it is not the punish­ ment that follows as closely as possible upon wrong-doing, as Thucydides said,1 but that which is more remote, that observes decorum.", "4254": "For as Melanthius says of anger, \" Fell things it does when it the mind unsettles,\" 2 so also reason acts with justice and moderation, when it banishes rage and passion.", "4255": "So also people are made milder by the example of other men, as when they hear that Plato, when he held his stick over his slave to correct him, waited some time, as he himself has told us, to compose his anger;", "4256": "and that Archytas, having learned of some wrong or dis­ orderly action on the part of some of his farm labourers, knowing that at the time be was in a very great rage and highly incensed at them, did nothing to them, but merely departed, saying, \" You may thank your stars that I am in a rnge with you.\"", "4257": "If then the remembrance of the words and recorded acts of men abates the fierceness and intensity of our rage, much more likely is it that we (observing that the deity, though without either fear or repentance in any case, yet puts off his punishments and defers them for some time) shall be reserved in our views about such matters, and shall think that mildness and long-suffering which the god exhibits a divine part of virtue, reforming a few by speedy punishment, but benefiting and correcting many by a tardy one.§", "4258": "VI.", "4259": "Let us consider in the second place that punish­ ments inflicted by men for offences regard only retaliation, and, when the offender is punished, stop and go no further;", "4260": "so that they seem to follow offences yelping at them like a dog, and closely pursuing at their heels as it were.", "4261": "But it is likely that the deity would look at the state of any guilty soul that he intended to punish, if haply it might turn and repent, and would give1 time for reformation to all whose vice was not absolute and incurable.", "4262": "For knowing bow great a share of virtue souls come into the world with, deriving it from him, and how strong and lasting is their nobility of nature, and how it breaks out into vice against its natural disposition through the corruption of bad habits and companions, and afterwards in some cases reforms itself, and recovers its proper position, he does not inflict punish­ ment on all persons alike;", "4263": "but the incorrigible he at once removes from life and cuts off, since it is altogether in­ jurious to others, but most of all to a man's own self, to live in perpetual vice, whereas to those who seem to have fallen into wrong-doing, rather from ignorance of what was good than from deliberate choice of what was bad, he gives time to repent.", "4264": "But if they persist in vice he punishes them too, for he has no fear that they will escape him.", "4265": "Consider also how many changes take place in the life and character of men, so that the Greeks give the names τρόπος and ἦθος to the character, the first word meaning change, and the latter the immense force and power of habit.", "4266": "I think also that the ancients called Cecrops half man and half dragon2 not because, as some say, he became from a good king wild and dragon-like, but contrariwise because he was originally perverse and terrible, and afterwards became a mild and humane king.", "4267": "And if this is uncertain, at any rate we know that Gelon and Hiero, both Sicilians, and Pisistratus the son of Hippocrates, though they got their supreme power by bad means, yet used it for virtuous ends, and though they mounted the throne in an irregular way, yet became good and useful princes.", "4268": "For by good legislation and by encouraging agriculture they made the citizens earnest and industrious instead of scoffers and chatterers.", "4269": "As for Gelon, after fighting valiantly and defeating the Carthaginians in a great battle, he would not conclude with them the peace they asked for until they inserted an article promising to cease sacrificing their

got a conviction against Cimon for incest with his sister, or had deprived Athens of Themistocles for his wantonness and revellings and outrages in the market, as in later days Athens lost Alci­ biades, by an indictment, should we not have had to go without the glory of Marathon, and Eurymedon, and beautiful Artemisium, \" where the Athenian youth laid the bright base of liberty ?\"2 For great natures produce nothing little, nor can their energy and activity rust owing to their keen intellect, but they toss to and fro as at sea till they come to a settled and durable character.", "4272": "As then one inexperienced in farming, seeing a spot full of thick bushes and rank growth, full of wild beasts and streams and mud, would not think much of it, while to one who has learnt how to discriminate and discern between different kind of soils all these are various tokens of the richness and goodness of the land, so great natures break out into many strange excesses, which exasperate us at first beyond bear­ ing, so that we think it right to cut off such offenders and stop their career at once, whereas a better judge, seeing the good and noble even in these, waits for

undiscovered.", "4304": "But at last going to sup with some strangers, he knocked down a nest of swallows, pricking it with his lance, and killed all the young swal­ lows.", "4305": "And when the company said, as it was likely they would, * Whatever makes you act in such a strange man­ ner?'", "4306": "'Have they not,' he replied, ' been long bearing false witness against me, crying out that I had killed my father ? '", "4307": "And the company, astonished at his answer, laid the matter before the king, and the affair was inquired into, and Bessus punished.\"§ ix. \" These cases,\" I continued, \" we cite supposing, as has been laid down, that there is a deferring of punish­ ment to the wicked;", "4308": "and, for the rest, I think we ought to listen to Hesiod, who tells us—not like Plato, who asserts that punishment is a condition that follows crime— that it is contemporaneous with it, and grows with it from the same source and root.", "4309": "For Hesiod says, \" Evil advice is worst to the adviser;", "4310": "\" 2 and, \" He who plots mischief 'gainst another brings", "4311": "It first on his own pate.\"", "4312": "3", "4313": "The cantharis is said to have in itself the antidote to its own sting, but wickedness, creating its own pain and torment, pays the penalty of its misdeeds not afterwards but at the time of its ill-doing.", "4314": "And as every malefactor about to pay the penalty of his crime in his person bears his cross, so vice fabricates for itself each of its own torments, being the terrible author of its own misery in life, wherein in addition to shame it has frequent fears and fierce passions and endless remorse and anxiety.", "4315": "But some are just like children, who, seeing malefactors in the theatres in golden tunics and purple robes with crowns on and dancing, admire them and marvel at them, thinking them happy, till they see them goaded and lashed and issuing fire from their gaudy but cheap garments.", "4316": "1", "4317": "For most wicked people, though they have great households and conspicuous offices and great power, are yet being secretly punished before they are seen to be murdered or hurled down rocks, which is rather the climax and end of their punishment than the punishment itself.", "4318": "For as Plato tells us that Herodicus the Selymbrian having fallen into consumption, an incurable disease, was the first of mankind to mix exercise with the art of healing, and so prolonged his own life and that of others suffering from the same disease, so those wicked persons who seem to avoid immediate punishment, receive a longer and not slower punishment, not later but extend­ ing over a wider period;", "4319": "for they are not punished in their old age, but rather grow old in perpetual punishment.", "4320": "I speak of course of long time as a human being, for to the gods all the period of man's life is as nothing, and so to them ' now and not thirty years ago' means no more than with us torturing or hanging a malefactor in the evening instead of the morning would mean ;", "4321": "especially as man is shut up in life as in a prison from which there is no egress or escape, and though doubtless during his life he has much feasting and business and gifts and favours and amusement, yet, just like people playing at dice or draughts in a prison, the rope is all the time hanging over his head.", "4322": "\"2§ x. \"", "4323": "And indeed what prevents our asserting that people in prison under sentence of death are not punished till their heads are cut off, or that the person who has taken hemlock, and walks about till he feels it is getting into his legs, suffers not at all till he is deprived of sensation by the freezing and curdling of his blood, if we consider the last moment of punishment all the punishment, and ignore all the inter­ mediate sufferings and fears and anxiety and remorse, the destiny of every guilty wretch ?", "4324": "That would be arguing that the fish that has swallowed the hook is not caught, till we see it boiled by the cook or sliced at table.", "4325": "For every wrong-doer is liable to punishment, and soon swallows the pleasantness of his wrong-doing like a bait, while his conscience still vexes and troubles him, \" As through the sea the impetuous tunny darts.\"", "4326": "For the recklessness and audacity of vice is strong and ram­ pant till the crime is committed, but afterwards, when the passion subsides like a storm, it becomes timid and dejected and a prey to fears and superstitions.", "4327": "So that Stesichorus in his account of Clytæmnestra's dream may have repre­ sented the facts and real state of the case, where he says, \" A dragon seemed to appear to her with its lofty head smeared all over with blood, and out of it seemed to come king Orestes the grandson of Plisthenes.\"", "4328": "For visions in dreams, and apparitions during the day, and oracles, and lightning, and whatever is thought to come from the deity, bring tempests of apprehension to the guilty.", "4329": "So they say that one time Apollodorus in a dream saw himself flayed by the Scythians, and then boiled, and that his heart out of the caldron spoke to him in a low voice and said, \"I am the cause of this;", "4330": "\" and at another time he dreamed that he saw his daughters running round him in a circle all on fire and in flames.", "4331": "And Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, a little before his death, dreamt that Aphro­ dite threw some blood on his face out of a certain phial.", "4332": "And the friends of Ptolemy Ceraunus dreamed that be was summoned for trial by Seleucus, and that the judges were vultures and wolves, who tore his flesh and distributed it wholesale among his enemies.", "4333": "And Pausanias at Byzan­ tium, having sent for Cleonice a free-born maiden, intend­ ing to outrage her and pass the night with her, being seized with some alarm or suspicion killed her, and fre­ quently saw her in his dreams saying to him, \" Come near for judgement, lust is most assuredly a grievous bane to men,\" and as this apparition did not cease, he sailed, it seems, to Heraclea to the place where the souls of the dead could be summoned, and by propitiations and sacrifices called up the soul of the maiden, and she appeared to him and told him that this trouble would end when he got to Lacedæmon, and directly he got there he died.\"1§ xi. \"", "4334": "And so, if nothing happens to the soul after death, but that event is the end of all enjoyment or punishment, one would be rather inclined to say that the deity was lax and indulgent in quickly punishing the wicked and depriving them of life.", "4335": "For even if we were to say that the wicked had no other trouble in a long life, yet, when their wrong-doing was proved to bring them no profit or enjoyment, no good or adequate return for their many and great anxieties, the consciousness of that would be quite enough to throw 2 their mind off its balance.", "4336": "So they record of Lysimachus tint he was so overcome by thirst that he surrendered himself and his forces to the Getæ for some drink, but after he had drunk and bethought him that he was now a captive, he said, \" Alas !", "4337": "How guilty am I for so brief a gratification to lose so great a kingdom !\"", "4338": "And yet it is very difficult to resist a necessity of nature.", "4339": "But when a man, either for the love of money, or for political place or power, or carried away by some amorous propen­ sity, does some lawless and dreadful deed, and, after his eager desire is satisfied, sees in process of time that only the base and terrible elements of his crime remain, while nothing useful, or necessary, or advantageous has flowed from it, is it not likely that the idea would often present itself to him that, moved by vain-glory, or for some illiberal and unlovely pleasure, he bad violated the greatest and noblest rights of mankind, and had filled his life with shame and trouble ?", "4340": "For as Simonides used to say play­ fully that he always found his money-chest full but his gratitude-chest empty,3 so the wicked contemplating their own vice soon find out that their gratification is joyless and hopeless,4 and ever attended by fears and griefs and gloomy memories, and suspicions about the future, and dis­ trust about the present.", "4341": "Thus we hear Ino, repenting for what she had done, saying on the stage, \" Dear women, would that I could now inhabit", "4342": "For the first time the house of Athamas, Guiltless of any of my awful deeds!", "4343": "\"I", "4344": "It is likely that the soul of every wicked person will medi­ tate in this way, and consider how it can escape the memory of its ill-deeds, and lay its conscience to sleep, and become pure, and live another life over again from the beginning.", "4345": "For there is no confidence, or reality, or continuance, or security, in what wickedness proposes to itself, unless by Zeus we shall say that evil-doers are wise, but wherever the greedy love of wealth or pleasure or violent envy dwells with hatred and malignity, there will you also see and find stationed superstition, and remissness for labour, and cowardice in respect to death, and sudden caprice in the passions, and vain-glory and boasting.", "4346": "Those that censure them frighten them, and they even fear those that praise them as wronged by their deceit, and as most hostile to the bad because they readily praise those they think good.", "4347": "For as in the case of ill-tempered steel the hardness of vice is rotten, and its strength easily shattered.", "4348": "So that in course of time, understanding their real selves, they are vexed and disgusted with their past life and abhor it.", "4349": "For if a bad man who restores property entrusted to his care, or becomes surety for a friend, or contributes very gene­ rously and liberally to his country out of love of glory or honour, at once repents and is sorry for what he has done from the fickleness and changeableness of his mind;", "4350": "and if men applauded in the theatres directly afterwards groan, their love of glory subsiding into love of money;", "4351": "shall we suppose that those who sacrificed men to tyrannies and con­ spiracies as Apollodorus did, or that those who robbed their friends of money as Glaucus the son of Epicydes did,2 never repented, or loathed themselves, or regretted their past misdeeds ?", "4352": "For my part, if it is lawful to say so, I do not think evil-doers need any god or man to punish them, for the marring and troubling of all their life by vice is in itself adequate punishment.", "4353": "\"§ XII. \" But consider now whether I have not

combatant in reserve, since the other two questions have been debated sufficiently.", "4356": "For as to the charge and bold accusation that Euripides brings against the gods, for visiting the sins of the parents upon the children, consider that even those of us who are silent agree with Euripides.", "4357": "For if the guilty were punished themselves there would be no further need to punish the innocent, for it is not fair to punish even the guilty twice for the same offence, whereas if the gods through easiness remit the punishment of the wicked, and exact it later on from the innocent, they do not well to compensate for their tardiness by injustice.", "4358": "Such con­ duct resembles the story told of Æsop’s coming to this very spot,1 with money from Crœsus, to offer a splendid sacrifice to the god, and to give four minæ to each of the Delphians.", "4359": "And some quarrel or difference belike ensuing between him and the Delphians here, he offered the sacri­ fice, but sent the money back to Sardis, as though the Delphians were not worthy to receive that benefit, so they fabricated against him a charge of sacrilege, and put him to death by throwing him headlong down yonder rock called Hyampia.", "4360": "And in consequence the god is said to have been wroth with them, and to have brought dearth on their land, and all kinds of strange diseases, so that they went

the gods admits of a just defence.", "4398": "For a city is one continuous entity, a sort of creature that never changes from age, or be­ comes different by time, but is ever sympathetic with and conformable to itself, and is answerable for whatever it does or has done for the public weal, as long as the community by its union and federal bonds preserves its unity.", "4399": "For he that would

reckoned to be the same person from birth to death, and similarly we think it right for a city always remaining the same to be liable to reproach for the ill deeds of its former inhabitants, on the same principle as it enjoys its ancient glory and power ;", "4405": "or shall we, without being aware of it, throw everything into Heraclitus' river, into which he says a person cannot step twice,2

it appropriately receives his share, whether that be honour or punishment.", "4408": "And if I should not seem to be trifling, I should say that the bronze statue of Cassander melted down by the Athenians, and the body of Dionysius thrown out of their territory by the Syra­ cusans after his death, were treated more unjustly than punishing their posterity would have been.", "4409": "For there

through the body, come certain dispositions, and vices or improvement of character.", "4414": "For just as it is likely in the case of the body that the same feelings and changes will take place, so

and take away the tripod of the Pythian Priestess, and abolish and destroy the oracle.", "4424": "For as long as many such oracles are still given, as was said to be given to Corax of Naxos formerly,

act, he was ordered to go to the dwelling of Tettix, and appease the soul of Archilochus.", "4430": "Now this place was Tænarum, for there they say Tettix the Cretan had gone with a fleet and founded a city, and dwelt near the place where departed souls were conjured up.", "4431": "Similarly also, when the Spartans were bidden by the oracle to appease the soul of Pausanias, the necromancers were summoned from Italy, and, after they had offered sacrifice, they got the ghost out of the temple.\"§ XVIII.", "4432": "\"It is one and the same argument,\" I continued, “ that confirms the providence

rewards or punishments will be assigned to it.", "4434": "For during life the soul struggles, like an athlete, and when the struggle is over, then it gets its deserts.", "4435": "But what rewards or punishments the soul gets when by itself in the unseen world for the deeds done in the body has nothing to do with us that are alive, and is perhaps not credited by us, and certainly unknown to us;", "4436": "whereas those punishments that come on descen­ dants and on the race are evident to all that are alive, and deter and keep back many from wickedness.", "4437": "For there is no more disgraceful or bitter punishment than to see our chil­ dren in misfortune through our faults, and if the soul of an impious or lawless man could see after death, not his statues or honours taken from him, but his children or friends or race in great adversity owing to him, and pay­ ing the penalty for his misdeeds, no one would ever persuade him, could he come to life again, to be unjust and

though not vice or virtue only, but sorrow or joy and all other propensities, came from generation, to which the poet bids us come gay and agreeable and sprightly.", "4455": "But it is not Hesiod's function, or the work of human wisdom, but it belongs to the deity, to discern and accurately distinguish similarities and differences of character, before they become obvious by resulting in crime through the influence of the passions.", "4456": "For the young of bears and wolves and apes manifest from their birth the nature innate in them in all its naked simplicity;", "4457": "whereas man­ kind, under the influence of customs and opinions and laws, frequently conceal their bad qualities and imitate what is good, so as altogether to obliterate and escape from the innate taint of vice, or to be undetected for a long time, throwing the veil of craft round their real nature, so that we are scarce conscious of their villainy till we feel the blow or smart of some unjust action, so that we are in fact only aware that there is such a thing as injustice when men act unjustly, or as vice when men act viciously, or as cowardice when men run away, just as if one were to sup­ pose that scorpions had a sting only when they stung us, or that vipers were venomous only when they bit us, which would be a very silly idea.", "4458": "For every bad man is not bad only when he breaks out into crime, but he has the seeds of vice in his nature, and is only vicious in act when he has opportunity and means, as opportunity makes the thief steal,2 and the tyrant violate the laws.", "4459": "But the deity is not ignorant of the nature and disposition of every man, inasmuch as by his very nature he can read the soul better than the body, and does not wait to punish violence in the act, or shamelessness in the tongue, or lasciviousness in the members.", "4460": "For he does not retaliate upon the wrong-doer as having been ill-treated by him, nor is he angry with the robber as having been plundered by him, nor does he hate the adulterer as having himself suffered from his licentious­ ness, but it is to cure him that be often punishes the adul­ terous or avaricious or unjust man in embryo, before he has had time to work out all his villainy, as we try to stop epileptic fits before they come on.§ xxi.", "4461": "Just now we were dissatisfied that the wicked were punished late and tardily, whereas at present we find fault with the deity for correcting the character and disposition of some before they commit crime, from our ignoring that the future deed may be worse and more dreadful than the past, and the hidden intention than the overt act;", "4462": "for we are not able fully to understand the reasons why it is better to leave some alone in their ill deeds, and to arrest others in the intention ;", "4463": "just as no doubt medicine is not appropriate in the case of some patients, which would be beneficial to others not ill, but yet perhaps in a more dangerous condition still.", "4464": "And so the gods do not visit all the offences of parents on their children, but if a good man is the son of a bad one, as the son of a sickly parent is sometimes of a good constitution, he is exempt from the punishment of his race, as not being a partici­ pator in its viciousness.", "4465": "But if a young man imitates his vicious race it is only right that he should inherit the punishment of their ill deeds, as he would their debts.", "4466": "For Antigonus was not punished for Demetrius, nor, of the old heroes,1 Phyleus for Augeas, or Nestor for Neleus, for though their sires were bad they were good, but those whose nature liked and approved the vices of their ances­ tors, these justice punished, taking vengeance on their simi­ larity in viciousness.", "4467": "For as the warts and moles and freckles of parents often skip a generation, and reappear in the grandsons and granddaughters, and as a Greek woman, that had a black baby and so was accused of adultery, found out that she was the great granddaughter of an Ethiopian,1 and as the son of Pytho the Nisibian who recently died, and who was said to trace his descent to the Sparti, had the birthmark on his body of the print of a spear the token of his race, which though long dormant had come up again as out of the deep, so frequently earlier generations conceal and suppress the mental idiosyncrasies and passions of their race, which afterwards nature causes to break out in other members of the family, and so dis­ plays the family bent either to vice or virtue.\"§ XXII.", "4468": "When I had said thus much I was silent, but Olympicus smiled and said, \" We do not praise you, lest we should seem to forget your promised story, as though what you had advanced was adequate proof enough, but we will give our opinion when we have heard it.\"", "4469": "Then I began as follows.", "4470": "\"", "4471": "Thespesius of Soli, an intimate friend of that Protogenes3 who lived in this city with us for some time, had been very profligate during the early part of his life, and had quickly run through his property, and for some time owing to his straits had given himself up to bad practices, when repenting of his old ways, and following the pursuit of riches, he resembled those profligate husbands that pay no attention to their wives while they live with them, but get rid of them, and then, after they have married other men, do all they can wickedly to seduce them.", "4472": "Ab­ staining then from nothing dishonourable that could bring either enjoyment or gain, in no long time he got together no great amount of property, but a very great reputation for villainy.", "4473": "But what most damaged his character was the answer he received from the oracle of Amphilochus.", "4474": "4", "4475": "For he sent it seems a messenger to consult the god whether he would live the rest of his life better, and the answer was be would do better after his death.", "4476": "And indeed this hap­ pened in a sense not long after.", "4477": "For he fell headlong down from a great height, and though he bad received no wound nor even a blow, the fall did for him, but three days after (just, as he was about to be buried) he recovered.", "4478": "He.", "4479": "soon picked up his strength again, and went home, and so changed his manner of life that people would hardly credit it.", "4480": "For the Cilicians say that they know nobody who was in those days more fairdealing in business, or more devout to the deity, or more disagreeable to his enemies, or more faithful to his friends;", "4481": "insomuch that all who had any dealings with him desired to hear the reason of this change, not thinking that so great a reformation of character could have proceeded from chance, and their idea was correct, as his narrative to Protogenes and others of his great friends showed.", "4482": "For he told them that, when his soul left the body, the change he first underwent was as if he were a pilot thrown violently into the sea out of a ship.", "4483": "Then raising himself up a little, he thought he recovered the power of breathing again altogether, and looked round him in every direction, as if one eye of the soul was open.", "4484": "But he saw none of the things he had ever seen before, but stars enormous in size and at immense distance from one another, sending forth a wonderful and intense brightness of colour, so that the soul was borne along and moved about every­ where quickly and easily, like a ship in fair weather.", "4485": "But omitting most of the sights he saw, he said that the souls of the dead mounted into the air, which yielded to them and formed fiery bubbles, and then, when each bubble quietly broke, they assumed human forms, light in weight but with different kinds of motion, for some leapt about with wonder­ ful ability and darted straight upwards, while others like spindles flitted round all together in a circle, some in an upward direction, some in a downward, with mixed and confused motion, hardly stopping at all, or only after a very long time.", "4486": "As to most of these he was ignorant who they were, but he saw two or three that he knew, and tried to approach them and talk with them, but they would not listen to him, and did not seem to be in their right minds, but out of their senses and distraught, avoiding every sight and touch, and at first turned round and round alone, but afterwards meeting many other souls whirling round ard in the same condition as themselves, they moved about pro­ miscuously with no particular object in view, and uttered inarticulate sounds, like yells, mixed with wailing and terror.", "4487": "Other souls in the upper part of the air seemed joyful, and frequently approached one another in a friendly way, and avoided those troubled souls, and seemed to mark their displeasure by keeping themselves to themselves, and their joy and delight by extension and expansion.", "4488": "At last he said he saw the soul of a relation, that he thought he knew but was not quite sure, as he died when he was a boy, which came up to him and said to him, \" Welcome, Thespesius.\"", "4489": "And he wondering, and saying that his name was not Thespesius but Aridæus, the soul replied, \" That was your old name, but henceforth it will be Thespesius.", "4490": "For assuredly you are not dead, but by the will of the gods are come here with your intellect, for the rest of your soul you have left in the body like an anchor ;", "4491": "and as a proof of what I say both now and hereafter notice that the souls of the dead have no shadow and do not move their eyelids.\"", "4492": "Thespesius, on hearing these words, pulled himself some­ what more together again, and began to use his reason, and looking more closely he noticed that an indistinct and shadow-like line was suspended over him, while the others shone all round and were transparent, but were not all alike;", "4493": "for some were like the full-moon at its brightest, throwing out one smooth even and continuous colour, others had spots or light marks here and there, while others were quite variegated and strange to the sight, with black spots like snakes, while others again had dim scratches.", "4494": "Then the kinsman of Thespesius (for there is nothing to prevent our calling the souls by the name of the persons), pointed out everything, and told him that Adrastea, the daughter of Necessity and Zeus, was placed in the highest position to punish all crimes, and no criminal was either so great or so small as to be able to escape her either by fraud or violence.", "4495": "But, as there were three kinds of punishment, each had its own officer and administering functionary. \"", "4496": "For speedy Vengeance undertakes the punish­ ment of those that are to be corrected at once in the body and through their bodies, and she mildly passes by many offences that only need expiation;", "4497": "but if the cure of vice demands further pains, then the deity hands over such criminals after death to Justice, and those whom Justice rejects as altogether incurable, Erinnys (the third and fiercest of Adrastea's officers), pursues as they are fleeing and wandering about in various directions, and with pitiless severity utterly undoes them all, and thrusts them down to a place not to be seen or spoken about.", "4498": "And, of all these punishments, that which is administered in this life by Vengeance is most like those in use among the barbarians.", "4499": "For as among the Persians they pluck off and scourge the garments and tiaras of those that are to be punished, while the offenders weep and beg them to cease, so most punish­ ments by fine or bodily chastisement have no sharp touch, nor do they reach vice itself, but are only for show and sentiment.", "4500": "And whoever goes from this world to that incorrigible and impure, Justice takes him aside, naked as he is in soul, and unable to veil or hide or conceal his villainy, but descried all round and in all points by every­ body, and shows him first to his good parents, if such they were, to let them see what a wretch he is and how unworthy of his ancestors ;", "4501": "but if they were wicked too, seeing them punished and himself being seen by them, he is chastised for a long time till he is purged of each of his bad propen­ sities by sufferings and pains, which as much exceed in magnitude and intensity all sufferings in the flesh, as what is real is more vivid than a dream.", "4502": "But the scars and marks of the stripes for each bad propensity are more visible in some than in others.", "4503": "Observe also, he continued, the dif­ ferent and various colours of the souls.", "4504": "That dark dirty­ brown colour is the pigment of illiberality and covetous­ ness, and the blood-red the sign of cruelty and savageness, and where the blue is there sensuality and love of pleasure are not easily eradicated, and that violet and livid colour marks malice and envy, like the dark liquid ejected by the cuttle fish.", "4505": "For as during life vice produces these colours by the soul being acted upon by passions and reacting upon the body, so here it is the end of purification and correc­ tion when they are toned down, and the soul becomes alto­ gether bright and one colour.", "4506": "But as long as these colours remain, there are relapses of the passions accompanied by palpitation and throbbing of the heart, in some faint and soon suppressed, in others more violent and lasting.", "4507": "And some of these souls by being again and again corrected recover their proper disposition and condition, while others again by their violent ignorance and excessive love of plea­ sure 1 are carried into the bodies of animals;", "4508": "for one by weakness of reasoning power, and slowness of contempla­ tion, is impelled by the practical element in him to gene­ ration, while another, lacking an instrument to satisfy his licentiousness, desires to gratify his passions immediately, and to get that gratification through the medium of the body;", "4509": "for here there is no real fruition, but only an imper­ fect shadow and dream of incomplete pleasure.", "4510": "\"After he had said this, Thespesius' kinsman hurried him at great speed through immense space, as it seemed to him, though be travelled as easily and straight as if he were carried on the wings of the sun's rays.", "4511": "At last he got to an extensive and bottomless abyss, where his strength left him, as he found was the case with the other souls there:", "4512": "for keeping together and making swoops, like birds, they flitted all round the abyss, but did not venture to pass over it.", "4513": "To internal view it resembled the caverns of Bacchus, being beautiful throughout2 with trees and green foliage and flowers of all kinds, and it breathed a soft and gentle air, laden with scents marvellously pleasant, and producing the effect that wine does on those who are topers ;", "4514": "for the souls were elevated by its fragrance, and gay and blithe with one another:", "4515": "and the whole spot was full of mirth and laughter, and such songs as emanate from gaiety and enjoyment.", "4516": "And Thespesius' kinsman told him that this was the way Dionysus went up to heaven by, and by which he afterwards took up Semele, and it was called the place of Oblivion.", "4517": "But he would not let Thespesius stay there, much as he wished, but forcibly dragged him away, instructing and telling him that the intellect was melted and moistened by pleasure, and that the irrational and corporeal element being watered and made flesh stirs up the memory of the body, from which comes a yearning and strong de­ sire for generation, so called from being an inclination to the earthy when the soul is weighed down with moisture.", "4518": "Next Thespesius travelled as far in another direction, and seemed to see a great crater into which several rivers emptied themselves, one whiter than the foam of the sea or snow, another like the purple of the rainbow, and others of various hues whose brightness was apparent at some distance, but when he got nearer the air became thinner and the colours grew dim, and the crater lost all its gay colours but white.", "4519": "And he saw three genii sitting together in a triangular position, mixing the rivers together in certain proportions.", "4520": "Then the guide of Thespesius' soul told him, that Orpheus got as far as here, when he came in quest of the soul of his wife,1 and from not exactly remembering what he had seen spread a false report among mankind, that the oracle at Delphi was common to A polio and Night, though Apollo had no communion with Night:", "4521": "but this, pursued the guide, is an oracle common to Night and the Moon, that utters forth its oracular knowledge in no particular part of the world, nor has it any particular seat, but wanders about everywhere in men's dreams and visions.", "4522": "Hence, as you see, dreams receive and disseminate a mixture2 of simple truth with deceit and error.", "4523": "But the oracle of Apollo you do not know, nor can you see it, for the earthiness of the soul does not suffer it to soar upwards, but keeps it down in depen­ dence on the body.", "4524": "And taking him nea rer his guide tried to show him the light from the tripod, which, as he said, shone as far as Parnassus through the bosom of Themis, but though he desired to see it he could not for its brightness, but as he passed by he heard the shrill voice of a woman speaking in verse several things, among others, bethought, telling the time of his death.", "4525": "That, said the genius, was the voice of the Sibyl, who sang about the future as she was being borne about in the Orb of the moon.", "4526": "Though desirous then to hear more, he was conveyed into another direction by the violent motion of the moon, as if he had been in the eddies of a whirlpool, so that he heard very little more, only a prophecy about Mt. Vesuvius and that Dicæirchia3 would be destroyed by fire, and a short piece about the Emperor then reigning that though he was good he would lose his empire through sickness.", "4527": "\"After this Thespesius and his guide turned to see those that were undergoing punishment.", "4528": "And at first they saw only distressing and pitiable sights, but after that, Thespe­ sius, little expecting it, found himself among his friends and acquaintances and kinsfolk who were being punished, and undergoing dreadful sufferings and hideous and bitter tortures, and who wept and wailed to him.", "4529": "And at last he descried his father coming up out of a certain gulf covered with marks and scars, stretching out his hands, and not allowed to keep silence, but compelled by those that presided over his torture to confess that he had been an accursed wretch and poisoned some strangers that had gold, and during his lifetime had escaped the detection of everybody;", "4530": "but had been found out here, and his guilt brought home to him, for which he had already suffered much, and was being dragged on to suffer more.", "4531": "So great was his consternation and fear that he did not dare to intercede or beg for his father's release, but wishing to turn and flee he could no longer see his gentle and kind guide, but he was thrust forward by some persons horrible to look at, as if some dire necessity compelled him to go through with the business, and saw that the shades of those that had been notorious criminals and punished in their life-time were not so severely tortured here or like the others, but had an incomplete2 though toilsome punish­ ment for their irrational passions.", "4532": "3", "4533": "Whereas those who under the mask and show of virtue had lived all their lives in undetected vice were forced by their torturers with labour and pain to turn their souls inside out, unnaturally wriggling and writhing about, like the sea-scolopendras who, when they have swallowed the hook, turn themselves inside out;", "4534": "but some of them their torturers flayed and crimped so as to show their various inward vices which were only skinned over, which were deep in their soul the principal part of man.", "4535": "And he said he saw other souls, like snakes two or three or even more twined together, devouring one another in malignity and malevolence for what they had suffered or done in life.", "4536": "He said also that there were several lakes running parallel, one of boiling gold, another most cold of lead, another hard of iron, and several demons were standing by, like smiths, who lowered down and drew up by turns with instruments the souls of those whose criminality lay in insatiable cupidity.", "4537": "For when they were red-hot and transparent through their bath in the lake of gold, the demons thrust them into the lake of lead and dipped them in that;", "4538": "and when they got congealed in it and hard as hail, they dipped them into the lake of iron, and there they became wonderfully black, and broken and crushed by the hardness of the iron, and changed their appearance, and after that they were dipped again in the lake of gold, after suffering, he said, dreadful agony in all these changes of torment.", "4539": "But he said those souls suffered most piteously of all that, when they seemed to have escaped justice, were arrested again, and these were those whose crimes had been visited on their children or descendants.", "4540": "For whenever one of these latter happened to come up, he fell into a rage and cried out, and showed the marks of what he had suffered, and upbraided and pur­ sued the soul of the parent, that wished to fly and hide himself but could not.", "4541": "For quickly did the ministers of torture pursue them, and hurry them back again to Jus.", "4542": "tice,1 wailing all the while on account of their fore-know­ ledge of what their punishment would be.", "4543": "And to some of them he said many of their posterity clung at once, and just like bees or bats stuck to them, and squeaked and gib­ bered 2 in their rage at the memory of what they had suf­ fered owing to them.", "4544": "Last of all he saw the souls of those that were to come into the world a second time, forcibly moulded and transformed into various kinds of animals by artificers appointed for the very purpose with instruments and blows, who broke off all the limbs of some, and only wrenched off some of others, and polished others down or annihilated them altogether, to fit them for other habits and modes of life.", "4545": "Among them he saw the soul of Nero tortured in other ways, and pierced with red-hot nails.", "4546": "And the artificers having taken it in hand and converted it into the semblance of a Pindaric viper, which gets its way to life by gnawing through its mothers womb, a great light, he said, suddenly shone, and a voice came out of the light, ordering them to change it into something milder, so they devised of it the animal that croaks about lakes and marshes, for he had been punished sufficiently for his crimes, and now deserved some favour at the hands of the gods, for he had freed Greece, the noblest nation of his sub­ jects and the best-beloved of the gods.", "4547": "1", "4548": "So much did Thespesius behold, but as he intended to return a horrible dread came upon him.", "4549": "For a woman, marvellous in appearance and size, took hold of him and said to him, \" Come here that you may the better remember everything you have seen.\"", "4550": "And she was about to strike him with a red-hot iron pin, such as the encaustic painters use,2 when another woman prevented her ;", "4551": "and be was suddenly sucked up, as through3 a pipe, by a strong and violent wind, and lit upon his own body, and woke up and found that he was close to his tomb.", "4552": "§ i. Plato in his Laws' does not permit neighbours to use one another's water, unless they have first dug for themselves as far as the clay, and reached ground that is unsuitable for a well.", "4553": "For clay, having a rich and com­ pact nature, absorbs the water it receives, and does not let it pass through.", "4554": "But he allows people that cannot make a well of their own to use their neighbour's water, for the law ought to relieve necessity.", "4555": "Ought there not also to be a law about money, that people should not borrow of others, nor go to other people's sources of income, until they have first examined their own resources at home, and col­ lected, as by drops, what is necessary for their use ?", "4556": "But nowadays from luxury and effeminacy and lavish expendi­ ture people do not use their own resources, though they have them, but borrow from others at great interest with­ out necessity.", "4557": "And what proves this very clearly is the fact that people do not lend money to the needy, but only to those who, wanting an immediate supply, bring a wit­ ness and adequate security for their credit, so that they can be in no actual necessity of borrowing.", "4558": "1§ II.",

goods out at pawn cannot be saved even by Zeus the Protector of Property :", "4565": "they are ashamed to sell, they are not ashamed to pay interest on their goods when out at pawn.", "4566": "And yet the famous Peri­ cles made the ornament of Athene, which weighed forty talents of fine gold, removable at will, for “so,” he said, \"we can use the gold in war, and at some other time restore as

gets joined to the body like an oyster to its shell, as Plato says, because it cannot call to mind or remember from what honour and greatness of happiness it migrated, not from Sardis to Athens, nor

connue des femmes troyennes en Italie, et dont on place la scène en divers lieux?", "51": "Leurs maris avaient débarqué pour reconnaître le pays où ils venaient d’aborder.", "52": "Pendant ce temps-là elles mirent le feu aux vaisseaux, afin de terminer leur longue navigation.", "53": "Craignant ensuite la vengeance de leurs maris, elles se jetèrent au cou de leurs parents et de leurs proches, et les embrassèrent en leur demandant grace.", "54": "Ces témoignages de tendresse apaisèrent les Troyens, et depuis elles conservèrent cette manière de saluer leurs proches.", "55": "Ou plutôt est-ce un privilège accordé aux dames romaines, pour qui c’est une marque d’honneur et de puissance que d’avoir un grand nombre de parents honnêtes qu’elles puissent embrasser de cette manière?", "56": "Serait-ce enfin que les lois, en défendant le mariage entre parents, leur ont permis du moins ce témoignage de leur amitié réciproque?", "57": "Autrefois les Romains ne pouvaient épouser aucune de leurs parentes :", "58": "cette défense subsiste encore pour les tantes et les sœurs;", "59": "et ce n’est que bien tard qu’on leur a permis de se marier avec leurs cousines.", "60": "Voici quelle en fut l’occasion.Un homme pauvre, mais honnête, et qui jouissait de la plus grande considération auprès du peuple, épousa sa cousine, qui lui apportait une fortune considérable.", "61": "Il fut cité en justice;", "62": "mais le peuple ne voulut pas qu’on instruisît le procès;", "63": "et non content de l’avoir absous, il permit généralement le mariage avec les cousines, en conservant toujours la défense pour les degrés supérieurs.7.", "64": "Pourquoi les dons mutuels sont-ils défendus entre mari et femme?", "65": "Est-ce à l’exemple de Solon, qui, en permettant les donations faites par les mourants, excepta celles qui auraient été extorquées par violence ou obtenues par l’insinuation d’une épouse, parceque la contrainte ôtait la liberté, et que la séduction troublait le jugement?", "66": "De même les Romains ont-ils tenu pour suspectes les donations mutuelles entre mari et femme?", "67": "Est-ce qu’ils regardaient comme un signe très équivoque de bienveillance une libéralité que font souvent des étrangers et des personnes indifférentes, et qu’ils ont proscrit dans le mariage ces preuves mercenaires d’amitié, afin que les époux s’aimassent pour eux-mêmes, sans aucun motif d’intérêt?", "68": "Serait-ce que les femmes, étant sujettes à se laisser corrompre par l’attrait des présents, ils ont cru relever leur mérite en faisant voir qu’elles aiment leurs maris, quoiqu’elles n’en reçoivent rien?", "69": "Ou plutôt n’ont-ils pas voulu signifier par là que tout doit être commun entre mari et femme?", "70": "En effet, lorsqu’on reçoit quelque chose, il semble qu’on regarde le reste comme étranger pour soi.", "71": "Ainsi deux époux qui se font quelque don mutuel, paraissent s’ôter l’un à l’autre tout le reste.8.", "72": "Pourquoi ces donations sont-elles aussi défendues entre le beau-père et le gendre?", "73": "Est-ce, par rapport au gendre, parceque le don peut retourner à la femme par son père?", "74": "et, pour le beau-père, parcequ’il ne paraît pas juste qu’il donne à celui de qui il ne reçoit rien?9.", "75": "Pourquoi les maris, au retour d’un voyage ou de la campagne, font-ils prévenir leurs femmes de leur arrivée?", "76": "Est-ce par un effet de leur confiance en elles?", "77": "Car une arrivée subite et inattendue a l’air d’un espionnage, et annonce le désir de surprendre.", "78": "C’est pour cela qu’ils s’empressent de donner à leurs femmes la nouvelle d’un retour qu’elles attendent, et qui doit leur faire plaisir.", "79": "Est-ce pour savoir s’ils les trouveront bien portantes, et empressées de les revoir?", "80": "Serait-ce enfin que les femmes, en l’absence de leurs maris, ont plus de peines et de sollicitudes domestiques, et qu’ils les font prévenir de leur retour afin qu’elles quittent tout autre soin pour ne s’occuper que de les bien recevoir?10.", "81": "Pourquoi adorent-ils les dieux la tête couverte;", "82": "et qu’au contraire, quand ils rencontrent des personnes respectables, ils se découvrent par honneur?", "83": "Car c’est là ce qui rend, ce semble, la question difficile à résoudre.On raconte qu’Énée, pendant qu’il sacrifiait aux dieux, vit passer Diomède, et qu’aussitôt il se couvrit la tête, et acheva dans cet état le sacrifice1.", "84": "Si ce récit est véritable, il paraît assez naturel que, comme on se couvre devant un ennemi, au contraire on se montre à découvert à une personne amie et respectable par sa vertu.", "85": "Car l’usage de sacrifier, la tête couverte, est purement accidentel, et doit son origine au fait qu’on vient de rapporter.", "86": "Si l’on en veut une autre raison, il faudra seulement rechercher pourquoi ils adorent les dieux la tête couverte, puisque l’autre usage n’est qu’une suite du premier.", "87": "En effet, s’ils se découvrent devant des personnes puissantes, c’est moins pour leur faire honneur que pour ne pas les exposer à l’envie, en montrant qu’elles n’affectent pas les mêmes honneurs que les dieux, et quelles craindraient même de les recevoir.", "88": "Mais ils se couvrent en adorant les dieux, soit par un abaissement respectueux devant leur majesté, soit plutôt que, craignant d’entendre du dehors quelque parole de mauvais augure, ils se couvrent les oreilles avec leurs robes.", "89": "Rien ne prouve tant cette crainte que l’usage où ils sont de frapper avec grand bruit sur de l’airain lorsqu’ils s’approchent d’un oracle pour le consulter.", "90": "Serait-ce enfin, comme le prétend Castor2, dans l’ouvrage où il compare les institutions romaines avec celles de Pythagore, que le génie qui est en nous a besoin des dieux extérieurs dont il implore le secours?", "91": "Et par cet usage il nous fait entendre, d’une manière allégorique, que notre ame est cachée, et comme couverte par le corps.11.", "92": "Pourquoi, en sacrifiant à Saturne, ont-ils la tête découverte?", "93": "Est-ce parceque l’usage contraire pour les autres dieux ne remonte qu’à Énée, et que le culte de Saturne est beaucoup plus ancien?", "94": "Est-ce qu’ils ne se couvrent la tête que pour les dieux du ciel, et qu’ils mettent Saturne au nombre des dieux de la terre et des enfers?", "95": "Est-ce enfin que rien n’est caché, ni voilé pour la vérité, dont, chez les Romains, Saturne est le père?12.", "96": "Pourquoi regardent-ils Saturne comme le père de la vérité?", "97": "Est-ce, comme le pensent quelques philosophes, parceque chez eux Saturne est le même que le temps, et que le temps découvre la vérité?", "98": "Ou bien parceque le siècle de Saturne, qui fut, selon la fable, le plus juste de tous les âges, dut vraisemblablement être aussi celui où l’on connut le plus la vérité?13.", "99": "Pourquoi sacrifient-ils à l’Honneur, la tête découverte?", "100": "Est-ce parceque l’honneur est une qualité brillante, qui éclate aux yeux de tout le monde?", "101": "Et comme ils témoignent leur respect aux gens d’honneur en se découvrant devant eux, ils honorent par un culte semblable la divinité qui porte le même nom.14.", "102": "Pourquoi les fils assistent-ils aux funérailles de leurs pères, la tête voilée, et que les filles y vont la tête découverte et les cheveux épars?", "103": "Estr-ce parceque les fils doivent honorer leurs pères comme des dieux, et les filles les regretter comme morts, et qu’ainsi la loi, en assignant à chaque sexe la fonction qui lui convient, a voulu remplir tous les devoirs à l’égard des morts?", "104": "Est-ce que, dans le deuil, on doit changer les pratiques ordinaires?", "105": "Or, il est d’usage, dans tout autre cas, que les femmes paraissent en public la tête voilée, et les hommes découverts.", "106": "En Grèce même, dans les événements malheureux, les femmes se font couper les cheveux, et les hommes les laissent croître;", "107": "tandis que les uns et les autres suivent dans les autres temps un usage contraire.", "108": "Mais ne vaut-il pas mieux s’en tenir, par rapport aux fils, à la première raison que nous en avons donnée?", "109": "Varron nous apprend qu’ils tournent autour des tombeaux de leurs pères, et qu’ils les honorent comme des temples1.", "110": "Lorsque après avoir brûlé le corps, ils découvrent les ossements parmi les cendres, ils disent que le mort est passé au rang des dieux2.", "111": "Pour les femmes, il ne leur était permis en aucune occasion d’avoir la tête couverte.", "112": "On dit que Sp. Carbilius fut le premier qui répudia sa femme pour cause de stérilité.", "113": "Sulpitius-Gallus fut le second, parcequ’il avait vu la sienne se couvrir la tête de sa robe;", "114": "et P. Sempronius le troisième, parceque la sienne avait assisté à des jeux funèbres3.15.", "115": "Pourquoi n’immolent-ils aucun animal au dieu Terme, en l’honneur duquel ils célèbrent les fêtes Terminales?", "116": "Est-ce que Romulus n’avait mis aucune limite au territoire romain, afin que ses sujets pussent l’étendre aux dépens de leurs voisins, et regarder comme à eux tout celui où leur lance pourrait atteindre, comme disait un Lacédémonien4?", "117": "Mais Numa Pompilius, prince juste, humain et philosophe, sépara par des bornes le territoire de Rome d’avec celui des peuples voisins, donna à ces limites le dieu Terme pour surveillant, pour gardien d’une paix et d’une amitié mutuelles, et crut que le culte de ce dieu ne devait être souillé du sang d’aucun animal5.16.", "118": "Pourquoi est-il défendu aux esclaves romaines d’entrer dans le temple de Leucothée1, et que les femmes y en introduisent une à qui elles donnent des soufflets sur les joues?Ces souffiets sont-ils la marque de l’interdiction prononcée contre les autres, et cette défense prend-elle son origine dans ce que la Fable raconte d’lno?", "119": "La jalousie qu’elle conçut, dit-on, contre une de ses esclaves, qu’elle soupçonnait d’être aimée de son mari, la fit entrer dans une telle fureur, qu’elle tua son fils.", "120": "Les Grecs disent que cette esclave était étolienne, et s’appelait Antiphera.", "121": "Aussi à Chéronée un des ministres de Leucothée se tient-il à la porte du temple, armé d’un fouet, pour en défendre l’entrée à tout esclave de l’un et de l’autre sexe, à tout homme et à toute femme d’Étolie.17.", "122": "Pourquoi n’invoquent-ils cette même déesse que pour leurs neveux, et jamais pour leurs enfants?", "123": "Est-ce parceque Ino aima beaucoup sa sœur, dont elle nourrit même le fils, au lieu quelle fut malheureuse dans ses enfants?", "124": "Ou cet usage est-il fondé sur un principe d’honnêteté, et a-t-il pour objet de resserrer entre les proches les liens de la nature?18.", "125": "Pourquoi la plupart des citoyens riches consacrentils à Hercule la dîme de leurs biens?", "126": "Est-ce parceque ce héros immola lui-même la dixième partie du troupeau de bœufs de Géryon?", "127": "Est-ce parcequ’il affranchit les Romains de la dîme qu’ils payaient aux Étrusques, ou ces faits n’ont-ils aucun fondement historique, et ne font-ils de plus grands sacrifices à ce dieu qu’à cause de la voracité qu’on lui attribue?", "128": "N’est-ce pas plutôt qu’ils voulaient diminuer les trop grandes richesses, source ordinaire de haine et d’envie, aussi dange reuses dans le corps politique qu’un excès d’embonpoint dans le corps physique, et qu’ils ont cru que l’offrande de leur superflu ne pouvait être plus agréable à aucun autre dieu qu’à Hercule, qui avait toujours mené une vie frugale?19.", "129": "Pourquoi commencent-ils l’année au mois de janvier?Le mois de mars était autrefois le premier de l’année.", "130": "Entre plusieurs preuves qui le démontrent, une des plus frappantes, c’est que le mois de juillet portait le nom de cinquième, celui d’août de sixième, et ainsi de suite jusqu’au dernier, qui s’appelait décembre, c’est-à-dire le dixième depuis le mois de mars.", "131": "Ce qui a fait dire à quelques auteurs qu’anciennement, chez les Romains, l’année n’était composée que de dix mois, dont plusieurs avaient plus de trente jours1.", "132": "D’autres prétendent que le mois de décembre était àla vérité le dixième, à compter du mois de mars, mais qu’il était suivi de ceux de janvier et de février, qui faisaient le onzième et le douzième;", "133": "que dans ce dernier, qui terminait l’année, on faisait les expiations pour les morts.", "134": "Depuis, ajoutent-ils, on transposa cet ordre, et le mois de janvier commença l’année, parceque ce fut au premier jour, ou aux calendes de ce mois, que leurs premiers consuls entrèrent en charge, après l’expulsion des rois.Une opinion plus vraisemblable, c’est que Romulus, prince belliqueux, qui ne respirait que la guerre et passait pour fils de Mars, avait placé au commencement de l’année le mois qui portait le nom de ce dieu;", "135": "qu’ensuite Numa, qui, naturellement pacifique, desirait de tourner les esprits de ses sujets du goût des armes à celui de l’agriculture, avait donné le premier rang au mois de jan vier, et fait rendre les plus grands honneurs à Janus, dont ce mois portait le nom, comme à un prince qui avait toujours préféré à la gloire des armes les arts pacifiques et la culture des terres.", "136": "Mais ne faudrait-il pas plutôt penser que Numa prit pour commencer Tannée une époque plus conforme au cours de la nature?", "137": "Car, en général, dans les révolutions communes de l’univers, nulle n’est en soi la première ni la dernière :", "138": "c’est la volonté des hommes qui en détermine le commencement et la fin.", "139": "Il semble donc que l’époque la plus naturelle pour le commencement de l’année est celle qui suit le solstice d’hiver, où le soleil cessant d’avancer, retourne sur ses pas et se rapproche de nous.", "140": "Il se fait alors dans la nature une espèce de révolution qui augmente la durée des jours, raccourcit les nuits et ramène vers nous cet astre brillant, chef et dominateur de ce mobile univers.20.", "141": "Pourquoi les dames romaines, qui parent avec grand soin de toutes sortes de plantes et de fleurs les chapelles domestiques de la bonne déesse, n’y portentelles jamais de myrte?", "142": "Faut-il croire la fable qu’on raconte, qu’un aruspiee nommé Faulius, ayant découvert que sa femme avait bu du vin en cachette, la châtia avec des verges de myrte1?", "143": "Depuis, les femmes ne portent point de myrte dans les chapelles de cette déesse, et donnent le nom de lait au vin qu’elles lui offrent.", "144": "Cet usage viendrait-il de ce qu’en célébrant ces mystères, elles se conservent pures et s’interdisent tout commerce avec les homtnes?", "145": "Pendant le sacrifice, elles font sortir de la maison non-seulement leurs maris, mais en général tous les hommes;", "146": "elles ont aussi le myrte en horreur, parcequ’il est consacré à Vénus;", "147": "car la déesse qu’on adore aujourd’hui sous le nom de Vénus Murcia s’appelait autrefois Myrtia.21.", "148": "Pourquoi les Latins ont-ils tant de respect pour le pivert, et qu’ils se gardent avec soin de lui faire du mal?", "149": "Est-ce parceque le roi Picus, qui fut, selon la Fable, métamorphosé en pivert par les enchantements de sa femme, prononçait des oracles à ceux qui venaient le consulter1?", "150": "Ou à ce récit purement fabuleux faut-il préférer le suivant, comme bien plus vraisemblable?", "151": "Romulus et Rémus, qu’on avait exposés aussitôt après leur naissance, furent, dit-on, allaités par une louve, et un pivert vint fréquemment leur apporter de la nourriture.", "152": "Encore aujourd’hui il est assez ordinaire, au rapport de Nigidius2, que dans les vallées couvertes de bois, on ne voie guère de pivert sans qu’il y paraisse aussi un loup.", "153": "Une autre raison, peut-être meilleure, c’est que chaque dieu a un oiseau qui lui est consacré, et que le pivert l’est à Mars, parceque cet oiseau est fier et hardi, et il a le bec si fort, qu’il perce les chênes jusqu’au cœur.22.", "154": "Pourquoi représentent-ils Janus avec deux visages?", "155": "Est-ce, comme on le raconte, parceque ce prince, qui était né à Perrhebie3, dans la Grèce, passa en Italie et s’établit au milieu des peuples barbares qui l’habitaient, dont il adopta le langage et les mœurs?", "156": "Est-ce plutôt parceque, ayant trouvé les Italiens sauvages et féroces, il leur donna des mœurs plus douces, les poliça et leur inspira le goût de l’agriculture4?23.", "157": "Pourquoi tout ce qui sert aux funérailles se vendil dans le temple de la déesse Libitine, qu’ils croient être la même que Vénus?", "158": "Est-ce encore une des sages institutions de Numa, qui aura voulu par là leur apprendre à n’avoir pas horreur des cérémonies funèbres, comme si c’étaient des choses abominables?", "159": "Était-ce pour les foire ressouvenir que tout ce qui naît est périssable, puisque la même déesse préside à la naissance et à la mort?", "160": "On voit à Delphes une statue de Vénus Épitymbia, auprès de laquelle on évoque les mânes, pour leur faire des libations1.24.", "161": "Pourquoi ont-ils, dans chaque mois, trois époques fixes et invariables, mais séparées entre elles par des intervalles inégaux?", "162": "Est-ce, comme le prétend Juba, parcequ’aux calendes les magistrats convoquaient le peuple et lui annonçaient les nones pour le cinquième jour?", "163": "Quant aux ides, ils les regardaient comme un jour sacré.", "164": "Ou n’est-ce pas plutôt que, réglant les époques du jour sur les phases de la lune, ils en ont remarqué trois principales dans chaque mois :", "165": "la première, dans sa conjonction avec le soleil, où elle n’est pas visible;", "166": "la seconde, lorsque se dégageant des rayons solaires, elle commence à nous apparaître dans la partie occidentale du ciel;", "167": "la troisième, enfin, quand son orbe est tout éclairé et qu’elle est dans son plein.", "168": "La phase où elle n’est pas visible porte le nom de calendes, parcequ’en leur langue ils expriment ce qui se fait en cachette par le mot clàm, d’où ils ont fait le verbe ccelare, cacher.", "169": "Ils donnent, par une appellation très juste, à sa première apparition, le nom de none, ou nouvelle lune.", "170": "Ils dérivent leur mot novus, nouveau, de notre terme grec νέος.", "171": "Les ides ont pris leur nom ou de la beauté du jour, parcequ’alors la lune brille dans tout son éclat, ou de Jupiter, dont le nom grec signifie forme, beauté.", "172": "Mais, dans cette matière, il ne faut pas s’attacher avec une précision rigoureuse au nombre des jours, ni chicaner sur un léger défaut de justesse dans le calcul, puisque aujourd’hui même que les observations astronomiques ont été si fort multipliées, la lune, par l’inégalité de ses mouvements, met en défaut les raisonnements des physiciens et échappe à leurs calculs.25.", "173": "Pourquoi n’est-il pas permis d’entreprendre un voyage ni même de sortir de la ville le lendemain des calendes, des nones et des ides?", "174": "Est-ce, suivant l’opinion commune et d’après le récit de Tite-Live lui-même, parceque les tribuns militaires, s’étant mis en marche contre les Gaulois le lendemain des ides de juillet, ils perdirent, auprès du fleuve Allia, cette bataille funeste qui fut suivie de la prise de Rome?", "175": "Ce jour fut regardé comme malheureux, et bientôt la superstition gagnant de plus en plus, comme il n’est que trop ordinaire, s’étendit au lendemain des calendes et des nones.", "176": "Mais cette opinion a trouvé bien des contradicteurs.", "177": "D’un côté, on dit que cette déroute auprès du fleuve Allia arriva un autre jour que les ides;", "178": "d’ailleurs ils ont plusieurs autres jours estimés malheureux qu’ils n’observent pas dans tous les mois, mais seulement dans ceux auxquels les événements sont arrivés.", "179": "De plus, estil vraisemblable qu’un seul lendemain des ides regardé comme funeste ait entraîné dans la même superstition ceux des calendes et des nones?Ne faut-il pas plutôt penser qu’ayant consacré le premier de leurs mois aux dieux du ciel, et le second aux mânes (c’est dans celui-ci qu’ils font les expiations pour les morts), ils ont aussi consacré par des fêtes les trois époques principales de chaque mois, et en ont destiné le lendemain aux mânes, en défendant qu’on fît dans ces trois jours aucune entreprise?", "180": "Les Grecs, qui honorent les dieux le jour de la nouvelle lune, consacrent de même le lendemain aux génies et aux héros, à qui, dans les repas, ils font aussi les secondes libations.", "181": "En effet, le temps est une sorte de nombre, et le principe de tout nombre, c’est-à-dire l’unité, est regardé comme sacré.", "182": "Le nombre deux, qui suit l’unité, lui est opposé, et forme le premier nombre pair;", "183": "or, tout nombre pair est défectueux, imparfait et indéterminé;", "184": "le nombre impair a les propriétés contraires.", "185": "Aussi les nones sont-elles le cinquième jour après les calendes;", "186": "les ides le neuvième après les nones;", "187": "et ces principales époques sont séparées entre elles par des intervalles impairs.", "188": "Mais les jours qui suivent ces trois époques forment des nombres pairs et n’ont, par conséquent, ni la même dignité ni la même vertu.", "189": "C’est pour cela qu’ils ne voyagent point dans ces sortes de jours et qu’ils n’entreprennent aucune affaire importante.Ou faut-il appliquer à ce sujet l’apologue connu de Thémistocle?", "190": "Ce général disait que le jour de fête avait été appelé en justice par son lendemain, qui prétendait que son adversaire entraînait beaucoup de soins et d’embarras, et que lui il faisait jouir tranquillement de ce qu’on avait préparé pour le jour de fête.", "191": "« Ce que tu dis est vrai, répondit ce dernier;", "192": "mais si je n’avais été, tu n’existerais pas.", "193": "» Thémistocle appliquait cet apologue aux généraux qui lui avaient succédé, pour leur faire entendre qu’ils n’auraient rien été si lui-même n’eût sauvé la ville.", "194": "De même, tout voyage et toute affaire importante exigent des préparatifs et des soins;", "195": "et les Romains, aux jours de fête, suspendaient toute autre affaire pour ne s’occuper que du culte des dieux, d’après l’avertisse ment que leur en donne le pontife lorsqu’ils commencent le sacrifice :", "196": "« Soyez à ce que vous faites.", "197": "» Ainsi il n’était guère possible qu’ils fissent des voyages ou qu’ils entreprissent rien d’important le lendemain des jours de fête, puisqu’ils n’avaient pu rien préparer.", "198": "Ils l’employaient donc à disposer chez eux ce qu’ils avaient à faire.", "199": "Serait-ce enfin une suite de la pratique qu’ils observent encore, de rester, après le sacrifice, assis quelque temps dans les temples?", "200": "Ils ne font pas non plus succéder immédiatement aux jours de fète des jours de travail et d’action, mais ils les séparent par quelque intervalle, pour mieux se disposer aux affaires, qui souvent sont difficiles et contrarient les projets des hommes.26.", "201": "Pourquoi, dans le deuil, les femmes portent-elles des robes blanches et des voiles de même couleur?", "202": "Est-ce à l’exemple des mages, qui se munissent d’un habit éclatant et-lumineux contre Pluton et les ténèbres des enfers?", "203": "Veulent-ils que les parents du mort soient vêtus de la même couleur que les linceuls dont on l’enveloppe?", "204": "Or ils parent ainsi le corps du mort, parcequ’ils ne peuvent vêtir son ame, qu’ils veulent conduire hors de ce monde pure et brillante, comme désormais affranchie des combats et des traverses quelle a eus à soutenir.", "205": "Serait-ce qu’une couleur simple et unie convient mieux au deuil, au lieu que les couleurs composées sont faites pour le faste et le luxe?", "206": "Car on peut dire du noir, aussi bien que du pourpre :", "207": "ce sont des vêtements et des couleurs trompeuses1.", "208": "Les corps qui sont noirs de leur pro Pre substance, s’ils n’ont pas été colorés par l’art, le sont au moins par la nature.", "209": "Le blanc seul est une couleur pure, sans mélange, inimitable à l’art, et par cela même convenable aux morts qu’on ensevelit.", "210": "Un mort est devenu un être pur, simple et sans composition;", "211": "son corps était en lui comme une couleur étrangère qui altérait sa simplicité, et la mort l’en dégage.", "212": "A Argos, au rapport de Socrate1, on porte, dans le deuil, des robes blanches lavées dans de l’eau pure.27.", "213": "Pourquoi regardent-ils, en général, tous les murs comme sacrés, et qu’ils n’ont pas le même respect pour les portes?", "214": "Est-ce, comme le dit Vairon, afin que les citoyens combattent plus courageusement et jusqu’à sacrifier leur vie pour la défense des murailles?", "215": "On croit même que Romulns ne tua son frère Rémus que parcequ’en franchissant un espace consacré il l’avait rendu profane.", "216": "Pour les portes, elles ne pouvaient pas être sacrées, puisqu’elles servaient de passage aux choses nécessaires à la vie et même aux morts qu’on portait en terre.", "217": "Celui donc qui voulait bâtir une ville commençait par tracer avec une charrue attelée d’un bœuf et d’une vache tout l’espace que les murailles devaient occuper, et lorsqu’il avait mesuré celui qui était destiné aux portes, il ôtait le soc et soulevait la charrue, parceque tout le terrain qu’elle touchait était sacré et inviolable2.28.", "218": "Pourquoi défendent-ils aux enfants de jurer par Hercule dans l’intérieur de la maison, et qu’ils les obligent, pour le faire, de sortir en plein air?", "219": "Est-ce, comme plusieurs le veulent, parceque ce héros n’aima point à être rénfermé dans des murailles, qu’il vécut toujours en plein air et dans des courses continuelles?", "220": "Ou n’est-ce pas plutôt parceque Hercule était pour eux un dieu étranger et non indigène?", "221": "Ce qui porterait à le croire, c’est qu’ils ne jurent aussi par Bacchus qu’en plein air, et c’était encore pour eux un dieu étranger1.", "222": "N’est-ce enfin qu’un badinage qu’on fait aux enfants?", "223": "Favorinus, cependant, croit qu’on a voulu par là prévenir en eux une trop grande facilité pour le serment.", "224": "L’obligation de sortir est une espèce de préparatif qui cause quelque délai et leur donne le temps de la réflexion.", "225": "Je croirais volontiers avec Favorinus que si cet usage était particulier à Hercule, c’est que ce dieu eut un tel respect pour le serment, qu’il ne l’employa qu’une seule fois, à l’égard de Phylès, fils d’Augias.", "226": "Aussi la prêtresse de Delphes reprocha-t-elle aux Lacédémoniens l’habitude qu’ils avaient de jurer;", "227": "elle leur dit qu’il valait mieux tenir fidèlement sa parole sans faire de serment2.29.", "228": "Pourquoi ne souffrent-ils pas qu’une nouvelle mariée touche le seuil de la porte pour entrer dans la maison de son mari, et que les promîtes3 l’enlèvent dans leurs bras pour le lui faire franchir?", "229": "Cet usage vient-il de ce que les premières femmes qu’ils eurent n’y entrèrent pas volontairement et y furent transporlées dans les bras de leurs ravisseurs4?", "230": "Est-ce qu’elles veulent avoir l’air de n’entrer que par force dans un lieu où elles doivent perdre leur virginité?", "231": "Est-ce pour leur faire entendre qu’elles ne doivent pas quitter la maison, à moins quelles n’y soient forcées, comme elles l’ont été pour y entrer?", "232": "En Béotie, on brûle devant la porte du mari l’essieu de la voiture dans laquelle la nouvelle mariée a été conduite, pour lui apprendre qu’elle est obligée de rester à la maison, d’où on lui ôte les moyens de sortir.30.", "233": "Pourquoi la nouvelle mariée, lorsqu’elle entre dans la maison de son époux, est-elle obligée de prononcer ces mots :", "234": "Où vous serez, Caïus, moi, Cala, je serai aussi?", "235": "Cette formule signifie-t-elle que la femme entre chez son mari sous la condition de partager avec lui la propriété et le gouvernement de la famille?", "236": "Et alors ces paroles voudraient dire :", "237": "« Où vous serez maître et seigneur, je serai aussi dame et maîtresse.", "238": "» Ces mots Caïus et Caïa sont des noms communs qu’ils emploient pour désigner les personnes, comme les jurisconsultes font de ceux de Caïus, Seïus, Lucius,

anciennement la statue dans le temple de Sanctus?", "240": "elle avait des sandales aux pieds et un fuseau à la main, symboles de sa vie retirée et laborieusel1.31.", "241": "Pourquoi, dans les noces, emploie-t-on ce chant si connu qu’on appelle Talasius?Ce nom vient-il de talasia, ouvrage de laine?", "242": "Car les Latins disent talasus pour talarus, Quand la nouvelle épouse est entrée dans la maison, on la fait asseoir sur une peau de mouton garnie de sa laine.", "243": "Elle est obligée d’apporter une quenouille avec un fuseau, et de couronner de laine la porte de la maison.", "244": "Ou faut-il s’en tenir au rapport des historiens, qui disent que lors de l’enlèvement des Sabines, il y avait à Rome un jeune guerrier aussi célèbre par ses vertus que par ses exploits nommé Talasius?", "245": "Des plébéiens ses clients avaient enlevé pour lui une jeune Sabine de la plus grande beauté, et afin que personne ne vînt la leur ravir ni la leur disputer, ils criaient, en l’enlevant, qu’elle était destinée à Talasius.", "246": "Une foule de citoyens, par honneur pour ce guerrier, la conduisirent jusque chez lui avec de grandes acclamations.", "247": "Ce mariage fut heureux, et il passa depuis en usage d’invoquer dans le mariage Talasius, comme les Grecs invoquent l’Hyménée.32.", "248": "Pourquoi, au mois de mai, jettent-ils du haut du pont de bois dans le Tibre des figures d’hommes qu’ils appellent Argitns?", "249": "Cela vient-il de ce que les Barbares qui habitaient anciennement le pay s faisaient périr de cette manière les Grecs qui tombaient entre leurs mains?", "250": "Mais Hercule, dont ils admiraient la valeur, abolit cette coutume meurtrière et leur conseilla de jeter dans le fleuve ces sortes de figures, afin de satisfaire leur superstition.", "251": "Or, dans les premiers temps, on donnait également à tous les Grecs le nom d’Argiens.", "252": "Faut-il attribuer cet usage au roi Évandre, qui s’enfuit de la Grèce et vint s’établir en Italie?", "253": "Et les Arcadiens de sa suite, qui regardaient les Grecs comme leurs ennemis, à cause du voisinage, voulurent, par cet usage, perpétuer le souvenir de leur haine contre ces peuples1.33.", "254": "Pourquoi les anciens Romains n’allaient-ils jamais manger en ville sans y mener leurs fils, même les plus jeunes?", "255": "Était-ce pour imiter l’institution de Lycurgue, qui avait établi que les enfants seraient admis aux repas communs, afin que la présence et l’inspection des vieillards les accoutumassent à user des plaisirs avec modération, au lieu de s’y livrer sans frein et sans mesure, comme les bêtes?", "256": "D’ailleurs les pères eux-mêmes étaient contenus par la vue de leurs enfants et se conduisaient avec plus de réserve.", "257": "En effet, quand les vieillards, dit Platon, sont sans retenue, les jeunes gens perdent nécessairement toute pudeur.34.", "258": "Pourquoi Brutus, au rapport de Cicéron, faisait-il les expiations pour les morts au mois de décembre, tandis que les autres Romains les faisaient dans le mois de février?", "259": "Ce Brutus1 est celui qui entra dans la Lusitanie et passa le premier le fleuve d’oubli2.", "260": "Était-ce que, conformément à l’usage où l’on est de rendre ces devoirs aux morts à la fin du jour et du mois, il croyait plus naturel de le faire aussi à la fin de l’année et dans le dernier mois, qui est celui de décembre?", "261": "Étaitce parceque ces honneurs se rendaient aux dieux mânes, et que la saison la plus naturelle pour les honorer était, selon Brutus, celle où tous les fruits sont cueillis?", "262": "Croyaitil que le temps le plus propre pour penser aux mânes etait celui où l’on commence à ouvrir la terre pour lui confier les semences?", "263": "Voulait-il par là honorer Saturne, à qui ce mois est consacré et qu’on compte parmi les dieux des enfers?", "264": "Était-ce parceque les Saturnales, une de leurs plus grandes fêtes, et dans laquelle ils se livrent davantage à la bonne chère et aux plaisirs, se célébraient ce mois-là, et qu’il voulait en offrir aux morts quelques prémices?", "265": "Mais plutôt n’est-il pas faux que Brutus fût le seul qui fit ces sacrifices au mois de décembre?", "266": "Car c’est aussi dans ce mois qu’on rend les honneurs funèbres à Larentia et qu’on fait des libations sur son tombeau.35.", "267": "Pourquoi rendent-ils de si grands honneurs à Larentia, qui ne fut qu’une courtisane?Je ne parle point de cette Acca Larentia qui fut nourrice de Romulus et qu’ils honorent dans le mois d’avril.", "268": "L’autre était surnommée Fabula, et voici son histoire.", "269": "Un prêtre d’Hercule à qui, selon l’usage, son état laissait beaucoup de loisir, passait presque tout son temps à jouer aux dés et aux osselets.", "270": "Un jour qu’il ne vint aucun de ceux qui avaient coutume de faire sa partie, il proposa au dieu de jouer avec lui, à condition que s’il gagnait.", "271": "Hercule lui accorderait une grâce à son choix, et que s’il était battu, il donnerait à souper au dieu et lui amènerait une belle femme.", "272": "Il jette les dès d’abord pour Hercule, ensuite pour lui-même, et perd la partie.", "273": "Fidèle aux conventions, il

eut commerce avec elle d’une manière toute divine, et le lendemain, àla pointe du jour, il lui ordonna d’aller sur la place publique, de suivre le premier citoyen quelle rencontrerait et de tâcher

fait connaissance avec elle, il la mit à la tête de sa maison et, en mourant, lui laissa tous ses biens.", "278": "Larentia fit, à sa mort, le peuple romain son héritier, et de là les honneurs qu’on lui rend1.36.", "279": "Pourquoi donnent-ils le nom de fenêtre à une porte de Rome auprès de laquelle est un bâtiment appelé la chambre de la Fortune?", "280": "Est-ce parceque le roi Servius, qui fut très heureux, passait pour avoir un commerce secret avec la Fortune, qui, dit-on, entrait chez lui par la fenêtre?", "281": "Ou ce récit n’est-il qu’une fable, et ce nom vient-il de ce qu’après la mort de Tarquin l’Ancien, Tanaquil, sa veuve, femme d’une prudence et d’une sagesse dignes de son rang, harangua le peuple par la fenêtre de son palais et lui persuada d’élire Servius pour roi?37.", "282": "Pourquoi de toutes les offrandes qu’on fait aux dieux, les dépouilles prises sur les ennemis sont-elles les seules qu’on laisse périr, sans qu’il soit permis de les réparer?Croient-ils que la gloire qu’ils ont acquise en les remportant périt avec elles, et veulent-ils par là s’encourager à en obtenir de nouvelles?", "283": "Ou plutôt regardent-ils comme la marque odieuse d’un esprit de discorde, de renouveler ces preuves de leurs anciennes divisions avec leurs ennemis, après que le temps les a détruites?", "284": "Chez les Grecs mêmes, on n’approuve point ceux qui ont élevé les premiers des trophées de pierre et d’airain.38.", "285": "Pourquoi Q. Métellus, homme prudent et instruit, lorsqu’il fut devenu souverain pontife, défendit-il qu’on prît les auspices après le sixième mois, aujourd’hui le mois d’août?", "286": "Estrce que, comme nous sommes dans l’usage de ne les prendre qu’à la naissance du jour ou à midi, au commencement et au milieu du mois, ef non le soir ou les derniers jours du mois, temps que nous croyons peu propres aux affaires,", "287": "Métellus aussi regarda les mois qui suivent les huit premiers comme le soir de l’année, qui penche déjà vers son déclin?", "288": "Est-ce afin de n’employer que des oiseaux bien formés et dans la force de l’âge, tels qu’ils sont avant l’été, au lieu qu’aux approches de l’automne, les uns sont malades et languissants, les autres encore trop petits, et plusieurs disparaissent, chassés par les premiers froids dans d’autres contrées?39.", "289": "Pourquoi les citoyens qui n’ont pas prêté le serment militaire ne peuvent-ils pas, lorsqu’ils se trouvent dans le camp, tuer un ennemi ni le blesser?", "290": "(Cette loi est attestée par Caton l’Ancien, qui écrivait un jour à son fils que si le temps de son service était fini, il revînt à Rome, ou que s’il restait à l’armée, il obtînt du général la permission de combattre les ennemis.", "291": ")Croient-ils que la nécessité seule peut donner le droit de faire périr quelqu’un, et que le tuer sans une loi et un ordre exprès, c’est être homicide?", "292": "C’est pour cela sans doute que Cyrus loua Chrysante.", "293": "qui, ayant le bras levé pour percer un ennemi et entendant sonner la retraite, se retint et ne le frappa point, parcequ’il ne croyait plus en avoir le droit.", "294": "Serait-ce que tout soldat qui, dans une bataille, vient à lâcher le pied, doit pouvoir être cité et puni, parceque sa fuite est d’un plus mauvais exemple qqe la mort ou la blessure d’un ennemi ne peut être utile?", "295": "Or, celui qui a son congé n’est plus sujet aux lois militaires;", "296": "mais s’il demande à remplir les devoirs de soldat, il est soumis aux lois et justiciable de son général.40.", "297": "Pourquoi est-il défendu au prêtre de Jupiter de se frotter d’huile en plein air?", "298": "Est-ce par la même raison qu’ils regardent comme une indécence qu’un fils paraisse nu devant son père, et un gendre devant son beau-père, et qu’autrefois même ils ne prenaient pas le bain ensemble?", "299": "Or Jupiter est le père des hommes, et ce qui se fait en plein air est surtout exposé à ses regards.", "300": "Est-ce que, comme il est défendu d’ôter ses habits dans un temple, ils ont le même respect pour l’air, qu’ils croient rempli de dieux et de génies1?", "301": "C’est pour cela que nous faisons bien des choses, même nécessaires, dans le secret de nos maisons et comme hors de la présence des dieux.", "302": "D’ailleurs, n’y a-t-il pas des actions que le prêtre seul peut faire, et d’autres que la loi commande à tous par l’organe du prêtre?", "303": "Ainsi, dans la Béotie, le droit de porter une couronne et des armes, de laisser croître ses cheveux, et la défense d’entrer dans les terres des Phocéens2, sont des choses particulières au seul magistrat;", "304": "mais de ne manger des pommes qu’après l’équinoxe d’automne, de ne pas tailler la vigne avant celui du printemps, ce sont des pratiques que le magistrat commande à tous les citoyens, afin que chacune se fasse dans sa saison.", "305": "De même, chez les Romains, le prêtre de Jupiter est le seul qui ne puisse ni aller à cheval, ni passer plus de trois nuits hors de Rome, ni quitter un seul instant son bonnet, marque de sa dignité et d’où lui vient le nom de flamine3.", "306": "Mais il est plusieurs lois que le prêtre intime à tous les citoyens, et de ce nombre est la défense de se frotter d’huile en plein air1.", "307": "En général, les Romains désapprouvent fort la pratique de s’oindre le corps d’huile publiquement, et ils sont persuadés que rien n’a tant contribué à amollir lés Grecs et à les faire tomber dans l’esclavage, que leurs gymnases.", "308": "C’étaient pour les villes des occasions de paresse, d’oisiveté, d’amusements pernicieux;", "309": "De là naissaient les vices les plus infâmes.", "310": "Ces sommeils, ces promenades, ces mouvements réglés et compassés, ce régime si exact et si mesuré, tout cela énervait les corps des jeunes gens.", "311": "C’est ce qui a fait perdre insensiblement aux Grecs le goût des armes, et au mérite de soldats pesamment armés et de bons cavaliers ils ont préféré celui d’athlètes agiles, de lutteurs adroits, d’hommes de bonne mine.", "312": "Or il est difficile de ne pas donner dans tous ces écueils dès qu’une fois on ne craint pas de paraître nu en public;", "313": "au lieu qu’on les évite en se frottant d’huile et en donnant à son corps tous les autres soins nécessaires dans l’intérieur de sa maison.41.", "314": "Pourquoi l’ancienne monnaie des Romains portait-elle d’un côté l’empreinte d’un Janus à deux visages, et de l’autre celle de la poupe ou de la proue d’un vaisseau?", "315": "Était-ce, suivant l’opinion la plus commune, pour honorer Saturne, qui vint par mer en Italie?", "316": "Il est vrai que cela lui fut commun avec bien d’autres héros, tels que Janus, Évandre et Énée.", "317": "Ainsi je l’attribuerais à une autre cause, qui me paraît bien plus vraisemblable.", "318": "Rien ne contribue tant aux bonnes mœurs des villes qu’une sage législation, et rien ne lui est plus nécessaire que l’abondance.", "319": "Rome devait à Janus les lois qui avaient adouci les mœurs de ses habitants, et à la navigation de son fleuve les richesses de la terre et de la mer.", "320": "Elle avait donc mis sur sa monnaie, d’un côté l’empreinte de son législateur, qu’on représentait à deux visages, comme on l’a déjà dit, à cause de l’heureuse révolution qu’il avait opérée;", "321": "et de l’autre la navigation du Tibre.", "322": "Ils eurent aussi une autre monnaie sur laquelle étaient empreints un bœuf, une brebis et un porc, pour signifier que les troupeaux faisaient leurs principales richesses.", "323": "Aussi la plupart des anciens Romains, au rapport de Fénestella1, tiraient-ils leur nom de quelque animal, tels que Suillius, Buhulcus et Porcins.42.", "324": "Pourquoi ont-ils choisi le temple de Saturne pour en faire le dépôt du trésor public et des archives?Ont-ils suivi en cela l’opinion généralement établie, que sous le règne de Saturne, les hommes exempts d’avarice et de fraude pratiquaient en tout la justice et la bonne foi?", "325": "Est-ce parceque ce dieu préside à la culture des terres et des fruits?", "326": "car c’est là ce que sa faux désigne et non ce qu’a dit Antimachus, d’après Hésiode :", "327": "L’abondance des fruits et la vente qui en a été la suite ont donné naissance à la monnaie, et c’est pour cela qu’on l’a mise sous la garde de Saturne, qui en est regardé comme l’auteur.", "328": "Ce qui confirme cette opinion, c’est que les marchés qui se tiennent tous les neuf jours sur la place publique sont consacrés à Saturne, parceque l’abondance des fruits en a nécessairement amené les achats et les ventes.", "329": "Peut-être est-ce remonter trop loin, et il est, je crois, plus probable que Valérius Publicola, après l’expulsion des rois, fit le premier du temple de Saturne le dépôt du trésor public, parcequ’il était bien fortifié, exposé à la vue de tout le monde et à l’abri des insultes.43.", "330": "Pourquoi les ambassadeurs qui viennent de toutes parts à Rome vont-ils se faire inscrire au temple de Saturne, sur le registre des questeurs?", "331": "Cela vient-il de ce que Saturne aimait les étrangers, parcequ’il l’avait été lui-même en Italie?", "332": "Ou plutôt n’en faut-il pas chercher la solution dans l’histoire?", "333": "Il paraît qu’anciennement les questeurs envoyaient des présents aux ambassadeurs;", "334": "qu’ils avaient soin d’eux lorsqu’ils tombaient malades, et que, s’ils venaient à mourir, ils les faisaient enterrer aux dépens du trésor public.", "335": "Aujourd’hui la multitude des ambassadeurs qui se rendent à Rome a fait supprimer cette dépense, mais on a conservé l’usage de les faire inscrire sur le registre des questeurs.44.", "336": "Pourquoi n’est-il pas permis au prêtre de Jupiter de faire aucun serment?", "337": "Est-ce que le serment est une espèce de question pour les gens fibres, et que l’ame d’un prêtre ne doit être, non plus que son corps, assujettie à aucune torture?", "338": "A-t-on cru qu’il serait inconséquent de ne pas s’en rapporter, pour de petites choses, à la parole d’un homme à qui l’on confie les choses les plus sacrées et les plus importantes?", "339": "Est-ce parceque tout serment finit par des imprécations contre ceux qui se parjureraient?", "340": "Or l’imprécation est toujours de mauvais augure, et les lois défendent aux prêtres d’en prononcer contre personne.", "341": "Aussi approuva-t-on la prêtresse d’Athènes qui ne voulut point maudire Alcibiade, quoique le peuple le lui ordonnât, et qui répondit qu’elle était faite pour prononcer des vœux et non des malédictions1.", "342": "Est-ce enfin de peur que le peuple ne soit exposé aux suites d’un parjure si un homme qui en serait coupable prononçait des vœux et offrait des sacrifices pour la république?45.", "343": "Pourquoi, dans la fête des Vinales2, verse-t-on du temple de Vénus une grande quantité de vin?", "344": "Est-ce, comme on croit assez généralement, parceque Mézence, froi des Étrusques, fit offrir la paix à Énée, à condition de lui donner tout le vin qu’il recueillerait cette année?", "345": "Sur le refus de son ennemi, il promit à ses soldats de leur abandonner ce vin s’il était vainqueur.", "346": "Énée, informé de cette promesse, consacra le vin aux dieux;", "347": "il vainquit Mézence et répandit devant le temple de Vénus tout le vin qu’il recueillit.", "348": "Peut-être est-ce un avertissement symbolique qu’on donne au peuple de passer les jours de fête dans la sobriété et d’éviter l’intempérance, parceque les dieux préfèrent une abondante effusion de vin à l’usage excessif de cette liqueur.46.", "349": "Pourquoi les anciens Romains laissaient-ils le temple de la déesse Horta toujours ouvert?Croyaient-ils, comme le dit Antistius Labéon3, que cette déesse, dont la fonction, suivant que son nom l’indique, est d’exhorter, d’animer au bien, devait être toujours en activité, toujours libre et en mouvement, sans jamais être renfermée ni retenue?", "350": "Ou plutôt ont-ils voulu marquer que cette déesse, qu’ils appellent aujourd’hui Ora, en faisant la première syllabe longue, est toujours en action, toujours occupée, observe avec soin tout ce qui se passe et veille sans distraction sur les actions humaines?", "351": "Ou ce mot, comme bien d’autres de leur langue, est-il emprunté du grec et exprime-t-il que cette déesse voit tout, et que, comme elle ne se repose jamais, son temple doit rester continuellement ouvert?", "352": "Que si la conjecture de Labéon, qui tire le nom de cette déesse du mot exhorter, est fondée, ne pourra-t-on pas donner la mêrqe origine au nom d’orateur, puisque le but d’un orateur est d’exhorter, de persuader le peuple, au lieu de le dériver, comme d’autres, des vœux et des prières?47.", "353": "Pourquoi Romulus fit-il construire hors de la ville le temple de Vulcain?Comme il passait pour fils de Mars, et que peut-être il ajoutait foi à cette jalousie que la Fable raconte de Vulcain contre ce Dieu, à cause de ses amours avec Vénus, il n’aura pas voulu que Vulcain et Mars eussent dans la même ville un domicile commun.", "354": "Mais sans adopter cette tradition « ridicule, ne faut-il pas croire plutôt que ce temple fut bâti par ce prince, au commencement de son règne, pour s’y assembler avec Tatius, son collègue au trône, et y délibérer en secret avec lès sénateurs sur les affaires publiques, sans qu’on vînt les interrompre?", "355": "Ou est-ce parceque Rome ayant été, dans les premiers temps, sujette à de fréquents incendies, il voulut bien honorer le dieu du feu, mais il plaça son temple hors de la ville1?48.", "356": "Pourquoi, aux fêtes de Cousus1, couronne-t-on les chevaux et les ânes, et les dispense-t-on de tout travail?", "357": "Est-ce parceque ces fêtes sont consacrées à Neptune équestre, et que l’âne, qui est l’associé du cheval dans le travail, partage aussi son repos?", "358": "Est-ce que, dans cette saison, la navigation, qui dévient favorable, permet qu’on laisse reposer quelques jours les bêtes de somme2?49.", "359": "Pourquoi ceux qui briguaient les charges étaientils obligés, au rapport de Caton, de quitter la toge et de n’avoir qu’une simple tunique?", "360": "Craignait-on qu’ils ne cachassent de l’argent sous leur toge pour acheter les suffrages?", "361": "Ou les candidats, qui savaient que le peuple jugeait dignes des magistratures non les citoyens les plus distingués par leur naissance, leurs richesses ou leur crédit, mais ceux qui avaient reçu plus de blessures à l’armée, venaient-ils au Champ-de-Mars sans toge, afin qu’on pût voir les cicatrices dont ils étaient couverts?", "362": "Était-ce une manière plus humble de gagner la faveur du peuple, comme ils employaient aussi pour cela les prières et les autres marques de soumission?50.", "363": "Pourquoi le flamine de Jupiter, selon le rapport d’Atéius, perdait-il sa dignité quand sa femme venait à mourir?Pensait-on que celui qui a perdu sa femme est plus malheureux que celui qui est resté célibataire?", "364": "En effet, la famille d’un homme marié est complète;", "365": "celle d’un homme veuf est imparfaite et, pour ainsi dire, mutilée.", "366": "Est-ce parceque la femme du flamine partage son sacerdoce, et qu’il est plusieurs sacrifices qu’il ne peut faire sans elle?", "367": "Il n’est pas toujours facile ni même convenable d’en épouser une autre aussitôt après la mort de la première;", "368": "aussi ne lui a-t-il jamais été permis de la répudier.", "369": "De nos jours seulement, Domitien l’a permis une fois.", "370": "Encore les prêtres assistèrent-ils à la dissolution du mariage, qu’ils accompagnèrent des cérémonies les plus tristes et les plus extraordinaires.", "371": "Au reste, on sera moins surpris de cet usage lorsqu’on saura que si un des censeurs venait à mourir, son collègue était obligé d’abdiquer1.", "372": "Le censeur Livius Drusus étant mort, Scaurus Émilius, son collègue, ne voulait pas quitter sa charge.", "373": "Les tribuns du peuple, pour l’y forcer, le firent mettre en prison.51.", "374": "Pourquoi placent-ils un chien auprès des dieux lares, qu’ils appellent prestites, et qu’ils les vêtissent de peaux de chien?", "375": "Est-ce parcequ’ils président à la maison, et qu’à ce titre, ils doivent veiller à sa défense et, à l’exemple des chiens, se montrer redoutables aux étrangers et doux aux gens de la maison?", "376": "Faut-il adopter l’opinion de quelques Romains qui pensent avec les sectateurs de Chrysippe qu’il erre dans l’univers de mauvais génies, dont les dieux se servent, comme de bourreaux, pour châtier les méchants et les impies?", "377": "De même à Rome, regarde-ton les lares comme des génies redoutables, destinés au châtiment des humains et chargés de veiller sur ce qui se passe dans l’intérieur des maisons.", "378": "Ils sont donc vêtus de peaux de chien et ont un de ces animaux auprès d’eux pour signifier qu’ils sont habiles à éventer les méchants et à les punir.52.", "379": "Pourquoi immolent-ils un chien à la déesse ManaGeneta, et qu’ils lui demandent qu’aucun de ceux qui sont dans la maison ne devienne bon?Geneta préside aux enfantements et à la production des choses périssables.", "380": "Ses noms eux-mêmes désignent une génération qui s’écoule.", "381": "Ainsi, les Romains lui immolent un chien pour ceux qui naissent dans leurs maisons, comme les Grecs font à Hécate.", "382": "Socrate dit que les Argiens sacrifient aussi un chien à Lucine, pour en obtenir un heureux enfantement.", "383": "Mais la prière que les Romains font à la déesse Geneta ne regarde-t-elle pas les chiens qui naissent dans leurs maisons, plutôt que les hommes?", "384": "Ils demandent qu’ils soient méchants et qu’ils se fassent craindre aux étrangers.", "385": "Serait-ce que, comme on donne le nom de bons à ceux qui sont morts, ils la prient indirectement par cette formule que personne de la famille ne meure?", "386": "Il ne faut pas au reste s’étonner de cette expression.", "387": "Aristote rapporte que dans le traité fait entre les Spartiates et les Arcadiens, il fut convenu qu’on ne rendrait bon, c’est-à-dire qu’on ne ferait mourir aucun des Tégéates qui se seraient déclarés pour les Lacédémoniens.53.", "388": "Pourquoi, dans les jeux capitolins, fait-on encore aujourd’hui proclamer par un héraut :", "389": "Sardiens à vendre, et qu’on produit, par raillerie, un vieillard qui, comme les enfants, porte une bulle pendue au cou?Les Véiens d’Étrurie avaient résisté longtemps à Romulus.", "390": "Il se rendit enfin maître de leur ville et fit vendre publiquement un grand nombre de prisonniers avec leur roi, en leur reprochant leur faiblesse et leur folie.", "391": "Or, les Étrusques tiraient leur origine des Lydiens, dont Sardes était la capitale.", "392": "C’est pour cela qu’on les proclamait sous ce nom, et l’usage s’en est conservé par plaisanterie1.54.", "393": "Pourquoi donnent-ils le nom de macellum à la boucherie?", "394": "Est-ce, comme dans bien d’autres mots de leur langue, par corruption du mot màgeiros, qui en grec signifie

oiseau qui soit vicié, n’est-il pas encore plus convenable que les prêtres qui s’approchent des autels pour connaître la volonté des dieux y apportent une pureté parfaite et qu’ils n’aient rien de défectueux?", "503": "Or, un ulcère est une souillure et comme une mutilation du corps.74.", "504": "Pourquoi Servius Tellius consacra-t-il un temple à la fortune petite, que dans leur langue ils

du tribunal, qu’il sert à montrer le pouvoir et la force du peuple qui l’a établi, en ce què les tribuns ne peuvent pas s’élever au-dessus des autres citoyens, et n’ont rien dans leur habillement, ni

"588": "Disposent-ils la nuit ce qu’ils projettent de faire, pour être en état de l’exécuter à la pointe du joùr?", "589": "car il faut se préparer avant que d’agir, et ne pas attendre, pour le faire,", "590": "Je moment de l’action, comme Myson le dit à Chilon, l’un des sept sages, qui s’étonnait qu’il préparât un van pendant l’hiver?", "591": "Est-ce que l’heure de midi, étant pour bien des gens le terme des affaires sérieuses, ils ont voulu prendre, pour les commencer, le milieu de la nuit?", "592": "On sait qu’un magistrat romain ne fait jamais ni traité ni trêve après midi.", "593": "Est-ce parcequ’on ne peut fixer le commencement et la fin du jour au lever et au coucher du soleil?", "594": "Car en prenant, comme font plusieurs, pour le commencement du jour, le premier instant où le soleil se lève, et pour celui de la nuit le moment où il se plonge sous l’horizon, nous n’aurons jamais de véritable équinoxe, et la nuit que nous croirons la plus égale au jour sera plus courte de toute la grandeur du soleil1.", "595": "Ce que les mathématiciens2 disent pour lever cet inconvénient, que la sé paration du jour et de la nuit se fait au moment où le centre du soleil touche l’horizon, est contraire à l’évidence.", "596": "Alors il faudrait dire que le jour est fiqi, et qu’on est dans la nuit, tandis que le soleil nous éclairerait encore, et répandrait sur la terre une lumière abondante.", "597": "Puis donc que le lever et le coucher du soleil, pour les raisons déjà rapportées, ne peuvent pas déterminer avec précision le commencement et la fin du jour, il reste d’en fixer le commencement à l’instant où le soleil occupe le milieu du ciel, ou bien à l’instant opposé.", "598": "Mais le second point est préférable, parceque de midi à son coucher, il s’éloigne de nous, au lieu qu’il s’en rapproche de minuit à son lever.85.", "599": "Pourquoi, anciennement, ne permettaient-ils à leurs femmes ni de moudre ni de faire la cuisine?", "600": "Était-de en jnémoire des conventions faites avec les Sabins?", "601": "Après l’enlèvement des Sabines et la guerre qui en fut la suite, ils insérèrent dans les articles de paix qu’un Romain ne pourrait pas obliger sa femme à moudre ni à faire la cuisine.86.", "602": "Pourquoi ne sont-ils pas dans l’usage de se marier au mois de mai?", "603": "Comme ce mois tient le milieu entre ceux d’avril et de juin, dont le premier est consacré à Vénus et le second à Junon1, deux divinités qui président au mariage, veulent-ils, pour se marier, ou prévenir le mois de mai, ou attendre celui de juin?", "604": "Cet usage vient-il de ce que, dans ce mois, ils font la plus grande de leurs expiations en jetant du pont dans le Tibre des figures humaines, au lieu des hommes mêmes qu’ils en précipitaient autrefois?", "605": "Aussi la prêtresse de Junon doit-elle, ces jours-là, rester en habits négligés, s’abstenir du bain et de toute espèce de parure.", "606": "Est-ce à cause des expiations que la plupart des peuples latins font dans ce mois, qui, sans doute pour cette raison, est consacré à Mercure, et tire son nom de Maïa1?", "607": "Ou bien est-ce, comme d’autres le prétendent, parceque le mois de mai tire son nom des anciens, ou des vieillards2, et celui de juin des jeunes gens, et que le mariage ne convient pas aux premiers, comme dit Euripide :", "608": "Ils ne se marient donc pas au mois de mai, et attendent pour cela celui de juin, qui le suit immédiatement.87.", "609": "Pourquoi séparent-ils avec la pointe d’une lance les cheveux des nouvelles mariées3?", "610": "Est-ce un symbole qui rappelle que leurs premières femmes avaient été enlevées de force, et conservées par les armes?", "611": "Est-ce pour les avertir que, s’unissant à des hommes belliqueux, leur parure doif être simple, et n’avoir rien qui sente le luxe et la mollesse?", "612": "C’est ainsi que Lycurgue, en défendant qu’on employât, pour faire les portes et les toits des maisons, d’autres instruments que la hache et la scie, avait banni de Sparte tout luxe et toute superfluité.", "613": "Est-ce une manière allégorique de leur faire entendre que le fer seul pourra rompre leur mariage?", "614": "Est-ce que la plupart des cérémonies du mariage se rapportent à Junon;", "615": "que la lance est consacrée à cette déesse;", "616": "que ses statues sont ordinairement appuyées sur une lance, et qu’elle-même porte le nom de Quiris?", "617": "Or, c’était, chez les anciens Romains, le nom de la lance, et de là, Mars était appelé Quirinus.88.", "618": "Pourquoi appellent-ils lucar l’argent qui sert aux frais des spectacles?", "619": "Est-ce parcequ’il y a autour de la ville plusieurs bois consacrés aux dieux, dont le produit est employé aux frais des spectacles?89.", "620": "Pourquoi la fête quirinale est-elle appelée la fêle des fous?", "621": "Est-ce, comme le dit Juba, parceque ce jour est destiné à ceux qui ne connaissent pas leur tribu?", "622": "Ou bien parceque ceux que des affaires, un voyage ou même l’ignorance avaient empêchés de célébrer dans leur tribu la fête fornicale, la remplaçaient par celle des fous1?90.", "623": "Pourquoi, au rapport de Yarron, lorsqu’ils sacrifient à Hercule, n’invoquent-ils aucun autre dieu, et qu’on ne voit pas de chien dans toute l’enceinte du lieu où se fait le sacrifice?", "624": "N’invoquent-ils point d’autre divinité, parceque Hercule n’est regardé que comme un demi-dieu?", "625": "Est-ce parceque Évandre éleva un autel à ce héros et lui sacrifia lorsqu’il était encore parmi les mortels?", "626": "De tous les animaux, le chien est celui qu’Hercule combattit le plus, et qui lui donna le plus de peine, surtout le chien Cerbère.", "627": "D’ailleurs, ce fut à cause d’un chien que les Hippocodntides tuèrent Énus, fils de Licymnius.", "628": "Hercule fut obligé de les combattre, et dans cette action il perdit plusieurs de ses amis, et entre autres son frère Iphiclus1.91.", "629": "Pourquoi était-il défendu aux patriciens d’habiter auprès du Capitole", "630": "?", "631": "Cette défense fut-elle occasionnée par l’ambition de Manlius qui y demeurait, et qui voulut usurper l’autorité souveraine?", "632": "Depuis lui, sa famille s’engagea par serment à ne jamais prendre le prénom de Mardis.", "633": "Ou cette loi, dictée par la crainte, datait-elle de plus loin?", "634": "Publicola, l’homme le plus populaire qui fut jamais, ne cessa d’être en butte aux calomnies des grands et aux soupçons du peuple, qu’après qu’il eut fait démolir la maison qu’il avait près du Capitole, et qui semblait dominer la place publique.92.", "635": "Pourquoi donnaient-ils une couronne de chêne à celui qui avait sauvé un citoyen à la guerre?", "636": "Est-ce parcequ’ils trouvaient facilement du chêne, en quelque lieu qu’ils fissent la guerre, ou parceque cet arbre est consacré à Jupiter et à Junon, divinités tutélaires des villes?", "637": "Cette coutume était-elle prise des Arcadiens, qu’on croyait avoir une sorte de parenté avec le chêne, premier arbre que la terre ait produit, comme les premiers hommes passaient pour être nés de la terre?93.", "638": "Pourquoi les vautours sont-ils employés de préférence pour les augures?", "639": "Est-ce parceque Romulus, en bâtissant Rome, aperçut douze vautours, ou que cet oiseau est un de ceux qu’on voit le moins?", "640": "On trouve bien rarement un nid de vautours, et c’est toujours de lieux très éloignés qu’ils apparaissent tout à coup, ce qui fait croire que leur apparition est le présage de quelque événement.", "641": "Est-ce d’Hercule qu’ils ont reçu cet usage?", "642": "Rien, s’il faut en croire Hérodore, ne faisait plus de plaisir à ce héros, quand il prenait les auspices, que de voir un vautour, qu’il regardait comme le plus doux des oiseaux carnivores :", "643": "1° parcequ ’il ne touche à aucun animal vivant, qu’il n’en tue jamais, comme font les aigles, les éperviers et les oiseaux de nuit, et qu’il ne se nourrit que de cadavres;", "644": "2° il ne touche pas aux corps morts de son espèce;", "645": "jamais on ne vit de vautour manger un oiseau, tandis que les aigles et les éperviers poursuivent et dévorent de préférence les volatilles.", "646": "Or, selon Eschyle,D’ailleurs, de tous les oiseaux, c’est le moins nuisible à l’homme.", "647": "Il ne fait tort ni aux plantes, ni aux fruits, ni aux animaux domestiques.", "648": "Enfin, s’il est vrai, comme les Égyptiens le prétendent, que toute l’espèce des vautours est femelle, et qu’ils conçoivent par le souffle du vent du midij comme les arbres sont fécondés par celui du zéphyr1, il est assez probable que les signes qu’ils donnent sont certains et à l’abri de toute erreur;", "649": "au lieu que l’agitation des autres oiseaux, lorsqu’ils s’accouplent, leurs rapines, leurs combats et leurs fuites mettent nécessairement dans l’observation des présages beaucoup de trouble et d’incertitude.94.", "650": "Pourquoi le temple d’Esculape est-il hors de la ville?Le séjour de la campagne leur a-t-il paru plus salutaire que celui de la ville?", "651": "En effet, les Grecs eux-mêmes ont coutume de placer les temples de ce dieu dans des lieux sains et élevés.", "652": "Est-ce parcequ’ils croient que ce dieu leur est venu d’Épidaure, où son temple est très loin de la ville?", "653": "Est-ce que, dans le transport d’Esculape à Rome, un serpent étant sorti de la galère auprès d’une île où il disparut, on pensa que le dieu avait voulu marquer lui-même le lieu où l’on devait bâtir son temple1?95.", "654": "Pourquoi est-il défendu à ceux qui gardent la continence d’user de légumes?Ont-ils les fèves en aversion par les mêmes raisons que les sectateurs de Pythagore?", "655": "Est-ce parceque les pois et les haricots ont des noms assez semblables à ceux de l’Érèbe, et du Léthé, et qu’en général ils font un grand usage des légumes dans les évocations des morts et les repas funéraires?", "656": "Est-ce que, pour pouvoir garder la continence, il faut des corps purs et légers?", "657": "Or, les légumes sont venteux, et engendrent une surabondance d’humeurs qui demande de fréquentes évacuations.", "658": "Est-ce enfin que par les flatuosités qu’ils occasionnent, ils irritent les désirs?96.", "659": "Pourquoi enterrent-ils toutes vives les vestales qui se laissent corrompre?Comme ils sont dans l’usage de brûler les morts, croient-ils qu’il n’est pas juste de brûler celle qui n’a pas su garder religieusement le feu sacré?", "660": "Regardent-ils comme un sacrilège de faire périr un corps consacré par les cérémonies les plus augustes, et de porter des mains violentes sur une femme sacrée?", "661": "C’est pour cela qu’ils la laissent mourir, en la descendant sous terre, dans le domicile qu’ils lui ont préparé, et où l’on a mis une lampe, un pain, du lait et de l’eau, et qu’ensuite ils cachent soigneusement le caveau en le couvrant de terre.", "662": "Encore ne se croient-ils pas quittes de tout scrupule, et il est d’usage, même aujourd’hui, que les prêtres fassent les cérémonies funèbres sur le lieu où une vestale a été enterrée1.97.", "663": "Pourquoi, après les jeux équestres, qui se font aux ides de décembre2, celui des chevaux vainqueurs qui est àla droite du char est-il immolé à Mars, que celui qui lui a coupé la queue la porte à un lieu appelé Regia, où il répand du sang sur l’autel, et que deux bandes de citoyens, dont l’une vient par la rue Sacrée, et l’autre par la voie Suburra, se disputent à qui aura la tête de l’aninfal?", "664": "Est-ce, comme quelques uns le disent, pour punir le cheval d’avoir été l’instrument de la prise de Troie, parcequ’ils sont eux-mêmesEst-ce parceque le cheval est un animal hardi, belliqueux, digne, par conséquent, de Mars, et qu’on immole aux dieux ce qu’on sait leur être plus agréable3?", "665": "Le cheval vainqueur est immolé de préférence, parceque c’est à Mars qu’on attribue là victoire, ou plutôt, comme c’est ce dieu qui inspire le courage de tenir ferme dans son poste, et que les soldats qui gardent leur rang sont sûrs de vaincre ceux qui lâchent le pied, veulent-ilspunir la légèreté, compagne ordinaire de la fuite, et montrer, par cette action symbolique, qu’il n’y a point de salut pour les fuyards?98.", "666": "Pourquoi les censeurs, dès qu’ils sont entrés en charge, s’occupent-ils avant tout de donner à bail la nourriture des oies sacrées, et d’orner les statues des dieux?", "667": "Est-ce pour commencer par les objets qui exigent moins de dépense et de soins?", "668": "Est-ce par une ancienne reconnaissance pour ces animaux qui, lorsque Rome était au pouvoir des Gaulois, et qu’une nuit ces barbares étaient près d’escalader les murs du Capitole, sans que les chiens en fussent éveillés, entendirent le bruit des ennemis, et par leurs cris réveillèrent les gardes?", "669": "Ou les censeurs qui ont l’intendance des choses les plus importantes, et l’inspection de tout ce qui intéresse la religion, la police, les mœurs et la conduite des citoyens, donnentils leurs premiers soins à l’animal le plus vigilant, pour avertir qu’on doit veiller avec le plus grand soin au culte des dieux?", "670": "L’ornement des statues était un soin nécessaire, parceque le vermillon, dont on les avait anciennement peintes, s’etfaçait bientôt.99.", "671": "Pourquoi les prêtres condamnés à l’exil sont-ils privés de leur dignité et remplacés par d’autres, et que l’augure seul n’est jamais dépouillé du pontificat, de quelques crimes qu’il ait été convaincu?Veulent-ils que les secrets qui intéressent la religion ne soient pas connus par d’autres que par les prêtres?", "672": "et l’augure ayant juré de ne révéler à personne la science augurale, ils ne veulent pas, en lui ôtant sa dignité, le dégager de son serment.", "673": "Est-ce que la qualité d’augure n’est pas un nom de magistrature ou de dignité, mais dp science et d’art, et que défendre à un devin de prédire l’avenir, c’est vouloir qu’un médecin ou un musicien cessent de l’être?", "674": "On peut bien leur ôter leur dénomination, mais non pas leur science.", "675": "S’ils n’en créent pas une autre, c’est sans doute afin de ne pas augmenter le nombre des augurés établis dans l’origine1bulle?.100.", "676": "Pourquoi, aux ides d’août, tous les esclaves de l’un et de l’autre sexe célèbrent-ils une fête particulière, dans laquelle les femmes ont le plus grand spin de laver et de nettoyer leur tête?", "677": "Est-ce parceque Servius, qui était né à pareil jour, d’une mère captive, a voulu dans cette fêfe dispenser les esclaves de tout travail?", "678": "L’usage de se laver la tête à cette occasion a passé des esclaves aux femmes libres.101.", "679": "Pourquoi font-ils porter à leurs enfants un ornement qu’ils appellentEst-ce, comme bien d’autres usages, par honneur pour les premières femmes enlevées, qu’ils parent ainsi les enfants?", "680": "Est-ce pour honorer la valeur de Tarquin?", "681": "On raconte que dans un combat contre les Latins et les Étrusques, ce prince, encore à la fleur de l’âge, chargea les ennemis avec la plus grande vigueur;", "682": "qu’étant tombé de cheval, il soutint hardiment l’effort de ceux qui venaient fondre sur lui.", "683": "Les Romains, encouragés par son exemple, remportèrent une pleine victoire, et tuèrent seize mille ennemis.", "684": "Après la bataille, son père lui mit au cou une bulle d’or pour récompenser sa valeur.", "685": "Cet usage vient-il de ce que les anciens, qui ne rougissaient pas d’aimer leurs jeunes esclaves, comme l’attestent encore aujourd’hui les comédies, mais qui s’abstenaient avec grand soin des enfants de condition libre, pour éviter à cet égard toute méprise, faisaient porter à ces derniers cette marque distinctive de leur condition?", "686": "Etait-ce un moyen imaginé pour contenir les enfants et mettre un frein au libertinage, en leur faisant honte de mener une vie licencieuse avant que d’avoir quitté les marques de l’enfance?", "687": "On ne peut guère ajouter foi à l’opinion de Varron, qui prétend que le mot boulé, qui en grec signifie conseil, se rend en dialecte éolien par bolla, et qu’ainsi cet ornement est donné aux enfants comme un signe ou un présage de bon conseil.", "688": "Mais n’est-il pas plutôt relatif à la lune?", "689": "Cette planète, quand elle est dans son plein, n’a pas à nos yeux la figure d’un globe, mais celle d’une lentille ou d’un disque, et suivant Empédocle, sa substance même a réellement cette forme.102.", "690": "Pourquoi ne donnent-ils les noms à leurs fils que le neuvième jour après leur naissance, et à leurs filles, le huitième?", "691": "Est-ce par une raison prise de la nature qu’ils nomment plus tôt les filles?", "692": "Elles croissent’plus vite et acquièrent plus promptement leur perfection.", "693": "Mais ils attendent après le septième jour, parceque cette époque est périlleuse pour les enfants.", "694": "C’est le temps ou le cordon ombilical tombe au plus grand nombre, et jusque-là l’enfant ressemble plus à une plante qu’à un être vivant1.", "695": "Est-ce d’après les principes de Pythagore qu’ils ont adopté ce nombre de jours?", "696": "Ce philosophe donnait au nombre impair le nom de mâle, et au nombre pair celui de femelle.", "697": "Le premier, disait-il, est fécond, et dans la composition, il l’emporte sur le pair.", "698": "Lorsqu’on les divise en unités, le nombre pair laisse toujours un espace vide;", "699": "au lieu que l’impair a toujours comme un milieu qui remplit l’espace entre les membres divisés.", "700": "Cela vient-il de ce qu’entre tous les nombres, neuf est le premier carré formé de trois, qui est un nombre impair et parfait, et huit le premier cube formé de deux, nombre pair?", "701": "Or, il faut que le mari soit, comme ce carré, impair et parfait;", "702": "et la femme, telle que le cube, doit être fixe, attachée à la maison, et ne quitter que difficilement sa place.", "703": "On peut ajouter encore que, comme le nombre neuf est un carré qui a trois pour racine, et huit, un cube dont deux est la racine, ainsi les hommes avaient trois noms, et les femmes seulement deux1.103.", "704": "Pourquoi appellent-ils Spurii, les enfants dont le père est incertain?Ce n’est pas, comme les Grecs le croient et comme les orateurs le disent dans leurs plaidoyers, parceque plusieurs pères ont concouru à leur naissance.", "705": "Spurius est un prénom ordinaire aux Romains, comme Sextus, Decimus et Caius.", "706": "Ils n’écrivent pas en entier ces sortes de noms, mais tantôt par leur seule lettre initiale, comme ceux de Titus, Lucius et Marcus, tantôt par les deux premières, comme ceux de Tiberius et Cneius;", "707": "d’autres par les trois, comme ceux de Sextus et Servius.", "708": "Spurius est un de ceux qu’ils écrivent par les deux lettres initiales S et P. lis écrivent aussi par ces mêmes lettres le nom de bâtard;", "709": "et alors elles signifient sans père.", "710": "C’est donc l’usage d’écrire par les mêmes caractères le prénom Spurius, et le nom de bâtard, qui a donné lieu à l’erreur.", "711": "On en donne une autre raison que je rapporterai quoique peu vraisemblable.", "712": "Les Sabins appellent la matrice Spurium, et c’est par ignominie qu’ils donnent ce nom à ceux qui sont nés d’une union illégitime.104.", "713": "Pourquoi donnent-ils à Bacchus le surnom de liber pater, ou père libre?", "714": "Est-ce parcequ’il est pour les buveurs le père de la liberté?", "715": "Plusieurs même deviennent insolentsdans l’ivresse.", "716": "Est-ce parceque ce dieu introduisit l’usage des libations?", "717": "Ou ce nom, comme le veut Alexandre1, vient-il d’Éleuthère, ville de la Béotie, d’où Bacchus s’est appelé Eleutherius, ou libre2?105.", "718": "Pourquoi n’est-il pas d’usage que les filles se marient dans le temps des fêtes publiques, et que les veuves ont la liberté de le faire?", "719": "Est-ce, comme le prétend Yarron, parceque les filles sont tristes quand elles se marient, et que les veuves sont dans la joie, et qu’il ne faut, dans un jour de fête, rien faire avec tristesse ni comme par contrainte?", "720": "Est-ce qu’il est honorable pour les filles et honteux pour les veuves d’avoir beaucoup de témoins de leur mariage?", "721": "Car on doit desirer un premier mariage et en craindre un second, qui n’est pas honorable si le premier mari vit encore, et qui doit causer du chagrin s’il se fait après sa mort.", "722": "C’est pour cela que les veuves préfèrent des noces tranquilles aux cérémonies bruyantes qui les accompagnent ordinairement.", "723": "Or, les fêtes occupent tout le monde, et permettent à peu de personnes d’assister à des noces.", "724": "Senait-ce parceque l’enlèvement des Sabines, qu’ils firent un jour de fête, leur attira la guerre, et que depuis ils ont réputé de mauvais augure de marier leurs filles les jours de fête?106.", "725": "Pourquoi les Romains honorent-ils la fortune sous la dénomination de premier-née?(??) Est-ce, selon l’opinion commune, parceque Servius, qui était né d’une mère captive, fut élevé par la fortune sur le trône de Rome?", "726": "Est-ce parceque Rome elle-même dut son origine à la fortune, ou faut-il le rapporter à une cause naturelle et plus philosophique?", "727": "La fortune est le principe de tout, et la nature est composée de choses qui, rapprochées par la fortune, ont acquis ensuite de l’ordre et de l’arrangement.107.", "728": "Pourquoi donnent-ils le nom d’histrions aux por médiens consacrés à Bacchus?", "729": "L’historien Cluvius Rufus raconte que, dans les premiers temps de la république, sous le consulat de C. Sulpicius et de Lie.", "730": "Stolon, la peste fit périr tous les cornédiens, sans en excepter un seul.", "731": "On en fit venir d’Étrurie plusieurs fort habiles.", "732": "Le plus célèbre d’entre

entre les proches est-il défendu?", "735": "Est-ce pour étendre les parentés et multiplier les alliacés, en prenant des femmes dans des familles étrangères?", "736": "Craignent-ils les discordes que ces mariages pourraient faire naître entre lès parents, et qui altéreraient la tendresse naturelle du sang?", "737": "Ont-ils voulu que les femmes, qui par leur faiblesse ont besoin de plusieurs défenseurs si elles venaient à être maltraitées par leurs maris, pussent trouver dans leurs proches une ressource nécessaire?109.", "738": "Pourquoi le prêtre de Jupiter, qu’ils appellent flamen dialis, ne peut-il toucher ni farine ni levain?", "739": "Est-ce parceque la farine est un aliment imparfait et indigeste?", "740": "Elle a perdu la nature du blé, et n’a pas acquis celle du pain.", "741": "Elle n’est plus une semence, et n’est pas encore une nourriture.", "742": "Aussi le poète1 l’appelle-l-il métaphoriquement muléphaton, c’est-à-dire un blé qui a péri sous la meule.", "743": "Le levain formé d’une pâte fermentée fait aigrir la farine, la rend plus molle et moins serrée.", "744": "En général, tout ce qui fermente produit une espèce de corruption;", "745": "et si le levain est trop àbondant, il gâte et perd la farine.110.", "746": "Pourquoi ce même prêtre ne peut-il pas toucher de la viande crue?", "747": "Est-ce pour lui inspirer, par cette défense, la plus grande aversion pour l’usage de la viande crue?", "748": "Est-ce par la même raison que nous venons de donner pour la farine?", "749": "La viande crue n’est plus un animal, et n’est pas encore une nourriture.", "750": "En la faisant bouillir ou rôtir, on change ses qualités naturelles, et on lui donne une autre forme.", "751": "Quand elle est crue elle est désagréable, dégoûtante, et ressemble à une chair corrompue et couverte d’ulcères.111.", "752": "Pourquoi lui a-t-on aussi défendu de toucher un chien ou une chèvre, et même d’en prononcer le nom?Ont-ils la chèvre en horreur, comme un animal lascif et puant?", "753": "ou parcequ’il est, de tous les animaux, le plus sujet à l’épilepsie, craignent-ils que le mal ne se communique à ceux qui auraient mangé d’une chèvre qui en serait atteinte, ou même qui l’aurait touchée?", "754": "Ils croient que ce qui la rend sujette à cette maladie, c’est la petitesse de ses vaisseaux pneumatiques, qui font que sa respiration est souvent interceptée.", "755": "Ils fondent cette conjecture sur la faiblesse de son cri.", "756": "En effet, les hommes attaqués de l’épilepsie ont une voix faible et qui approche du bêlement.", "757": "Le chien est moins lascif, et ne sent pas si mauvais.", "758": "Cependant quelques personnes prétendent qu’on n’en souffre aucun dans la citadelle d’Athènes ni dans File de Délos, parcequ’ils s’accouplent publiquement;", "759": "comme si les bœufs, les porcs et les chevaux ne faisaient pas de même.", "760": "Aussi n’en est-ce point la véritable cause.", "761": "Comme le chien est un animal querelleur, on le bannit des enceintes où l’on offre les sacrifices, et des lieux d’asile, afin que les suppliants y puissent trouver uiwefuge assuré.", "762": "Il est donc vraisemblable qu’on a voulu que le prêtre de Jupiter, qui est pour ainsi dire une statue vivante et un autel de refuge, laissât à tous les suppliants un accès facile auprès de sa personne, sans que rien pût les en écarter et leur inspirer de la terreur.", "763": "Aussi avait-il son lit dans le vestibule de sa maison, et celui qui tombait à ses genoux était, ce jour-là, exempt de toute punition.", "764": "S’il arrivait chargé de chaînes, on le déliait, et on jetait les feçs hors de la maison, non par la porte, mais par-dessus le toit.", "765": "Il n’aurait servi de rien aux suppliants que le prêtre se montrât si doux et si humain s’il avait eu auprès de lui un chien qui les eût éloignés en les effrayant par ses cris.", "766": "D’ailleurs, les anciens ne croyaient pas cet animal absolument pur.", "767": "Ils ne le sacrifiaient à aucun des dieux célestes;", "768": "et celui qu’ils plaçaient dans un carrefour pour servir de nourriture à la terrestre Hécate, y tenait lieu de ces victimes d’expiation

apparu.", "1827": "Leé uns attribuent au dieu Lare, d’autres à Yulcain, cet amour qui donna naissance à Servius.", "1828": "On ajoute que ce prince étant encore au berceau, sa tête fut tout à coup

vaste et aussi puissant que celui de Rome, n’a pu être l’ouvrage de la valeur et de la prudence humaine, et que le cours des événements qui l’ont portée à ce haut point de grandeur a été l’effet de

réunissant, écraser l’Italie.", "1856": "C’est lui qui, lorsque Philippe fut attaqué, suscita tant d’affaires à Antiochus, qu’il ne put marcher à son secours, et qui avait déjà fait tomber Philippe2

Capitole la nouvelle du décret de l’armée, et qui pour cela ne craignit point de s’exposer au plus grand péril.", "1868": "Il ne pouvait aller qu’à travers le camp des ennemis, dont les corps de garde

confirmatif de l’élection, il retourne vers Camille parle même chemin.", "1872": "Le lendemain, un des Barbares, qui se promenait par hasard en cet endroit, aperçut les traces que Pontius avait imprimées sur la terre, en se glissant sur la pointe des pieds.", "1873": "Il remarqua aussi que les herbes qui se trouvaient entre les rochers avaient été foulées, et portaient l’empreinte des efforts que Pontius avait faits en se traînant dans ces sentiers obliques.", "1874": "Il fait part de cette découverte à ses compagnons, qui voyant que les ennemis leur montrent eux-mêmes le chemin du

citoyens du danger qui les menaçait.", "1878": "On nourrissait, auprès du temple de Junon, des oies destinées au service de la déesse.", "1879": "Cet animal est naturellement inquiet, et prend l’alarme au moindre bruit.", "1880": "L’extrémité pressante où l’on se trouvait réduit dans le Capitole faisait un peu négliger leur nourriture, et la faim rendait encore leur sommeil plus léger.",

de leurs armes, elles poussèrent des cris plus forts et plus perçants.", "1883": "Les Romains, réveillés par ce bruit, et se doutant de ce qui en était la cause, courent aux murailles, repoussent les Gaulois, et les font rouler le long des précipices.", "1884": "Encore aujourd’hui, dans la fête instituée en mémoire de cet événement, on promène en pompe un chien mis en croix, et une oie richement parée, portée sur une litière.", "1885": "Ce spectacle montre le pouvoir de la Fortune, et la facilité de ses ressources dans les situations les plus périlleuses.", "1886": "Pour parvenir à ses fins, elle donne de l’intelligence aux êtres le plus dépourvus de sens et de raison;", "1887": "elle inspire de la force et du courage aux plus timides.", "1888": "Qui ne serait frappé du plus juste étonnement, lorsque comparant en lui-même l’état déplorable où Rome était alors réduite, avec sa prospérité présente, considérant la richesse et l’éclat des dons qu’on lui apporte de toutes parts, les merveilles des arts qui se disputent la gloire de l’orner, l’émulation des villes à l’embellir par leurs présents, les couronnes que les rois lui envoient, les prémices de ce que produisent de plus curieux la terre, les mers, les îles, les continents, les fleuves, les arbres, les animaux, les plaines, les montagnes et les mines, qui tous concourent à l’envi à relever, par des beautés de tout genre, la splendeur de cette ville;", "1889": "lors, dis-je, que, faisant en luimême cette comparaison, il pense à combien peu il a tenu que rien de tout cela n’existât? qu’au moment où Rome allait être la proie des flammes, ensevelie pour jamais dans des ténèbres profondes, et détruite sans ressource par le fer d’un ennemi barbare qui ne respirait que sang et que carnage, de vils et timides animaux furent la cause de son salut?", "1890": "que ces guerriers célèbres par tant d’exploits, les Manlius, les Servius, les Posthumius, les Papyrius, qui furent les tiges des familles les plus illustres, allaient être cruellement massacrés, si les cris de quelques oies ne les eussent appelés à la défense de leurs dieux et de leur patrie?", "1891": "Que s’il est vrai, comme Polybe le raconte dans le second livre de son histoire, que les Gaulois qui s’étaient emparés de Rome, sur la nouvelle que des Barbares voisins avaient fait une irruption dans leur pays1, où ils mettaient tout à feu et sang, firent la paix avec Camille et abandonnèrent l’Italie, peut-on douter alors que ce ne soit la Fortune qui ait sauvé Rome, en appelant ailleurs les ennemis, ou plutôt en les éloignant de cette ville, contre toute attente?", "1892": "Mais ne nous arrêtons pas à des circonstances qui sont trop incertaines, et sur lesquelles on ne saurait rien décider, puisqu’au rapport de Tite-Live, les monuments historiques de ces temps-là ont péri, ou sont dans la plus étrange confusion2.", "1893": "Les événements postérieurs mieux connus et plus certains, prouvent évidemment la protection de la Fortune sur Rome.Je mets au nombre des bienfaits de cette déesse la mort d’Alexandre, ce prince si renommé par les plus grands exploits et les succès les plus heureux, par un courage et une confiance supérieure à tous les dangers, qui, comme un astre brillant, se portait avec rapidité de l’aurore au couchant, et tournait déjà vers l’Italie l’éclat menaçant de ses armes.", "1894": "Il avait un prétexte pour la guerre, dans la mort d’Alexandre, roi des Molosses, que les Bruttiens et les Lucaniens avaient tué proche de Pandose1.", "1895": "Mais au fond, son véritable motif était cet amour pour la gloire qui le portail à attaquer tous les peuples;", "1896": "cette soif de commander qui lui faisait desirer de pousser ses conquêtes plus loin que celles de Bacchus et d’Hercule.", "1897": "Il savait que la force et la puissance romaine étaient comme le boulevard de toute l’Italie.", "1898": "La renommée lui avait fait connaître les Romains comme des athlètes couverts de gloire, et

pied des armées de cent trente mille hommes au moins, tous braves, tous aguerris, tousPlutarque, dans ce traité, se propose de prouver qu’Alexandre n’a point dû ses succès à la Fortune.", "1900": "Il montre Alexandre luttant contre les obstacles et les dangers, et triomphant de tout par sa patience et son courage.", "1901": "Il Tait tenir par ce héros à la Fortune un discours dans lequel il raconte lui-même tous les périls qu’il a courus dans les diverses entreprises que l’amour de la gloire lui avait inspirées, les blessures sans nombre qu’il y a reçues, et qui souvent avaient mis ses jours dans le plus grand danger.", "1902": "Plutarque peint ensuite les difficultés qu’Alexandre eut à vaincre, et met en contraste les vastes projets qu’il avait conçus avec le peu de ressources que la Fortune lui laissait pour les exécuter.", "1903": "Mais ses grandes qualités suppléèrent à ce qui lui manquait.", "1904": "Sa grandeur d’ame, sa prudence et son courage furent les ressources inépuisables dont la philosophie l’avait pourvu pour l’expédition importante qu’il méditait.", "1905": "Alexandre porta le flambeau de la philosophie chez les peuples les plus barbares, et leur fit adopter les mœurs et les coutumes des Grecs.", "1906": "Il civilisa les nations les plus sauvages;", "1907": "il les rendit heureuses;", "1908": "et s’il eut le dessein de conquérir l’univers entier, ce fut uniquement pour faire le bonheur du genre humain, en réunissant tous les hommes sous les mêmes lois, en ne leur donnant à tous qu’une même patrie, et leur apprenant à se regarder comme les membres d’une même famille.La Fortune prétend donc qu’Alexandre lui doit tout.", "1909": "Je vais combattre cette prétention et prendre le parti de la philosophie, ou plutôt d’Alexandre lui-même, qui

d’apparence que les premiers philosophes qui ont réfléchi sur la nature du Dieu qu’on y adore;", "2762": "ont attribué à ce mot EI une signification particulière et importante, ou l’ont voulu

de ce temple n’est pas moins philosophe que prophète, nous approuvâmes tous Ammonius d’avoir expliqué sous ce double rapport les divers noms φι’οη lui donne.", "2769": "Ainsi, disait-il, on l’appelle

recherches, d’admirer, de douter, il est naturel, ajoutait Ammonius, que la plupart des choses qui regardent ce dieu soient enveloppées d’énigmes qui aient besoin d’explication, et dont il faille développer les motifs et les causes.", "2773": "Par exemple, pourquoi de tous les bois, le sapin est-il le seul qu’on emploie à Delphes pour l’entretien du feu perpétuel?", "2774": "Pourquoi ne brûle-t-on que du laurier dans les sacrifices, et n’a-t-on mis dans le temple que les statues de deux parques, tandis que partout ailleurs on en trouve trois?", "2775": "Pour quelle raison n’est-il

indignés de cette usurpation, mais ne voulant pas confondre ouvertement leur arrogânce, ni se faire, pour un titre d’honneur, des ennemis dangereux de ces hommes puissants, ils se rendirent à

il reste un nombre milieu, principe de multiplication1;", "2868": "aussi èst-il plus fécond que le nombre pair.", "2869": "Quand il lui est uni, il conserve toutes ses propriétés, et il ne peut jamais les perdre.", "2870": "Cela est si vrai, que le pair joint à l’impair, au lieu de produire le pair, ne produit jamais que l’impair.", "2871": "La combinaison de ces deux nombres en fait connaître la différence.", "2872": "Le pair joint au pair ne produit jamais l’impair.", "2873": "Sa propriété est invariable;", "2874": "il n’a pas la puissance de produire un nombre différent;", "2875": "au lieu

différences des nombres.", "2877": "J’ai déjà dit que la ressemblance du premier nombre pair avec la femme, et du premier impair avec l’homme, avait fait donner au nombre cinq, par les disciples de Pythagore, le nom de mariage.On lui donne aussi le nom de nature, parcequ’en le multipliant par lui-même, on a pour dernier terme un nombre cinq1.", "2878": "Comme la nature qui reçoit du froment pour semence, après l’avoir multiplié et lui avoir fait subir plusieurs transformations nécessaires à la perfection de son œuvre, le ramène enfin à sa première substance et reproduit du froment, de même tandis que les autres nombres, multipliés par eux-mêmes, donnent dans leur multiplication des nombres différents, les nombres cinq et six sont les seuls dont les carrés se terminent au nombre de leur racine;", "2879": "car le carré de six est trente-six comme celui de cinq est vingt-cinq, avec cette différence cependant que le nombre six n’a la propriété de se reproduire dans son carré qu’une seule fois et d’une seule manière;", "2880": "au lieu que le nombre cinq, outre la propriété de se reproduire lui-même par la multiplication, a de plus cette faculté particulière, que doublé, ou il produit une dizaine, ou il se reproduit lui-même alternativement, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à l’infini2, en quoi il est l’image de cette cause éternelle qui régit l’univers.", "2881": "En effet, comme cette cause, toujours subsistante, produit le monde, et que par le monde elle se perfectionne elle-même, car, dit Héraclite, toutes les substances se changent en feu, et le feu en toutes les autres substances (comme d’un lingot d’or on fait de la monnaie, et de la monnaie un lingot d’or);", "2882": "ainsi le nombre cinq joint avec lui-même ne peut rien produire d’imparfait ou d’hétérogène, et ses changements sont tellement déterminés, qu’il ne peut que se reproduire lui-même, ou une dizaine, c’est-à-dire un nombre de son espèce, ou un nombre parfait.Maintenant, si quelqu’un me demande quel rapport tout cela peut avoir avec Apollon, je répondrai que ce dieu n’est pas le seul à qui on puisse l’appliquer, et que cela convient également à Bacchus, qui n’a pas moins de droit qu’Apollon sur l’oracle de Delphes1.", "2883": "J’ai entendu des théologiens prononcer dans leurs discours, ou chanter dans leurs vers, que Dieu, incorruptible et éternel de sa nature, subit, par la loi d’une

pour accompagner le cortége de Bacchus.", "2897": "Mais ils chantent pour Apollon le péan, genre de poésie modeste et réglée.", "2898": "Ils peignent ce dieu dans la fleur d’une jeunesse immortelle,

et pétulants, le désordre et la fureur.", "2901": "Ils invoquent sous le nom d’Evius, ce dieu qui agite les bacchantes, et ils lui rendent des honneurs insensés.", "2902": "Cette différence de culte pour ces deux divinités a un rapport naturel aux divers changements de ce principe universel du mondeMais comme la durée de ces révolutions périodiques n’est pas la même;", "2903": "que l’une, qu’ils appellent satiété, est plus longue que celle qu’ils nomment indigence, afin de suivre cette proportion, ils chantent le péan dans leurs sacrifices pendant les trois premières saisons de l’année;",

circonstance.", "2907": "Ce qu’il y adu moins de certain, c’est que ces théologiens attribuent à ce dieu le nombre cinq, qui tantôt se reproduit lui-même comme le feu, et tantôt forme le nombre dix comme le monde1.", "2908": "Mais la musique que nous savons être si agréable à ce dieu, croirons-nous quelle n’a point de rapport avec le nombre cinq?", "2909": "La science de l’harmonie consiste, comme on sait, à former des accords justes.", "2910": "Or, les accords ne sont et ne peuvent être qu’au nombre de cinq, comme le montre la raison, et que l’expérience le confirme à quiconque en voudra faire l’épreuve sur des cordes tendues ou sur les trous de la flûte, et s’en rapporter au jugement seul de l’oreille sans faire usage de la raison.", "2911": "Ces accords se forment tous suivant les proportions des nombres.", "2912": "Celle de la quarte est sesqui-tierce;", "2913": "celle de la quinte, sesquialtère;", "2914": "celle de l’octave, double;", "2915": "celle de la quinte par-dessus

"Des quatre principes élémentaires qui composent et composeront à jamais les corps naturels, et qui sont le feu, l’air, la terre et l’eau, l’air étant le seul qui s’approche de l’airain et qui s’y

comique1.", "3121": "Peut-être desirez-vous savoir en vertu de quelle propriété naturelle lecontact de l’air a pu donner à l’airain cette couleur?", "3122": "— Assurément, répliqua Diogénianus.",

étranger, et j’en imagine une autre cause.", "3127": "Comme l’huile est une substance pure, subtile et transparente, quand on la met sur l’airain, la rouille brille à travers, au lieu que les autres liquides, naturellement plus denses, l’empêchent de pa raître.", "3128": "— Fort bien, mon ami, lui dit Théon.", "3129": "Mais voulezvous savoir une autre raison qu’en donne Aristote?", "3130": "— Je le veux bien, répliqua Diogénianus.", "3131": "— Ce philosophe prétend que les autres liquides appliqués sur la rouille, la détachent peu à peu et la dissipent, parcequ’ils ont des parties inégales et plus rares;", "3132": "au lieu que l’huile, par sa densité, l’épaissit et la fixe.", "3133": "Si nous pouvions supposer ici quelque chose de semblable, nous ne manquerions pas de solution à la

rouille qu’on y voit, et à laquelle un air dense donne de la consistance.", "3143": "— Mais, mon ami, reprit Théon, qui empêche que le même air soit dense et rare, ainsi que les étoffes de soie et de lin dont Homère a dit :", "3144": "Il montre par là que la finesse de leur tissu ne donnait point de passage à l’huile, et que la trame en était si serrée, que ce liquide s’écoulait par-dessus.", "3145": "Or, ce n’est pas seulement pour expliquer comment l’air fait sortir la rouille de l’airain qu’on peut av(??)r recours à sa ténuité, mais encore pour prouver que cette qualité de l’air rend

expliquer les oracles.", "3147": "On en lut un en vers qui regardait, si je ne me trompe, le règne d’Égon l’Argien1 Sur cela Diogénianus dit qu’il avait été toujours fort étonné que les vers des oracles fussent si mauvais, tandis qu’ils étaient inspirés par Apollon, et que ce dieu est le chef des Muses, qu’il préside à la poésie et à l’éloquence, aussi bien qu’au chant et à l’harmonie, et

les ornements et les énigmes dont elle les couvrait.", "3456": "Le motif de ces plaintes était moins la difficulté d’entrevoir la vérité des oracles sous l’ombre qui la cachait, que de faire disparaître leur ambiguïté, et tous ces dehors mystérieux et énigmatiques, dont on ne les enveloppait que pour justifier les événements contraires à ceux que la prédiction avait annoncés.", "3457":

attention.", "3540": "Ne vouloir pas que les petites choses servent de preuves aux grandes, ce serait, mon cher Démétrius, porter préjudice à bien des arts, et leur ôter leurs démonstrations ou leurs conjectures.", "3541": "Vous-même, ne prouvez-vous pas un point assez important, c’est-à-dire que les anciens héros avaient coutume de se raser, parceque Homère fait mention du rasoir?", "3542": "Ne concluez-vous pas qu’ils plaçaient leur argent à intérêt de ce qu’il dit ailleurs :", "3543": "Vous entendez cet accroissement de l’intérêt annuel :", "3544": "vous saisissez avidement l’épithète d’aiguë que le même poète donne à la nuit, pour en inférer que la terre étant sphérique, son ombre se termine en cône.", "3545": "Tout homme equi ne voudra pas qu’on juge des grandes choses par les petites, passera-t-il aux médecins de conjecturer qu’il y aura l’été des maladies contagieuses quand il y a beau- coup d’araignées, et qu’au printemps les feuilles de figuier ont la forme du pied de la corneille?", "3546": "Souffrira-t-il qu’on juge de la grandeur du disque du soleil par une mesure d’eau déterminée1, ou qu’un instrument d’une forme très simple marque la hauteur de celui des deux pôles qui est toujours visible sur notre horizon?", "3547": "car voilà ce que nous disaient les prêtres d’Ammon.", "3548": "Il faut donc avoir recours à d’autres raisonnements pour leur prouver que le soleil, comme nous l’avons cru de tout temps, conserve invariablement la route qui lui a été prescrite.", "3549": "»Le philosophe Ammonius1, qui était présent à cette conversation, prit la parole.", "3550": "« Ce n’est pas seulement le soleil, s’écria-t-il, mais tout le ciel;", "3551": "car il faudra nécessairement dans ce système que la route du soleil d’un tropique à l’autre soit rétrécie;", "3552": "qu’il ne parcoure plus une aussi grande portion du cercle de l’horizon que le disent les mathématiciens, et que cette portion diminue de plus en plus par la contraction des cercles méridionaux vers le septentrion;", "3553": "que par conséquent notre été devienne plus court, et la température de l’air plus froide, puisque le soleil se replierait toujours au dedans de l’espace qu’il parcourt, et décrirait, aux signes des tropiques, de plus grands parallèles.", "3554": "Il s’ensuivra encore que les cadrans dressés à Syène ne seront plus sans ombre au solstice d’été2;", "3555": "que l’espace entre les tropiques étant rétréci, plusieurs étoiles fixes seront obligées de se réfugier sous l’horizon, et d’autres de le heurter et de se confondre.", "3556": "Diront-ils que les autres astres conservant toujours le même mouvement, le soleil seul éprouve dans le sien de la variation?", "3557": "Mais ils ne pourront assigner aucune cause de cette accélération de mouvement pour le soleil tout seul, entre un si grand nombre d’étoiles.", "3558": "D’ailleurs ils troubleront la plupart des phénomènes célestes, et surtout ceux de la lune par rapport au soleil.", "3559": "Nous n’aurions donc nul besoin de leurs mesures d’huile pour ob server cette différence d’années si elle avait lieu.", "3560": "Les éclipses de la lune, qui se trouve assez souvent dans la projection de l’ombre de la terre, et celles du soleil, lorsqu’il est en conjonction avec la lune, suffiraient pour le prouver.", "3561": "La fausseté de cette opinion est évidente, et ne mérite pas d’être discutée plus longtemps.« — Mais, dit Cléombrote, j’ai vu moi-même ces différentes mesures d’huile.", "3562": "Les prêtres m’en ont montré plusieurs, et la mesure de l’année présente était beaucoup plus petite que celle des années antérieures.« — Eh quoi!", "3563": "reprit Ammonius, cette observation a-t-elle donc échappé à tant d’autres peuples chez qui l’on adore et l’on conserve des feux perpétuels depuis un espace de temps presque infini?", "3564": "Ou si l’on veut absolument admettre la vérité de cette diminution annuelle, n’est-il pas plus naturel de l’attribuer au refroidissement et à l’humidité de l’air, ou même à une cause toute contraire, je veux dire à sa chaleur et à sa sécheresse, qui, rendant le feu moins actif, font qu’il a moins besoin d’aliment, et qu’il ne consomme pas autant d’huile?", "3565": "Je me souviens d’avoir entendu dire à des physiciens que l’air en hiver a plus de ressort et favorise davantage la combustion;", "3566": "qu’au contraire, dans les temps de chaleur, l’air plus raréfié rend le feu moins actif;", "3567": "qu’allumé aux rayons du soleil, il a moins d’activité, prend plus mollement aux matières combustibles, et les consume plus lentement.«", "3568": "Je crois qu’il faut attribuer à la qualité de l’huile la cause de cet effet.", "3569": "Il est probable que l’huile qu’on extrait du fruit de jeunes oliviers contient plus de parties aqueuses, et qu’elle est moins propre à brûler que celle des vieux oliviers, dont la sève plus élaborée a plus de consistance, et donne une huile plus parfaite, plus propre à fournir à la lumière un aliment de plus longue durée.", "3570": "Les prêtres d’Ammon ne devaient pas expliquer autre ment un phénomène qui d’ailleurs paraît fort extraordinaire et presque incroyable.", "3571": "»Dès qu’Ammonius eut cessé de parler, je pris la parole et je dis à Cléombrote :", "3572": "Pourquoi ne nous parlez-vous pas plutôt de l’oracle qui a eu autrefois une si grande réputation par le dieu dont il était l’organe, mais dont aujourd’hui la gloire paraît bien flétrie1?", "3573": "Cléombrote baissa les yeux et garda le silence.", "3574": "« Il ne faut point, dit alors Démétrius, s’occuper de cet oracle, et rechercher les causes du mépris dans lequel il est tombé.", "3575": "Ne voyons-nous pas les nôtres tellement négligés, qu’a l’exception de deux ou trois, tous les autres sont abandonnés et ne donnent plus de réponse?", "3576": "Il faut plutôt chercher la cause de leur silence;", "3577": "car, sans parler des autres pays, la Béotie, qui autrefois retentissait de la voix de tant d’oracles, en est aujourd’hui si dépourvue, qu’il semble qu’un vent brûlant ait soufflé sur toute la contrée et y ait tari toutes les sources de la divination.", "3578": "La seule où l’on puisse encore puiser est celle de Lébadie2.", "3579": "Tous les autres oracles, ou gardent le silence, ou sont réduits à la plus affreuse solitude.", "3580": "»Dans le temps de la guerre médique, l’oracle d’Apollon Ptoüs et celui d’Amphiaraüs étaient également célèbres, et la véracité de l’un et de l’autre fut reconnue.", "3581": "Le prophète de l’oracle d’Apollon, qui parlait ordinairement en langue éolienne3, répondit aux Barbares en une langue qu’aucun des ministres présents ne put comprendre.", "3582": "Sans doute le dieu voulait signifier par là que les Barbares n’ont aucune part à l’enthousiasme prophétique, et que la langue grecque n’est point faite pour se prêter à leurs demandes.", "3583": "L’esclave qu’on avait envoyé vers l’oracle d’Amphiaraüs crut voir en songe le prêtre,

à rester, le prêtre le frappa rudement à la tête d’une grosse pierre.", "3586": "C’étaient des prédictions symboliques de ce qui devait arriver.", "3587": "Mardonius, battu non par un roi, mais par le tuteur et le lieutenant du roi de Sparte1, qui commandait les Grecs, fut tué dans le combat d’un coup de pierre, comme l’esclave lydien avait cru en songe être frappé d’une pierre.« Tégyre, où l’on

un oracle qui leur ordonnait de chercher le lieu de la naissance d’Apollon, et d’y faire des sacrifices.", "3592": "Comme ils témoignèrent leur surprise d’une réponse qui leur faisait douter si ce dieu n’était pas né ailleurs qu’à Délos, la prêtresse ajouta qu’une corneille leur indiquerait l’endroit.", "3593": "Ils s’en allèrent, et arrivés à Chéronée, ils entendirent une cabaretière qui parlait avec des étrangers, de l’oracle de Tégyre qu’ils allaient consulter.", "3594": "Ces étrangers, en prenant congé d’elle, l’appelèrent du nom de corneille, qui était en effet le sien.", "3595":

plus récentes de la véracité de ces oracles.", "3597": "Et puisque aujourd’hui ils ont entièrement cessé, il est assez convenable que nous trouvant dans le temple d’Apollon Pythien, nous recherchions les causes de cette révolution.", "3598": "»Pendant cet entretien nous nous étions avancés du temple vers la porte de la salle où les Cnidiens avaient coutume de s’assembler.", "3599": "Nous y entrons.", "3600": "Les amis que nous allions joindre nous avaient prévenus, et s’étaient assis pour nous attendre.", "3601": "Tous les autres se tinrent tranquilles, parceque c’était l’heure du bain,

s’irriter, et dont l’humeur n’est rien moins que douce, quoique, selon Pindare, il dût être plein de bonté pour les hommes.", "3620": "Soit que nous le regardions comme le soleil même, ou comme le père et le souverain de cet astre, infiniment élevé au-dessus de ce monde visible, il n’est pas vraisemblable qu’il ne daigne plus parler aux hommes, lui qui est le principe de leur naissance, de leur nourriture, de leur vie et de leur intelligence.", "3621": "Peut-on croire aussi que la providence divine, qui, comme une mère tendre et bienfaisante, produit et conserve toutes choses pour notre usage, ne montre que dans la divination seule du ressentiment des outrages quelle reçoit de nous, et qu’après nous en avoir fait don dès l’origine du monde, elle nous la retire aujourd’hui, comme si

conséquence de nier que Dieu soit l’auteur du silence des oracles :", "3628": "dire qu’ils ont cessé par toute autre cause que la volonté divine, c’est faire soupçonner que Dieu ne les a pas introduits dans le monde, et qu’ils ont une autre origine.", "3629": "Car il n’est point de puissance supérieure à celle de Dieu qui puisse abolir la divination, si elle est réellement son ouvrage.", "3630": "Aussi ce que j’ai surtout désapprouvé dans le raisonnement de Planétiade, c’est l’inconstance qu’il attribuait à Dieu, qui, selon lui, tantôt favorisait la perversité des hommes, et tantôt lui était contraire.", "3631": "Il faisait de la divinité un roi ou un tyran qui, fermant une porte aux méchants, leur en ouvre une autre, et répond à leurs demandes.«", "3632": "Mais comme rien ne doit paraître plus digne des dieux que de ne mettre en œuvre que des moyens suffisants, sans jamais en employer d’inutiles ou de superflus, on peut prendre ce principe pour règle de leur conduite.", "3633": "Or, la dépopulation qu’ont causée dans toutes les parties de l’univers les séditions et les guerres précédentes, s’étant fait principalement sentir dans la Grèce, au point qu’elle pourrait à peine mettre sur pied trois mille hommes d’infanterie, tandis que la seule ville de Mégare en envoya un pareil nombre à la bataille de Platée, à quoi aurait servi de laisser subsister un si grand nombre d’oracles, qu’à rendre plus sensible la solitude de la Grèce?", "3634": "Dieu aurait sûrement en cela fourni matière à plus d’une inculpation.", "3635": "De quelle utilité seraient aujourd’hui les oracles de Tégyre et de Ptoüs, où l’on trouve à peine dans tout un jour un berger qui garde ses troupeaux?«", "3636": "Cet oracle même de Delphes, le plus ancien et le plus célèbre de tous, fut longtemps réduit à une vaste solitude par un affreux dragon, qui le rendait, dit-on, inaccessi ble, quoiqu’à dire vrai, je crois que dans cette occasion on prend l’effet pour la cause.", "3637": "Ce fut vraisemblablement la solitude du lieu qui attira ce monstre, plutôt qu’il ne causa lui-même cette solitude.", "3638": "Lorsque, par la faveur du dieu, la Grèce eut rétabli plusieurs de ses villes, et que le pays se fut repeuplé, l’oracle eut deux prophétesses qui montaient tour à tour sur le trépied, et une troisième désignée, qui leur servait comme d’assistante.", "3639": "Il n’y a plus aujourd’hui qu’une seule prophétesse, et l’on ne s’en plaint pas, car elle suffit aux besoins du pays.", "3640": "Il ne faut donc pas accuser Apollon.", "3641": "Ce qui reste ici de divination est suffisant pour ceux qui viennent consulter l’oracle, et personne ne s’en retourne mécontent.", "3642": "Agamemnon, avec neuf hérauts, avait de la peine à contenir l’assemblée des Grecs, tant elle était nombreuse.", "3643": "Au contraire, vous verrez ici, dans peu de jours, que, sur ce théâtre, une seule voix se fait entendre facilement de tous les spectateurs.", "3644": "De même la divination employa plusieurs organes, lorsque la population était plus nombreuse.", "3645": "Mais aujourd’hui, il faudrait s’étonner, si Dieu prodiguait inutilement ses oracles, et les laissait ou s’écouler comme l’eau, ou se perdre dans les airs, comme ces échos qui, dans les lieux solitaires, répètent les cris des bergers et des troupeaux.", "3646": "»Après qu’Ammonius eut parlé, Cléombrote, voyant que je gardais le silence, m’adressa la parole, et me dit :", "3647": "« Estce que vous êtes convenu que Dieu a lui-même établi et aboli les oracles et la divination?", "3648": "» Point du tout, lui répondis-je;", "3649": "j’assure au contraire que Dieu n’a aboli ni l’un ni l’autre.", "3650": "Il est vrai que les dieux nous ont donné pour notre utilité bien des choses qui sont sujettes au changement et que la matière dont elles sont composées passe par différents états;", "3651": "leur origine ne les garantit pas de la dissolution.", "3652": "Je crois que la divination est sujette aux mêmes vicissitudes.", "3653": "La bonté divine a fait aux hommes des dons précieux, mais elle ne leur a rien donné d’éternel.", "3654": "Les dieux seuls sont immortels, a dit Sophocle, leurs ouvrages ne le sont pas.", "3655": "Il faut laisser à ceux qui connaissent la nature des choses, et les qualités de la matière, le soin de chercher quelle est la vertu et la puissance des oracles, de manière cependant que Dieu en soit toujours le principe.", "3656": "Il serait insensé et même ridicule d’imaginer que dieu, semblable aux ventriloques qu’on appelait autrefois euryclées, et qu’on nomme aujourd’hui pythons1, entre dans le corps des prophètes, et qu’il se serve de leurs organes, pour faire entendre ses réponses.«", "3657": "Vous avez raison, me dit Cléombrote;", "3658": "mais comme il est difficile de comprendre et de déterminer jnsqu’à quel point et dans quels effets il faut faire intervenir la providence divine, les uns ne lui en attribuent aucun, les autres les mettent tous sur son compte, et tous s’éloignent également du juste milieu, le seul point convenable.", "3659": "Il est plus sensé de dire, avec quelques autres, que comme Platon, en imaginant un élément qui est le sujet jourd’hui la matière et la nature, a délivré les philosodes qualités propres aux substances, et qu’on appelle auphes d’un grand nombre de difficultés considérables;", "3660": "de même, selon moi, ceux qui ont supposé des êtres intermédiaires entre les dieux et les hommes, et ont trouvé le nœud qui nous lie avec eux, ont levé un bien plus grand nombre de difficultés épineuses, soit que cette doctrine vienne de Zoroastre2 et des mages, soit qu’elle tire son origine de la Thrace et d’Orphée, de l’Egypte et de la Phrygie, comme le font conjecturer les sacrifices et les rites qui sont en usage dans ces deux pays, où des cérémonies lugubres et funèbres se trouvent mêlées avec celles qu’on pratique pour les dieux célestes.", "3661": "Parmi les Grecs, Homère emploie indifféremment les noms de dieux et de génies, et appelle quelquefois les premiers, des démons.« Hésiode est le premier qui ait distingué d’une manière précise quatre espèces d’êtres intelligents;", "3662": "les dieux, les démons, qu’il suppose nombreux et bienfaisants, ensuite les héros, au nombre desquels il place les demidieux, et enfin les hommes.", "3663": "D’autres admettent dans les âmes le même changement que dans les corps;", "3664": "et comme la terre se change en eau, l’eau en air, et l’air en feu, la nature tendant toujours en haut;", "3665": "de même parmi les ames humaines, celles qui sont plus vertueuses deviennent des héros, les héros sont changés en démons, et quelques unes en petit nombre, entièrement purifiées par un long exercice des vertus, sont élevées à la nature divine.", "3666": "Il en est au contraire qui, incapables de maîtriser leurs désirs, se rabaissent jusqu’à se plonger de nouveau dans des corps mortels, pour y mener, comme dans une atmosphère nébuleuse, une vie obscure et misérable.", "3667": "Hésiode pense qu’après une certaine révolution de siècles, les démons subissent la mort, et il désigne cet espace de temps d’une manière enveloppée, en faisant dire à une naïade :", "3668": "Ceux qui ne prennent pas le mot d’âge dans son véritable sens, prolongent ce temps jusqu’à une durée infinie.", "3669": "On ne doit l’entendre que d’une année;", "3670": "et alors la vie des démons ne sera en tout que de neuf mille sept cent vingt ans.", "3671": "Plusieurs mathématiciens retranchent encore sur ces années, et Pindare même ne les porte pas au delà de ce nombre, lui qui prétend que les nymphes égalent la durée des arbres, et que c’est pour cela qu’on les appelle hamadryades.", "3672": "»Comme il parlait encore, Démétrius l’interrompit.", "3673": "« Cléombrote, lui dit-il, comment pouvez-vous dire que l’àge de l’homme ne signifie qu’une année?", "3674": "soit qu’on l’entende seulement du temps de sa vigueur, soit qu’on le prenne pour toute sa vie, comme quelques uns lisent dans Hésiode, sa durée n’est pas aussi courte que vous le dites.", "3675": "Ceux qui suivent la première leçon, entendent avec Héraclite, par l’âge de l’homme, un espace de trente ans, temps auquel un fils peut lui-même devenir père.", "3676": "Ceux qui l’entendent dans le second sens, donnent à l’âge de l’homme cent huit ans.", "3677": "Ils disent que la moitié de la vie humaine est de cinquante-quatre ans, nombre composé de l’unité, des deux premiers nombres plans, des deux premiers carrés et des deux premiers cubes1;", "3678": "ce sont les nombres que Platon a aussi employés pour la création de l’ame.", "3679": "Hésiode paraît avoir voulu faire allusion, quoique d’une manière obscure, à cet embrasement universel qui détruira les nymphes et les eaux :", "3680": "«—Je reconnais ici, dit alors Cléombrote, cet embrasement des stoïciens dont tout le monde parle, et je vois qu’après avoir envahi les vers d’Héraclite et d’Orphée, il s’est encore saisi de ceux d’Hésiode.", "3681": "Mais je ne crois ni à la destruction du monde, ni à d’autres effets aussi impossibles;", "3682": "et les paroles que vous avez rapportées sur la vie des animaux, et en particulier sur celle de la corneille et du cerf, prouvent qu’on ne doit pas admettre un aussi grand nombre d’années.", "3683": "Au reste, comme l’année renferme dans sa durée le commencement et la fin de tout ce que les différentes saisons amènent et que la terre produit de son sein, on peut, ce me semble, très bien se servir du mot d’année pour désigner l’âge de l’homme.", "3684": "vous-même vous reconnaissez qu’Hésiode appelle la vie de l’homme âge.", "3685": "N’est-ce pas?", "3686": "» Démétrius en convint.", "3687": "« Il est également certain, reprit Cléombrote, que l’on exprime souvent par un même terme la mesure et la chose mesurée, comme on le voit dans les mots hémine, boisseau, amphore et muid.", "3688": "Ainsi, comme nous donnons particulièrement le nom de nombre à l’unité, qui est la plus petite mesure et le principe de tous les nombres, de même Hésiode donne à l’année, qui est la première mesure de la vie humaine, le nom d’âge, dont l’année est la mesure;", "3689": "car les nombres qui se forment de ces premiers n’ont pas les propriétés les plus remarquables en ce genre.", "3690": "Le nombre 9,720 est formé des quatre premiers nombres en commençant par l’unité, joints ensemble et multipliés quatre fois, ou de dix fois quatre;", "3691": "car de l’une et l’autre manière on a quarante pour produit, et ce dernier nombre, triplé successivement jusqu’à cinq fois, donne pour résultat le nombre 9,720.", "3692": "Mais je n’ai pas besoin d’entrer en discussion sur ce point avec Démétrius.", "3693": "Que le temps dans lequel l’ame des génies et la vie des héros éprouvent des changements, soit plus long ou plus court, qu’il soit déterminé ou incertain, il n’en sera pas moins prouvé dans l’une et l’autre supposition, par des témoins de la plus haute antiquité et d’une sagesse reconnue, qu’il est entre les dieux et les hommes des êtres intermédiaires sujets aux passions et aux vicissitudes de l’humanité, et que nous devons, d’après la tradition de nos pères, reconnaître et honorer sous le nom de génies.« Xénocrate, l’ami de Platon, pour nous en donner une idée, employait les figures des triangles.", "3694": "Il représentait la divinité par le triangle équilatéral, l’humanité par le triangle scalène, et les démons par le triangle isocèle.", "3695": "Le premier a ses trois côtés parfaitement égaux;", "3696": "dans le second, ils sont tous trois inégaux;", "3697": "le troisième, dont deux côtés sont égaux et l’autre inégal, convient aux génies, qui réunissent aux affections humaines la puissance divine.", "3698": "La nature elle-même en a mis sous nos yeux des images sensibles :", "3699": "celles des dieux dans le soleil et les astres;", "3700": "celles des mortels dans les vapeurs qui s’enflamment, dans les comètes et les autres météores ignés.", "3701": "Euripide y fait allusion dans ces vers :", "3702": "La lune a un rapport frappant avec les génies, dont elle représente les changements par les progrès et les diminutions périodiques de sa lumière, qui la font appeler par les uns un astre terrestre;", "3703": "par les autres, une terre cé leste;", "3704": "par d’autres, enfin, le partage d’Hécate céleste et terrestre1.« Si l’on supprimait l’air répandu entre la terre et la lune, on détruirait l’assemblage et l’union de toutes les parties de l’univers, en ne laissant au milieu qu’un espace vide et sans liaison.", "3705": "De même, ceux qui n’admettent pas l’existence des génies détruisent tout commerce entre les dieux et les hommes, en ôtant cette classe d’êtres que Platon appelle les interprètes et les ministres des dieux;", "3706": "du moins ils nous mettent dans la nécessité de tout confondre, d’assujettir les dieux aux passions humaines, et de les arracher, en quelque sorte, du ciel pour les faire vaquer aux affaires des mortels, comme on dit que les femmes de Thessalie font descendre la lune sur la terre.", "3707": "Cette opinion de leur pouvoir s’accrédita, dit-on, par la ruse d’Aglaonice, fille d’Hégétor, qui, versée dans les connaissances astronomiques, faisait croire au vulgaire, dans les éclipses de lune, que par ses charmes magiques elle attirait du ciel cette planète.«", "3708": "Nous ne devons pas ajouter foi aux discours de ceux qui prétendent que Dieu méprise la divination, les sacrifices et les fêtes;", "3709": "mais ne croyons pas non plus qu’il y préside lui-même.", "3710": "Il y a des génies dont les dieux se servent comme de ministres et de serviteurs, à qui le soin des fêtes et des mystères est confié.", "3711": "Il en est d’autres qui sont

aurait-il qu’un seul monde?", "3911": "Celui qui objecte qu’il n’y a qu’une seule terre et une seule mer, n’aperçoit pas dans ces objets une similitude de parties qui est évidente.", "3912": "Nous divisons la terre et la mer en plusieurs parties qui portent le même nom;", "3913": "mais nulle partie du monde n’est le monde même, puisqu’il est composé de substances d’une nature différente.", "3914": "Ceux qui emploient toute la matière à former un seul monde, dans la crainte que ce qu’on laisserait au dehors ne troublât, par sa résistance ou par ses chocs, l’harmonie de sa composition, s’effraient mal à propos.", "3915": "Dans la supposition de plusieurs mondes, chacun aura une mesure déterminée de matière et de substance, et il ne restera rien de superflu qui soit dans le désordre, et qui tombe hors de sa sphère.", "3916": "La forme particulière de chaque monde contenant toute la matière qui lui est attribuée, ne permet pas qu’aucune de ses parties, errant au hasard, s’échappe de son sein pour tomber d’un monde dans un autre.", "3917": "La nature n’admet ni une infinité sans bornes, ni des mouvements sans règle et sans mesure.", "3918": "Que si par hasard il s’en écoule quelques portions des uns dans les autres, il faut que ce soient des parties homogènes, et, pour ainsi dire, amies, et que le mélange s’en fasse de la manière la plus analogue à leur nature, comme les rayons des astres se mêlent et se confondent ensemble.", "3919": "Les mondes eux-mêmes doivent s’en réjouir, se contempler les uns les autres d’un œil serein, et établir un commerce d’amitié entre les dieux bons, qui sont en grand nombre dans chacun jde ces mondes.", "3920": "Il n’y a dans tout ce que je viens de dire rien d’impossible, rien de fabuleux ou de contraire à la raison, à moins qu’on ne soit entraîné par l’opinion d’Aristote, comme plus conforme aux lois physiques.", "3921": "Chaque corps, dit ce philosophe, ayant son lieu propre et naturel, il est nécessaire que la terre tende de tous côtés vers le milieu, et que l’eau placée au-dessus d’elle serve de fondement aux substances plus légères.", "3922": "Or, s’il y a plusieurs mondes, il arrivera que la terre en bien des endroits sera supérieure au feu et à l’air, et qu’en bien d’autres elle leur sera inférieure.", "3923": "Il faudra en dire autant de l’air et de l’eau, qui tantôt occuperont la place que la nature leur a assignée, et tantôt seront déplacées.", "3924": "Mais, selon lui, ces hypothèses étant impossibles, il croit qu’il n’y a ni deux ni plusieurs mondes, mais un seul composé de toute la matière qui existe, et disposé selon les lois de la nature, en raison de la diversité des substances.", "3925": "Cette assertion a plus de vraisemblance que de vérité.", "3926": "Il faut, mon cher Démétrius, la bien examiner.", "3927": "Lorsque Aristote dit que les corps tendent ou vers le milieu, ou vers les parties inférieures, ou vers les parties supérieures, ou enfin autour du milieu par un mouvement circulaire, de quel milieu veut-il parler?", "3928": "Ce n’est pas de celui du vide, qu’il ne reconnaît pas.", "3929": "Ceux même qui l’admettent n’y placent ni milieu, ni commencement, ni fin.", "3930": "Ces trois rapports expriment des bornes, et l’infini n’en a point.", "3931": "Mais si on forçait Aristote d’avouer que l’infini se meut nécessairement, comment pourrait-on y concevoir les différents mouvements des corps?", "3932": "Dans le vide, les corps sont sans force, ils n’ont pas de volonté ni de tendance qui les porte vers un milieu.", "3933": "Il est bien difficile de comprendre comment ils peuvent se mouvoir vers un objet incorporel et indifférent, ou recevoir de lui un mouvement et une tendance qu’il ne peut pas leur donner.", "3934": "Ce sont donc les corps et non l’espace qui forment ce milieu;", "3935": "puisque le monde n’est qu’un assemblage bien ordonné de différents corps, leur différence en met nécessairement une dans leurs mouvements.", "3936": "Aussi, quand leur substance éprouve quelque changement, l’un va occuper la place de l’autre.", "3937": "Leur raréfaction donne à la matière un mouvement circulaire qui la porte vers le?", "3938": "parties supérieures, et leur condensation les pousse et les presse vers le milieu.", "3939": "Il est inutile de s’arrêter davantage sur ce sujet.", "3940": "Quelle que soit la cause qu’on donne pour principe à ces affections, et à ces vicissitudes des corps, elle contiendra chacun de ces mondes dans l’état où il doit être.", "3941": "Chacun a sa terre et sa mer;", "3942": "il a son milieu particulier, ses affections et changements des corps, sa nature et ses facultés qui le conservent et le maintiennent dans sa place.", "3943": "Ce qui est au dehors, soit qu’on le suppose un néant, ou un vide infini, n’a pas de milieu, comme on l’a déjà dit.", "3944": "Mais comme il y a plusieurs mondes, chacun a son milieu propre, et par conséquent son mouvement particulier qui porte certains corps vers le milieu, en éloigne les autres, et fait tourner les autres autour du milieu, suivant la division qu’on vient de voir.", "3945": "Mais admettre plusieurs milieux, et prétendre que tous les corps graves tendent de tous côtés vers un seul, c’est à peu près comme si l’on soutenait que le sang de tous les hommes coule dans une seule veine, ou que tous les cerveaux sont enveloppés dans une seule membrane, comme s’il y avait de l’inconvénient à ce que tous les corps solides ne fussent pas réunis dans un même lieu et tous les corps légers dans un autre.", "3946": "Si cette opinion est absurde, il ne le serait pas rtioins de trouver mauvais qu’un tout eût ses parties rangées dans l’ordre et la disposition qui leur sont naturelles.", "3947": "Il serait aussi fou de vouloir qu’il existât un monde où la lune serait placée en bas, comme si un homme avait la cervelle aux talons, et le cœur aux tempes.", "3948": "Mais il n’est point absurde de supposer plusieurs mondes séparés les uns des autres, dont les parties soient également distinguées comme ils le sont eux-mêmes entre eux.", "3949": "Dans chaque monde, la terre, la mer et le ciel occuperont le lieu le plus convenable à leur nature.", "3950": "Chacun aura ses parties supérieure et inférieure, son environ et son milieu, et cela en lui-même, et par rapport à luimême, non au dehors de soi ni par rapport à un autre.", "3951": "La pierre que quelques uns supposent placée hors du monde, ne peut facilement être conçue ni en repos, ni en mouvement.", "3952": "Comment restera-t-elle immobile, puisqu’elle a de la pesanteur?", "3953": "ou comment tendra-t-elle vers le monde, comme les autres corps graves, puisqu’elle n’en fait point partie, et qu’elle n’est point au nombre des substances qui le composent?", "3954": "Quant à la terre qui est contenue et attachée dans un autre monde, il ne faut pas craindre que sa pesanteur l’arrache du tout dont elle fait partie et la porte dans notre monde, puisqu’on voit avec quelle force chaque partie est contenue dans son état naturel.", "3955": "Si nous prenons le haut et le bas, hors du monde, et non par rapport à lui-même, nous tomberons dans les mêmes difficultés qu’Epicure, qui fait mouvoir tous ses atomes vers les lieux qui sont au-dessous des pieds, comme si le vide avait des pieds, ou que dans l’infini on pût concevoir du haut et du bas.", "3956": "Aussi je ne puis comprendre ce que Chrysippe avait dans l’esprit, lorsqu’il a avancé que le monde était situé au milieu, que sa substance occupait de toute éternité cette place, et que cette position avait beaucoup contribué à assurer sa durée, et à le rendre en quelque sorte incorruptible et éternel.", "3957": "C’est ce qu’on lit dans son quatrième livre des Possibles, ομ il a imaginé ce rôvelridicule du milieu dans le vide, et où il assigne avec encore plus d’absurdité ce milieu imaginaire pour cause de la durée du monde.", "3958": "Cependant il avait souvent dit ailleurs que la substance du monde est dirigée et contenue par les mouvements qui portent les corps vers son milieu, ou qui les en éloignent.Quant aux autres objections des stoïciens, quelle impression peuvent-elles faire?", "3959": "Ils demandent comment, en supposant plusieurs mondes, il pourra n’y avoir qu’un seul destin, une seule Providence, et qu’il n’y aura pas nécessairement plusieurs Jupiters1.", "3960": "D’abord, s’il est contre la raison d’admettre plusieurs Jupiters, leurs opinions seront encore bien plus absurdes.", "3961": "En effet, dans ces révolutions infinies de mondes qu’ils supposent, ne font-ils pas à l’infini des soleils, des lunes, des Apollons, des Dianes, et des Neptunes1?", "3962": "En second lieu, quelle nécessité de supposer plusieurs Jupiters parcequ’il y aura plusieurs mondes, plutôt que d’admettre pour chaque monde un dieu plein d’intelligence et de raison, qui le dirige et le gouverne, comme celui que nous appelons le souverain et le père de toutes choses?", "3963": "Ou qui empêche qu’ils ne dépendent tous de la destinée et de la providence de Jupiter, et qu’ils lui obéissent;", "3964": "que ce dieu suprême veille sur tout, préside à tout et donne à tous les effets qui s’opèrent, leur principe, leur germe et leur cause?", "3965": "Ne voyonsnous pas souvent ici un seul tout se former de plusieurs corps différents, dont chacun a séparément sa vie, son intelligence, son activité, comme sont une assemblée civile, une armée, un chœur de musique;", "3966": "c’est le sentiment de Chrysippe.", "3967": "Serait-il donc impossible que dans le grand tout de l’univers, il existât dix mondes, cinquante, ou même cent qui fussent conduits par une seule intelligence, et soumis à un même principe?", "3968": "Cette disposition est au contraire très digne des dieux;", "3969": "car il ne faut pas croire que, semblables aux rois des abeilles, ils ne quittent jamais un lieu déterminé, mais qu’ils restent enfermés, et, pour ainsi dire, emprisonnés dans la matière.", "3970": "C’est pourtant ce que font les stoïciens, lorsqu’ils prétendent que les dieux sont des propriétés intimes de l’air, de l’eau et du feu;", "3971": "qu’ils les font naître avec le monde, et les livrent avec lui aux flammes qui doivent les consumer.", "3972": "Ils ne les laissent pas même déliés et libres, comme des conducteurs de char ou des pilotes;", "3973": "mais tels que des statues qui sont clouées et scel lées sur leurs bases, ces dieux, dans leur système, renfermés et comme attachés à la nature matérielle, en partagent toutes les vicissitudes, jusqu’à son entière destruction.", "3974": "Ce sentiment, si je ne me trompe, est bien plus noble et plus digne de la majesté des dieux, qui les suppose libres et indépendants.", "3975": "Castor et Pollux donnent du secours à ceux qui sont battus de la tempête, et par leur présence,Ils n’ont pas besoin pour cela de monter sur le vaisseau et d’en partager les périls;", "3976": "ils se montrent seulement au haut des airs, et le font voguer en sûreté1.", "3977": "De même les dieux visitent tour à tour les divers mondes pour jouir du spectacle qu’ils offrent, et pour les gouverner chacun par les lois de la nature.", "3978": "Le Jupiter d’Homère ne porte pas bien loin ses regards, lorsqu’il les détourne de la ville de Troie sur les Thraces et sur les peuples nomades des bords du Danube.", "3979": "Mais le vrai Jupiter, promenant ses regards sur plusieurs mondes, a sous les yeux les révolutions les plus belles et les plus dignes de lui.", "3980": "Il ne regarde pas hors de soi un vide infini;", "3981": "il ne se considère pas uniquement lui-même, comme quelques uns l’ont pensé;", "3982": "mais il contemple les ouvrages des dieux et des hommes, les mouvements et les révolutions périodiques des astres.", "3983": "Car la divinité ne hait point les changements;", "3984": "au contraire elle s’y plaît, à en juger par les vicissitudes du mouvement de ces globes qui roulent dans les deux.", "3985": "L’infinité des mondes, contraire à toute raison, n’admet pas même de dieu, et livre tout àla fortune et au hasard.", "3986": "Mais une Providence qui gouverne avec sagesse un nombre déterminé de mondes, ne me paraît ni exiger plus de peine, ni le céder en rien pour la dignité à celle qui, s’unissant à une seule substance et s’y collant, pour ainsi dire, la change à l’infini, et lui fait subir de nouvelles formes.", "3987": "Je m’arrêtai là;", "3988": "et, après un moment de silence, Philippe prit la parole :", "3989": "« Ce n’est pas à moi, dit-il, à prononcer sur la vérité ou la fausseté de cette opinion.", "3990": "Mais si nous donnons à Dieu le département de plus d’un monde, pourquoi voulons-nous qu’il n’en ait formé que cinq?", "3991": "J’avoue que j’apprendrais le rapport de ce nombre à la multitude des mondes;", "3992": "avec plus de plaisir, que la cause de l’inscription El qu’on a consacrée dans ce temple;", "3993": "car ce nombre n’est ni un triangle, ni un carré, ni un cube, ni un nombre parfait.", "3994": "Il n’offre aucune propriété, qui puisse flatter ceux qui attachent beaucoup de prix à ces subtilités numériques.", "3995": "La raison prise des éléments, que Platon a désignée d’une manière énigmatique, est très difficile à comprendre, et ne laisse apercevoir aucune probabilité qui ait pu lui faire conclure que, comme il y a dans la matière cinq espèces de corps qui ont leurs angles et leurs côtés égaux, et dont les aires sont égales, il s’en soit formé sur-le-champ cinq mondes.", "3996": "»Cependant, repris-je, son système a été, ce me semble, assez bien développé par Théodore de Solès1, dans l’explication qu’il a donnée de la géométrie de Platon.", "3997": "Voici ce qu’il en dit.", "3998": "La pyramide, l’octaèdre, l’icosaèdre, le dodécaèdre que Platon met pour les premiers corps élémentaires, sont tous parfaitement beaux, par l’égalité de leurs rapports et de leurs proportions, et il n’est pas au pouvoir de la nature d’en former de meilleurs, ni même d’aussi bons.", "3999": "Cependant ils n’ont pas eu tous une même composition, et ils n’ont pas un même principe.", "4000": "La pyra mide est le plus petit et le plus délié des cinq.", "4001": "Le dodécaèdre est le plus grand, et composé de plus de parties.", "4002": "Des deux autres, l’icosaèdre a le double des triangles de l’octaèdre.", "4003": "Il est donc impossible que ces corps aient tous été formés en même temps d’une seule matière.", "4004": "Les corps petits et déliés, dont l’organisation est plus simple, ont dû obéir, les premiers, à l’agent qui donne le mouvement et la forme à la matière, recevoir les premiers leur constitution, et exister avant ceux qui sont plus grands, et ont plus de parties.", "4005": "Tel est le dodécaèdre, dont l’organisation demande plus de travail.", "4006": "Il suit de là que la pyramide seule est proprement‘un corps élémentaire, et qu’aucun des autres ne l’est, puisque, par leur nature même, leur formation est postérieure àla sienne.", "4007": "Le remède à cet inconvénient, a été de diviser la matière en cinq mondes :", "4008": "l’un est la pyramide, qui a existé la première;", "4009": "l’autre, l’octaèdre;", "4010": "un troisième, l’icosaèdre.", "4011": "Or, de ce qui aura premièrement existé dans chacun de ces mondes, les autres corps se formeront successivement, suivant la raréfaction et la condensation des parties qui les composent, et qui se changent les unes dans les autres.", "4012": "C’est ce que Platon montre, en suivant en détail toutes leurs révolutions.", "4013": "Pour nous, il nous suffira d’en donner une légère idée.L’air se forme du feu éteint, et quand il a été luimême bien atténué, il produit de nouveau le feu.", "4014": "Dans les principes de ces deux éléments, on peut connaître les affections et les changements de tous les autres.", "4015": "Le principe du feu est la pyramide composée des vingt-quatre premiers triangles.", "4016": "Le principe de l’air est l’octaèdre, composé des quarante-huit triangles de même nature.", "4017": "L’élément de l’air se forme donc de deux éléments du feu combinés ensemble, et ce même élément divisé en donne du feu.", "4018": "S’il se condense de nouveau, il acquiert la nature d’eau.", "4019": "Ainsi, en toute génération, ce qui existe le pre mier, donne aux autres substances, par son changement, une origine facile;", "4020": "en sorte qu’il n’y a plus un élément seul, et que l’un ayant, dans la substance de l’autre, un principe actif d’origine, ils conservent tous la dénomination commune d’élément.« Théodore, dit alors Ammonius, s’est donné bien du tourment, pour expliquer ce système.", "4021": "Mais je me trompe fort, ou il a pris pour base de son explication, des principes qui se détruisent l’un l’autre.", "4022": "Il établit que ces cinq corps élémentaires ne sont pas formés tous ensemble, mais que celui qui est le plus délié, et dont la composition exige moins de travail, se forme toujours le premier.", "4023": "Il ajoute ensuite, comme une conséquence de ce principe, une assertion qui le contredit formellement :", "4024": "c’est que toute matière ne produit pas d’abord ce qui est plus délié et plus simple;", "4025": "que quelquefois les corps graves et composés de plusieurs parties, sont les premiers qui naissent de la matière.", "4026": "D’ailleurs, après avoir supposé cinq éléments, et conséquemment cinq mondes, il n’applique son raisonnement qu’à quatre de ces éléments, et, comme au jeu des osselets, il soustrait le cube, qui ne peut, dit-il, ni se changer dans les autres corps, ni changer les autres en lui, parceque les triangles qui le composent sont d’un genre différent.", "4027": "Les autres ont pour principe commun la moitié d’un triangle, et celui-là seul a pour principe, un triangle isocèfe qui ne peut se mêler, ni s’unir en aucune manière avec le demi-triangle.", "4028": "Si donc il y a cinq éléments et cinq mondes, et que dans chacun d’eux, ce qui existe le premier, soit pour les autres un principe de génération, il s’ensuivra que partout où le cube existera le premier, aucun des autres ne pourra se former, puisque le cube ne peut être changé en aucun d’eux.", "4029": "Je n’ajoute pas qu’on donne au dodécaèdre, un autre principe que le triangle scalène, dont Platon compose la pyramide, l’octaèdre et l’icosaèdre.", "4030": "Il faut donc, dit Ammonius en souriant, ou nous résoudre ces difficultés, ou donner de votre chef une autre explication qui fixe nos incertitudes.", "4031": "»Je n’ai, lui dis-je, pour le présent, rien de plus probable à vous dire.", "4032": "Mais peut-être vaut-il encore mieux rendre raison de son propre sentiment que de celui des autres.", "4033": "Je reprends donc la question dans son principe.", "4034": "Puisqu’il existe deux natures, l’une sensible, qui se forme, se détruit, et subit successivement diverses révolutions;", "4035": "l’autre purement intelligible, et qui se maintient toujours dans le même état, il serait étrange, mon cher Ammonius, qu’en admettant dans celle-ci des divisions, et des manières d’être différentes, on s’indignât, on s’irritât même contre ceux qui ne laisseraient pas la nature corporelle et passible parfaitement ifne, mais la diviseraient en plusieurs parties.", "4036": "C’est aux substances divines et permanentes qu’il appartiendrait d’être ainsi inséparablement unies, et de n’admettre ni séparation, ni division.", "4037": "Cependant le pouvoir de l’être changeant, en s’étendant jusqu’à ces êtres intelligibles, a mis entre eux de plus grandes dissimilitudes d’idées et de formes, que ne sont les intervalles qui séparent les corps.Platon combat le sentiment de ceux qui assurent qu’il n’y a qu’une seule idée universelle, et il établit cinq principes, qui sont l’essence, l’essence l’êtrere toujours le même, l’être changeant, le mouvement et le repos.", "4038": "Dans cette supposition il n’est pas surprenant que chacun des éléments corporels ait sa ressemblance dans la nature;", "4039": "il est vrai quelle n’y est pas pure et sans mélange;", "4040": "les éléments tiennent les uns des autres.", "4041": "Le cube est le signe certain du repos, à cause de la stabilité et de la solidité de ses surfaces.", "4042": "Il n’est personne qui ne reconnaisse la force du feu et l’activité de son mouvement dans la finesse des côtés et des angles de la pyramide.", "4043": "Le dodécaèdre, propre à représenter toutes les figures, est l’image de l’essence qui embrasse l’universalité des corps.", "4044": "Quant aux deux autres, l’icosaèdre convient à l’être changeant, et l’octaèdre à l’être toujours le même.", "4045": "L’un a produit l’air, qui contient toutes les substances sous une seule forme1.", "4046": "L’eau, qui, par ses combinaisons, prend des formes différentes, a été produite par l’autre.", "4047": "Si la nature veut l’égalité partout, il ne faut admettre ni plus ni moins de mondes qu’il n’y a de modèles existants, en sorte que chacun ait son principe constitutif et sa force originelle comme les corps dans leurs compositions.", "4048": "Voilà de quoi satisfaire ceux qui s’étonnent de ce que nous divisons en tant de genres une nature sujette au changement et à la réviviiication.", "4049": "Mais une chose à laquelle je vous prie de faire tous attention, c’est que des deux premiers principes, je veux dire l’unité et la dyade (ou le nombre binaire), celle-ci comme principe de tout désordre et de toute confusion, s’appelle infinité.", "4050": "Au contraire, l’unité terminant le vide infini qui n’a ni proportion ni bornes, lui donne sa forme, et le rend capable de recevoir les dénominations qu’on applique toujours aux choses sensibles.", "4051": "On reconnaît ses principes dans les nombres;", "4052": "et la dénomination de nombre ne convient à la multitude qu’autant qu’elle marque les bornes plus ou moins étendues que la forme a données à l’immensité de la matière.", "4053": "Toute multitude devient nombre, lorsqu’elle est terminée par l’unité.", "4054": "L’unité en est-elle ôtée, alors la dyade, infinie dans ses combinaisons, confond tout, détruit tout ordre, toutes bornes et toute mesure.", "4055": "Mais comme la forme, loin de détruire la matière, donne la figure et l’ordre au sujet qui la reçoit, on doit trouver nécessairement dans le nombre les deux principes d’où naît la première et la plus grande différence des nombres.", "4056": "Le principe infini produit le nombre pair;", "4057": "l’autre, comme le meilleur, donne naissance au nombre impair.", "4058": "Deux est le premier nombre pair, et trois le premier des impairs.", "4059": "De ces deux nombres réunis se forme le nombre cinq, qui, à raison de sa composition, est commun aux deux, mais qui, par sa nature, est impair;", "4060": "car la nature sensible, étant, à cause de sa composition et par la force de l’être toujours changeant, divisée en plusieurs parties, il fallait nécessairement que le nombre de ces parties ne fût ni le premier des nombres pairs, ni le premiers des impairs, mais un troisième composé des deux, afin qu’il fût le résultat des deux principes qui forment le nombre pair et le nombre impair;", "4061": "car l’un ne pouvait pas être séparé de l’autre, puisqu’ils ont également tous les deux la nature et la faculté de principe.", "4062": "Etant donc unis ensemble, le meilleur a prévalu sur l’infinité qui tend à la division, et a contenu la nature corporelle.", "4063": "Et comme la matière était divisée par ces deux principes, le meilleur a placé au milieu l’unité, qui a empêché que l’univers fût divisé seulement en deux parties.", "4064": "De là est venue la pluralité des mondes, produite par l’être changeant, qui est toujours dans l’infinité;", "4065": "mais là force de l’être toujours le même, qui agit d’une manière déterminée, les a produits en nombre impair.", "4066": "Et cette imparité a été fixée à cinq, parceque le meilleur principe n’a pas permis que la nature s’étendît au delà des bornes convenables.", "4067": "Si l’unité eût été pure et sans mélange, la matière n’eût admis aucune division.", "4068": "Mais comme elle s’est trouvée unie au nombre deux, dont la nature est de diviser, la matière a souffert une séparation;", "4069": "mais elle s’est arrêtée au nombre cinq, parceque le nombre impair l’a emporté sur le pair.Aussi les anciens tiraient-ils du nombre cinq le mot compter;", "4070": "et je croirais volontiers que le nom qui exprime l’univers en est aussi dérivé;", "4071": "et cela avec raison, parceque cinq est composé des deux premiers nombres.", "4072": "Les autres nombres multipliés en produisent qui sont différents d’eux-mêmes :", "4073": "le nombre cinq, multiplié par des nombre pairs, produit toujours une dizaine, qui est un nombre parfait;", "4074": "multiplié par des impairs, il se reproduit lui-même.", "4075": "Je n’ajoute pas que cinq est le résultat des deux premiers carrés un et quatre;", "4076": "qu’il vaut seul autant que les deux nombres qui le précèdent, et forme par là le plus beau triangle rectangle;", "4077": "qu’entin, il est le premier nombre qui soit en proportion sesqui-altère.", "4078": "Ces observations sont peut-être étrangères au sujet que nous traitons.", "4079": "Mais ce qui y a plus de rapport, c’est que le nombre cinq est de sa nature propre à diviser, et qu’il a servi de modèle à la plupart des divisions.Nous-mêmes, par exemple, nous avons cinq sens naturels et cinq facultés dans l’ame :", "4080": "la végétative, la sensible, la concupiscible, l’irascible et la raisonnable.", "4081": "Nous avons cinq doigts à chaque main.", "4082": "La plus grande fécondité dans les femmes ne va pas au delà de ce nombre;", "4083": "on ne connaît pas de femme qui ait eu plus de cinq enfants à la fois.", "4084": "Les fables égyptiennes disent que Rhéa mit au monde cinq dieux;", "4085": "ce qui désigne d’une manière énigmatique les cinq mondes formés d’une seule matière1.",

planètes, parceque le Soleil, Vénus et Mercure n’en font qu’une seule.", "4088": "Le monde lui-même, dans sa composition, suit cette analogie, comme parmi nous l’harmonie musicale résulte de la position des cinq tétracordes:", "4089": "celui des graves, celui des moyennes, des conjointes, des disjointes et des excellentes.", "4090": "Dans le chant, on distingue aussi cinq intervalles :", "4091": "le dièse, le semi-ton, le ton, le ton mineur et le ton majeur.", "4092": "Tant la nature, dans ses différentes compositions, semble se plaire à suivre l’analogie du nombre cinq, plutôt qu’elle n’affecte la forme sphérique, comme le veut Aristote1.Mais, dira peut-être quelqu’un, pourquoi Platon, après avoir supposé cinq mondes selon les cinq figures des éléments, après avoir dit que Dieu a formé l’univers sur l’analogie du nombre cinq, élève-t-il ensuite un doute sur la pluralité des mondes, et qu’il demande s’il faut croire qu’il n’y en ait qu’un ou cinq.", "4093": "Quel peut avoir été le fondement de ce doute?", "4094": "S’il faut appuyer son sentiment de quelque probabilité, je dirai que Platon a cru que les dissimilitudes de ces corps et de leurs figures entraînaient nécessairement des différences dans leurs mouvements.", "4095": "C’est ce qu’il enseigne lui-même, lorsqu’il dit qu’en se condensant ou se raréfiant, ils changent de nom et de lieu, comme de substance et de qualités.", "4096": "Si par exemple l’air devient feu et que la figure de l’octaèdre soit résolue en pyramide, ou que le feu, ’devenu soit resserré et comprimé dans l’octaèdre, il est impossible

font obstacle.", "4098": "Il le rend encore plus sensible par la comparaison des vans et des autres instruments destinés à cribler le blé.", "4099": "Il dit que, dans les éléments, lorsqu’ils agitaient la matière ou que la matière les agitait, les parties homogènes se réunissaient, et qu’elles occupaient tantôt une place, tantôt une autre, avant que par leur composition, l’univers fût formé.", "4100": "Telle était la disposition de la matière et de l’univers avant que Dieu les eût ordonnés.", "4101": "Les cinq qualités premières1 ont agi selon leur propriété naturelle.", "4102": "Elles ne se sont pas séparées et divisées totalement;", "4103": "dans cet état de confusion, le plus faible a été entraîné par le plus fort.", "4104": "Ainsi, dans leur formation, portées de côté et d’autre, elles ont fait autant de divisions qu’elles étaient de genres différents.", "4105": "L’une devint un feu qui, sans être parfaitement pur, participe de la forme ignée.", "4106": "Une autre fut de l’éther, non sans aucun mélange, mais participant de la substance éthérée.", "4107": "Une troisième, sans être une terre pure, tenait de la nature de la terre.", "4108": "L’air surtout se trouva mêlé avec Veau, parceque ce dernier élément, comme on l’a déjà dit, ne se sépara de l’autre que plein de substances de différents genres;", "4109": "car ce n’est point Dieu qui a séparé et distribué la matière.", "4110": "Mais après qu’elle se fut divisée d’elle-même et que chaque division, dans le plus grand désordre, eut occupé des lieux différents, il s’en empara, la mit en ordre et la disposa suivant les proportions les plus justes et les plus convenables.", "4111": "Donnant ensuite à chacune la raison pour la gouverner et la maintenir, il fit autant de mondes qu’il y avait d’espèces de corps élémentaires.", "4112": "Voilà ce que j’ai cru devoir dire pour la défense de Platon en faveur d’Ammonius.Quant au nombre des mondes, je ne voudrais pas affirmer qu’il n’y en a précisément que cinq.", "4113": "Mais je crois que l’opinion qui en admet plus d’un, sans néanmoins les multiplier à l’infini, et qui les fixe à un nombre déterminé, n’est pas plus déraisonnable qu’aucune des deux autres.", "4114": "Je vois qu’il est de la nature de la matière de se répandre, de se diviser;", "4115": "quelle ne se tient pas dans l’u nité, mais aussi que la raison ne lui permet pas de se séparer à l’infini.", "4116": "Au reste, c’est ici le lieu ou jamais de se souvenir de l’Académie, pour ne rien affirmer avec trop de confiance1, et nous tenir seulement fermes dans la question sur l’infinité des mondes, comme sur un chemin glissant et périlleux.", "4117": "Après ce discours, Démétrius prit la parole :", "4118": "« Lamprias, dit-il, nous donne un bon avis.", "4119": "Ce ne sont pascomme a dit Euripide, que les dieux emploient pour nous en imposer, mais celles des choses, quand notre vaine science ose prononcer sur des matières si fort au-dessus de notre intelligence.«", "4120": "Mais il est temps de revenir à notre premier entretien.", "4121": "Nous avons dit que les oracles abandonnés parles génies étaient semblables à des instruments de musique qui ne résonnent plus dès que le musicien cesse d’en jouer.", "4122": "Cette question en fait naître une autre bien plus intéressante :", "4123": "il s’agit de savoir quels sont les moyens que les génies ont employés pour remplir d’enthousiasme les prophètes de l’un et de l’autre sexe, et leur faire connaître l’avenir.", "4124": "Nous ne pouvons pas attribuer le silence des oracles à la retraite des génies, si nous ignorons comment leur présence peut les faire parler et donner des réponses.« — Croyez-vous donc, lui dit Ammonius, que les génies soient autre chose que des esprits errants de côté et d’autre, et, comme dit Hésiode,Pour moi, je pense qu’il y a entre un esprit pur et une ame revêtue d’un corps, la même différence qu’entre un homme dans l’état ordinaire et celui qui joue sur un théâtre.", "4125": "Il n’est donc ni étonnant ni absurde que des âmes qui en rencontrent d’autres leur communiquent la connaissance de l’avenir.", "4126": "Nous-mêmes nous n’employons pas toujours l’organe de la voix.", "4127": "Souvent l’écriture, le tact, le regard, nous servent à rappeler des choses passées, et à en présager de futures.", "4128": "Avez-vous, Lamprias, quelque chose à nous objecter?", "4129": "car il nous est revenu depuis peu que vous aviez eu à Lébadie une longue conférence sur cette matière avec des étrangers.", "4130": "Mais celui qui nous l’a rapporté ne se souvenait de rien de ce qu’il avait entendu.", "4131": "» N’en soyez point surpris, lui dis-je.", "4132": "Les affaires et les occupations qui venaient à la traverse à cause de l’oracle et du sacrifice qu’on y faisait alors, coupaient à chaque instant notre entretien, que nous ne pouvions suivre que par intervalles.", "4133": "« Maintenant, réprit Ammonius, vos auditeurs ont du loisir, ils sont disposés à tout éclaircir, à tout discuter, à mettre à l’écart toute dispute et toute altercation, à vous laisser, comme vous voyez, la liberté de tout dire, à avoir enfin pour vous la plus grande indulgence.", "4134": "»Tous les assistants m’ayant fait la même demande, après un moment de réflexion je pris la parole :", "4135": "C’est vous, dis-je à Ammonius, qui, sans y penser, avez donné lieu de rappeler ce qui fut dit dans cette occasion :", "4136": "car si ces ames séparées des corps, ou qui même n’y ont jamais été unies, sont, selon vous et le divin Hésiode, des géniespourquoi priverons-nous les ames unies à des corps de cette faculté naturelle aux génies de connaître et de prédire l’avenir?", "4137": "II n’est pas vraisemblable que les âmes, après leur séparation d’avec les corps, acquièrent quel— que propriété qu’elles n’avaient pas auparavant.", "4138": "Elles ont toujours les mêmes facultés, mais seulement moins parfaites lorsque les ames sont encore unies aux corps.", "4139": "Les unes sont obscures et cachées, les autres faibles et languissantes, celles-ci émoussées et tardives, comme sont nos regards à travers des nuages, ou nos pas sur un terrain humide.", "4140": "Elles ont besoin que des remèdes efficaces les rétablissent dans l’intégrité de leur nature, et les délivrent de tout ce qui retarde leur activité.", "4141": "Comme le soleil ne devient pas lumineux lorsqu’il sort d’un nuage, et que, toujours brillant de sa nature, il ne parait obscurci qu’à raison de la nuée qui le couvre, de même l’ame n’acquiert point la faculté de deviner, quand elle est sortie du corps comme d’un nuage.", "4142": "Elle la possède pendant qu’elle lui est unie;", "4143": "mais son union intime avec une nature mortelle en émousse l’activité.Pourrions-nous en douter, ou même en être surpris, en voyant, sans parler des autres facultés de l’ame, combien la mémoire, qui est l’opposé de la divination, a de force et de pouvoir pour retenir et conserver les choses passées, ou plutôt pour leur donner un nouvel être, car ce qui est passé n’a plus d’existence?", "4144": "Tout existe et périt successivement, les actions, les paroles et les affections.", "4145": "Le temps, comme un fleuve rapide, les entraîne dans sa course.", "4146": "Mais la mémoire, par je ne sais quel moyen, le saisit dans sa fuite, et donne une substance et une forme à ce qui n’est plus.", "4147": "L’oracle donné aux Thessaliens au sujet d’Arna, leur ordonnait de direLa mémoire est, pour nous, l’ouïe des sourds et la vue des aveugles.", "4148": "Il ne faut donc pas s’étonner que pouvant saisir ce qui n’est plus, elle prévoie ce qui n’est pas encore.", "4149": "L’avenir la touche même davantage, et est plus intéressant pour elle.", "4150": "Elle tend vers le futur et l’embrasse déjà, au lieu qu’elle est séparée du passé, et n’y tient que par le souvenir.", "4151": "Les âmes ont donc cette faculté innée, mais, à la vérité, faible et obscure;", "4152": "elle n’agit qu’avec difficulté.", "4153": "Cependant il en est en qui elle se développe tout à coup, soit dans les songes, soit dans les sacrifices, quand le corps est purifié, ou qu’il se trouve dans une position favorable à l’enthousiasme, et que la partie raisonnable et contemplative, dégagée de l’impression des objets présents qui troublaient son action, applique l’imagination à prévoir l’avenir.", "4154": "Il n’est pas vrai, comme le dit Euripide, que celui-làc’est seulement un homme intelligent et qui suit les indices probables que la raison lui découvre.", "4155": "Mais la faculté divinatrice, semblable à une table rase, privée en soi de raison et de détermination, capable cependant des affections et des pressentiments que lui causent les images qui s’offrent à elle, parvient, sans le secours de la raison, à saisir l’avenir, quand elle se distrait du présent;", "4156": "ce qui arrive lorsque, par une certaine disposition du corps, elle entre dans cet état que nous appelons enthousiasme.", "4157": "Or, souvent le corps acquiert naturellement cette disposition.", "4158": "La terre est pour les hommes une source abondante de plusieurs autres facultés dont les unes transportent les âmes hors d’elles-mêmes, causent des maladies contagieuses et la mort même;", "4159": "d’autres sont douces, saines et bienfaisantes :", "4160": "l’expérience nous le démontre.", "4161": "Mais la divination est un souffle céleste, un écoulement de la divinité, soit qu’elle se communique directement par l’air ou par quelque autre fluide.", "4162": "Lorsqu’elle affecte les corps, elle produit dans les ames une disposition fort extraordinaire dont il est difficile de déterminer clairement les propriétés, mais sur lesquelles on peut asseoir plusieurs conjectures raisonnables.Il paraît que la chaleur et la dilatation qu’elle cause ouvrent certains pores qui donnent entrée aux images de l’avenir, comme le vin, par les vapeurs qu’il porte au cerveau, excite dans l’ame des mouvements qui en font sortir ce qu’on cachait avec le plus de soin.", "4163": "Si nous en croyons Euripide, l’ivresse et la fureur bachique favorisent beaucoup la divination.", "4164": "C’est alors que l’ame échauffée et, pour ainsi dire, toute brûlante, secoue cette timidité que la prudence humaine inspire naturellement, et qui éloigne ou éteint même l’enthousiasme.", "4165": "On peut dire encore avec assez de vraisemblance que la sécheresse produite dans l’ame par la chaleur rend les esprits plus déliés et plus subtils.", "4166": "Telle est cette ame sèche dont parle Héraclite, et qu’il prétend être la plus parfaite.", "4167": "L’humidité non-seulement émousse la vue et l’ouïe, mais encore elle ôte aux miroirs, aux lampes et à l’air même leur lueur et leur éclat.", "4168": "D’un autre côté, il n’est pas impossible que la condensation et le rafraîchissement des esprits ne produisent dans l’ame la divination, et n’aiguisent en elle cette faculté, comme la trempe donne du tranchant au fer.", "4169": "L’étain fondu avec le cuivre, qui naturellement est très poreux, le rend à la fois plus compacte et plus serré, plus pur et plus brillant.", "4170": "Il est de même assez vraisemblable que la vapeur divinatrice ayant de l’analogie avec les esprits, remplit les vides qui s’y trouvent, les affermit et les contient.", "4171": "Il y a des substances qui ont du rapport les unes avec les autres.", "4172": "Ainsi la fève donne une plus forte teinture à la pourpre, et le nitre au safran, comme dit Empédocle :", "4173": "Par rapport au couteau sacré d’Apollon qu’on conserve à Tarse, nous vous avons entendu dire, Démétrius, qu’il n’y avait point d’eau qui le nettoyât mieux que celle du fleuve Cydnus1.", "4174": "De même à Olympie, on détrempe de la cendre avec de l’eau du fleuve Alphée, et on en couvre l’autel de Jupiter, tandis qu’on n’a jamais pu la lier avec l’eau d’aucun autre fleuve, quoiqu’on l’ait essayé plusieurs fois2.", "4175": "Il ne faut donc pas trouver extraordinaire que dans le grand nombre de sources qui jaillissent de la terre, celles de Delphes soient les seules qui inspirent aux ames l’enthousiasme, et leur fassent connaître l’avenir.Au reste, une tradition incontestable confirme cette opinion.", "4176": "On raconte que la vertu prophétique du lieu où est l’oracle commença d’être connue lorsqu’un berger, que le hasard y avait conduit, proféra des paroles qui portaient tous les caractères d’une inspiration divine.", "4177": "Les premiers qui les entendirent n’en tinrent pas d’abord grand compte;", "4178": "mais ensuite l’événement ayant justifié ses prédictions, à l’indifférence succéda l’admiration.", "4179": "Les plus instruits des Delphiens assurent que ce berger s’appelait Corétas.", "4180": "Pour moi, je pense que l’ame a le même rapport et la même adhésion avec l’inspiration divine, que l’organe de la vue avec la lumière.", "4181": "L’œil ne peut sans la lumière exercer la faculté de voir;", "4182": "de même l’œil prophétique de Famé a besoin d’un ressort convenable qui l’anime et le mette en action.", "4183": "Aussi plusieurs philosophes des premiers âges ont-ils cru qu’Apollon et le soleil n’étaient qu’un même dieu.", "4184": "Mais ceux qui connaissent cette belle et sage analogie de la nature entière et qui savent l’apprécier, pensent que ce que le corps est à l’esprit, la vue à l’ame et la lumière à la vérité, la faculté solaire l’est àla nature d’Apollon, qu’elle en est l’émanation et l’effet, et que ce dieu, toujours existant, ne cesse pas un instant de la produire.", "4185": "Le soleil agite, développe et met en mouvement l’organe de la vue;", "4186": "Apollon excite dans l’ame la faculté divinatrice.", "4187": "Ceux qui ont cru qu’ils n’étaient qu’un seul et même dieu, ont, avec assez de vraisemblance, rendu cet oracle commun à Apollon et à la terre.", "4188": "Ils pensaient que le soleil produisait dans le sein de la terre cette disposition et cette température qui en fait exhaler les vapeurs propres à la divination.Pour la terre, qu’Hésiode, en cela plus instruit que beaucoup de philosophes, a appeléenous la croyons aussi étemelle et incorruptible.", "4189": "Mais, selon toute apparence, ses propriétés se développent, disparaissent et changent successivement de siège, et une longue suite de siècles ramène plusieurs fois pour elle les mêmes révolutions.", "4190": "Nous pouvons le conjecturer par ce que nous avons tous les jours sous les yeux.", "4191": "On a vu des lacs, des rivières, et plus encore des sources d’eau chaude se perdre entièrement;", "4192": "d’autres disparaître et se cacher sous terre, pour reparaître ensuite dans la même place ou dans un lieu voisin.Nous avons des mines extrêmement éptfisées;", "4193": "par exemple, celles d’argent dans l’Attique, et celles d’airain dans l’Eubée, dont on faisait des épées d’une trempe excellente1.", "4194": "Eschyle en fait mention lorsqu’il dit :", "4195": "Il n’y a pas longtemps que la carrière de Caryste2 ne donne plus de ces pierres molles dont on tirait des fils qui servaient à faire du linge, des filets et des bonnets.", "4196": "Quelques uns d’entre vous ont sans doute vu de ces ouvrages :", "4197": "ils sont incombustibles;", "4198": "c’est par le feu qu’on en fait disparaître les saletés et qu’on leur donne leur première blancheur.", "4199": "On ne trouve aujourd’hui dans cette carrière que de petits fils aussi minces que des cheveux et des fibres, répandus çà et là avec les métaux.Aristote prétend que les vapeurs contenues dans le sein de la terre sont la cause de tous ces phénomènes, qui doivent nécessairement disparaître, changer de place et se reproduire avec elles.", "4200": "Il faut croire de même, au sujet des exhalaisons prophétiques, que leur vertu n’est pas éternelle, mais qu’elle est sujette à vieillir et à s’altérer.", "4201": "Il est probable que les pluies abondantes les étouifent, que la chute de la foudre les dissipe, surtout quand la terre, agitée par de violents tremblements, s’entr’ouvre à une grande profondeur, s’affaisse sur elle-même, bouche les passages à ces vapeurs intérieures, et les absorbe entièrement.", "4202": "Ainsi l’oracle de Delphes fut réduit au silence lors de ce tremblement de terre qui détruisit la ville.", "4203": "On dit aussi qu’à Orchomène, la peste ayant emporté le plus grand nombre des habitants, l’oracle de Tirésias cessa ses pré- dictions, et depuis ce temps il est resté muet1.", "4204": "On raconte la même chose des oracles de Cilicie;", "4205": "mais personne ne peut mieux que vous, Démétrius, nous en attester la vérité.« Je ne puis, répondit Démétrius, vous dire où ils en sont actuellement.", "4206": "Vous savez que je suis depuis bien longtemps hors de mon pays.", "4207": "Pendant que j’y étais, les oracles de Mopsuset d’Amphiloque avaient la plus grande réputation.", "4208": "Je vous raconterai au sujet du premier un événement qui vous étonnera beaucoup, et dont j’ai été le témoin.", "4209": "Le gouverneur qui commandait alors en Cilicie, homme méchant et emporté, ne savait que croire des dieux.", "4210": "Il flottait dans une incrédulité mal assurée, obsédé qu’il était par ces épicuriens qui, pleins d’une philosophie arrogante, se moquent de tout ce qui a rapport à la religion.", "4211": "Il députa donc un de ses affranchis à l’oracle, comme on envoie un espion dans un camp ennemi.", "4212": "Il lui donna un billet cacheté, dans lequel il avait écrit la question qu’il proposait, et qu’il n’avait dite à personne.", "4213": "L’affranchi ayant, selon l’usage, passé la nuit dans le temple, vit en songe, pendant son sommeil, un homme très bien fait qui ne lui dit que ce mot :", "4214": "Noir, et qui disparut aussitôt.", "4215": "Cette réponse nous parut ridicule, et nous ne savions qu’en penser, lorsque le gouverneur, frappé d’étonnement et de respect, ouvrit le billet, et nous montra ces mots qu’il y avait écrits :", "4216": "« T’immolerai-je un taureau blanc ou noir?", "4217": "» Les épicuriens furent confondus, et le gouverneur ayant sacrifié à Mopsus, eut depuis pour ce dieu la plus grande vénération.", "4218": "» A ces mots, Démétrius se tut.", "4219": "Comme je me disposais à finir cet entretien, je jetai les yeux sur Philippe et Ammonius, qui étaient assis l’un à côté de l’autre;", "4220": "et croyant m’apercevoir qu’ils voulaient parler, je me retins.", "4221": "Alors Ammonius prit la parole.", "4222": "« Mon cher Lamprias, me dit-il, Philippe a aussi quelque chose à dire sur ce qui vient d’être avancé.", "4223": "Il pense, avec bien des gens, qu’Apollon n’est pas différent du soleil, et qu’il ne fait avec lui qu’un même dieu.", "4224": "Mais le doute que j’ai à proposer est plus considérable et porte sur un objet plus important.", "4225": "Nous avons tout à l’heure, je ne sais pourquoi, ôté assez maladroitement la divination aux dieux pour la transporter aux génies;", "4226": "maintenant nous dépossédons aussi, ce me semble, ces derniers du sanctuaire et du trépied, en attribuant le principe, ou même la substance et la vertu de la divination, à des vents, à des vapeurs et à des exhalaisons.«", "4227": "La température et la chaleur, dont nous avons parlé, donne de la force à Lame, comme la trempe donne de la dureté à l’acier;", "4228": "mais tout cela est contraire à l’opinion que nous avons de la puissance des dieux.", "4229": "Ce raisonnement sur la cause des oracles est semblable à celui que fait le cyclope dans Euripide :", "4230": "La seule différence qu’il y ait, c’est que le cyclope ne voulait pas sacrifier aux dieux, mais à lui-même et à son ventre, le plus grand des génies, au lieu que nous leur faisons des sacrifices, nous leur adressons nos vœux pour avoir des réponses de leurs oracles.", "4231": "Il est vrai que nous pourrions nous en dispenser, si nous avions en nous la vertu de la divination, et que l’air et le vent nous les communiquent.« Pourquoi donc avoir établi des prêtresses?", "4232": "et pourquoi ne donnent-elles point de réponses, à moins que la victime ne s’agite et ne tremble dans tout son corps au moment où les ministres lui font les libations?", "4233": "Il ne suffit pas qu’elle secoue la tête, comme dans les autres sacrifices :", "4234": "il faut qu’elle éprouve dans tous ses membres un tremblement, une palpitation et un frémissement sensible.", "4235": "Sans cela, l’oracle ne parle point, et on refuse d’introduire la pythie dans le sanctuaire.", "4236": "Ces conditions supposent nécessairement qu’ils reconnaissent les dieux ou les génies pour auteurs des oracles :", "4237": "dans votre opinion, elles n’ont aucun fondement.", "4238": "En effet, que la victime tremble ou non, partout où ces exhalaisons s’élèveront de la terre, elles produiront l’enthousiasme, et dès qu’elles auront affecté les organes de la pythie, ou même du premier venu, elles mettront son ame dans la disposition prophétique.", "4239": "Il serait alors bien ridicule de n’employer que le ministère d’une femme et de lui imposer des privations pénibles, en l’obligeant de garder toute sa vie la chasteté la plus exacte.", "4240": "Ce Corétas qui, selon les Del phiens, découvrit le premier, par hasard, la vertu de cet antre, n’avait rien, je crois, qui le distinguât des autres bergers, si toutefois ce récit est vrai, et qu’il ne soit pas une pure fable, comme je le pense;", "4241": "car lorsque je me rappelle tous les biens que cet oracle a procurés à la Grèce pendant les guerres, les pestes, les famines et dans les établissements de nouvelles colonies, je ne puis souffrir qu’on en attribue l’origine, non à Dieu et à sa providence, mais à la fortune et au hasard.", "4242": "Je suis tout disposé à en conférer avec Lamprias, pourvu que Philippe y veuille consentir.—", "4243": "Très volontiers, répondit Philippe;", "4244": "votre discours a fait trop d’impression sur moi et sur tous ceux qui sont présents pour vous le refuser.", "4245": "»Pour moi, lui dis-je, non-seulement il m’a touché, mais il m’a même fait craindre de passer aux yeux de cette respectable assemblée pour un homme qui, démentant las gravité de son âge, a cherché, par un langage artificieux, à détruire ou à affaiblir la vérité de quelques idées religieuses inspirées par les dieux et reçues parmi nous;", "4246": "mais je me justifierai, et Platon viendra à mon secours.", "4247": "Il a blâmé Anaxagoras l’Ancien de ce qu’il s’attachait trop aux causes naturelles, et qu’uniquement occupé de celles qui produisent nécessairement les affections corporelles, il négligeait les premières et principales causes, l’efficiente et la finale.", "4248": "Platon est le premier d’entre les philosophes qui ait parlé de ces deux causes.", "4249": "Il disait que Dieu était l’auteur et le principe de tout ce qui se fait par intelligence, sans cependant ôter à la matière ses propriétés et ses effets.", "4250": "Il sentait fort bien que l’ordre établi parmi les choses naturelles et sensibles avait plus d’une cause, et qu’il était le résultat de la matière et de la forme combinées ensemble.", "4251": "Les ouvrages des arts nous le prouveront.", "4252": "Le premier qui se présente est la coupe de ce temple dont la base a tant de célébrité, et est appelée Hypocratéride par Hérodote.", "4253": "Les causes matérielles qui ont concouru à la formation de cette coupe sont le feu, qui a amolli la matière, le fer et l’eau, qui lui a donné la trempe.", "4254": "Sans ces moyens, on n’aurait jamais pu faire cet ouvrage.", "4255": "Mais l’intelligence de l’artiste qui les a employés en est véritablement la cause essentielle;", "4256": "cela est si vrai, que le nom des artistes est marqué dans les ouvrages de peinture et de sculpture.", "4257": "C’est lui qui a fait le tableau que

matérielle, recherche avec soin toutes les nuances, tous les accidents de cou- leurs que produisent la sinopis mêlée avec l’ocre, et le noir avec le mélinuma2, diminue-t-il en rien la gloire de Polygnote?", "4260": "et celui qui explique pourquoi le fer s’amollit ou se durcit;", "4261": "et qu’après avoir été ramolli par le feu il cède aux coups redoublés du marteau et se dilate;", "4262":

appelle la force du fer;", "4263": "celui-là, dis-je, ôte-t-il à l’ouvrier le mérite d’avoir fait tout l’ouvrage?", "4264": "Je ne le pense pas.", "4265": "En examinant les propriétés des remèdes que les médecins emploient, on ne détruit pas la science de la médecine.", "4266": "Ni Platon, en affirmant que nous voyons par l’impression de la lumière solaire sur nos yeux, et que nous entendons par la vibration que l’air produit dans notre oreille, ne nie sûrement pas que ce ne soit l’intelligence et la sagesse divine qui nous ont donné les organes de la vue et de l’ouïe.", "4267": "En général, tout effet, comme je l’ai déjà dit, ayant deux causes de son existence, les plus anciens d’entre les théologiens et les poëtes ne se sont arrêtés qu’à la plus parfaite;", "4268": "ils appliquaient à tout cette maxime commune :", "4269": "Ils ne pensaient seulement pas aux causes nécessaires et naturelles.", "4270": "Les nouveaux, à qui l’on a donné le nom de physiciens, suivant une route contraire, ont perdu de vue cette cause si belle et si sublime, et ont tout fait dépendre des substances corporelles, de leurs affections, de leurs impulsions, de leurs changements et de leurs températures;", "4271": "ainsi le système des uns et des autres est incomplet.", "4272": "Les premiers ignorent ou négligent les causes matérielles et physiques, et les seconds, les causes efficientes et finales.", "4273": "Celui donc qui nous a le premier fait connaître avec clarté ces deux genres de causes, et a joint à celle qui agit et opère, selon les lumières de la raison, un sujet qui en reçoit nécessairement l’impression, celui-là justifie son opinion et la mienne de toute imputation calomnieuse.", "4274": "En donnant à la divination pour sujet l’esprit humain, et pour instrument le souffle, ou la vapeur qui produit l’enthousiasme, nous ne lui ôtons pas l’influence de la raison et de la divinité.", "4275": "D’abord la terre, qui produit ces exhalaisons, et le soleil, qui donne à la terre, les diverses températures qu’elle éprouve, sont, par une suite de la tradition de nos pères, honorés comme des dieux.", "4276": "Nous ajoutons ensuite que les génies président à la température et qu’ils lui donnent plus ou moins d’activité, afin de contenir le délire et l’enthousiasme de ceux qui en ressentent l’impression, de modérer leur esprit, et de les garantir de tout accident fâcheux.", "4277": "Cette supposition n’a rien d’absurde, rien d’impossible, et ce n’est pas la contredire que d’offrir des sacrifices, de couronner les victimes, et de leur faire des libations avant que de consulter l’oracle.", "4278": "Les prêtres et les ministres chargés d’immoler la victime, de répandre les libations sur sa tête, d’observer son agitation et son tremblement, ne

que l’oracle donnera sa réponse, et qu’un défaut dans cette cérémonie annonce le contraire, je ne vois pas quelle conséquence on en peut tirer contre ce que j’ai dit plus haut.", "4286": "Toute faculté produit bien ou mal son effet naturel, suivant que les circonstances lui sont favorables ou non.", "4287": "Et comme nous ne pouvons pas juger certainement du caractère de ces circonstances, il est naturel que Dieu nous le fasse connaître par des signes.Je crois aussi que les exhalaisons qui s’élèvent de la terre n’ont pas toujours la même vertu, et qu’elles sont tantôt plus, tantôt moins fortes :", "4288": "la preuve sur laquelle je m’appuie a pour témoins une foule d’étrangers, et tous les ministres qui servent habituellement dans ce temple.", "4289": "La chapelle où l’on place ceux qui viennent consulter l’oracle n’est ni bien souvent, ni dans des temps réglés, mais par des intervalles purement fortuits, remplie d’une odeur suave, qui, s’exhalant du sanctuaire comme d’une source abondante, affecte les assistants d’une sensation pareille à celle des parfums les plus doux et les plus précieux.", "4290": "Il est probable que cette vapeur est excitée par la chaleur, ou par quelque autre cause locale.Si cette opinion paraît manquer de vraisemblance, du moins ne peut-on nier que la pythie elle-même n’éprouve en divers temps des impressions plus ou moins vives dans cette partie de l’ame qui est frappée de l’esprit prophétique, et qu’elle ne soit pas toujours aussi bien disposée qu’une harmonie dont les accords ne souffrent aucune variation.", "4291": "Entre les mouvements et les affections pénibles qui agissent sur son corps et pénètrent jusqu’à son ame, il en est beaucoup qu’elle sent, et un plus grand nombre qui lui sont inconnus;", "4292": "lorsqu’elle en est saisie, il serait mieux pour elle de ne pas approcher du sanctuaire pour y prêter son ministère au dieu, parcequ’elle n’a pas alors toute la pureté nécessaire, et qu’elle est comme un instrument bien fait à la vérité, et bien sonore, mais qui n’est pas d’accord.", "4293": "Le vin n’affecte pas toujours de même un buveur, ni le son de la flûte, un homme sujet à l’enthousiasme.", "4294": "L’un

fréquemment des songes et des visions, et s’ils y ajoutent plus de foi que d’autres, c’est que leur imagination se portant successivement sur une foule d’objets, elle rencontre quelquefois juste, comme, à force de tirer de l’arc, on frappe quelquefois le but.", "4303": "Lofs donc que l’imagination et la faculté divinatrice se trouvent en rapport avec la disposition de l’esprit prophétique, les prophètes sont nécessairement saisis de l’enthousiasme.", "4304": "Si elles sont dans une disposition contraire, ou il n’y a point d’enthousiasme, ou il éclate en un trouble violent, en un désordre convulsif qui le rend absolument sans effet, ou même très dangereux.", "4305": "C’est ce qui est arrivé depuis peu à la pythie, qui en a été la victime.", "4306": "Des étrangers étaient venus de loin pour consulter l’oracle.", "4307": "La victime, aux premières libations, ne fit aucun mouvement et parut insensible.", "4308": "Les prêtres cependant les continuèrent à l’envi les uns des autres, et à

répugnance.", "4311": "Aux premières paroles qu’elle prononça, On reconnut, à l’âpreté de sa voix, qui sortait avec l’impétuosité d’un vaisseau que les flots entraînent, que le dieu n’agissait point sur elle, et qu’elle était saisie d’un esprit muet et malin.", "4312": "Enfin, n’étant plus maîtresse d’elle-même, elle s’élança hors du sanctuaire en poussant des cris horribles et se roulant à terre;", "4313": "en sorte que tout le monde prit la fuite, non-seulement ceux qui consultaient l’oracle, mais le prophète Nicandre lui-même, et tous les prêtres qui l’assistaient.", "4314": "Ils rentrèrent un moment après, et l’emportèrent hors du temple sans connaissance;", "4315": "elle ne vécut que très peu de jours.", "4316": "Aussi exige-t-on que la pythie se conserve dans la plus grande pureté, et s’interdise tout commerce avec les étrangers.", "4317": "Les signes qu’ils veulent voir dans la victime, avant que de consulter l’oracle, ont pour objet de s’assurer de la volonté du dieu,

même manière sur tous ceux qu’il anime.", "4319": "Il est, comme on l’a déjà dit, pour ceux qui sont bien disposés, le,principe et comme le foyer des affections qui opèrent l’enthousiasme.", "4320":

pas de les approfondir aujourd’hui, renvoyons-en la discussion à un autre moment, avec celle des doutes de Philippe sur Apollon et le soleil.Ce Tut autrefois une question fort agitée parmi les philosophes, de savoir si l’on pouvait enseigner la vertu, ou si elle était dans l’homme un attribut de son ame, qui, né avec lui, s’y conservât sans instruction et sans élude.", "4327": "Platon a traité à fond ce sujet dans un de ses dialogues intitulé Menon, du nom du sophiste à qui il fait soutenir que la vertu peut être le fruit de l’enseignement.", "4328": "Socrate combat ses raisons, et il décide qu’elle n’est point, dans l’homme, l’effet de l’instruction.", "4329": "Mais il prétend aussi qu’elle n’est pas, en lui, une suite de la nature, et que ceux qui la possèdent la doivent à la bonté de Dieu, qui seul la produit dans leur ame.", "4330": "Cette controverse, source de toutes celles où l’on a cherché à définir la grace, n’est qu’un sophisme qui tend à anéantir la puissance du libre arbitre.", "4331": "Plutarque fait voir ici que la vertu n’apparaissant qu’en germe dans l’ame humaine, a besoin, comme toutes ses autres facultés, d’étre développée et éclairée par l’expérience

autres philosophes sur la vertu, non pas simplement pour en faire l’histoire, mais afin que l’exposition de leurs sentiments jette plus de lumière et de certitude sur les principes que

à chacun ce qui lui appartient, est la justice;", "4390": "quand elle nous dirige dans le discernement de ce qu’il faut fuir ou éviter, elle est la tempérance.", "4391": "Inspire-t-elle le courage de supporter les maux, c’est la force.", "4392": "Ceux qui défendent ce sentiment de Zénon veulent que par la prudence ce soit la science qu’il ait désignée.Chrysippe, qui croit que chaque qualité forme

affection, comme une habitude de la partie supérieure de l’ame, produite par la raison, ou plutôt comme la raison même, invariablement fixée à ses principes de droiture.", "4397": "Ils ne croient pas qu’il y ait en nous une faculté sensuelle et irraisonnable, qui par sa nature diffère de la raison1.", "4398": "Cette partie principale de l’ame qu’ils appellent intelligence, devient, disent-ils, vice ou vertu, selon les changements qu’elle éprouve dans ses affections et ses habitudes.", "4399": "Elle n’a rien en elle d’irraisonnable;", "4400": "mais on lui attribue cette qualité lorsque la cupidité, prenant le dessus, se rend sourde aux conseils de la raison, et nous porte à des actions illégitimes.", "4401": "Ils veulent que la passion elle-même soit la raison, mais corrompue et dépravée par des jugements faux et pervers qui l’entraînent hors d’elle-même.", "4402": "Ils semblent tous avoir ignoré que chacun de nous est véritablement un être double et composé;", "4403": "du moins n’ont-ils connu que cette composition, qui résulte de l’union de l’ame avec le corps, trop frappante pour n’être pas aperçue de tout le monde;", "4404": "mais ils n’ont pas vu que l’ame elle-même est en quelque sorte composée de deux natures différentes;", "4405": "que sa partie ir raisonnable est comme un second corps, uni à la raison par des liens intimes et nécessaires.Pythagore cependant paraît avoir connu cette seconde composition, à en juger par l’estime qu’il faisait de la musique.", "4406": "Il la regardait comme un moyen puissant de calmer et d’adoucir l’ame, dont il savait que toutes les facultés ne sont pas également dociles à la voix de l’instruction et des conseils;", "4407": "que souvent la parole est trop faible pour les ramener du vice à la vertu;", "4408": "qu’alors, pour empêcher qu’elles ne soient entièrement indociles aux lois de la philosophie, il faut employer une persuasion plus puissante, plus capable de manier, et, pour ainsi dire, d’apprivoiser ces affections rebelles.Platon a vu avec la dernière évidence que l’ame du monde n’est pas un être simple, un dans sa nature, et sans composition;", "4409": "mais qu’elle est un mélange du principe de l’étre toujours le même, et de celui de l’être changeant.", "4410": "D’un côté, elle suit dans sa marche un ordre régulier et constant que rien ne dérange.", "4411": "De l’autre, divisée en mouvements opposés, elle parcourt des cercles et des révolutions contraires, d’où naissent les divers êtres qui composent l’univers.", "4412": "L’âme humaine, qui n’est qu’une portion de celle du monde, formée sur des nombres et des proportions analogues à ceux de cette ame universelle, n’est pas non plus simple dans sa nature et dans ses affections.", "4413": "Elle a deux facultés;", "4414": "l’une intelligente et raisonnable, faite par sa nature pour maîtriser l’homme et pour le gouverner;", "4415": "l’autre, irraisonnable, déréglée, siège des passions et des erreurs, a besoin d’être régie par une faculté supérieure.", "4416": "Cette dernière se subdivise en deux autres, dont l’une, corporelle et soumise aux désirs du corps, est appelée la partie concupiscible.", "4417": "L’autre s’unit quelquefois avec celle-ci, et quelquefois se déclare contre elle en faveur de la raison, à qui elle prête sa force et sa vigueur :", "4418": "c’est la partie irascible.", "4419": "Platon prouve cette division par la résistance que la raison oppose aux passions et à la partie irascible :", "4420": "car des facultés souvent révoltées contre la partie supérieure de notre ame, sont nécessairement d’une autre nature qu’elle.Aristote a fait un grand usage de ces principes, comme on le voit par ses écrits;", "4421": "seulement, dans ses derniers ouvrages, il a joint la partie irascible de l’ame à la concupiscible, parceque la colère n’est, selon lui, qu’un désir violent de se venger du tort qu’on a reçu.", "4422": "Mais il a cru constamment que la partie irraisonnable, qui est le siège des passions, différait essentiellement de la raison;", "4423": "non quelle eri soit absolument privée, comme la partie sensible, qui végète et se nourrit, qui, naturellement indocile, et sourde à la voix de la raison est en quelque sorte une production du corps, et lui est intimement unie.", "4424": "La partie concupiscible n’a pas proprement la raison en partage, mais elle a une pente naturelle à l’écouter, à lui obéir, à se former sur elle, lorsqu’une vie animale et voluptueuse ne l’a pas entièrement corrompue.Ceux qui s’étonnent qu’une faculté privée de raison obéisse à la partie raisonnable, ignorent sans doute jusqu’où va le pouvoir de la raison pour conduire et pour gouverner, non par une autorité dure et tyrannique, mais par une douce et insinuante persuasion, bien plus efficace que la contrainte et la violence.", "4425": "En effet, les esprits, les nerfs, les os, et toutes les autres parties de notre corps, ne sont-elles pas privées d’intelligence?", "4426": "Cependant à peine la raison tirant, pour ainsi dire, les rênes, a donné le signal de sa volonté, que tout s’étend, se dispose, et s’empresse d’obéir.", "4427": "Veut-elle marcher, déjà les pieds sont

la raison, c’est le calme subit où rentrent nos sens, lorsque, émus par la présence des objets qui les flattent, ils sentent que la raison et les lois leur en interdisent la jouissance.", "4431": "Qu’un homme ait conçu de l’amour pour une personne qu’il ne connaît pas, et à qui la nature né lui permet pas de s’unir, dès qu’il vient à la reconnaître, ses désirs s éteignent au premier avertissement de la raison, et les sens eux-mêmes se conforment à ce qu’elle prescrit.", "4432": "Souvent encore, après avoir mangé certains mets avec la plus grande satisfaction, si l’on apprend que c’étaient des viandes impures dont la loi défendait l’usage, non-seulement la réflexion en fait concevoir une peine intérieure, mais le corps lui-même, agité par ces remords, en éprouve un soulèvement général.", "4433": "Je craindrais qu’on ne m’accusât de vouloir séduire par des images trop agréables, et faites pour plaire aux jeunes gens, si j’apportais en preuve de cette opinion les harpes, les lyres, les flûtes et les autres instruments que l’art a inventés pour rendre par les accords les mouvements des passions humaines.", "4434": "Ces corps, quoique privés de sentiment, partagent notre joie, notre tristesse, nos chants, nos plaisirs, et expriment avec énergie les volontés, les affections et les mœurs de ceux qui les touchent.", "4435": "Zénon mena, dit-on, un jour ses disciples au théâtre pour y entendre le musicien Amébée1.", "4436": "« Allons apprendre.", "4437": "leur dit-il, de quelle harmonie sont capables les entrailles des animaux, les nerfs, les os, et le bois même,

l’instruction et l’habitude amènent enfin à prononcer des paroles bien articulées, qui, au premier signe de leur maître, font des mouvements et des tours, et servent à nos amusements et à nos besoins.", "4439": "Après avoir lu dans Homère qu’Achille exhorte au combat les hommes et les chevaux, faut-il être surpris que la partie de notre ame qui desire, qui s’irrite, qui s’attriste et se réjouit, obéisse à la raison, en prenne les affections et les sentiments?", "4440": "Est-elle donc étrangère à la partie supérieure de notre ame, séparée d’elle et jetée, pour ainsi dire, dans un moule extérieur dont on la contraigne par violence de prendre la forme?", "4441": "Ne lui est-elle pas, au contraire, unie par la nature même d’une manière si intime, qu’elle existe et vit avec elle, et par l’effet de l’habitude se pénètre de sa substance?", "4442": "C’est pour cela qu’on lui donne le nom de mœurs.Car les mœurs, pour en donner ici une idée, sont une qualité de la partie irraisonnable;", "4443": "et on les appelle ainsi, parceque cette qualité, imprimée par la raison dans cette partie de l’ame, est une suite de l’habitude.", "4444": "La raison ne veut pas détruire entièrement les passions, ce qui ne serait ni possible ni utile, mais seulement les renfermer dans de justes bornes, et par là produire les vertus morales qui n’opèrent pas l’anéantissement total des passions, mais qui les règlent et les modèrent.", "4445": "Et ces vertus sont le fruit de la prudence, qui ramène aune disposition sage et honnête l’activité naturelle des passions.On distingue trois choses dans l’ame :", "4446": "la puissance, la passion et l’habitude.", "4447": "La puissance est le principe et comme la matière de la passion, par exemple la pente à la colère, à la honte, à l’audace.", "4448": "La passion est le mouvement actuel de cette puissance, comme la colère, la honte et l’audace.", "4449": "L’habitude est la force du penchant qu’un exercice fréquent donne à la puissance, et qui fait le vice ou la vertu, suivant que la passion a été bien ou mal dirigée par la raison.", "4450": "[Mais comme toutes les vertus ne consistent pas dans ce juste milieu qui constitue les vertus morales, il faut examiner en quoi les unes diffèrent des autres, et pour cela, reprendre de plus haut.", "4451": "Il est des choses qui subsistent simplement pour elles-mêmes;",

déterminent, et ces attraits que l’habitude produit dans nos affections, ont besoin d’être gouvernés par la raison, qui les retient dans un juste milieu.", "4469": "Cette partie irraisonnable, qui est

faire abandonner, la raison le ranime aussitôt, et le rappelle à son devoir.", "4475": "Au contraire, cet attrait est-il trop désordonné, se laisse-t-il emporter sans mesure, la raison modère sa violence, le fait rentrer dans l’ordre, et par les bornes quelle prescrit aux passions, produit dans la partie irraisonnable les vertus morales, également éloignées du défaut et de l’excès.", "4476": "Toutes les vertus, jele répète, ne consistent pas dans un juste milieu.", "4477": "La sagesse, qui, indépendante de la partie irraisonnable, réside dans cette faculté pure de notre ame inaccessible aux passions, est une propriété supérieure de la raison qui trouve sa perfection en elle-même.", "4478": "C’est elle qui nous donne la science, cette qualité divine si essentielle à notre bonheur.",

le blanc et le noir.", "4484": "Un nombre est moyen entre deux autres, s’il contient l’un, et qu’il soit contenu dans l’autre :", "4485": "tel est huit entre quatre et douze.", "4486": "Enfin une

vertu.", "4488": "Elle n’est pas un composé de deux vices;", "4489": "elle ne contient pas ce qui est en deçà du devoir, et n’est pas contenue dans ce qui est au delà.", "4490": "Elle n’est pas totalement exempte du trouble des passions, dans lesquelles se trouvent les deux extrêmes, le défaut et l’excès.", "4491": "Ce milieu donc qui constitue la vertu morale, est semblable à celui de

continence ne soit qu’une vertu imparfaite et, pour ainsi dire, subalterne, parcequ’elle n’est pas ce juste milieu qui résulte de l’accord de la partie inférieure de l’ame avec la partie supérieure,

cupidité, qui, indifférente à ces sortes de matières, ne cherche pas même à s’en occuper.", "4587": "La raison donc embrasse avec joie la vérité dès qu’elle la découvre, et abandonne le mensonge,

facultés différentes, comme le mouvement diffère de ce qui le produit.", "4628": "Chrysippe luimême, qui, dans plusieurs endroits de ses ouvrages, définit la patience et la continence des habitudes

la partie animale, laquelle, tirant son origine des sens, et, pour ainsi dire, enfoncée dans le corps, participe à ses affections, et s’en pénètre entièrement.", "4661": "Et peut-on en douter, quand

chantant, et de ne pas se montrer moins courageux que les cygnes.«", "4598": "Quand il fut habillé, il dit aux matelots qu’il voulait chanter un hymne en l’honneur d’Apollon, pour obtenir de ce dieu

disposaient à le tuer.", "4602": "Dès qu’Arion les vit tirer leurs épées, et le pilote se couvrir le visage, il s’élança dans la mer, le plus loin qu’il put du vaisseau.", "4603": "Mais avant que son

d’ailleurs de la rapidité de sa course par l’éloignement où il était du vaisseau, il desira de se sauver, moins par crainte de la mort ou par amour de la vie, que par l’ambition de passer pour un homme chéri des dieux, et pour avoir une pleine conviction de leur puissance.«", "4607": "En même temps, comme il considérait le ciel tout parsemé d’étoiles, la lune qui se levait pure et brillante, la mer parfaitement calme et aussi unie qu’une plaine que les dauphins sillonnaient dans leur marche, il lui vint en pensée que la justice a plus d’un œil ouvert sur les humains, et que tous ces êtres sont autant d’organes avec lesquels Dieu examine tout ce qui se passe sur la terre et sur la mer.", "4608": "Ces réflexions rendirent à ses sens fatigués toute leur vigueur;", "4609": "et quand enfin, en approchant du promontoire, dont les bords étaient escarpés, il vit les dauphins le tourner avec précaution, pour éviter le danger et pour le conduire sûrement à terre, comme un vaisseau dans le port, il ne douta plus que la main de Dieu même ne l’eût ainsi conduit.«", "4610": "Après ce récit, continua Gorgias, nous lui demandâmes où il pensait que le vaisseau dût aborder.", "4611": "Il nous répondit que ce serait à Corinthe, mais qu’il n’y arriverait que fort tard, parceque, s’étant élancé dans la mer au soleil couchant, il n’avait pas fait moins de cinq cents stades, et que, dans ce moment même, le calme avait commencé.", "4612": "»Gorgias ajouta qu’après avoir pris le nom du pilote et du patron, avec le signalement du navire, il avait envoyé des soldats dans des chaloupes pour s’assurer de tous les endroits de la côte où l’on pouvait aborder;", "4613": "qu’il avait aussi amené Arion, en le cachant avec soin, de peur que les matelots, apprenant qu’il était en vie, ne prissent la fuite;", "4614": "qu’enfin cette aventure avait tous les caractères d’un événement miraculeux;", "4615": "car, en arrivant à Corinthe, il avait appris que ses soldats s’étaient emparés du navire, et le gardaient dans le port avec les matelots et les passagers.Dès qu’il eut achevé, Périandre lui ordonna d’aller surle-champ les faire mettre en prison, et d’empêcher que personne pût les approcher et leur dire qu’Arion était sauvé.« Moquez-vous maintenant, dit alors Ésope, de ce que je fais parler des corbeaux et des geais, en voyant les dauphins faire de telles prouesses.—", "4616":

illégitime avec la fille de son hôte.", "4623": "On soupçonna le poète d’avoir eu, dès l’origine, connaissance de ce crime, et même de l’avoir favorisé;", "4624": "et quoiqu’il en fût très innocent,

depuis, a porté le nom de Troile.", "4627": "Le corps d’Hér siode, à l’instant même qu'il entra dans la mer, fut reçu par une troupe de dauphins, qui le portèrent auprès de Rhyum et de Molycrie4.",

cadavre, surpris comme on peut croire, ils coururent au rivage, reconnurent Hésiode, dont le corps portait les traces récentes du meurtre, et n’eurent rien tant à cœur que de venger la mort d’un poète si célèbre.", "4630": "Ils ne furent pas longtemps à trouver les meurtriers, et, s’étant saisis d’eux, ils les précipitèrent dans la mer, et rasèrent leur maison.", "4631": "Hésiode fut enterré dans le bois même où il avait été assassiné.", "4632": "Mais les étrangers ignorent où est son tombeau, parcequ’on le cache avec soin, pour le dérober aux recherches des Orchoméniens, qui, d’après la réponse de l’oracle, veulent enlever les restes d’Hésiode, et les ensevelir dans leur pays1.«", "4633": "Si les dauphins montrent tant d’intérêt pour les hommes, même après leur mort, il est bien plus vraisemblable qu’ils les secourent vivants, surtout lorsqu’ils sont attirés par les accents d’une voix ou les sons d’une flûte.", "4634": "Car nous savons tous à présent que ces poissons aiment et recherchent-la musique, et que, dans le calme, ils nagent auprès des vaisseaux où ils entendent chanter ou jouer des instruments, et se plaisent à les suivre;", "4635": "ils s’amusent aussi de voir nager les enfants, et plongent avec eux à l'envi.", "4636": "Aussi y a-t-il partout une convention tacite qui pourvoit à leur sûreté.", "4637": "Personne ne cherche à les prendre et ne leur fait de mal;", "4638": "seulement, lorsqu’ils entrent dans les filets, et qu’ils troublent la pêche', on les châtie comme des enfants qui ont mérité d’être punis.", "4639": "Je me souviens aussi d’avoir

Sminthée.", "4645": "On l’habilla donc magnifiquement, et lorsqu’on fut au lieu destiné, et qu’on se disposait, après les prières d’usage, àla précipiter dans la mer, un jeune homme de la troupe nommé Énalus, plein de courage, comme il le fit voir, et qui aimait cette jeune personne, conçut en ce moment, contre tout espoir, un vif désir de la sauver.", "4646": "Il la saisit à l’instant où on la précipitait, l’embrasse étroitement et s’élance avec elle dans la mer.", "4647": "Il courut d’abord un bruit qu’ils s’étaient sauvés, et, quoiqu’il fût sans fondement, on le crut assez généralement dans l’armée.", "4648": "Dans la suite, Énalus, dit-on, parut à Lesbos, et raconta comment des dauphins l’avaient porté à travers les flots, lui et son amante, jusqu’au rivage, sans qu’ils eussent eu le moindre mal.", "4649": "Il ajoutait beaucoup d’autres particularités, qui, plus merveilleuses encore, semblaient imaginées à plaisir pour étonner et charmer un vulgaire crédule, mais qu’un fait certain, arrivé dans le moment qu’il parlait, rendit croyables.", "4650": "Il s’éleva tout à coup, auprès de nie, un énorme flot qui fit reculer tout le monde et qui s’avança jusqu’au temple de

l’instrument dé Dieu;", "4657": "et de même que, dans les divers mouvements du corps, si les uns sont purement mécaniques, la plupart, et les plus beaux, sont commandés par l’ame, ainsi l’ame, l’instrument le plus noble de tous, agit tantôt par elle-même, tantôt sous les ordres de Dieu, qui la meut et la gouverne à son gré.", "4658": "En effet, ajouta-t-il, si le feu, le vent, l’eau, les nuées et la pluie sont des instruments dont Dieu se sert, ou pour la nourriture et la conservation de plusieurs de ses créatures, ou pour leur perte et leur destruction, ne serait-il pas étrange qu’il n’employât les animaux à aucun de ses ouvrages?", "4659": "N’est-il pas plus vraisemblable que, dépendant tous de son pouvoir, ils lui obéissent, et suivent les mouvements qu’il leur donne avec la

Périandre;", "4664": "j’ai souvent voulu vous demander ce que signifient toutes ces grenouilles qui y sont Sculptées au pied d’un palmier, et quel rapport elles ont avec Apollon ou avec celui qui a

de Naxos racontent ce fait.Aristote dit que Polycrite n’avait pas été prise par les Érythréens, mais que Diognète, ayant eu une occasion de la voir, en était devenu éperdument amoureux, et lui avait promis de faire tout ce qu’elle désirerait, pourvu qu’elle répondît à son amour.", "7806": "Polycrite le lui promit, à condition qu’il lui accorderait une seule chose, pour laquelle, au rapport de ce

concitoyens.", "7809": "Par là, ceux de Naxos se trouvèrent égaux en force aux Milésiens, et firent la paix aux conditions qu’ils voulurent.Il y avait à Phocée1 deux frères jumeaux de la race des Codrides1, nommés Phobus et Blepsus.", "7810": "Phobus fut le premier qui, au rapport de Charon2, historien de Lampsaque, se précipita du promontoire de Leucate dans la mer.", "7811": "Son rang et son pouvoir l’égalaient presque aux rois.", "7812": "Il fit, pour ses propres affaires, un voyage à Parium3, où il se lia d’amitié avec Mandron, roi des Bebryces, surnommés Pithyesses4, et le secourut dans la guerre qu’il avait à soutenir contre des peuples voisins.", "7813": "Mandron, au départ de Phobus, lui fit les plus vives démonstrations d’amitié, et lui offrit de plus de lui céder une portion de la ville et de son territoire, s’il voulait établir à Pithyesse une colonie de Phocéens.Phobus ayant fait agréer la proposition à ses sujets, envoya son frère à Pithyesse avec les nouveaux colons, et Mandron exécuta fidèlement ce qu’il avait promis.", "7814": "Les Phocéens en peu de temps acquirent de grandes richesses, par le butin qu’ils faisaient sans cesse sur les Barbares du

prince vertueux et juste, d’user avec les Grecs de mauvaise foi, ils résolurent de profiter d’un voyage qu’il fit pour se défaire d’eux par ruse.Lampsace, fille de Mandron, instruite de leur dessein, essaya d’abord d’en détourner ses amis et ses proches, et leur représenta quelle impiété, quel forfait ils allaient commettre en faisant périr des bienfaiteurs qui, après les avoir si utilement secourus dans la guerre, étaient devenus leurs concitoyens.", "7818": "Toutes ses représentations furent sans effet.", "7819": "Alors elle fit dire secrètement aux Grecs ce qu’on tramait contre eux,

de la ville;", "7821": "ensuite, se partageant en deux bandes, les uns s’emparent des remparts, et les autres font main-basse sur les habitants.", "7822": "Devenus maîtres de la ville, ils appelèrent Mandron, pour délibérer avec lui sur ce qu’ils avaient à faire.", "7823": "Dans cet intervalle, Lampsace étant morte de maladie, ils l’ensevelirent avec les plus grands honneurs, et donnèrent son nom à la ville.", "7824": "Mandron, pour éviter tout soupçon de trahison, ne voulut pas habiter avec eux;", "7825": "seulement il leur demanda de lui renvoyer les femmes et les enfants de ceux qui avaient été tués.", "7826": "Ils les lui envoyèrent avec la plus grande fidélité, et, peu contents des honneurs héroïques1 qu’ils avaient d’abord décernés à Lampsace, ils lui sacrifièrent, dans la suite,

tyrannie de Cyrène, fit périr un grand nombre de citoyens, tua de sa main Mélanippe, grand-prêtre d’Apollon, et s’empara du sacerdoce.", "7830": "Il fit mourir ensuite Phédimus, le mari d’Arétaphile,

allait enterrer, les perçaient à coups de poignard, et leur appliquaient des lames ardentes, pour s’assurer si quelques citoyens, en contrefaisant le mort, ne sortaient pas secrètement de la

défaire de son mari par le poison.", "7837": "Elle s’en procura de plusieurs espèces;", "7838": "et comme elle faisait l’essai de chacun, elle fut découverte et dénoncée au tyran.Sur les premiers

la força de l’abandonner.", "7850": "Nicocrate, persuadé de son innocence, fit cesser la torture, et eut regret de l’y avoir appliquée.", "7851": "Bientôt même, emporté par son amour, il revint à Arétaphile, vécut avec elle comme par le passé, et chercha à regagner le cœur de sa femme, en lui prodiguant les caresses et les honneurs.", "7852": "Mais Arétaphile, qui avait résisté aux tourments

Arétaphile et de suivre ses conseils, il fit bientôt voir, par son insolence et la brutalité de sa conduite, qu’il avait voulu ôter la vie à son frère, mais non détruire la tyrannie.", "7863": "Il conserva cependant toujours du respect et de la déférence pour Arétaphile.", "7864": "Elle, de son côté, dissimulant sa haine sans lui résister ouvertement, préparait en secret l’exécution des nouveaux projets qu’elle méditait.", "7865": "D’abord elle lui suscita la guerre d’Afrique, en excitant sous main un petit prince de cette contrée, nommé Anabus, à faire des courses dans le pays et à

main hardie, l’entraîne avec force, et le livre au barbare.", "7873": "Les Africains s’en emparent, le çhargent de chaînes, et le gardent avec soin, jusqu’à ce que les amis d’Arétaphile eussent

délibéra avec ses frères, et feignant de consentir au mariage, elle dit au tyran d’en conférer avec eux.", "7985": "Il les vit à cet effet;", "7986": "mais comme ils mettaient à la conclusion de l’affaire des délais affectés, Éryxo fit dire à Laarque, par une de ses esclaves, que le retardement apporté par ses frères à son mariage cesserait bientôt, s’ils avaient eu une fois commerce ensemble;", "7987": "qu’ils seraient les premiers à presser le mariage;", "7988": "qu’il vînt donc la trouver la nuit, et que ce préliminaire amènerait tout à une heureuse fin.", "7989": "Laarque, ravi de ces témoignages de tendresse de la part d’Èryxo, se livre aux plus flatteuses espérances, et lui fait répondre qu’il se rendra chez elle au premier avis qu’elle lui fera donner.", "7990": "Éryxo avait tout concerté avec Polyarque, l’aîné de ses frères.", "7991": "Le jour est pris pour le rendez-vous, et Polyarque se cache dans l’appartement de sa sœur, avec deux jeunes gens armés qui avaient à venger la mort de leur père, que le tyran venait de faire périr.", "7992": "Laarque se rendit sans gardes chez Éryxo, où sur-le-champ il fut assailli par les deux jeunes gens, qui le tuèrent à coups d’épée, lis jetèrent le corps par-dessus les murailles.", "7993": "On montra Battus au peuple, comme l'héritier légitime des États de son père, et Polyarque rétablit à Cyrène l’ancienne forme de gouvernement.Il y avait dans la ville un grand nombre de soldats d’Amasis, roi d’Égypte, dont Laarque avait éprouvé la fidélité, et c’était surtout par leur moyen qu’il s’était rendu redoutable à Cyrène.", "7994": "Ils députèrent vers Amasis quelques uns d’entre eux, pdur accuser Polyarque et Éryxo.", "7995": "Ce prince irrité se préparait à faire la guerre aux Cyrénéens, lorsque sa mère mourut.", "7996": "Le soin des funérailles ayant suspendu ses projets, on apprit à Cyrène la résolution qu’il avait prise.", "7997": "Polyarque crut devoir se rendre auprès de lui, afin de se justifier.", "7998": "Éryxo voulut y aller avec son frère, résolue de partager ses périls;", "7999": "et leur mère Critola, quoique fort avancée en âge, les y accompagna :", "8000": "elle était sœur de l'ancien Battus, surnommé l’Heureux;", "8001": "ce qui lui donnait une grande considération.", "8002": "Quand ils furent en Egypte, ils n’eurent pas de peine à faire approuver leur conduite à tous les courtisans d’Amasis, et ce prince luimême ne put s’empêcher d’admirer la sagesse et le courage d’Éryxo.", "8003": "Il leur rendit les mêmes honneurs qu’à des rois, et après les avoir comblés dé présents, il les renvoya dans leur pays.Xénocrite de Cumes 1 ne mérite pas moins notre admiration par la manière dont elle se défit du tyran Aristodème, surnommé le Mou.", "8004": "Quelques uns ont cru qu’on l’appelait ainsi à cause de sa mollesse, mais c’est une erreur.", "8005": "Ce surnom, qui signifie impubère1, lui fut donné par les Barbares, parcequ’avant l’âge de puberté, étant encore au nombre de ces jeunes garçons qui portaient de longs cheveux, et qu’on appelait, pour cette raison, coronistes1, il s’était signalé dans les guerres contre les Barbares voisins, non-seulement par sa hardiesse et par ses exploits, mais encore par sa prudence et son adresse.", "8006": "Ses grandes qualités lui attirèrent l’admiration de ses concitoyens, et le firent élever aux premiers emplois.", "8007": "Il fut envoyé au secours des Romaifts, lorsqu’ils étaient vivement pressés par les Étrusques, qui voulaient rétablir sur le trône Tarquin le Superbe.", "8008": "Dans cette expédition, qui dura longtemps, il s’attacha singulièrement à caresser les soldats, et en faisant le personnage d’un démagogue plutôt que celui d’un général d’armée, il leur persuada de le seconder dans le projet qu’il avait formé de détruire le Sénat et de chasser de la ville les meilleurs et les plus puissants citoyens.", "8009": "Devenu par leur secours tyran de Cumes, il se surpassa lui-même en scélératesse, par les indignités qu’il exerça contre les femmes et les enfants des familles les plus honnêtes.", "8010": "On rapporte qu’il forçait ceux-ci à laisser croître leurs cheveux, à se parer avec mollesse, et qu’il obligeait les autres de se faire tondre en rond, de porter des robes pareilles à celles qu’ont les jeunes gens avant l’âge de puberté et des tuniques fort courtes.", "8011": "Il devint passionnément amoureux d’une jeune fille nommée Xénocrite, dont le père était alors en exil, et sans chercher à gagner sa confiance et son amour, il la prit d’autorité, persuade qu’elle s’estimerait heureuse de vivre avec lui et de voir que tout le monde enviât son bonheur.", "8012": "Mais Xénocrite, moins touchée de ces prétendus avantages qu’indignée de se voir unie à un homme avec qui elle n’avait pas contracté un mariage légitime, desirait, autant que les plus vifs ennemis du tyran, la liberté de sa patrie.Aristodème, dans ce même temps, faisait creuser un fossé d’une étendue considérable, sans aucune espèce de besoin ou d’utilité, et par le seul plaisir de vexer ses sujets et de les accabler de travaux;", "8013": "ils étaient tous obligés de transporter par jour une certaine quantité de terre.", "8014": "Une femme, qui travaillait comme les autres, vit un jour Aristodème venir de son côté.", "8015": "Aussitôt elle détourne les yeux, et se couvre le visage avec un des pans de sa robe.", "8016": "Lorsqu’il fut parti, les jeunes gens lui demandèrent en raillant pourquoi elle craignait de voir Aristodème, et qu’elle ne faisait pas de même pour les autres.", "8017": "« C’est, répondit-elle, que de tous les Cuméens, il n’y a qu’Aristodème qui soit un homme.", "8018": "»Ces paroles firent une vive impression sur tous les assistants, et la honte qu’en conçurent les plus généreux leur inspira le dessein d’affranchir Cumes de la tyrannie.", "8019": "Xénocrite, qui les avait entendus, dit qu’elle aimerait mieux porter de la terre et voir son père de retour, que de partager la puissance et la fortune d’Aristodème.", "8020": "Ce discours fortifia dans leur dessein ceux qui avaient conjuré contre lui, et dont Thymotélès était le chef.", "8021": "Xénocrite leur ayant ménagé ime entrée libre et sûre dans le palais, ils attaquèrent le tyran désarmé et sans gardes, et n’eurent pas de peine à se défaire de lui.", "8022": "C’est ainsi que Cumes fut mise en liberté par deux femmes, dont l’une fit naître la première pensée du complot, et l’autre en facilita l’exécution.", "8023": "On voulut combler Xénocrite d’honneurs et de présents;", "8024": "mais elle refusa tout, et ne demanda que la permission de donner la sépulture à Aristodème.", "8025": "Les Cuméens, non contents de lui accorder ce qu’elle desirait, la nommèrent prêtresse de, Cérès, persuadés que ce choix ne serait pas moins agréable à la déesse que convenable à Xénocrite.LA FEMME DE PYTHÈS", "8026": ".La femme de Pythès, qui vivait du temps de Xerxès, roi de Perse, est célèbre par sa sagesse et son humanité.", "8027": "Son mari, dit-on, avait découvert des mines d’or.", "8028": "Les richesses considérables qu’il en tirait ayant allumé en lui une cupidité insatiable, il se livrait tout entier au soin de les exploiter, et forçait tous ses sujets, sans exception, de renoncer à tout autre travail pour fouiller, tirer et nettoyer l’or de ses mines.", "8029": "Il en avait déjà péri plusieurs, et tous les autres perdaient courage, lorsque leurs femmes vinrent en foule trouver la reine, et déposèrent à sa porte les signes de leur supplication.", "8030": "Elle leur donna de bonnes espérances, et les renvoya.", "8031": "Aussitôt elle fait venir des orfèvres en qui elle avait confiance, les enferme dans un des appartements du palais, et leur fait faire des pains d’or, des fruits, de la pâtisserie et d’autres mets qu’elle savait être du goût de son mari, le tout du même métal..", "8032": "Pythès était alors en voyage.", "8033": "A son retour, quand il voulut souper, elle lui fit servir une table et des mets d’or, sans qu’il y eût rien à manger.", "8034": "D’abord Pythès fut charmé de l’adresse avec laquelle ils étaient imités;", "8035": "mais lorsque ses yeux furent rassasiés, il dit qu’on lui servît de quoi souper;", "8036": "mais à chaque chose qu’il demandait, on le lui présentait en or.", "8037": "A la fin, il se fâcha, et dit qu’il avait faim, a Prenez-vous-en à vous-même, lui dit alors sa femme.", "8038": "Vous nous avez fait avoir de l’or en abondance, mais tout le reste nous manque.", "8039": "Tous les arts sont négligés, toutes les branches d’industrie abandonnées;", "8040": "on ne cultive plus les terres, nous avons cessé de semer, de planter, de nous fournir des autres productions de la terre, pour n’en tirer qu’un métal inutile, qui nous donne les plus grands embarras, et qui désole nos sujets.", "8041": "» Ce discours fit impression sur Pythès, et sans abandonner entièrement l’exploitation des mines, il n’y employa que la cinquième partie de ses sujets, et appliqua le reste à l’agriculture et aux autres arts.Lorsque Xerxès partit pour son expédition contre la Grèce, Pythès, qui l’avait reçu avec la plus grande magnificence et lui avait fait de riches présents, lui demanda, pour toute grâce, que, de plusieurs enfants qu’il avait, il lui en laissât un seul pour avoir soin de sa vieillesse.", "8042": "Xerxès, irrité de cette demande, fit égorger et couper par morceaux celui de ses enfants qu’il avait souhaité de garder auprès de lui, et emmena les autres, qui furent tous tués dans différents combats.", "8043": "Pythès, vivement affligé de tant de pertes, éprouva ce qui arrive ordinairement aux âmes faibles et vicieuses.", "8044": "Dégoûté de la vie, il craignait encore plus la mort;", "8045": "ne voulant point vivre et ne pouvant mourir, il prit le parti le plus extraordinaire.", "8046": "Il y avait dans la ville une plate-forme que côtoyait un fleuve nommé Pythopolis.", "8047": "Il se fit construire un tombeau sur cette plate-forme, et détourna le cours du fleuve afin qu’il vînt baigner les pieds de son tombeau.", "8048": "Dès que l’ouvrage fut achevé, il remit dans les mains de sa femme toute l’autorité, et s’enferma dans le tombeau, avec ordre à la reine de n’en jamais approcher, mais de lui envoyer tous les jours son souper dans un bateau, jusqu’à ce qu’elle vît le bateau passer outre sans qu’on eût touché au souper;", "8049": "qu’elle cessât alors de lui rien envoyer, parceque ce serait une preuve qu’il n’existait plus.", "8050": "C’est ainsi qu’il passa le reste de ses jours.", "8051": "Sa femme gouverna avec beaucoup de sagesse, et fit oublier à ses sujets les maux qu’ils avaient soufferte sous le règne de son mari.FIN Dü
