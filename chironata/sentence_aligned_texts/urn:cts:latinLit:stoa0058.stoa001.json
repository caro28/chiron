happiness.", "1706": "For no man can deny that some good is the highest:", "1707": "as it were a great and deep fountain, and from which many brooks and rivers flow.", "1708": "We therefore say

fountain may become a river, and yet the river comes again to the fountain!", "1713": "So every good comes from God, and again to him, and he is the full and perfect good, which is not deficient in

then is some good full of every will, and is deficient in no good ?", "1722": "Then answered I, and said:", "1723": "Very rightly and very rationally thou bast over­ come and convinced me, so that I cannot contradict, or even imagine anything contrary to it, but that it is all even as thou sayest.§", "1724": "II.", "1725": "Then said Wisdom:", "1726": "Now I would that thou shoulder consider studiously until thou discover where the full happi- ness is.", "1727": "Dost thou not then know that all mankind is unani­ mously consenting that God is the origin of all goods, and the ruler of all

would that thing from which it came to him be better than he, if it were so.", "1753": "But it is very foolish, and a very great sin, that any one should thus think of God ;", "1754": "or moreover think that any­ thing was before him, or better than he, or like him.", "1755": "But we must be convinced that God is of all things the best.", "1756": "If thou then believest that God is like as it is among men, that one thing is the man, that is soul and body, and another is his goodness, which God joins and afterwards holds together and regulates;", "1757": "if thou believest that it is so

distinct from another thing is one, and the thing another, though they be together, If therefore anything is distinct from the highest good, then that is not the highest good.", "1759": "It is,

thoughtest that these goods were members of the true happi­ ness, as there are many members in one man, and yet all belong to one body;", "1817": "or whether thou though test that any one of the five goods constituted the true happiness, and then the four other goods were its good, as soul and body consti­ tute one man, and the one man has many members, and nevertheless to these two, that is, to the soul and to the body, belong all these goods of the man, both ghostly and bodily.", "1818": "This then is the good of the body, that a man be fair, and strong, and tall, and broad, and many other goods in addition to these;", "1819": "and yet it is not the body itself, because if that loses any of these goods, it is nevertheless what it was be­ fore.", "1820": "Then the good of the soul is

shouldest meet a man so debased that he is turned from good to evil, thou canst not rightly name him man, but beast.", "2537": "If then thou observest with respect to any man, that he is a rapacious

again into the mire, and wallow therein.", "2546": "When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began he again to sing, and thus said:", "2547": "§", "2548": "I. I CAN relate to thee, from ancient fables, a story very like to the subject which we have just now spoken about.", "2549": "It happened formerly in the Trojan war, that there was a king whose name was Ulysses, who had two countries under the Cæsar.", "2550": "The countries were called Ithaca and Retia, and the Cæsar's name was Agamemnon.", "2551": "When Ulysses went with the Cæsar to the battle, he had some hundred ships.", "2552": "Then were they some ten years in that war.", "2553": "When the king again returned homeward from the Cæsar, and they had conquered the land, he had not more ships than one;", "2554": "but that was a ship with three rows of oars.", "2555": "Then opposed him a great tempest and a stormy sea.", "2556": "He was then driven on an island out in the Wendel sea.",

of royal lineage, and they knew not any other God at that time, but worshipped their kings for gods.", "2559": "Then should the father of Jove be also a god, whose name was Saturn;", "2560": "and

servants, and also of other maidens.", "2566": "As soon as she saw the king driven thither, whom we before mentioned, whose name was Ulysses, then began she to love him, and each of them the other, beyond measure ;", "2567": "so that he for love of her neglected all his kingdom, and his family, and dwelt with her until the time that his thanes would no longer remain with him ;", "2568": "but for love of their country, and on ac­ count of exile, determined to leave him.", "2569": "Then began false men to work spells.", "2570": "And they said that she should by her sorcery overthrow the men,

knew it.", "2580": "That mind was very sorrowful through the miseries which they suffered.", "2581": "Indeed, the men who believed these fictions, nevertheless knew that she by sorcery could not change the minds of men, though she changed the bodies.", "2582": "How great an excellence is that of the mind in comparison of the body!", "2583": "By these things, and the like thou mayest learn,

able to do it;", "2600": "the third, that they accomplish it.", "2601": "For God has decreed to give punish­ ments and miseries to wicked men for their wicked works.", "2602": "Then said I:", "2603":

will be lost to them sooner than either thou or they would expect.", "2607": "For nothing is of long duration in this present life, though it seem to men that it be long.", "2608": "But very frequently the great power of the wicked falls very suddenly, even as a great tree in a wood makes a loud crash when men least expect;", "2609": "and through fear they are always very miserable.",

miserable.", "2612": "If the miseries are all true, which we long ago discoursed about, that the wicked should have in this world, then is it evident that those miseries are infinite which are eternal.", "2613": "Then said I:", "2614": "That is wonderful which thou sayest, and very difficult to be understood by foolish men.", "2615": "But I nevertheless perceive that it appertains well enough to the discourse which we were before holding.", "2616": "Then said he:", "2617": "I am not now speaking to foolish men, but am speaking to those who desire to understand wisdom;", "2618": "for it is a token of wisdom that any one is willing to hear and understand it.", "2619": "But if any of the foolish doubt any of the reasonings which we have already uttered in this same book, let him

argue rightly.", "2621": "If he will do none of these things, then he knows not what he means.§ III.", "2622": "But I can still teach thee another thing, which to foolish men will seem yet more incredible, and is nevertheless suitable enough to the argument which we are holding.", "2623": "Then said I:", "2624": "What thing is that ?", "2625": "Then said he:", "2626": "It is this, that those wicked persons are much happier who in this world have great misery, and manifold punishment for their evil, than those are who have no suffering nor punishment in this world for their guilt.", "2627": "Let no one, however, think that I speak thus merely because I would reprove vices, and praise virtue, and by the example urge and persuade men to good conduct through fear of punishment:",

he:", "2632": "Dost thou recollect what we before said, that is, that the good always had power and happiness, and the wicked never had either ?", "2633": "Then said I:", "2634": "That I remember.", "2635": "Then said he:", "2636": "But what thickest thou, if thou seest any man very unhappy, and yet perceivest something of good in him;", "2637": "is he as unhappy as the man who has no good in him ?", "2638": "Then said I:", "2639": "He appears to me happier, who has something of good.", "2640": "Then said he:", "2641": "But what then dost thou think con­ cerning him who has no good, if he has some addition of evil ?", "2642": "He, thou wilt say, is still more unhappy than the other, through the addition of evil.", "2643": "Then said I:", "2644": "Why should not I think so ?", "2645": "Then said be:", "2646": "Consider that it so appears to thee, and understand with inward mind that the wicked have always something of good among their evil, that is their punishment, which we may very easily, and justly reckon to them as good.", "2647": "But those whose evil is all unpunished in this world, have an evil heavier and more dangerous than any punishment in this world is;", "2648": "that is,, that their evil is un­ punished in this world, which is the most evident token of the greatest evil in this world, and of the worst recompense after this world.", "2649": "Then said I:", "2650": "I cannot deny this.", "2651": "Then said he:", "2652": "Therefore the wicked are more unhappy, because their wickedness is undeservedly forgiven them, than they are if their wickedness is recompensed according to their deserts.", "2653": "Therefore it is right that evil should be inflicted on the wicked, and it is wrong that they should be suffered to go unpunished.", "2654": "Then said I:", "2655": "Who denies this ?", "2656": "Then said be:", "2657": "No man can deny that everything is good which is right, and everything evil which is wrong.", "2658": "Then said I:", "2659": "I am very much troubled with this discourse, and wonder why so righteous a judge should bestow any unjust gift.", "2660": "Then said he:", "2661": "Wherefore sayest thou that ?", "2662": "Then said 1:", "2663": "Because thou before saidst that he did wrong, inasmuch as lie left the wicked unpunished.", "2664": "Then said be:", "2665": "That is his glory, that he is so bountiful, and bestows so abundantly.", "2666": "It is a great gift that he waits till the wicked are sensible of their evil and turn to good.", "2667": "Then said I:", "2668": "Now I understand that it is not an eternal gift which he gives to the wicked, but is rather the delay and waiting of the highest judge.", "2669": "On account of his waiting and forbearance, methinks he is the more despised ;", "2670": "and yet this argument pleases me well enough, and seems to me like enough to what thou before saidst.", "2671": "§ IV.", "2672": "But I beseech thee, now, that thou wouldest tell me whether thou thinkest that the wicked have any punishment after this world;", "2673": "or the good any reward for their goodness ?", "2674": "Then said he:", "2675": "Did I not say to thee before, that the good have recompense for their goodness both here and for ever;", "2676": "and the wicked also have recompense for their evil, both here, and also for ever ?", "2677": "But I will now divide the wicked from the wicked in two parts.", "2678": "For one'part of the wicked shall have eternal punishment, because they have deserved no mercy;", "2679": "and the other part shall be cleansed and proved iu the heavenly fire, as silver here is, because it has some deserving of some mercy, wherefore it may come after these troubles to everlasting honour.", "2680": "Still I could instruct thee more both concerning the good and concerning the evil, if I now had leisure.", "2681": "But I fear that I should neglect what we were be­ fore seeking after, that is, that we would argue so that thou mightest perceive that the wicked have no power, nor any honour, either in this world or in that to come.", "2682": "For for­ merly this appeared to thee the worst of all things, that thou thoughtest they had'too much;", "2683": "and thou always didst lament that they were not always punished:", "2684": "and I always said to thee, that they never are without punishment, though it ap­ pear not so to thee.", "2685": "But I know, however, that thou wilt lament that they have so long time permission to do evil;", "2686": "and I have always said to thee, that the time is a very little while ;", "2687": "and I now say to thee, that the longer it is, the more unhappy they are, and it would be to them the greatest un­ happiness of all, that the time continued till doomsday.", "2688": "And I said to thee also, that they would be more unhappy if their evil were unjustly passed over, than they would be if their evil were justly punished.", "2689": "Yet it so happens that thou thinkest those who have impunity are happier than those who are punished.§", "2690": "V.

are unwilling to believe this thy doctrine, but they will not even hear it.", "2693": "Then said he:", "2694": "That is no wonder.", "2695": "Thou knowest that the men who have unsound eyes cannot very easily look at the sun when she shines brightest, nor indeed do they choose to look on fire, or on anything bright, though the apple of the eye be left.", "2696": "In like manner the sinful minds are blinded by their evil will, so that they are not able to be­ hold the light of bright truth, which is the highest wisdom.", "2697": "But it is with them, as with the birds and the beasts which can see better by night than by day.", "2698": "The day blinds and darkens their eyes, and the darkness of the night enlightens them.", "2699": "Therefore the blinded minds think that this is the greatest happiness, that a man should be permitted to do evil, and his deed should be unpunished, For they are not desirous to inquire after every instruction, until they know what is right, but turn to their evil will, and seek after it.", "2700": "There­ fore I know not to what purpose thou teachest me to the foolish men who never inquire after me.", "2701": "I never speak to them;", "2702": "but I speak to thee, because thou art inclined to seek after me, and labourest more in the pursuit than they do.", "2703": "I care not what they judge.", "2704": "I approve thy judgment more than theirs, for they all look with both eyes, as well with the eyes of the mind as with those of the body, on these earthly things, which excessively delight them.", "2705": "But thou alone sometimes lookest with one eye on the heavenly things, and with the other thou lookest as yet on these earthly things.", "2706": "For the foolish think that every man is as blind as they are, and that no man is able to see what they cannot behold.", "2707": "Such folly is most like to this;", "2708": "that a child should be born full sound and full healthy, and so flourishing in all excellences and virtues, during childhood and afterwards throughout youth, that he becomes capable of every art;", "2709": "and then a little before his middle-age, he should become blind in both eyes, and also the eyes of the mind should become so blinded, that he remembers nothing which he ever before saw or heard:", "2710": "and nevertheless he should think that he is as capable of everything as he ever was when most capable:", "2711": "and should think that it is with every man as it is with him ;", "2712": "and that it seems to every man as it seems to him.", "2713": "But though lie were so foolish as to think so, should we all think as he thinks ?", "2714": "I think, however, that we should not.", "2715": "But I wish to know what thou thinkest concerning the men of whom we before said, that it appeared to us that they were more like wild beasts than men ?", "2716": "How much wisdom had they ?", "2717": "Methinks, however, they have none.§ VI.", "2718": "I would now utter to thee a true observation, but I know that this people will not believe it:", "2719": "that is, that those persons whom men injure are happier than those are who injure them.", "2720": "Then wondered I at this, and said:", "2721": "I wish that thou wouldest explain to me how it can be so.", "2722": "Then said he:", "2723": "Dost thou understand that every evil-willing man and every evil-doing man is deserving of punishment ?", "2724": "Then said I:", "2725": "Clearly enough I understand that.", "2726": "Then said he:", "2727": "Is he not then evil-willing and evil-doing, who injures the innocent ?", "2728": "Then said I:", "2729": "So it is as thou sayest.", "2730": "Then said he:", "2731": "Dost thou think that they are miserable and unhappy, who are deserving of punishment?", "2732": "Then said I:", "2733": "I not only think it, but know it very well.", "2734": "Then said he:", "2735": "If thou wert now to judge, which wouldest thou judge more deserving of punishment, him who injured the innocent, or him who suffered the injury ?", "2736": "Then said I:", "2737": "There is no comparison.", "2738": "I would help him who was innocent, and oppose him who injured him.", "2739": "Then said he:", "2740": "Then, in thy opinion, he is more miserable who does the evil, than he who suffers it.", "2741": "Then said I:", "2742": "This I believe, that every unjust punishment is the evil of him who inflicts it, not of him who suffers it;", "2743": "there­ fore his evil makes him miserable.", "2744": "And I perceive that this is a very just observation which thou now makest, and very agreeable to those which thou madest before;", "2745": "but I never­ theless know that this people will not think so.", "2746": "§ VII.", "2747": "Then said he:", "2748": "Thou understandest it well.", "2749": "But advocates now-a-days plead for those who have less need of it.", "2750": "They plead for those who are injured, and do not plead for those who do the injury.", "2751": "It were more needful to those who injure others who are innocent, that some one should plead for them before the magistrates, and pray that as great hurt might be done to them, as they had done to other innocent persons.", "2752": "As the sick man has need that some one should lead him to the physician, that he may cure him;", "2753": "so has he who does evil, that some one should lead him to the magis­ trates, that they may cut off and burn his vices.", "2754": "I do not say that it is wrong that men should help the innocent, and defend him;", "2755": "but I say that it is better that we should accuse the guilty ;", "2756": "and I say that the defence does no good either to the guilty or to him who pleads for him, if they wish that their evil should not he punished in proportion to its guilt.", "2757": "But I know that if the guilty had any spark of wisdom, and in any measure knew that they might make amends for their crimes by punishment, which came upon them here in this world, then they would not say that it was punishment, but would say that it was their purification and their amend­ ment;", "2758": "and would seek no advocate, but they would cheer­ fully suffer the magistrates to punish them according to their own will.", "2759": "Hence no wise man ought to hate any one.", "2760": "No one hates the good, except the most foolish of all.", "2761": "Nor is it right that we hate the wicked;", "2762": "but it is more right that we have mercy on him.", "2763": "This then is mercy to them, that we punish their vices according to their deservings.", "2764": "No, one ought to afflict a sick person who is troubled;", "2765":

the deservings of good men, and misery is founded on the deservings of wicked men.", "2782": "But I will yet say that methinks the happiness of this present life is no little good, and its unhappiness no little evil.", "2783": "For I never saw nor heard of any wise man who would rather be an exile, and miserable, and foreign, and despised, than wealthy, and honour­ able, and powerful, and eminent in his own country.", "2784": "For they say that they can the better fulfil their wisdom, and observe it, if their power be ample over the people that are under them, and also in some measure over those who are in the neigh­ bourhood round about them, because they are able to repress the wicked, and promote the good.", "2785": "For the good is always to be honoured, both in this present life and in that to come ;", "2786": "and the wicked, whom man cannot restrain from his evil, is always deserving of punishment, both in this world and in that to come.", "2787": "But I very much wonder why it should so fall out, as it now often does;", "2788": "that is, that various punishments and manifold misfortunes come to the good, as they should to the wicked;", "2789": "and the blessings which should be a reward to good men for good works, come to wicked men.", "2790": "Therefore I would now know from thee, how that course of events were approved by thee.", "2791": "I should wonder at it much less, if I knew that it happened by chance, without God's will, and without his knowledge.", "2792": "But the Almighty God has increased my fear and my astonishment by these things.", "2793": "For he some­ times gives felicities to the good, and infelicities to the wicked, as it were right that he always did.", "2794": "Sometimes again he per­ mits that the good have infelicities and misfortunes in many things;", "2795": "and the wicked have happiness, and it frequently happens to them according to their own desire.", "2796": "Hence I cannot think otherwise but that it so happens by chance, un­ less thou still more rationally show me the contrary.", "2797": "Then answered he, after a long time, and said:", "2798": "It is no wonder if any one think that something of this kind happens unde­ signedly, when he cannot understand and explain wherefore God so permits.", "2799": "But thou oughtest not to doubt that so good a creator and governor of all things, rightly made all that he has made, and rightly judges and rules it all, though thou knowest not why he so and so may do.§ III.", "2800": "When he had made this speech, then began he to sing, and said:", "2801": "Who of the unlearned wonders not at the course of the sky, and its swiftness;", "2802": "how it every day re­ volves about all this middle-earth ?", "2803": "Or who wonders not that some stars have a

of the centre-while, further, whatever joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like simplicity, and no longer expands vaguely into space-even so whatsoever departs widely from primal mind is in- volved more deeply in the meshes of fate, and things are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come nearer to that central pivot;", "2015": "while if aught cleaves close to supreme

is known is grasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to the faculty of the knower.", "2402": "An example will make this clear :", "2403": "the roundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by touch.", "2404": "Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simul- taneous reflection of rays;", "2405": "touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and attachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery itself.", "2406": "Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another by Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another by pure Intelligence.", "2407": "Sense judges figure clothed in material substance, Imagination figure alone without matter.", "2408": "Thought transcends this again, and by its con- templation of universals considers the type itself which is contained in the individual.", "2409": "The eye of Intelligence is yet more exalted;", "2410": "for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold absolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision.", "2411": "Wherein the main point to be considered is this :", "2412": "the higher faculty of comprehension em- braces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher.", "2413": "For Sense has no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagina- tion behold universal ideas, nor Thought embrace pure form;", "2414": "but Intelligence, looking down, as it were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form, dis- criminates also the several elements which underlie it;", "2415": "but it comprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself, which could be cognized by no other than itself.", "2416": "For it cognizes the universal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of Sense, without employ- ing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but surveying all things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash of intuition.", "2417": "Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces images and sense- impressions without resorting to Imagina- tion or Sense.", "2418": "For it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its conceptual point of view:", "2419": "\" Man is a two-legged animal endowed with reason.\"", "2420": "This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that the thing is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought considers it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational conception.", "2421": "Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming representations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys sense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of Sense-percep- tion, but of Imagination.", "2422": "See'st thou, then, how all things in cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things which they cognize ?", "2423": "Nor is this strange;", "2424": "for since every judgment is the act of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task by its own, not by another's power.", "2425": "'From the Porch's murky depths Comes a doctrine sage, That doth liken living mind To a written page;", "2426": "Since all knowledge comes through Sense, Graven by Experience.'", "2427": "As,' say they, I the pen its marks Curiously doth trace", "2428": "On the smooth unsullied white Of the paper's face, So do outer

external signs With the hidden forms combines.'", "2443": "Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the qualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity of mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's action upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying inactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies en- dowed with sentiency the mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own efficacy discriminates the im- pressions furnished to the body, how much more do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their discrimination their own mental activities instead of con- forming to external objects ?", "2444": "So on these principles various modes of cognition belong to distinct and different substances.", "2445": "For to creatures void of motive power- shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks and grow there-belongs Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining knowledge;", "2446": "to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of seeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also.", "2447": "Thought per- tains only to the human race, as Intelli- gence to Divinity alone ;", "2448": "hence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of its own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of the other forms of knowledge also.", "2449": "But what if Sense and Imagination were to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems itself to behold to be nothing?", "2450": "For the object of Sense and Imagination cannot be universal;", "2451": "so that either the judgment of Reason is true and there is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many objects are pre- sented to Sense and Imagination, the con- ception of Reason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular as if it were a something \"universal,\" is empty of content.", "2452": "Suppose, further, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate the object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of universality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the knowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond bodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to trust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment.", "2453": "In a dispute of this sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as well as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason ?'", "2454": "In like manner is it

involve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as certainly about to come to pass.", "2456": "There is, then, no fore- knowledge of such events ;", "2457": "or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there is, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity.", "2458": "If, however, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind, even as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that human Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind, no less than we judged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason.", "2459": "Wherefore let us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme In telligence;", "2460": "for there Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon;", "2461": "and that is in what way things whose

is eternal;", "2477": "in this judgment all rational beings agree.", "2478": "Let us, then, con- sider what eternity is.", "2479": "For this word carries with it a revelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine know- ledge.", "2480": "Now, eternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single moment.", "2481": "What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison with things temporal.", "2482": "For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding from the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time which can embrace the whole space of its life together.", "2483": "To-morrow's state it grasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's;", "2484": "nay, even in the life of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment.", "2485": "Whatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as Aristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end, and its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet is not such as rightly to be thought eternal.", "2486": "For it does not include and embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present hold on things to come, not yet accomplished.", "2487": "Accordingly, that which includes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from which nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped, this is rightly called eternal;", "2488": "this must of necessity be ever present to itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time in an abiding present.", "2489": "Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that on Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the Creator, because they are told that he believed the world to have had no begin- ning in time,* and to be destined never to come to an end.", "2490": "For it is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what Plato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to be embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to the Divine mind.", "2491": "Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to created things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.", "2492": "For the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate existence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot succeed in equal- ling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and falls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite dura- tion of the future and the past;", "2493": "and since it cannot possess the whole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner it never ceases to be, it seems, up to a certain point, to rival that which it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently to any present moment of time, however swift and brief;", "2494": "and since this bears some resemblance to that ever- abiding present, it bestows on everything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence.", "2495": "But since it cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the result has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the complete- ness of which it could not embrace while it stood still.", "2496": "So, if we are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in saying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.'", "2497": "Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably to its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present, His knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the simplicity of its own change- less present, and, embracing the whole infinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that falls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place.", "2498": "And therefore, if thou wilt carefully con- sider that immediate presentment whereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not foreknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that never passes.", "2499": "For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not pre- vision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from things mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some lofty height.", "2500": "Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are surveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly men impose no necessity on things which they see?", "2501": "Does the act of vision add any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes ?''", "2502": "Assuredly not.''", "2503": "And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's, just as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He see all things in His eternal present.", "2504": "Wherefore this Divine anticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it beholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to pass in time.", "2505": "Nor does it con- found things in its judgment, but in the one mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what without necessity.", "2506": "For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish between the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former voluntary, the latter necessary action:", "2507": "so also the Divine vision in its universal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the things which are present to its regard, though future in respect of time.", "2508": "Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come into existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any necessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based on truth.", "2509": "And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to come to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to come to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word necessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth, but one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the Divine his special study.", "2510": "For my answer would be that the same future event is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when considered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered.", "2511": "So, then, there are two neces- sities—one simple, as that men are neces- sarily mortal;", "2512": "the other conditioned, as that, if you know that someone is walking, he must necessarily be walking.", "2513": "For that which is known cannot indeed be other- wise than as it is known to be, and yet this fact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity.", "2514": "For the former necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by the addition of a condition.", "2515": "No necessity compels one who is voluntarily walking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at the moment of walking.", "2516": "In the same way, then, if Providence sees anything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no necessity of nature.", "2517": "Now,", "2518": "God views as present those coming events which happen of free will.", "2519": "These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the Divine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine cognizance;", "2520": "viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the absolute freedom naturally theirs.", "2521": "Accordingly, without doubt, all things will come to pass which God fore- knows as about to happen, but of these certain proceed of free will;", "2522": "and though these happen, yet by the fact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue of which before they happened it was really possible that they might not have come to pass.'", "2523": "What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since, through their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of neces- sity ?", "2524": "This difference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly took, the sun's rising and the man's walk- ing ;", "2525": "which at the moment of their occur- rence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them before it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was not so at all.", "2526": "So likewise the things which to God are present without doubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of things, others from the power of the agent.", "2527": "Quite rightly, then, have we said that these things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine knowledge;", "2528": "but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from the bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense, regarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its own nature particular.", "2529": "\"But,\" thou wilt say, \" if it is in my power to change my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance change something which comes within its fore- knowledge.\"", "2530": "My answer is :", "2531": "Thou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose;", "2532": "but since the truth of providence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou dost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine foreknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present spectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various actions.", "2533": "Wilt thou, then, say :", "2534": "\"", "2535": "Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at my discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its knowledge correspondingly ?\"'", "2536": "Surely not.", "2537": "''True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and transforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and varies not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this or that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations without altering.", "2538": "And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all things God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from the simplicity of His own nature.", "2539": "Hereby also is resolved the objection which a little while ago gave thee offence-that our doings in the future were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge.", "2540": "For this faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate cognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes nothing to what comes after.", "2541": "'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and laws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held forth to wills un- bound by any necessity.", "2542": "God, who fore- knoweth all things, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of His vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and dispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments.", "2543": "Our hopes and prayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly directed cannot fail of effect.", "2544": "Therefore, withstand vice, practise virtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to Heaven.", "2545": "Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will not hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done before the eyes of a Judge who
