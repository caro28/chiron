previously translated by Floyer Sydenham are introduced.", "4": "Tay­ lor's portion of the work is far from correct, and betrays an imperfect knowledge of Greek:", "5": "that by Sydenham is much better, and evidently the work of a scholar, but in many instances, and tbuse chiefly where difficulties present themselves, he obscures his authors meaning by too great amplification.", "6": "Trans­ lations of several detached Dialogues have appeared at various times, but of those which have fallen into my hands none appear to me deserving of notice, with the exception of a little volume containing the Phædrus, Lysis, and Protagoras, by Mr. J. Wright, of Trinity College, Cambridge, the production of a promising scholar.", "7": "In the volume now offered to the public, I have endeavoured to keep as closely to the original as the idioms of the two languages would allow.", "8": "In the introduction to each Dialogue I have con­ tented myself with giving a brief outline of the argu­ ments ;", "9": "sufficient, I trust, to enable a reader not fami­ liar with the rigid dialectics of Plato to follow the chain of his reasoning, and catch the points at which he so frequently diverges from, and again returns to, the main subject of each Dialogue.", "10": "The editions which have been made use of are those of Bekker, Ast, and Stallbaum, though with very few exceptions the readings of the latter have been adopted.", "11": "The division into sections, according to the London edition of Bekker, has been retained, because the ar­ rangement is convenient, and it is believed that that edition is more generally to be met with in this country than any other.", "12": "Oxford, Nov. 28, 1848.Page 428. § 114, 1. 6, for objects, both, read both objects.", "13": "Two charges were brought against Socrates, one, that he did not believe in the gods received by the state, the other, that he corrupted the Athenian youth by teaching them not to believe.", "14": "Plato, who was present at the trial, probably gives us the very arguments employed by the accused on that occasion.", "15": "Socrates disdained to have recourse to the usual methods adopted by the popular orators of the day to secure an acquit­ tal ;", "16": "and, having devoted his whole life to the search after and the inculcation of religious, philosophical, and moral truth, resolved to bear himself in this extremity in a manner con­ sistent with his established character, and to take his stand on his own integrity and innocence, utterly uninfluenced by that imaginary evil, death.", "17": "From this cause it is that his defence is so little artificial.", "18": "In his discussions with others, on what­ ever subject, it was his constant habit to keep his opponents to the question before them, and he would never suffer them to evade it, but by a connected series of the most subtle questions or arguments compelled them to retract any erroneous opinion they might have advanced:", "19": "whereas, in defending himself, he never once fairly grapples with either of the charges brought against him.", "20": "With regard to the first accusation, that he did not believe in the established religion, he neither confesses nor denies it, but shews that he had in some instances conformed to the religious customs of his country, and that he did believe in God, so much so indeed that even if they would acquit him on condition of his abandoning his practice of teaching others, he could not consent to such terms, but must persevere in ful­ filling the mission on which the Deity had sent him, for that he feared God rather than man.", "21": "With reference to the second charge which he meets first, by his usual method of a brief but close cross-examination of his accuser Melitus, he brings him to this dilemma, that he must either charge him with cor­ rupting the youth designedly, which would be absurd, or with doing so undesignedly, for which he could not be liable to punishment.", "22": "The Defence itself properly ends with the twenty-fourth section.", "23": "The second division to the twenty-ninth section re­ lates only to the sentence which ought to be passed on him.", "24": "And in the third and concluding part, with a dignity and fulness of hope worthy even of a Christian, he expresses his belief that the death to which he is going is only a passage to a better and a happier life.", "25": "I KNOW not, 0 Athenians, how far you have been influenced by my accusers:", "26": "for my part, in listening to them I almost forgot myself, so plausible were their arguments :", "27": "however, so to speak, they have said nothing true.", "28": "But of the many false­ hoods which they uttered I wondered at one of them espe­ cially, that in which they said that you ought to be on your guard lest you should be deceived by me, as being eloquent in speech.", "29": "For that they are not ashamed of being forthwith convicted by me in fact, when I shall shew that I am not by any means eloquent, this seemed to me the most shameless thing in them, unless indeed they call him eloquent who speaks the truth.", "30": "For, if they mean this, then I.would allow that I am an orator, but not after their fashion :", "31": "for they, as I affirm, have said nothing true;", "32": "but from me you shall hear the whole truth.", "33": "Not indeed, Athenians, arguments highly wrought, as theirs were, with choice phrases and expressions, nor adorned, but you shall hear a speech uttered without premeditation, in such words as first present themselves.", "34": "For I am confident that what I say will be just, and let none of you expect other­ wise :", "35": "for surely it would not become my time of life to come before you like a youth with a got up speech.", "36": "Above all things therefore I beg and implore this of you, 0 Athenians, if you hear me defending myself in the same language as that in which I am accustomed to speak both in the forum at the counters, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere, not to be surprised or disturbed on this account.", "37": "For the case is this:", "38": "I now for the first time come before a court of justice, though more than seventy years old;", "39": "I am therefore utterly a stranger to the language here.", "40": "As, then, if I were really a stranger, you would have pardoned me if I spoke in the lan­ guage and the manner in which I had been educated, so now I ask this of you as an act of justice, as it appears to me, to disregard the manner of my speech, for perhaps it may be somewhat worse, and perhaps better, and to consider this only, and to give your attention to this, whether I speak what is just or not ;", "41": "for this is the virtue of a judge, but of an orator to speak the truth.", "42": "2.", "43": "First then, 0 Athenians, I am right in defending myself against the first false accusations alleged against me, and my first accusers, and then against the latest accusations, and the latest accusers.", "44": "For many have been accusers of me to you, and for many years, who have asserted nothing true, of whom I am more afraid than of Anytus and his party, although they too are formidable;", "45": "but those are still more formidable, Athe­ nians, who laying hold of many of you from childhood, have persuaded you, and accused me of what is not true :", "46": "—“ that there is one Socrates, a wise man, who occupies himself about celestial matters, and has explored every thing under the earth, and makes the worse appear the better reason.\"", "47": "Those, 0 Athenians, who have spread abroad this report are my formid­ able accusers:", "48": "for they who hear them think that such as search into these things do not believe that there are gods.", "49": "In the next place, these accusers are numerous, and have accused me now for a long time ;", "50": "moreover they said these things to you at that time of life in which you were most credulous, when you were boys and some of you youths, and they accused me altogether in my absence, when there was no one to defend me.", "51": "But the most unreasonable thing of all is, that it is not possible to learn and mention their names, except that one of them happens to be a comic poeta.", "52": "Such, however, as influenced by envy and calumny have persuaded you, and those who, being themselves persuaded, have persuaded others, all these are most difficult to deal with ;", "53": "for it is not possible to bring any of them forward here, nor to confute any;", "54": "but it is altogether necessary, to fight as it were with a shadow, in making my defence, and to convict when there is no one to answer.", "55": "Consider, therefore, as I have said, that my accusers are twofold, some who have lately accused me, and others long since, whom I have made mention of;", "56": "and believe that I ought to defend myself against these first;", "57": "for you heard them accusing me first, and much more than these last.", "58": "Well.", "59": "I must make my defence then, 0 Athenians, and endeavour in this so short a space of time to remove from your minds the calumny which you have long entertained.", "60": "I wish, indeed, it might be so, if it were at all better both for you and me, and that in making my defence I could effect some­ thing more advantageous still:", "61": "I think however that it will be difficult, and I am not entirely ignorant what the difficulty is.", "62": "Nevertheless let this turn out as may be pleasing to God, I must obey the law, and make my defence.", "63": "3.", "64": "Let us then repeat from the beginning what the accusa­ tion is from which the calumny against me has arisen, and relying on which Melitus has preferred this indictment against me.", "65": "Well.", "66": "What then do they who charge me say in their charge ?", "67": "For it is necessary to read their deposition as of public accusers.", "68": "\"", "69": "Socrates acts wickedly, and is criminally curious in searching into things under the earth, and in the heavens, and in making the worse appear the better cause, and in teaching these same things to others.\"", "70": "Such is the accusa­ tion :", "71": "for such things you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes, one Socrates there carried about, saying that he walks in the air, and acting many other buffooneries, of which I understand nothing whatever.", "72": "Nor do I say this as disparaging such a science, if there be any one skilled in such things, only let me not be prosecuted by Melitus on a charge of this kind;", "73": "but I say it, 0 Athenians, because I have no­ thing to do with such matters.", "74": "And I call upon most of you as witnesses of this, and require you to inform and tell each other, as many of you as have ever heard me conversing;", "75": "and there are many such among you.", "76": "Therefore tell each other, if any one of you has ever heard me conversing little or much on such subjects.", "77": "And from this you will know that other things also, which the multitude assert of me, are of a similar nature.", "78": "4.", "79": "However not one of these things is true ;", "80": "nor, if you have heard from any one that I attempt to teach men, and require pay­ ment, is this true.", "81": "Though this indeed appears to me to be an honourable thing, if one should be able to instruct men, like Gorgias the Leontine, Prodicus the Cean, and Hippias the Elean.", "82": "For each of these, 0 Athenians, is able, by going through the several cities, to persuade the young men, who can attach them­ selves gratuitously to such of their own fellow citizens as they please, to abandon their fellow citizens and associate with them, giving them money and thanks besides.", "83": "There is also another wise man here, a Parian, who I hear is staying in the city.", "84": "For I happened to visit a person who spends more money on the sophists than all others together, I mean Callias, son of Hip­ ponicus.", "85": "I therefore asked him, for he has two sons, \" Callias,\" I said, \" if your two sons were colts or calves, we should have had to choose a master for them and hire a person who would make them excel in such qualities as belong to their nature :", "86": "and he would have been a groom or an agricultural labourer.", "87": "But now, since your sons are men, what master do you intend to choose for them ?", "88": "Who is there skilled in the qualities that become a man and a citizen ?", "89": "For I suppose you must have considered this, since you have sons.", "90": "Is there any one,\" I said, \" or not?\" \" Certainly,\" he answered. \" Who is he?\" said I, \" and whence does he come ?", "91": "and on what terms does he teach ?\"", "92": "He replied, \" Evenus the Parian, Socrates, for five minæ.”", "93": "And I deemed Evenus happy, if he really possesses this art, and teaches so admirably.", "94": "And I too should think highly of myself and be very proud, if I possessed this know­ ledge ;", "95": "but I possess it not, 0 Athenians.", "96": "5.", "97": "Perhaps, one of you may now object:", "98": "\" But, Socrates, what have you done then ?", "99": "Whence have these calumnies against you arisen ?", "100": "For surely if you had not busied yourself more than others, such a report and story would never have got abroad, unless you had done something different from what most men do.", "101": "Tell us, therefore, what it is, that we may not pass a hasty judgment on you.\"", "102": "He who speaks thus appears to me to speak justly, and I will endeavour to shew you what it is that has occasioned me this character and imputation.", "103": "Listen then :", "104": "to some of you perhaps I shall appear to jest, yet be assured that I shall tell you the whole truth.", "105": "For I, 0 Athenians, have acquired this character through nothing else than a certain wisdom.", "106": "Of what kind, then, is this wisdom ?", "107": "Perhaps it is merely human wisdom.", "108": "For in this, in truth I appear to be wise.", "109": "They probably, whom I just now men­ tioned, possessed a wisdom more than human, otherwise I know not what to say about it;", "110": "for I am not acquainted with it, and whosoever says I am, speaks falsely and for the purpose of calumniating me.", "111": "But, 0 Athenians, do not cry out against me, even though I should seem to you to speak somewhat arrogantly.", "112": "For the account which I am going to give you, is not my own, but I shall refer to an authority whom you will deem worthy of credit.", "113": "For I shall adduce to you the god at Delphi as a witness of my wisdom, if I have any, and of what it is.", "114": "You doubtless know Chærepho:", "115": "he was my asso­ ciate from youth, and the associate of most of you ;", "116": "he accom­ panied you in your late exile and returned with you.", "117": "You know, then, what kind of a man Chærepho was, how earnest in what­ ever he undertook.", "118": "Having once gone to Delphi, he ventured to make the following inquiry of the oracle, (and, as I said, 0 Athenians, do not cry out,) for he asked if there was any one wiser than me.", "119": "The Pythian thereupon answered that there was not one wiser:", "120": "and of this, his brother here will give you proofs, since he himself is dead.", "121": "6.", "122": "Consider then why I mention these things:", "123": "it is because I am going to shew you whence the calumny against me arose.", "124": "For when I heard this, I reasoned thus with myself, What does the god mean?", "125": "What enigma is this?", "126": "For I am not conscious to myself that I am wise, either much or little.", "127": "What then does he mean by saying that I am the wisest ?", "128": "For assuredly he does not speak falsely:", "129": "that he cannot do.", "130": "And for a long time, I was in doubt what he meant;", "131": "afterwards with con­ siderable difficulty I had recourse to the following method of searching out his meaning.", "132": "I went to one of those who have the character of being wise, thinking that there, if any where, I should confute the oracle, and shew in answer to the response that This man is wiser than I, though you affirmed that I was the wisest.", "133": "Having then examined this man, (for there is no occasion to mention his name, he was however one of our great politicians, in examining whom I felt as I proceed to describe, 0 Athenians,) having fallen into conversation with him, this man appeared to me to be wise in the opinion of most other men, and especially in his own

others who were present.", "136": "When I left him, I reasoned thus with myself, I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appear to know any thing great and good :", "137": "but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing, whereas I, as I do not know any thing, so I do not fancy I do.", "138": "In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than him, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.", "139": "After that I went to another who was thought to be wiser than the former, and formed the very same opinion.", "140": "Hence I became odious to him and to many others..", "141": "7. After this I went to others in turn, perceiving indeed and grieving and alarmed that I was making myself odious;", "142": "how­ ever it appeared necessary to regard the oracle of the god as of the greatest moment, and that in order to discover its mean­ ing, I must go to all who had the reputation of possessing any knowledge.", "143": "And by the dog, 0 Athenians, for I must tell you the truth, I came to some such conclusion as this:", "144": "those who bore the highest reputation appeared to me to be most deficient, in my researches in obedience to the god, and others who were considered inferior, more nearly approaching to the possession of understanding.", "145": "But I must relate to you my wandering, and the labours which I underwent, in order that the oracle might prove incontrovertible.", "146": "For after the politi­ cians I went to the poets as well the tragic as the dithyrambic and others, expecting that here I should in very fact find my­ self more ignorant than

them.", "148": "I am ashamed, 0 Athe­ nians, to tell you the truth;", "149": "however it must be told.", "150": "For, in a word, almost all who were present could have given a better account of them

and under the influence of enthusiasm like prophets and seers;", "152": "for these also say many fine things, but they understand nothing that they say.", "153": "The poets appeared to me to be affected in a similar manner :", "154": "and at the same time I perceived that they considered themselves, on account of their poetry, to be the wisest of men in other things, in which they were

artizans.", "158": "For I was conscious to myself that I knew scarcely any thing, but I was sure that I should find them possessed of much beautiful know­ ledge.", "159": "And in this I was not deceived;", "160": "for they knew things which I did not, and in this respect they were wiser than me.", "161": "But, 0 Athenians, even the best workmen appeared to me to nave fallen into the same error as the poets:", "162": "for each, because he excelled in the practice of his art, thought that he was very wise in other most important matters, and this mistake of theirs ob­ scured the wisdom that they really possessed.", "163": "I therefore asked myself in behalf of the oracle, whether I should prefer to con.", "164": "tinue as I am, possessing none either of their wisdom or their ignorance, or to have both as they have.", "165": "I answered, therefore, to myself and to the oracle, that it was better for me to con­ tinue as I am.9.", "166": "From this investigation, then, 0 Athenians, many enmities have arisen against me, and those the most grievous and severe, so that many calumnies have sprung from them and amongst them this appellation of being wise.", "167": "For

and inquire into these things, in obedience to the god, both among citizens and strangers, if I think any one of them is wise ;", "171": "and when he appears to me not to be so, I take the part of the god, and shew that he is not wise.", "172": "And in consequence of this occupation I have no leisure to attend in any considerable degree to the affairs of the state or my own;", "173": "but I am in

of men who fancy they know something, although they know little or nothing.", "177": "Hence those who are put to the test by them are angry with me, and not with them, and say that \" there is one

intem­ perance and wantonness.", "311": "For he seems, as it were, to have composed an enigma for the purpose of making an experiment.", "312": "Whether will Socrates the wise know that I am jesting, and contradict myself, or shall I deceive him and all who hear me ?", "313": "For in my opinion he clearly contradicts himself in the indictment, as if he should say, Socrates is guilty of wrong in not believing that there are gods, and in believing that there are gods.", "314": "And this, surely, is the act of one who is trifling.", "315": "5.", "316": "Consider with me now, Athenians, in what respect he ap­ pears to me to say so.", "317": "And do you, Melitus, answer me;", "318": "and do ye, as I besought you at the outset, remember not to make an uproar if I speak after my usual manner.",

pipes ?", "323": "There is not, 0 best of men :", "324": "for since you are not willing to answer, I say it to you and to all here present.", "325": "But answer to this at least:", "326": "is there

having hardly answered, though compelled by these judges.", "331": "You assert then that I do believe and teach things relating to demons, whether they be new or old ;", "332": "therefore, according to your admission, I do believe in things relating to demons, and this you have sworn in the bill of indictment.", "333": "If then I believe in things relating to demons, there is surely an absolute necessity that I should believe that there are demons.", "334": "Is it not so?", "335": "It is.", "336": "For I suppose you to assent, since you do not answer.", "337": "But with respect to demons, do we not allow that they are gods, or the children of gods ?", "338": "Do you admit this or not ?", "339": "Mel.", "340": "Certainly.", "341": "Socr.", "342": "Since then I allow that there are demons as you ad­ mit, if demons are a kind of gods, this is the point in which I say you speak enigmatically and divert yourself in saying that I do not allow there are gods, and again that I do allow there are, since I allow that there are demons ?", "343": "But if demons are the children of gods, spurious ones, either from nymphs or any others, of whom they are reported to be, what man can think that there are sons of gods, and yet that there are not gods ?", "344": "For it would be just as absurd, as if any one should think that there are mules the offspring of horses and asses, but should not think there are horses and asses.", "345": "However, Melitus, it cannot be otherwise than that you have preferred this indict­ ment for the purpose of trying me, or because you were at a loss what real crime to allege against me :", "346": "for that you should persuade any man who has the smallest degree of sense, that the same person can think that there are things relating to demons and to gods, and yet that there are neither demons;", "347": "nor gods, nor heroes, is utterly impossible.", "348": "16. That I am not guilty then, 0 Athenians, according to the indictment of Melitus, appears to me not to require a length­ ened defence ;", "349": "but what I have said is sufficient.", "350": "And as to what I said at the beginning, that there is a great enmity to­ wards me among the multitude, be assured it is true.", "351": "And this it is which will condemn me, if I am condemned, not Melitus, nor Anytus, but the calumny and envy of the multitude, which have already condemned many others, and those good men, and will I think condemn others also;", "352": "for there is no danger that it will stop with me.", "353": "Perhaps, however, some one may say, \" Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to have pursued a study, from which you are now in danger of dying?\"", "354": "To such a person I should answer with good reason,", "355": "You do not say well, friend, if you think that a man, who is even of the least value, ought to take into the account the risk of life or death, and ought not to

died at Troy would be vile characters, as well all the rest as the son of Thetis, who so far despised danger in comparison of submitting to dis­ grace, that when his mother, who was a goddess, spoke to him, in his impatience to kill Hector, something to this effect, as I think b, \" My son, if you revenge the death of your friend Patroclus, and slay Hector, you will yourself die, for,\" she said,

chief, there, as it appears to me, he ought to remain and meet danger, taking no account either of death or any thing else in compari­ son with disgrace.17.", "363": "I then should be acting strangely, 0 Athenians, if, when the generals whom you chose to command me assigned me my post at Potidsea, at Amphipolis, and at Delium, I then remained where they posted me, like any other person,

that occasion, through fear of death or any thing else whatso­ ever, desert my post.", "364": "Strange indeed would it be, and then in truth any one might justly bring me to trial, and accuse me of not believing in the gods, from disobeying the oracle, fearing death, and thinking myself to be wise when I am not.", "365": "For to fear death, 0 Athenians, is nothing else than to appear to be wise, without being so;", "366": "for it is to appear to know what one does not know.", "367": "For no one knows but that death is the greatest of all goods to man ;", "368": "but men fear it, as if they well knew that it is the greatest of evils.", "369": "And how is not this the most repre­ hensible ignorance, to think that one knows what one does not know ?", "370": "But I, 0 Athenians, in this perhaps differ from most men;", "371": "and if I should say that I am in any thing wiser than another, it would be in this, that not having a competent know­ ledge of the things in Hades, I also think

defence on my own behalf, as any one might think, but I do so on your behalf, lest by condemning me you should offend at all with respect to the gift of the deity to you.", "400": "For, if you should put me to death, you will not easily find such another, though it may be ridi­ culous to say so, altogether attached by the deity to this city as to a powerful and generous horse, somewhat sluggish from his size, and requiring to be roused by a gad-fly;", "401": "so the deity appears to have united me, being such a person as I am, to the city, that I may rouse you, and persuade and reprove every one of you, nor ever cease besetting you throughout the whole day.", "402": "Such another man, 0 Athenians, will not easily be found, there­ fore, if you will take my advice, you will spare me.",

profit from this course, and had re­ ceived pay for my exhortations, there would have been some reason for my conduct;", "408": "but now you see yourselves, that my accusers, who have so shamelessly

the Tholus, ordered us to bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, that he might be put to death;", "430": "and they gave many similar orders to many others, wishing to involve as many as they could in guilt.", "431": "Then however I shewed, not in word but in deed, that I did not care for death, if the expression be not too rude, in the smallest degree, but that all my care was to do nothing unjust

reason, and concludes by bidding him tell Evenus to follow him as soon as he can.", "1025": "Simmias expresses his surprise at this message, on which Socrates asks, \" Is not Evenus a philosopher ?\" and on the question being answered in the affirmative, he says, that he or any philoso­ pher would be willing to die, though perhaps he would not commit violence on himself.", "1026": "This, again, seems a contradic­ tion to Simmias, but Socrates explains it by shewing that our souls are placed in the body by God, and may not leave it without His permission.", "1027": "Whereupon Cebes objects, that in that case foolish men only would wish to die and quit the ser­ vice of the best of masters, to which Simmias agrees.", "1028": "Socra­ tes, therefore, proposes to plead his cause before them, and to shew that there is a great probability that after this life he shall go into the presence of God and good men, and be happy in proportion to the purity of his own mind.", "1029": "He beginsa by stating that philosophy itself is nothing else than a preparation for and meditation on death.", "1030": "Death and philosophy have this in common :", "1031": "death separates the soul from the body, philosophy draws off the mind from bodily things to the contemplation of truth and virtue:", "1032": "for he is not a true philosopher who is led away by bodily pleasures, since the senses are the source of ignorance and all evil;", "1033": "the mind, therefore, is entirely occupied in meditating on death, and freeing itself as much as possible from the body.", "1034": "How, then, can such a man be afraid of death ?", "1035": "He who grieves at the approach of death cannot be a true lover of wisdom, but is a lover of his body.", "1036": "And, indeed, most men are temperate through intemperance, that is to say, they abstain from some pleasures that they may the more easily and permanently en­ joy others.", "1037": "They embrace only a shadow of virtue, not virtue itself, since they estimate the value of all things by the plea­ sures they afford.", "1038": "Whereas the philosopher purifies his mind from all such things, and pursues virtue and wisdom for their own sakes.", "1039": "This course Socrates himself had pursued to the utmost of his ability, with what success he should shortly know;", "1040": "and on these grounds he did not repine at leaving his friends in this world, being persuaded that in another he should meet with good masters and good friends.", "1041": "Upon this Cebesb says that he-agrees with all else that had been said, but cannot help entertaining doubts of what will be­ come of the soul when separated from the body, for the com­ mon opinion is that it is dispersed and vanishes like breath or smoke, and no longer exists any where.", "1042": "Socrates, therefore, proposes to enquire into the probability of the case, a fit em­ ployment for him under his present circumstances.", "1043": "His first argumentc is drawn from the ancient belief preva­ lent amongst men, that souls departing hence exist in Hades, and are produced again from the dead.", "1044": "If this be true, it must follow that our souls are there, for they could not be pro­ duced again if they did not exist:", "1045": "and its truth is confirmed by this, that it is a general law of nature that contraries are produced from contraries, the greater from the less, strong from weak, slow from swift, heat from cold, and in like man­ ner life from death, and vice versd.", "1046": "To explain this more clearly, he proceeds to shew that what is changed passes from one state to another, and so undergoes three different states, first the actual state, then the transition, and thirdly the new state, as from a state of sleep, by awaking to being awake :", "1047": "in like manner birth is a transition from a state of death to life, and dying from life to death, so that the soul, by the act of dying, only passes to another state;", "1048": "if it were not so, all nature would in time become dead, just as if people did not awake out of sleep all would at last be buried in eternal sleep.", "1049": "Whence the conclusion is that the souls of men are not anni­ hilated by death.", "1050": "Cebesd agrees to this reasoning, and adds that he is further convinced of its truth by calling to mind an argument used by Socrates on former occasions, that knowledge is nothing but reminiscence, and if this is so, the soul must have existed and had knowledge before it became united to the body.", "1051": "But in case Simmias should not yet be satisfied, Socrates e proceeds to enlarge on this, his second argument, drawn from reminiscence.", "1052": "We daily find that we are carried from the knowledge of one thing to another.", "1053": "Things perceived by the eyes, ears, and other senses, bring up the thought of other things :", "1054": "thus the sight of a lyre or a garment reminds us of a friend, and not only are we thus reminded of sensible objects, but of things which are comprehended by the mind alone, and have no sensitive existence.", "1055": "For we have formed in our minds an idea of abstract equality, of the beautiful, the just, the good, in short, of every thing which we say exists without the aid of the senses, for we use them only in the perception of individual things, whence it follows that the mind did not acquire this knowledge in this life, but must have had it before, and there­ fore the soul must have existed before.", "1056": "Simmias and Cebesf both agree in admitting that Socrates has proved the pre-existence of the soul, but insist that he has not shewn it to be immortal, for that nothing hinders but that, according to the popular opinion, it may be dispersed at the dissolution of the body.", "1057": "To which Socrates replies, that if their former admissions are joined to his last argument, the immortality, as well as the pre-existence of the soul, has been sufficiently proved.", "1058": "For if it is true that any thing living is produced from that which is dead, then the soul must exist after death, otherwise it could not be produced again.", "1059": "However to remove the apprehension that the soul may be dispersed by a wind as it were, Socrates proceeds, in his third arguments, to examine that doubt more thoroughly.", "1060": "What then is meant by being dispersed but being dissolved into its parts ?", "1061": "In order therefore to a thing being capable of dis­ persion it must be compounded of parts.", "1062": "Now there are two kinds of things, one compounded, the other simple, the former kind is subject to change, the latter not, and can be compre­ hended by the mind alone.", "1063": "The one is visible, the other in­ visible ;", "1064": "and the soul, which is invisible, when it employs the bodily senses wanders and is confused, but when it abstracts itself from the body it attains to the knowledge of that which is eternal, immortal, and unchangeable.", "1065": "The soul, therefore, being uncompounded and invisible must be indissoluble, that is to say immortal.", "1066": "Still Simmias and Cebesh are unconvinced.", "1067": "The former objects, that the soul, according to Socrates' own shewing, is nothing but a harmony resulting from a combination of the parts of the body, and so may perish with the body as the harmony of a lyre does when the lyre itself is broken.", "1068": "And Cebes, though he admits that the soul is more durable than the body, yet objects that it is not therefore of necessity immortal but may in time wear out, and it is by no means clear that this is not its last period.", "1069": "These objections produce a powerful effect on the rest of the company, but Socrates, undismayed, exhorts them not to suffer themselves to be deterred from seeking the truth by any difficulties they may meet with;", "1070": "and then proceedsi to shew, in a moment, the fallacy of Simmias' objection.", "1071": "It was before admitted, he says, that the soul existed before the body, but harmony is produced after the lyre is formed, so that the two cases are totally different.", "1072": "And further, there are various degrees of harmony, but every soul is as much a soul as any other.", "1073": "But then what will a person who holds this doctrine, that the soul is harmony, say of virtue and vice in the soul ?", "1074": "Will he call them another kind of harmony and discord ?", "1075": "If so, he will contradict himself, for it is admitted that one soul is not more -or less a soul than another, and therefore one cannot be more or less harmonized than another, and one could not admit of a greater degree of virtue or vice than another;", "1076": "and indeed a soul, being harmony, could not partake of vice at all, which is discord.", "1077": "Socrates, having thus satisfactorily answered the argument adduced by Simmias, goes on to rebut that of Cebesk, who objected that the soul might in time wear out.", "1078": "In order to do this, he relates that when a young man he attempted to investigate the causes of every thing, why they exist and why they perish;", "1079": "and in the course of his researches finding the futility of attributing the existence of things to what are called natural causes, he resolved on endeavouring to find out the reasons of things.", "1080": "He therefore assumed that there is a certain abstract beauty, and goodness, and magnitude, and so of all other things:", "1081": "the truth of which being granted he thinks he shall be able to prove that the soul is immortal.", "1082": "This then being conceded by Cebes, Socratesl argues that every thing that is beautiful is so from partaking of ab­ stract beauty, and great from partaking of magnitude, and little from partaking of littleness.", "1083": "Now it is impossible he argues that contraries can exist in the same thing at the same time, for instance the same thing cannot possess both magnitude and littleness, but one will withdraw at the ap­ proach of the other:", "1084": "and not only so, but things which, though not contrary to each other, yet always contain con­ traries within themselves cannot co-exist;", "1085": "for instance the number three has no contrary, yet it contains within itself the idea of odd, which is the contrary to even, and so three never can become even;", "1086": "in like manner heat while it is heat can never admit the idea of its contrary, cold.", "1087": "Now if this method of reasoning is applied to the soul it will be found to be immortal;", "1088": "for life and death are contraries, and never can co-exist, but wherever the soul is there is life, so that it con­ tains within itself that which is contrary to death, and conse­ quently can never admit of death ;", "1089": "therefore it is immortal.", "1090": "With this he closes his arguments in support of the sours immortality.", "1091": "Cebes owns himself convinced, but Simmias, though he is unable to make any objection to the soundness of Socrates' reasoning, cannot help still entertaining doubts on the subject.", "1092": "If, however, the soul is immortal, Socrates pro­ ceedsm, great need is there in this life to endeavour to become as wise and good as possible.", "1093": "For if death were a deliverance from every thing it would be a great gain for the wicked, but since the soul appears to be immortal, it must go to the place suited to its nature.", "1094": "For it is said that each person's demon conducts him to a place where he receives sentence according to his deserts.", "1095": "He then\" draws a fanciful picture of the various regions of the earth, to which the good and the bad will respectively go after death, and exhorts his friends to use every endeavour to acquire virtue and wisdom in this life, \" for,\" he adds, \" the reward is noble and the hope great.", "1096": "\"Having thus brought his subject to a conclusion, Socrates proposes to bathe himself, in order not to trouble others to wash his dead body.", "1097": "Crito thereupon asks if he has any com­ mands to give, and especially how he would be buried, to which he, with his usual cheerfulness, makes answer, \" Just as you please, if only you can catch me;", "1098": "\" and then, smiling, he re­ minds them that after death he shall be no longer with them, and begs the others of the party to be sureties to Onto for his absence from the body, as they had been before bound for his presence before his judges.", "1099": "After he had bathed, and taken leave of his children and the women of his family, the officer of the Eleven comes in to inti­ mate to him that it is now time to drink the poison.", "1100": "Crito urges a little delay, as the sun had not yet set, but Socrates ' refuses to make himself ridiculous by shewing such a fondness for life;", "1101": "the man who is to administer the poison is therefore sent for, and on his holding out the cup, Socrates, neither trembling nor changing colour or countenance at all, but, as he was wont, looking stedfastly at the man, asked if he might make a libation to any one, and being told that no more poison than enough had been mixed, he simply prayed that his depar­ ture from this to another world might be happy, and then drank off the poison readily and calmly.", "1102": "His friends, who had hitherto with difficulty restrained themselves, could no longer control the outward expressions of grief, to which Socrates said, “ What are you doing, my friends ?", "1103": "I, for this reason chiefly, sent away the women, that they might not commit any folly of this kind.", "1104": "For I have heard that it is right to die with good omens.", "1105": "Be quiet, therefore, and bear up.", "1106": "\"When he had walked about for a while his legs began to grow heavy, so he laid down on his back, and his body, from the feet upwards, gradually grew cold and stiff.", "1107": "His last words were, \"Crito, we owe a cock

question is about the choice of physicians or shipwrights, or the building of walls, or the construction of ports or docks, will a rhetorician be con­ sulted, or a person skilled in these several

justly;", "2454": "though if he uses it unjustly, he and not his teacher is to blarneySocrates, here, perceiving an inconsistency in Gorgias' state­ ment, after deprecating his being offended at the course the dis­ cussion might take, asks whether by saying that a rhetorician can speak more persuasively to the multitude on any art, than a person skilled in that art, he does not mean the ignorant by the multitude;", "2455": "and, that being admitted, whether it does not follow that one who is ignorant will be more capable of per­ suading the ignorant, than one who possesses knowledge ?",

takes up the discussion, and having elected to ask questions, instead of answering them, begins by asking Socrates what kind of art he considers rhetoric to be.", "2465": "Socrates answers that he does not think it is any art at all, but a kind of skill, employed for procuring gratification and pleasure :", "2466": "in other words, a species of flattery, of which there are many divisions.",

there are two divisions of it, gymnastics and medicine.", "2473": "In the political art legislation cor­ responds to gymnastics, and the judicial art to medicine.", "2474": "But flattery, perceiving that these four take the best possible care of the soul and body respectively, has divided itself fourfold, and feigns itself to be what it pretends, not really caring for what is best, but seducing ignorance by means of pleasure.", "2475": "Thus cookery puts on the garb of medicine, and pretends that it knows the aliment best for the body;", "2476": "and again, personal decoration feigns itself to be gymnastics.", "2477": "Then, he adds, what personal decoration is to gymnastics, that is sophistry to legis­ lation, and what cookery is to medicine, that is rhetoric to jus­ tice;", "2478":

him who possesses it.", "2483": "For what is it to have power ?", "2484": "is it to do what one wishes, or what appears to one to be best ?", "2485": "Polus admits that it is not good for a person devoid of under­ standing to do what appears to him to be best.", "2486": "He must therefore prove that rhetoricians possess understanding, other­ wise, since to have power is a good, they cannot do what they wish.", "2487": "Polus, however, is unable to distinguish between doing what one wishes and doing what appears to be best, and there­ fore agrees to change positions with Socrates, and to answer instead of asking questionsf.", "2488": "Socrates, then, asks, do men wish what they do for the sake of the thing itself, or for some other end ?", "2489": "for instance, do men take medicine because they wish to take it, or in order to health ?", "2490": "Again, do men incur the perils of the sea because they wish to be-in peril, or for the sake of riches ?", "2491": "Clearly the latter, in both and all similar cases.", "2492": "Now some things, such as wisdom, health, and riches, are good, but their contraries evil;", "2493": "but whatever we do, we do for the sake of that which is good.", "2494": "So that if we kill or banish a person, if it is good to do so, we wish it, and do what we wish;", "2495": "but if it is really evil, though it appears to us to be good, we do not what we wish.", "2496": "Polus sees the force of Socrates' argument, and can only ob­ ject to it that Socrates himself would like to do what he pleased, and would envy another whom he saw slaying, or spoiling, or imprisoning whom he pleased.", "2497": "But Socrates resolutely denies this, and insists that if he must necessarily either act unjustly or suffer unjustly, he should choose the latter;",

mentions instances of men whom all have accounted happy, though they were unjust, especially that of Archelaus, king of Macedonia.", "2502": "But Socrates denies that any one who acts unjustly can be happy;", "2503": "and fur­ ther than this, he contends that a person who acts unjustly, and does not suffer punishment, is more miserable than one who meets with punishment for his injustice.",

or the pleasure they oc­ casion, or both;", "2508": "and in like manner base things are deemed base on account of the pain or evil they occasion, or both;", "2509": "so that when of two things one is more beautiful than the other, it is so because it excels in pleasure or utility, or both;", "2510": "and when of two things one is more base, it must be because it exceeds in pain or evil.", "2511":

injustice does not exceed the suffering it, in pain;", "2514": "it remains, therefore, that it must exceed it in evil:", "2515": "consequently it must be worse, for whatever exceeds another thing in evil must necessarily be worseh.", "2516": "Having established his point thus far he now goes on to prove that it is the greatest of evils for one who has com­ mitted injustice not to be punished.",

patient;", "2520": "and the patient suffers what the agent does;", "2521": "so that if the agent punishes justly the patient also suffers justly.", "2522": "But it has been just admitted that all just things are beautiful;", "2523": "and it was proved before that all beautiful things are good, either because they are pleasant or useful;", "2524": "whence it follows that he who is punished suffers that which is good, and is benefited in being freed from the greatest evil, which is depravity in the soul.", "2525": "From all this it is evident that rhetoric can be of no use whatever:", "2526": "for it is generally employed for the purpose of excusing injustice, and screening men from the punishment they deserve, which on the contrary they ought rather to court than to shun i.", "2527": "Polus having been thus completely silenced, Callicles takes up the argument and begins by asking whether Socrates is really in earnest.", "2528": "Finding that he is so, he blames Polus for having granted that it is more-base to commit injustice than to suffer it;", "2529": "for that there is a difference between nature and law, which Socrates perceiving, confounded that which is more base by nature with that which is so by law, and so made that which is more base by law appear to be more so by nature:", "2530": "whereas by nature it is more base to suffer injustice than to commit it.", "2531": "For the weak and the many make laws with a view to their own advantage, but nature herself avows that it is just that the better should have more than the worse, and the more powerful than the weaker.", "2532": "Callicles then pro­ ceeds to inveigh against philosophy and philosophers, and when he has done, Socrates, after having indulged in a vein of pleasant irony at his expense, returns to the subject, and asks what he means by the superior, the better, and the stronger, whether they are the same or different.", "2533": "Callicles says they are the same.", "2534": "Socrates objects, that if that is the case the many being stronger are also the better, and so, in­ asmuch as they make the laws, law and nature are not con­ trary to each other.", "2535": "Callicles therefore is compelled to change his ground, and next says that by the better and superior he means the more wise:", "2536": "and at last he says that they are those who are skilled and courageous in administering the affairs of a city.", "2537": "He adds that it is just that the governors should have more than the governed.", "2538": "Socrates, hereupon, asks whether they ought not to govern themselves also and be temperate, which elicits from Callicles the shameless avowal that a man should have as large desires as he can, and indulge them with­ out restraintk.", "2539": "Socrates having in vain endeavoured to persuade Callicles to change his opinion by two similitudes of a perforated cask, and a full and an empty one, to which he compares the soul, pro­ ceeds to combat his assertion that a happy life consists in having and indulging as large desires as possible.", "2540": "If happiness consists in being hungry and eating, thirsty and drinking, it must follow that to be scabby and itch and scratch one's self is to live happily.", "2541": "Callicles is forced to admit that this is to live pleasantly, and then if pleasantly, happily;", "2542": "and at length is driven to assert that the pleasant and the good are the same.", "2543": "In order to confute this opinion, Socrates leads him to main­ tain that science and courage differ from each other and from the good;", "2544": "and then by a series of most subtle questions, too minute to be abbreviated, forces him to this absurd conclusion, that if the pleasant and the good are the same, a bad man, in­ asmuch as he oftentimes receives more pleasure than a good man, must be accounted better than a good one 1.", "2545": "Callicles to evade this absurdity is compelled to admit that some pleasures are better than others.", "2546": "From this concession Socrates shews that the end of all human actions is the good and not the pleasant;", "2547": "for that so far.", "2548": "is it from being the case that we do

philosophy persuades.", "2550": "He recurs there­ fore to his own former arguments, in which he stated that as there are certain skills, not arts, employed for the gratification of the body, so there are other corresponding ones made use of to please the soul, such as flute-playing, harp-playing, dithyrambic and even tragic poetry ;", "2551": "now take from these last melody, rhythm and measure,

the people better.", "2557": "But before this, Callicles, being hard pressed in argument, breaks off the discussion, and Socrates, at the request of Gorgias, carries it on by himself, and shews at length and with great force and perspicuity the advantages of a virtuous and well regulated life ;", "2558": "and in conclusion he de­ scribes the future judgment when each man will give account of

with which at that very instant his breast is full.", "7080": "Phæ­ drus catches at this, and insists on Socrates repeating these fine things, promising that if he says any thing that excels the speech of Lysias he will erect his statue in gold in Olympiad.", "7081": "As it is the present design of Socrates to take the same low view of love that Lysias had done, he determines to speak with his face covered, that he may not falter through shame.", "7082": "He begins by a definition of love, which he represents to be desire hurried on to the pleasure derived from personal beauty;",

sober senses.", "7089": "For, he argues, it is not universally true that madness is an evil, so far from it, that the greatest blessings spring from madness, for even prophetic inspiration is a species of madness and de­ rives its very name from it.", "7090": "And love is one of many kinds of madness, and as such the source of the greatest happiness to man.", "7091": "To prove this, he says, it is necessary to examine into the nature of the soul, both human and divine.", "7092": "The soul, then, is immortal, because it contains the principle of motion within itself (a subtle argument which it may be observed was not adduced in the Phædo, where the soul's immortality was the immediate point under discussion.)", "7093": "Still, to explain what the soul is would require a divine and

expectation is altogether groundless;", "7125": "and after a charming little episode on the origin of grasshoppers, proposes to consider in what a correct mode of speaking and writing consists", "7126": "The first essential is that the speaker should know the truth of the subject on which he is about to speak.", "7127": "And though it is commonly said that an orator need not know what is really just, but only what will appear so to the multitude, yet Socrates with great force destroys this fallacy, and shews that such rhetoric is not an art but an inartistic trick;", "7128": "for a genuine art of speaking neither does nor can exist without laying hold of truth.", "7129": "Rhetoric must be an art that leads the soul by means of argument.", "7130": "Now in courts of justice and

nearly resemble each other, so that a person who means to persuade or deceive another must be able to distinguish ac­ curately the similarity and dissimilarity of things, and so lead his hearer by means of resemblances.", "7132": "Taking this as his principle, Socrates proceeds to shew that the speech of Lysias is altogether inartistic, for that he ought first of all to have defined Love and divided it into its different species and shewn of which class he was going to speak, whereas he begins where he should have ended, and throughout speaks at random with­ out any definite design.", "7133": "He then proceeds to comment on his own two speeches.", "7134": "In one he argued that favour ought to be shewn to one that is in love, in the other to a person that is not in love.", "7135": "In one he said that love was a kind of divine madness, and then dividing this madness into four parts he shewed that the madness of Love is the best.", "7136": "In these speeches, then, are seen the two methods of arguing correctly, definition and division, the former of which contemplates many things under one aspect and brings them together under one general idea, the latter separates that general idea into speciesk.", "7137": "Socrates then ridicules the rules of rhetoric laid down by many of the sophists, and having passed a high eulogium on Pericles, shews that a perfect orator must know the real nature of the things to which he will have to apply his speeches, and that is the soul;", "7138": "for as the power of speech consists in leading the soul, he must know how many kinds of soul there are, and by what arguments each kind is most easily persuaded1.", "7139": "From speaking he proceeds to writing, and tells a pleasant story of the invention of letters, and remarks that the evil of writing is, that, like painting, if you ask it a question it cannot answer;", "7140": "and when once written it is tossed from hand to hand, as well among those who understand it as those who do not.", "7141": "But there is another kind of discourse far more excellent, which is written in the learner's mind, and knows when to speak and when to be silent.", "7142": "The conclusion of the whole is that a speaker should be acquainted with the true nature of each subject on which he speaks or writes, be able to define, and divide things into their species until he reaches the indivisible, and to inves­ tigate the nature of the soul and apply his discourses to each soul according to its capacity.", "7143": "Then, with a message, in accordance with these principles, to Lysias, and a high encomium on Isocrates, who promised to be led by a diviner impulse to holier and higher things, he con­ cludes by praying that Pan would grant him to be beautiful in the inner man,

In this lying down together, then, the unbridled horse of the lover has something to say to its charioteer, and begs to be allowed some small en­ joyment in recompence for his many toils, but the same horse of the favourite has nothing to say, but swelling with love and in doubt, embraces the lover, and kisses him as he would kiss a very dear friend, and when they are laid down together, he is unable to refuse, as far as in his power, to gratify his lover in whatever he requires.", "7783": "But his yoke-fellow, together with the charioteer, resists this familiarity with shame and rea­ son.", "7784": "If, then, the better parts of their mind have prevailed so as to lead them to a well-regulated mode of living and phi­ losophy, they pass their life here in bliss and concord, having ob­ tained the mastery over themselves, and being orderly, through having brought into subjection that part of the soul in which vice was engendered, and having set free that in which was virtue:", "7785": "and when they depart this life, becoming winged and light, they have been victorious in one of the three truly Olympic con­ tests, a greater good than which neither human prudence nor divine madness can possibly bestow on man.", "7786": "82.

"Socr.", "12173": "This then again is, as it seems, holiness, that which is dear to the gods.", "12174": "jEth.", "12175": "Most certainly.", "12176": "19.", "12177": "Socr.", "12178": "Can you wonder then, when you say this, that your statements do not remain fixed, but move about, and can you accuse me as being the Daedalus that makes them move about, when you yourself are far more skilful than Dædalus, and make them go round in a circle ?", "12179": "Do you not perceive that our discussion, turning round, comes to the same point ?", "12180": "For you surely remember that in a former part of our discus­ sion that which is holy and that which is acceptable to the gods appeared to us not to be the same, but different from each other:", "12181": "do you not remember ?", "12182": "jEth.", "12183": "I do.", "12184": "Socr.", "12185": "Now, then, do you not perceive that you say that holi­ ness is that which is dear to the gods ?", "12186": "But is this any thing else than that which is acceptable to the gods ?", "12187": "is it not so ?", "12188": "Euth.", "12189": "Certainly.", "12190": "Socr.", "12191": "Either, therefore, we did not then admit that properly, or, if we did, our

it, if any man does;", "12199": "and I cannot let you go like Proteus, until you have told me.", "12200": "For if you had not known clearly both what is holy and what is impious, it is not possible

not act rightly in this matter, and would have been ashamed in the sight of men.", "12202": "But now I am sure that you think you clearly know both what is holy and what is not.", "12203": "Tell me,

learning from you what things are holy and what not, I might get rid of Melitus's indictment, by shewing him that I had now become skilled in divine things by the aid of Euthyphron, and that I no longer through ignorance speak rashly, or introduce innova­ tions respecting them, and that therefore I should lead a better life for the future.", "12210": "As Socrates was one day going from the Academy to the Lyceum he met with Hippothales, Ctesippus, and other youths, who were on that day celebrating the Hermæan festival in a newly-erected palæstra hard by.", "12211": "They invite him to come in and join their conversation;", "12212": "he promises to do so on condition that they will first tell him who is the beauty among them.", "12213": "Hippothales, to whom he first puts the question, shews, by his embarrassment, that he is himself far gone in love;", "12214": "and on being taxed with it by Socrates blushes still more, whereupon Ctesippus says that he is constantly overwhelming them with his poems and speeches on his favourite Lysis.", "12215": "Socrates, on hearing this, begs Hippothales to inform him how a lover ought to speak of or address his favourite.", "12216": "Hippothales, though he does not deny his being in love, does deny that he makes verses or speeches;", "12217": "but Ctesippus shews that he is constantly giving utterance to the most extravagant praises of his fa­ vourite and his family;", "12218": "on which Socrates remarks that he should not celebrate his victory before it is won ;", "12219": "for that it is not wise to praise the object of one's affection before a return of affection on his part is secured, and moreover such as are beautiful when highly praised are apt to become arrogant, and so are more difficult to be won.", "12220": "Hippothales takes these sug­ gestions in good part, and begs Socrates to advise him how to address his favourite so as to win his affection, which Socrates readily promises to do if they will give him an opportunity of conversing with Lysis.", "12221": "To this end they all enter the palm­ stra, and almost as soon as Socrates, Ctesippus, Menexenus and others had seated themselves down in a quiet corner, Lysis, who is very fond of listening to conversations, comes and takes his seat next his friend Menexenus, while Hippo­ thales is concealed in the back-ground out of sight of his favourite a.", "12222": "Socrates begins by addressing a few words to the latter, but on Menexenus being called out by the master of the palæstra, he turns to Lysis, and asks him whether his parents do not love him very much.", "12223": "On Lysis replying that they certainly do, Socrates shews him that though, since they love him, they must needs wish to make him as happy as possible, yet they are so far from letting him do whatever he pleases, that they put him under the government of others, even of slaves, and this not on account of his youth, but because he has not yet ac­ quired sufficient experience and knowledge to be entrusted with the government of himself;", "12224": "but that whenever he is wise enough, not only his father, but all others, will entrust him with the management of themselves and their affairsb.", "12225": "At this point of the conversation Menexenus returned and resumed his seat near Lysis, who begs of Socrates to say over again to Menexenus what he had been saying to him;", "12226": "but Socrates desires him to tell it himself on some future occasion, and for the present engages to converse on some other subject with Menexenus.", "12227": "Having observed, therefore, the friendship that subsisted between Lysis and Menexenus, he asks the lat­ ter, when any one loves another, which of the two becomes a friend of the other, the lover or the beloved ?", "12228": "Menexenus re­ plies that there is no difference.", "12229": "But Socrates shews that it frequently happens that a lover is not only not loved in turn, but is even hated.", "12230": "In that case, then, which is the friend ?", "12231": "Menexenus is forced to admit that unless both love neither can be a friend to the other.", "12232": "But here Socrates interposes this difficulty;", "12233": "he remarks that men often love horses, dogs, and other things which cannot love in turn;", "12234": "and the poet, as Menexenus admits, speaks truly who says, \" Happy the man who has boys for his friends and horses and dogs,\" so that the beloved now appears to be a friend of the lover, and not the lover of the beloved;", "12235": "and by the same reasoning he who is hated is an enemy, and not he who hates, whence the absurd conclusion follows that people are beloved by their enemies and hated by their friends.", "12236": "This, however, is impossible;", "12237": "therefore the reverse must be the case, and the lover must be a friend of the beloved. \"", "12238": "If, then, neither those who love are to be friends, nor those who are loved, nor yet those who both love and are loved,\" who are to be called friends ?", "12239": "Lysis in­ terposes with the remark that they do not appear to him to have conducted their enquiries aright;", "12240": "so Socrates avails him­ self of the opportunity thus offered him, and directs his dis­ course to Lysis c.\"", "12241": "The poets say,\" he observes, that \"", "12242": "God ever conducts like to like,\" and the wisest among men say the same, \" that like must ever needs be friendly to like.\"", "12243": "Lysis agrees to this.", "12244": "But, objects Socrates, only half of this appears to be true, for the more wicked men are the more hostile are they to each other;", "12245": "so that it appears that the good man only is a friend to the good man only, but that the bad man never arrives at true friendship.", "12246": "But here again a new doubt is started.", "12247": "The like can derive no benefit from the like;", "12248": "how, there­ fore, can they be held in regard by each other ?", "12249": "and how can that which is not held in regard be a friend ?", "12250": "In like manner, the good man is sufficient for himself;", "12251": "but he who is sufficient needs nothing, and so will not regard any thing, and therefore not love.", "12252": "So that from this it appears, that not even the good will be friends to each otherd.", "12253": "Socrates then remarks, that he once heard some one say that like is most hostile to like, and the good to the good;", "12254": "and ge­ nerally that things most like each other are most full of envy, strife and hatred, but such as are most unlike are most dis­ posed to friendship, just as the dry desires the moist, the cold heat, and so on.", "12255": "Menexenus admits the truth of this, and of its consequence, that the contrary is most friendly to its con­ trary.", "12256": "But again Socrates drives him to this absurd conclu­ sion, that since enmity is most contrary to friendship, therefore an enemy must be a friend to a friend, or a friend a friend to an enemye.", "12257": "Since it appears, then, that neither is the like friendly to the like, nor the contrary to the contrary, Socrates next pro­ poses to enquire whether that .", "12258": "which is neither good nor evil can be the friend of the good.", "12259": "According to an ancient pro­ verb, the beautiful is friendly, and the good is beautiful, whence he would conclude that that which is neither good nor evil is friendly to the beautiful and the good.", "12260": "There are three several classes of things, he says, the good, the evil, and that which is neither good nor evil.", "12261": "It has already been proved that the good is not friendly to the good, nor the evil to the evil, nor yet the good to the evil, nor the evil to the good ;", "12262": "it remains, therefore, that that which is neither good nor evil must be friendly to the good.", "12263": "But a little further discussion leads to the more narrow conclusion, that that which is neither evil nor good is friendly to the good, on account of the presence of evil f.Both Lysis and Menexenus agree to this conclusion;", "12264": "but Socrates soon raises new difficulties, and shews the fallacious­ ness of their former reasoning.", "12265": "A friend, he says, is a friend to some one, and for the sake of something, and on account of something;", "12266": "for a rich man is a friend to a physician on ac­ count of disease, which is an evil, and for the sake of health, which is a good, so that that which is friendly is a friend for the sake of a friend, on account of an enemy.", "12267": "By proceeding in this way, he argues, we shall at length arrive at some prin­ ciple, which will not have to be referred to another friend, but will arrive at the first friend, for the sake of which all other things are friends, and which is friendly for its own sake.", "12268": "Now it has already appeared that we are friendly to that which is good, and that we love the good on account of evil;", "12269": "if, therefore, evil were to be done away with the good would be of no use to us, and we should not love it.", "12270": "In this, too, his young friends are willing to acquiesce, but Socrates dispels this delusion also, and shews that evil cannot be the cause of love, since if evil were done away with the desires would still remain, which in reality are the causes of friendship;", "12271": "for that which desires desires what it stands in need of, and that which stands in need is friendly to that of which it stands in need:", "12272": "and so love, desire, and friendship respect that which, in a manner, belongs to a man;", "12273": "but then evil belongs to evil and good to good, consequently they will each severally be friendly to their fellow, and the evil will be no less a friend to the evil than the good to the good;", "12274": "but both these positions have already been shewn to be erroneous, and so no positive solu­ tion of the question proposed is arrived ats.", "12275": "I WAS going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum on the road outside the wall close to the wall itself, but when I reached the little gate, where is the fountain of the Panops, I there met with Hippothales son of Hieronymus, Ctesippus the Pseanian, and other young men with them standing together in a group.", "12276": "And Hippothales seeing me approach said, \" Socrates, whither are you going, and whence come you ?\"\" From the Academy,\" I replied, \" and am going straight to the Lyceum.\"\"", "12277": "Hither, then,\" said he, \" straight
