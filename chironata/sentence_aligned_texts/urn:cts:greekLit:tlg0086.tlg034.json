process is, in that art, called syllogism :", "151": "inthis,enthymem5.", "152": "Rhetoric, it is plain, enjoys each advantage ;", "153": "for [with respect to it] the case, in this ;", "154": "reatise, is the same as in the Methodica has been stated of logic ;", "155": "the speeches of orators6 abounding, some in examples, others in enthymems ;", "156": "and orators themselves being in the same way, some fond of ex­ ample, others of enthymem.", "157": "Reasonings, however, conducted through the medium of example, are not less calculated to persuade ;", "158": "but those of which en­ thymem is the characteristic are rather applauded7.", "159": "ut I will hereafter explain what is the cause of this, and how we are to use each species of proof:", "160": "let us, at present, distinguish more clearly respecting these proofs themselves.", "161": "Now forasmuch as that which carries persuasion with it, does so in reference to some one ;", "162": "and either is, immediately on being enun­ ciated, actually of a nature to persuade, and enforce belief;", "163": "or [has its effect] from its appearing to prove through the medium of such [as compose the former class] ;", "164": "and as no art considers particular cases;", "165": "me­ dicine for example, what is wholesome for the indi­ viduals, Socrates or Callias, but what is so for any person of such a constitution ;", "166": "for this question comes within the province of art, but particulars are infinite, and cannot be known:", "167": "so neither will rhetoric con­ sider probability in reference to particular individuals;", "168": "what, for instance, is probable to Socrates or Callias, but that which is so to persons such as they are;", "169": "just in the same way as logic, for that art does not draw conclusions indiscriminately from any subjects;", "170": "for some things there are which appear probable even to a madman;", "171": "[yet you never would dream of arguing about them;", "172": "] but it supplies itself from subjects which require reasoning, as does rhetoric from sub­ jects which are usual matters of deliberation.", "173": "Its business then is respecting points about which we de­ liberate, and have no art specially conversant, and before auditors of such abilities as are not able to take a connected view of reasonings, conducted through many stages, nor to deduce an argument from remote principles.", "174": "Now we deliberate on subjects which appear to admit of having themselves in either of two ways:", "175": "for on questions which cannot, under any cir­ cumstances, past, present, or future, be otherwise;", "176": "on these, I say, no one deliberates, at least not while he apprehends them to be such 8;", "177": "for by such a deli- beration nothing is gained.", "178": "And you may draw your conclusions and inferences, sometimes from premises which you have arrived at by former syllogisms;", "179": "and sometimes from propositions, not syllogistically de­ duced, but requiring such a process by reason of their not being probable at first sight;", "180": "but of these pro­ cesses, it is impossible that the former should not be hard to follow up, by reason of its prolixity (for your hearer 9 is supposed to be a man of merely ordinary understanding), and the latter defective in persuasive efficacy, by reason of its not being deduced out of principles either acknowledged, or probable ;", "181": "sothat it is necessary that both the enthymem and example should be conversant about points which generally speaking, admit of being otherwise, the example an- swering to induction, xmpand the enthymem to syllo- Igism,) and be deduced out of few, and frequently out of fewer intermediate propositions thanthe syllogism, inits original form, consisted of.", "182": "For if any of these 4 be known, it is not necessary to mention it;", "183": "for the hearer of himself makes this addition.", "184": "For example, in order to convey the information that Dorieus was conqueror in a contest where a chaplet is the prize;", "185": "it suffices to say, that he conquered in the Olympic games :", "186": "but as to the circumstance that, having con­ quered at Olympia, he got a chaplet, there is no ne­ cessity for adding it, because every one knows it.", "187": "But as the necessary premises out of which the syllogisms of rhetoric are formed are very few, (for the majority of questions about which decisions and consideration are exercised admit of being otherwise;", "188": "because men deliberate and consider on the subjects of human conduct, and all conduct is of this con­ tingent nature, nor is a single branch, I may say, of these subjects necessary,) and it cannot but be that you should deduce contingent conclusions from pre­ mises whose nature is such;", "189": "and necessary ones, from necessary;", "190": "( this is evident to us from the Analytics:", "191": ")", "192": "I say, since this is the case, it is plAiD that the premises out of which enthymems are de­ duced, will be some of them necessary, but the greatest part contingent :", "193": "enthymems are - educed from probabilities10 (εἰκότα) and signs (σημει̃).", "194": "And thus it follows of necessity;", "195": "that, of these, each respectively is identified with each of the former.", "196": "For probability is what usually happens, not abso- lately so, however, as some define it, but, at any rate, that which, in contingent matter, has itself so to­ wards that with respect to which it is probable, as an universal to a particular 11.", "197": "But of the signs, one has the same ratio as a particular to an universal;", "198": "the other, as an universal to a particular :", "199": "and of these, the one which is necessarily conclusive, I call τεκμήριον;", "200": "but the other, which is not necessary, has no name assigned to it in reference to its difference [as a species.]", "201": "Now by necessary propositions, I mean those out of which a syllogism is adduced ;", "202": "and hence this kind of signs is called τεκμήριον, for when they think it impossible to do away what has been stated, people then esteem that they adduce a τεκμή­ ριον ;", "203": "the point having been evinced and concluded;", "204": "for, according to the old language, τέκμαρ is the same as \" a boundary.", "205": "Again, there is one sign whose ratio is as that of a particular to an universal:", "206": "thus, were one to assert, for instance, that wise are just;", "207": ",-because Socrates wise and just this then is a sign, but it may be done away, even supposing the premiss stated to be true ;", "208": "for it vio­ lates the rules of syllogism, as to the other, when, for instance, a person alleges as a sign that a man is sick, his being in a fever ;", "209": "or says a woman has had a child, because she has milkl ;", "210": "this is a necessary sign ;", "211": "which very one of the signs alone amounts to a τεκμήριον ;", "212": "since it alone, if the premiss be true, cannot be done away.", "213": "The other sign is in the ratio of an universal to a particular ;", "214": "as if, for instance, dne were to say it was a sign that a man has a fever, because he breathes thickly.", "215": "But this, even granting the premiss be true, may be done away :", "216": "for it is very possible that one who has not a fever should breathe thickly.", "217": "Now what is probability, what sign, and what τεκμήριον, and in what they differ, has been explained :", "218": "but in the Analytics [these several gradations of proof] as well as the reasons why some are not correctly inferred, and others are, have been distinctly stated with-greater clearness .", "219": "As to ex- ample, it has been stated that it is an induction, and induction on what kind of subjects ;", "220": "and its ratio is neither that of a part to a whole, nor of a whole to a part, nor of a whole to a whole :", "221": "but example is in the ratio of a part to a part 14, of a similar case to a similar, when, both coming under the same genus, the one case happens to be better known than the other.", "222": "For instance, you assert that Dionysius, in asking a guard, has views of setting up a tyranny, because Pisistratus before him, when designing this, began to ask for a body guard, and when he got it, established himself as tyrant;", "223": "so too did Theogenes, at Megara.", "224": "And all other persons who have acted in this way, and with whom your audience are ac­ quainted, become examples against Dionysius, with respect to whom they do not yet know whether he be asking a guard with this intention :", "225": "and all these cases come under the same general premiss15, that he who is laying schemes to set up a tyranny, asks a guard.", "226": "Now then the points have been stated out of which the proofs which have an air of demonstration are adduced.", "227": "The difference of enthymems is considerable, and has remarkably escapednearly every writer :", "228": "it is, too, a difference the very same as exists between syl­ logisms in logic :", "229": "for some enthymems there are of applicability equal to that of rhetoric itself, in the same way that in some syllogisms are;", "230": "others, according to the extent of other arts and faculties, existing, some already, and others not yet comprised by rules.", "231": "And hence those who employ them both escape the observation of their hearers, and if they handle them more than is right, pass out of their pro- per characters as mere orators.", "232": "This however will become clearer, if stated more in detail.", "233": "I call those forms of reasoning16 properly logical or rhetorical, in reference to which, I use the expression places ;", "234": "such are those which apply with equal advantage to ques­ tions of justice, and natural philosophy, and of the philosophy of social life, and to numerous other sub­ jects which differ in species.", "235": "The place for instance, of greater and less;", "236": "for there will not be a whit more advantage in deducing a syllogism or an enthymem from this place, on a question of justice or of natural philosophy, than on any other subject whatsoever;", "237": "and yet there are questions specifically distinct.", "238": "But I call peculiar, all those reasonings which arise out of propositions, conversant with each species and genus of subjects;", "239": "for instance, there are propositions on subjects of natural philosophy17 out of which neither enthymem nor syllogism could be constructed respect­ ing morals;", "240": "and on this subject, again, there are others out of which will arise no reasoning respecting natural philosophy;", "241": "this is also the case equally on every subject.", "242": "Now the first-mentioned reasonings (the τόποι) will render a man informed on no class of subjects, for they are about no distinct subject-matter:", "243": "as to the other (ἴδια), the orator, in proportion as he makes the better 18 selection of propositions peculiar, will imperceptibly produce a science different from mere rhetoric or logic19 ;", "244": "for, if he light on first prin­ ciples, thenceforth, it will no longer be rhetoric or logic which he is employing, but that science whose principles he embraces.", "245": "The greatest number of enthymems are constructed out of these peculiar propositions, which are particu­ lar and limited;", "246": "and from the universal ones, the less.", "247": "Just then as I did in the Topics, so here must I make a distinction of the peculiar20 propositions and places of enthymems, whence we are to deduce them.", "248": "Now I mean by εἶδη, those propositions which are peculiar to the several kindsof rhetoric;", "249": "by τόποι, those which are common alike to all.", "250": "Let us then treat of the special propositions before the others.", "251": "Let us, however, first ascertain the kinds of rhetoric itself;", "252": "in order that having distinguished them as to their number, we may separately ascertain the ele­ ments of persuasion and propositions peculiar to each 21.1 i THE species of rhetoric are three in number, for of so many descriptions are the hearers of orations;", "253": "be­ cause an oration is constituted of three things, of the speaker, and of the subject about which he speaks, and of the person to whom;", "254": "and to him it is that the end of the speech has its reference ;", "255": "I mean to the hearer.", "256": "TheTiearer must of necessity be either an unconcerned hearer, or a judge;", "257": "and a judge either of things past or to come;", "258": "one then acts as judge respecting what is yet to happen, as the mem­ her of a popular assembly;", "259": "the other respecting what has already taken place, as the president of a court of justice;", "260": "the other respecting the abilities of the orator, as the unconcerned hearer1.", "261": "Thus, then, there will necessarily result three kinds of orations, the deliberative, judicial, and demonstrative2.", "262": "The business of deliberation is partly exhortation, partly.", "263": "dissuasion ;", "264": "for invariably those who in their indivi­ dual capacities simply advise, and those who publicly harangue, effect one of these objects.", "265": "The business of judicial rhetoric is partly accusation, partly de­ fence;", "266": "for the litigants must of course do one or the other of these things.", "267": "Of demonstrative the busi- ness is partly praise, partly blame.", "268": "Moreover the time proper to each of these respectively is, to the deliberative orator, the future;", "269": "for in exhorting or dissuading, he advises respecting thingsfuture3.", "270": "The time proper to a judicial pleader is thepast;", "271": "for it is ever on the subject of actions already that tEe one party accuses, and the other defends.", "272": "To the demonstrative orator the present time is the most appropriate, for it is in reference to qualities actually possessed that all eithr praise or blame.", "273": "Orators, however, do very frequently avail themselves of other times;", "274": "as well by awakening a recollection of what has already happened, as by anticipating what is likely to happen.", "275": "The end of each of these branches is different, and, as belonging to three sub­ jects, is itself triple.", "276": "*The object of the deliberative orator is the expe-* dient and inexpedient;", "277": "for he who recommends, ad­ vises you to adopt the better measure;", "278": "but he who dissuades, diverts you from the worse;", "279": "the other considerations either of justice and injustice, of honour or disgrace, he adjoins by the way, in addi­ tion to these two.", "280": "The object of the judicial pleader is justice and injustice;", "281": "but he also embraces by the way those oTher considerations.", "282": "The object of those praise andblame is honour and disgrace ;", "283": "and these also refer other considerations to tHese two.", "284": "But we may take as a sign that what I have stated is the particular object of each, the fact that there are times when they will not feel inclined even to raise a question about the other:", "285": "the litigant, for example, will not always deny that the fact has taken place, or that it has hurt the other party;", "286": "but he never, under any circumstances, would admit that he has been guilty of injustice toward him ;", "287": "for then would there be no need of a judicial decision.", "288": "In the same way the deliberative orator very often aban­ dons the other considerations ;", "289": "but as to the point that he is advising what is disadvantageous, or dis­ suading from what is useful, this will he never admit;", "290": "but it frequently happens that (on a question of in­ vasion) they do not trouble themselves to make out that the subjugating a neighbouring people is not in­ consistent with justice.", "291": "Just so those who praise and blame do not consider whether the person's con­ duct has been advantageous or disadvantageous ;", "292": "nay, they, in many instances, set it down on the score of praise, that, overlooking his own interests, he wrought some deed of honour :", "293": "thus they praise Achilles, be­ cause he came to aid the cause of his comrade Pa­ troclus, with full knowledge that himself was fated to die ;", "294": "it being in his power, [by withholding that aid,] to live.", "295": "To him, however, a death such as this was the more honourable prize :", "296": "but to live would have been advantageous.", "297": "From what has been said, it is plain that the orator must first be in possession of propositions on the sub­ ject of each of these divisions, separately;", "298": "for the τεκμήρια, the probabilities and signs, are degrees of proof available to rhetoric generally.", "299": "It is necessary because syllogism, in general, is made up of proposi­ tions, and the enthymem is a syllogism made up of the propositions which have been mentioned.", "300": "And as it cannot be that what is impossible should ever heretofore have been done or should ever be done hereafter, but what is possible, only:", "301": "as again it cannot be that what has not happened, or that what is never about to happen, ever should, the one have been already done, the other be about to be done:", "302": "it becomes necessary for the deliberative, ju­ dicial, and demonstrative orator to have propositions on the subject of possibility and impossibility;", "303": "and on the questions, whether a fact has or has not hap- pened, will or will not take place.", "304": "And further, since all, as well in praising as in blaming, as well in exhorting as in dissuading, as well in accusing as in defending, attempt to evince not only the points I have mentioned, but likewise to prove respecting this good or bad, this honourable or dishonourable, this just or unjust, that it is, moreover, either great or small, whether speaking of the things independently, or comparing them respectively one with another:", "305": "as this is the case, it is plain that it will be necessary to have propositions respecting the degrees of great and small, of greater and less, as well general, as pe­ culiar to each division:", "306": "what good, for instance, is greater or less, what deviation from justice, or what conformity to it ;", "307": "and so in the same way also re­ specting the other subjects.", "308": "The points then have been stated, respecting which it will be absolutely necessary to get at propositions.", "309": "We must, after this, make a distinction between each of these respectively ;", "310": "the questions, for instance, about which deliberation is conversant;", "311": "those, too, about which demonstra­ tive rhetoric is concerned;", "312": "and, thirdly, those about which judicial.", "313": "FIRST, then, we must ascertain what kind of good or evil.", "314": "it is respecting which the deliberative orator gives his advice;", "315": "for we have seen that it is not about every kind, but about such as may or may not befall US1.", "316": "Such however as either has or will have an existence of necessity;", "317": "such, again, as it is impossible should exist or be produced;", "318": "respecting every such description [of good or evil] there never is any de- liberation:", "319": "neither, in fact, is there about every one even of contingent subjects ;", "320": "for of goods which may or may not accrue2, some exist naturally, others are produced by chance, on the subject of which it is not worth while to deliberate;", "321": "but evidently [he is con­ fined to subjects] about which men resolve;", "322": "of which character are all such as are of a nature to be referred to ourselves, and the first principle of whose creation is in our own power;", "323": "for in deliberation we carry on our views thus far, viz.", "324": "till we shall ascertain whether the achievement of the object be possible to us or not3.", "325": "Now, to enumerate in accurate detail, and to di­ vide into separate species, every subject about which men are wont to interest themselves;", "326": "to enter more­ over into minute distinctions conformable to the stand­ ard of truth to the very utmost that the subject ad­ mits it;", "327": "these inquiries it is not necessary, on the present occasion, to institute, by reason that they be­ long not to the art of rhetoric, but to some art whose province is, in a more peculiar manner, intellect, and truth4;", "328": "and because many speculations more than are proper to this art have already been assigned to it.", "329": "For that remark is true, which I have before made;", "330": "that rhetoric is made up of the science of logic5, and of that branch of the science of social life which recognises the subject of morals;", "331": "and it partly resembles logic, partly the declamations of the so­ phists :", "332": "and in exact proportion as one shall attempt to get up logic or rhetoric, not as they are general faculties, but as distinct sciences, he will unwittingly do away their nature by his encroaching, in the act of so tricking them out, upon sciences of certain defi­ nite subject-matter, and not of words alone.", "333": "Let us, however, even on the present occasion, discuss such points as it is worth while to enlarge upon, and which still reserve the more full consideration for the science of social life:", "334": "for nearly all the questions on which men deliberate and on which the delibera­ tive orator harangues, those at least of the highest concernment, are in number five6;", "335": "and these are questions of finance, of war andpeace, and again re­ specting the safeguard of territory, and respect­ ing imports and exports ,respecting legisla­ ture.", "336": "So that it will be fitting that the orator, who is about to give his advice on the subject of the finance of the state, be acquainted with its revenues, both what and how great they may be;", "337": "in order that, if any branch is overlooked, it may be added to the rest;", "338": "and, if any be in default, it may be augmented.", "339": "Moreover he should be acquainted with the whole expenditure of the state, that if any expense be su­ perfluous it may be curtailed;", "340": "if any too high, it may be reduced.", "341": "For men become more wealthy, not only by adding to their capital stock, but by detract­ ing from their expenses as well.", "342": "These, however, are points which we must not only learn from our own experience as individuals ;", "343": "but, with a view to de­ liberation on these subjects, one ought to be qualified by a research into the discoveries made by other people.", "344": "Respecting questions of war and peace, the orator must needs be acquainted with the force of the state, how great it actually is already, and how great it admits of becoming;", "345": "of what description also it is already, and what additions admit of being made to it.", "346": "Moreover he should know both what wars the state has been engaged in, and how it has conducted them.", "347": "This must he needs know, not in relation to his own state only, but as regards frontier states also;", "348": "particularly in the case of those with whom there is a likelihood of being at war, in order that toward the more powerful, pacific measures may be held, and that in regard to the weaker, it may rest with his own state to make war or not.", "349": "He should also be acquainted with the description of force which belongs to each state, whether it resemble or differ?", "350": "from his own;", "351": "for it is possible, even in this respect, to secure an advantage to yourself, or to have one taken by the enemy.", "352": "In order to all which things, the orator must necessarily have considered with at­ tention the wars, not of his own state only, but those also of others, what has been their issue;", "353": "for it is natural that from similar causes similar results should accrue.", "354": "Moreover as regards the safeguard of the tern- tory, it should not escape his attention how that is preserved;", "355": "but he must be acquainted as well with the numbers, as the nature of the garrisons, and with the positions of the strong holds:", "356": "this it is impossi­ ble that one not acquainted with the country should know.", "357": "But known it must be, in order that if any garrison be weak, it may be reinforced;", "358": "if any be unnecessary, it may be done away, and the force may rather maintain positions strictly adapted to defence.", "359": "Again, on the subject of provision, the orator should know how great a consumption is sufficient to subsist the state, and of what kind that is which arises at home, and what is imported;", "360": "and those nations whose exports there is need of, and those to whose markets he wants to import his home produc­ tions, in order that commercial treaties and agree- ments may be entered into with them.", "361": "[All this should the orator be acquainted withj, because it is absolutely necessary strictly topreserve your citi­ zens from any ground of quarrel in two of their relations, viz. in respect to those physically their su­ periors8, and those who may be serviceable in afore- mentioned points.", "362": "Thus much then it is absolutely necessary that the deliberative orator should be able to consider, in order to the security of the state;", "363": "neither is an at- tention to legislation the least essential;", "364": "for in its legislative enactments stands the safety of the state.", "365": "And thus it becomes requisite, both that he should know how many forms of government there are, and what system of things is expedient for each;", "366": "and what things, as well peculiar to the government, as opposite to it, have a natural tendency to destroy it9.", "367": "I talk of a government being destroyed by things peculiar to itself;", "368": "because, with the exception of the most excellent form of government, every other, by being relaxed or strained too much, de­ stroys itself.", "369": "Thus a democracy, not only when relaxed, but even when overstrained, grows weaker, and thus will at last be brought an oligarchy.", "370": "Just as hookedness or flatness of the nose, not only approach the mean in proportion as they relax from the excess, but also, when they become excessively hooked or flat, dispose the nostrils in such a way as no longer so resemble the nasal organ.", "371": "It is serviceable moreover with a view to legisla­ tion, to apprehend not only what constitution is ex­ pedient, by deriving your view from circumstances past, but to become acquainted also with the consti­ tution of other states, and to what kind of constitu- tions what sort of measures are adapted.", "372": "Thus it is plain, that accounts of travellers are of use with a view to legislation ;", "373": "for hence we are able to ascer­ tain what the laws of other nations are ;", "374": "and with a view to debates on matters of state, the researches of those who write on human conduct are useful:", "375": "all these points however form part, not of rhetoric, but of the science of social life.", "376": "So many then are the questions of highest con­ cern touching which the deliberative orator must be in possession of propositions.", "377": "We will, however, again discuss the elements out of which it is proper to exhort and dissuade, as well on these as on other questions.", "378": "NEARLY every one individually, and all men in ge- neral, have some object, at which directing every aim, they both choose and avoid;",

"381": "and what are its constituents;", "382": "for on the subject of it, and what conduces to it, and of its opposites, exhorta­ tion or dissuasion is always conversant;", "383": "and this, be­ cause we needs do the things which procure it or any of its constituents, or which render it greater from having been less, and refrain from doing the things which destroy or impede it, or produce its opposites.", "384": "Let happiness then be defined to be good fortune in conjunction with virtue2,—or, independency of life, -or, the life which is most pleasant,accompanied by security,—or, abundance of property and slaves, with powerto preserve and augment it;", "385": "for mankind al­ low either one or more of these things to amount nearly to happiness.", "386": "If then happiness be such as I have described, is constituents must necessarily be— 1st, noble birth 3, many and excellent friends, wealth, a good and numerous offspring, a good old age ;", "387": "and moreover personal excellencies ;", "388": "as health, comeli­ ness, strength, stature, ability in the games;", "389": "character;", "390": "—2nd, honour, good fortune;", "391": "—3rd, virtue, and its constItuent .",

emulate.", "399": "Considered in reference to individuals, noble birth is derivable from male or female ancestry, and legiti­ macy on both sides ;", "400": "and, just as in the case of a state, to

subject of the sense of shame;", "2088": "but of insensibility to it, we shall evidently know enough from the contraries.", "2089": "THE persons towards whom men feel gratitude, and the occasions on which, and with what dispositions on their own part, will be plain to us, after we have defined gratuitous benevolence.", "2090": "Now, let gratuitous benevolence1 be “ that conformably to which, he who has the power is said to confer a benefit on one who needs it, not in return for any thing, nor in order that any thing may accrue to him who so confers it, but that some benefit may arise to the object.\"", "2091": "But it becomes great should it be conferred on one who is in extreme want2, or if the boon be great and difficult of attainment, or at a crisis of a certain description, or if the giver has bestowed it alone, or first, or in a greater degree than any other.", "2092": "Wants are however our desires of these ;", "2093": "such particularly as are attend­ ed by pain on failing of their objects;", "2094": "and of this description are our lusts, as for instance, love.", "2095": "Again, such as arise in the suffering of the body, and in dan­ ger ;", "2096": "for both the man who is exposed to danger, and who suffers pain, is anxious for something.", "2097": "On which account, those who stand by us in poverty and ban­ ishment, should they confer even trifling benefits, will yet have gratified us by reason of the greatness of our need, and the circumstances of the time ;", "2098": "take the instance of him who gave but a mat [to a beggar] in the Lycæum.", "2099": "It is necessary, then, that our obli­ gation have reference, if possible, by all means to some case of this sort, but if not, to some one of equal or greater need.", "2100": "So that, as it is evident both when, and in what cases, an act of free benevolence takes place, and how the parties are affected, it is plain that out of these principles we must get up our speech, showing that, as regards the one party, they were or are exposed to pain, or want of this description, and as regards the other, that in such their want they as­ sisted them by administering some boon of this de­ scription.", "2101": "And it is also evident, by recurring to what topics we may do away the obligation, and make our audi- ence insensible of grateful feelings3;", "2102": "for either we may urge that they are or were assisting them for their own sakes, and this was supposed not to be free benevolence;", "2103": "or are doing so just because it fell out by chance, or because they were compelled to do so;", "2104": "or that they paid back a debt, but did not bestow a gift, and this as well if the party was conscious of his having been so indebted, as if he was not;", "2105": "be­ cause there is in both cases the idea of a quid pro quo;", "2106": "so that neither on this view of the case will any gratitude be felt.", "2107": "We should also examine the point under all the predicaments;", "2108": "for free benevo­ lence stands in this, either that that particular thing was given, or in such quantity, or of such a quality, or as to the time when, or the place where, it was given.", "2109": "And we may adduce it as a sign to suit this purpose, if the parties in question have refused a less favour;", "2110": "and if they have conferred on an enemy either the same favour, or an equal one, or a greater;", "2111": "for then it will be evident that they did it not for our sakes.", "2112": "Or, if he wittingly has given something paltry4;", "2113": "for no one acknowledges that he stands in need of what is paltry.", "2114": "And now have my sentiments respecting benevo­ lence, and the want of it, been explained.", "2115": "LET us explain the circumstances which excite pity;", "2116": "and the persons whom men pity;", "2117": "and, as regards themselves, with what dispositions.", "2118": "Now let pity be defined tb be1, \"a sort of pain occasioned by an evil capable of hurting or destroying2, appearing to be­ fall one who does not deserve it, which one may himself expect to endure3, or that some one connect­ ed with him will;", "2119": "and this when it appears near:", "2120": "for it evidently is necessary that a person likely to feel pity should be actually such as to deem that, either in his own person, or of some one connected with him, he may suffer some evil, and that an evil of such a description as has been stated in the defini­ tion, or one similar to it, or nearly equivalent to it.", "2121": "On which account neither do those who are abso- lutely lost, feel pity f for these think they shall no longer be exposed to suffering, for their sufferings are past;", "2122": "nor -those who esteem themselves excessively happy, but these wax insolent;", "2123": "for evidently, if they esteem every good to be realized to them, they also esteem their lot to be incapable of suffering any evil;", "2124": "since this also enters into the number of goods.", "2125": "But of this description, viz.", "2126": "such as think they may yet suffer evil, are both who already have suffered and escaped5;", "2127": "and those advanced in years, as well by reason of their prudence, as of their experience :", "2128": "and the weak ;", "2129": "and those who are rather timid;", "2130": "and men of education, for these calculate life's contingen­ cies aright;",

the excitements of courage, for instance, under anger or confidence ;", "2133": "for these feelings little calculate the future :", "2134": "nor do those feel pity who are under insolent dispositions7;", "2135": "for these persons also calculate little of suffering any thing:", "2136": "but those who are of the mean temperament between these are susceptible of pity :", "2137": "and those again are not susceptible of it who are vehemently affected by fear;", "2138": "for such as are horror-struck do not feel pity8, by reason of its being akin to an evil which comes home to themselves.", "2139": "Also people are suscep- tible of pity, should they esteem some persons to be good;", "2140": "for he who esteems no one to be such9, will think every one deserving of evil.", "2141": "And in a word, every one, when he is so affected as to call to his recollection the fact, that evils of such a character have befallen either him or his, or to apprehend that they may befall either him or his.", "2142": "And now it has been stated with what dispositions men feel pity.", "2143": "The circumstances which excite their pity will be evident from the definition :", "2144": "for whatever things, of the number of those which cause pain and anguish, have a tendency to destroy, are all such as to cause pity:", "2145": "again, every thing whose tendency is utter abolition;", "2146": "also all those evils which involve the quality of greatness, and of which chance is the cause .", "2147": "But the evils whose characteristic is great anguish and destruction, are as follows:", "2148": "death, as­ saults, personal injuries, and age, and sickness, and want of tood.", "2149": "And the evils of which chance is the cause, are, absolute want, or fewness of friends, (on which account even the being torn from friends and familiars is a circumstance to be pitied,) ugliness, in­ firmity, deformity, and the circumstance that some evil befalls one from a source whence it were becom­ ing for some good to have arisen;", "2150": "and the frequent occurrence of a similar thing:", "2151": "and the accession of some good, when one has already passed his suffer­ ings ;", "2152": "as for example, the gifts of the king were sent down to Diopithes after he was dead11;", "2153": "and the fact either that no good has accrued, or of there being no enjoyment of it when it has arrived.", "2154": "These, then, and the like, are the circumstances on account of which men feel pity.", "2155": "But people are sensible of pity toward their ac­ quaintances, if they be not of extremely close con­ nexion, but about such they feel just as they do about themselves when on the eve of suffering:", "2156": "and on this account Amasis, as they say, did not shed a tear over his son when he was being led to execution, but he did over his friend who was asking an alms;", "2157": "for this was a circumstance to call for pity;", "2158": "the other, to excite horror.", "2159": "For horror is distinct from pity, and has a tendency to expel pity from the breast, and is frequently available to produce a contrary ef­ fect13.", "2160": "Still men feel pity while the evil is yet ap­ proaching.", "2161": "And they feel it towards their equals, whether in age, in temper, in habits, in rank, or in family;", "2162": "for in all these relations, the evil is seen with greater clearness as possible to befall also one's self.", "2163": "For we must here also assume generally, that what­ ever people fear in their own case, that they pity as happening in the case of others.", "2164": "But as the disasters which excite pity always appear to be close at hand, while, as to those removed at the distance of ten thousand years, men neither in the expectation of them, if future, nor in the remembrance of them, if past, are sensible of pity at all, or at least not in an equal degree ;", "2165": "this being the case, it must follow that those characters which are got up with the aid of gesture, and voice, and dress, and of acting, generally have the greater effect in producing pity14.", "2166": "For thus, by setting the evil before our eyes, as either being on the eve of taking place, or as having hap­ pened, men make it appear to be close at hand.", "2167": "Likewise things which have just taken place, or quickly about to do so, have on this very account a greater tendency to excite pity.", "2168": "Also the indications and actions of persons ;", "2169": "for instance, the garments15 of those who have suffered, and other things of that sort.", "2170": "And the expressions of those under suffering, for instance, of those already in act of dying.", "2171": "And especially is it a circumstance to move pity, that while in these crises the persons have borne themselves virtuously 16.", "2172": "For all these circumstances produce pity in a higher degree from its appearing near;", "2173": "also, the fact of the person's being unworthy, and his dis­ aster appearing in view before our eyes.", "2174": "To pity is opposed, most directly, that feeling which men call indignation;", "2175": "for, to the feeling pain at un­ deserved misfortune, is opposed in a certain way the feeling pain at undeserved good fortune, and it ori­ ginates in the same disposition;", "2176": "and these feelings are both those of a virtuous disposition.", "2177": "For we ought to sympathize with, and to pity those who are undeservedly unfortunate;", "2178": "and to feel indignant at those who are undeservedly fortunate ;", "2179": "for whatever happens contrary to desert is unjust;", "2180": "and on this account we make indignation an attribute even of the gods1.", "2181": "It should seem, too, that envy stands opposed to pity in the same way, as appearing to be akin to, and in fact the same thing as, indignation;", "2182": "and yet it really is distinct.", "2183": "For envy is also a pain causing agitation, it also is felt at good fortune, not, however, at the good fortune of the undeserving [only], but of equals and fellows2.", "2184": "The feeling, however, in all cases equally [of envy and of indig­ nation], must exist [in the breasts of those affected by it], not because any difference will be likely to accrue to themselves, but on account of their neigh­ bour, solely as regards himself.", "2185": "For no longer will the one feeling be envy, and the other indignation, but fear, should the pain and agitation exist on this account, viz.", "2186": "because some evil will probably result to themselves from the good fortune of the other.", "2187": "But it is plain that opposite feelings will be conse- quent on these passions:", "2188": "for he who feels pain at those who are undeservedly unfortunate, will feel pleasure, or at least be unaffected by pain, at those who are unfortunate under different circumstances3:", "2189": "for instance, no good man would feel pain about par­ ricides and murderers when they meet with punish­ ment ;", "2190": "since we ought to feel joy at such occurrences ;", "2191": "and so in the case of those who are deservedly for­ tunate ;", "2192": "for both are instances of justice, and cause the good man to rejoice, since it must be that he has a hope that what has been realized to his equal, will be realized also to himself, and these are all feelings of the same disposition;", "2193": "and their opposites, of the opposite dispositions.", "2194": "Since the same man who ex­ ults in misfortune4 is also envious ;", "2195": "for any who feels pain at the accession and acquisition of any good, that person necessarily must rejoice when that good is in act of being withdrawn and lost.", "2196": "On which account these feelings are all of them obstacles to pity;", "2197": "but, among themselves, they differ for the fore­ going reasons, so that all are alike available with a view to render a thins not an object of pity.", "2198": "On the subject of indignation, then, let us first state who the persons are with whom men feel in­ dignant, the occasions on which, and, as regards themselves, with what dispositions;", "2199": "then, after these, of other points.", "2200": "But the subject will be plain from what has already been said ;", "2201": "for if indignation be a feeling pain on a man's appearing to be undeservedly fortunate, it will be evident in the first place that it is not possible to feel indignation in the case of every good.", "2202": "For there is no one who, it another be just, or brave, or shall make acquisitions of virtue, will feel indignation at that other ;", "2203": "for neither is pity felt at the contraries of these qualities5:", "2204": "but it is about wealth and power and the like possessions [that people feel indignant], and in a word, about all those things of which the good are deserving, and such as are naturally possessed of advantages;", "2205": "as, for ex­ ample, of high birth, of beauty, and advantages of that description.", "2206": "But as what is ancient seems, in a certain sense, akin to what is natural, it must follow, that men are indignant, in a greater degree, at those who possess the very same good, if they be recently possessed of it, and are by its means in good circum­ stances, [than with those who have long possessed it.]", "2207": "For those who have recently become rich give greater pain than those who have long been rich, and by right of birth.", "2208": "And, in the same way, persons in office, and men of power, and possessed of numer­ ous friends, and of good children, and any good of this description ;", "2209": "and likewise if, through the instru­ mentality of these, there should accrue to them any further good:", "2210": "here, too, those of recent wealth, who by means of their wealth get into office, give greater pain than those who have been wealthy of old.", "2211": "And in a similar manner in the case of the others.", "2212": "But the reason of this is, that while the one sort appear to possess what is their own, the others do not;", "2213": "for that which appears ever to have held this rank, seems to involve an idea of truth ;", "2214": "insomuch that the others seem to possess what does not belong to them.", "2215": "And as, of the goods, each does not become any one who may accidentally present himself, but there is a certain proportion and idea of adaptation;", "2216": "for ex­ ample, splendour in respect of armour, is not adapted to a man whose virtue is justice, but to him who possesses courage;", "2217": "and splendid marriage feasts are not adapted to those of recent wealth, but to those of high birth:", "2218": "therefore if any one, though he may be a good man, meet with a possession which is not adapted to him, we should feel indignant;", "2219": "as also with an inferior who disputes with his superior;", "2220": "and particularly if he does so on the very points in which he is inferior.", "2221": "Whence also this was remarked by Homer:", "2222": "\" He missed engaging with Ajax the son of Telamon;", "2223": "for Jupiter was indignant because he was fain to engage a hero his superior6.\"", "2224": "But, if it be not on the same grounds, we feel indignant if an in­ ferior challenge a superior, even on any grounds;", "2225": "for instance, if a musician were to dispute with a just man, for justice is superior to music.", "2226": "The per­ sons then with whom, and the reasons why men feel indignant will be evident from this;", "2227": "for they are these or others of the same description.", "2228": "As regards themselves, men have a tendency to in­ dignation, if they deserve and have acquired the highest goods;", "2229": "for the circumstance of those not their equals being thought worthy of equal advan- tages, is not just.", "2230": "Next, they feel it, if they chance to be good and excellent persons;", "2231": "for they both judge aright, and hate what is unjust.", "2232": "Again, if they be ambitious and desirous of certain objects, and especially should they be ambitious about those things which others who are undeserving obtain.", "2233": "And those, in a word, who think themselves worthy those things, of which they do not esteem others worthy, are apt to feel indignant at those others, and about those very objects.", "2234": "On which account slaves, sorry fellows, and men devoid of ambition, are not liable to feelings of indignation, since there is nothing of which they think themselves worthy.", "2235": "And from this it is evident on what occasions of misfortunes, or ill luck, or failure of success, persons ought to rejoice, or at least to be unaffected by pain;", "2236": "for, from what has been stated, the contraries will be evident.", "2237": "So that should the speech have wrought up the judges into this disposition, and should it have shown that those who claim to be pitied, and that the circum­ stances under which they claim it, are undeserving pity, and really deserving not to gain it, it will be impossible for the judges to feel pity.", "2238": "IT is plain also on what occasions, with whom, and with what dispositions men feel envy, if in truth envy be \" a sort of pain at apparent good fortune, touching the above-mentioned goods 1, in the case of equals, not in order that any thing may happen to one's self, and simply on account of their [being thus fortunately for those who have, or seem to have equals, will be the people to be envious.", "2239": "I mean by equals, those who are like in circumstances of birth, connexions, age, habits, character, and property.", "2240": "They, too, will be envious who fall but little short of possessing all 2 :", "2241": "hence those who are carrying on mighty projects, and those who are prosperous, are envious;", "2242": "for they think that every one is carrying off what belongs to them.", "2243": "Again, those who are re­ markably esteemed on any account, and particularly on account of their wisdom or happiness.", "2244": "And those who are ambitious are more given to envy than those who are devoid of ambition.", "2245": "And those who make a show of wisdom, for they are ambitious on the score of wisdom.", "2246": "And, in a word, those who in any respect are ambitious of glory are given to envy in that respect.", "2247": "And the narrow-minded;", "2248": "for, to them, every thing appears of consequence.", "2249": "The goods respecting which men feel envy have been told you ;", "2250": "for all those things whatsoever, about which men are eager for praise, and ambitious, whe- ther they be productions or acquisitions, and re­ specting which they are desirous of renown, and all cases of good luck;", "2251": "about all these nearly is envy felt;", "2252": "and particularly about such of them as the in­ dividuals are themselves desirous of, or think they ought themselves to possess, or those things in the possession of which they are themselves superior, or deficient in a trifling degree.", "2253": "Again, it is evident with whom men are envious ;", "2254": "for this has been already stated in connexion [with what has gone before;", "2255": "since men envy those who come near them in time, and place, and age, and cha­ racter ;", "2256": "whence the saying, \" kindred too is conscious of envy 3.\"", "2257": "Men also envy those with whom they are at

inferiors ;", "2262": "nor again of those to whom they conceive themselves to be in a great degree superior;", "2263": "with the like indifference do they regard those fat all en- gaged] in pursuits of this description.", "2264": "And as men are affected by ambition in regard to rivals, and competitors, and all, in a word, who are eager after the same objects, it must follow that they envy these in an especial manner;", "2265": "whence the saying, \" potter envies potter.\"", "2266": "And those who either succeed with difficulty, or do not succeed at all, envy those who succeed quickly.", "2267": "Again, they envy those whose ac­ quisitions and success are a reproach to themselves, and these are those who are near them, or their equals;", "2268": "for it becomes evident that they do them­ selves fail of success through their own fault, so that this, galling them, produces envy.", "2269": "And those who either possess or have acquired that which it would become themselves to possess, or which themselves had at one time acquired;", "2270": "at least the old, on this account, envy the young.", "2271": "And those who have been at considerable expense on an object, envy those who have expended little on the same object.", "2272": "But it is evident both with whom, and on what occasions, and with what dispositions people of this sort feel plea­ sure ;", "2273": "for they will be delighted, having in the con­ trary circumstances that very temper, the which being without, they are pained.", "2274": "So that if the judges themselves shall have been wrought up into this disposition, while those who lay claim to our pity or to the acquisition of some good, are such as have been described, it is evident that they will not obtain pity at the hands of those on whom they de­ pend for it.", "2275": "HENCE likewise it will be evident both with what dispositions, and in regard to what objects, and of whom, persons are emulous.", "2276": "Because if emulation be “a sort of pain at the apparent presence of goods which are held in honour, and which admit of one's gaining them himself, in the case of those naturally our equals;", "2277": "felt, not because they are present to an­ other, but because they are not likewise present to one Is self,\" (on which very account emulation is a vir- tuous feeling, and belongs to virtuous people, whereas envy is a depraved feeling, and belongs to persons who are depraved:", "2278": "for the one, by motion of his emu- lation, sets himself to acquire the good;", "2279": "while the other, by motion of his envy, sets himself to cause the dispossession of his neighbour).", "2280": "It must be, then, that persons who deem themselves worthy of goods which they do not possess, are apt to feel emulation;", "2281":

description as to be worth the atten­ tion of men in repute;", "2284": "these are wealth, number of friends, office, and whatever other goods are of this kind ;", "2285": "for men feel emulous of such goods ;", "2286": "as though, because they properly belong to such as are men of virtuous dispositions, it were matter of absolute right that themselves should be virtuous.", "2287": "Again, those are emulous whom others esteem worthy of such goods:", "2288": "and those again whose ancestors, or relations, or in- timate friends, or whose tribe or city is held in es­ teem about any point, such

wantonness, and not of malice.", "2368": "They are likewise prone to pity, from their conceiving every one to be good, and more worthy than in fact he is6;", "2369": "for they measure others by the standard of their own guiltlessness ;", "2370": "so that they conceive them to be suffering what they do not deserve.", "2371": "And they are fond of mirth, on which account they are also of a facetious turn7;", "2372": "for face­ tiousness is chastened forwardness of manner.", "2373": "Such, then, is the disposition of the young.", "2374": "BUT those who are advanced in life, and who have

account they neither love nor hate with great earnestness;", "2383": "but, conformably to the remark of Bias, they both love as though about to hate, and hate as though about to love.", "2384": "And they are pusillanimous, from their having been humbled by the course of life ;", "2385": "for they raise their desires to nothing great or vast, but to things only which con­ duce to support of life.", "2386": "And they are illiberal;", "2387": "for property is one of the necessaries;", "2388": "and they are at the same time aware, from their experience, of the difficulty of its acquisition,

"For tragedy is especially limited by one period of the sun, or ad­ mits but a small variation from this period;", "7008": "but the epopee is not defined within a certain time, and in this it differs;", "7009": "though at first they observed the same conduct with tragedy5, no less than epic po- etry.", "7010": "With respect to the parts, however, [of the epopee and tragedy,] some are the same in both, but others are peculiar to tragedy.", "7011": "Hence he who knows what is a good or bad tragedy, knows the same in respect to epic poetry.", "7012": "For those things which the epopee possesses are to be found in tragedy;", "7013": "but every thing which tragedy contains is not in the epopee.", "7014": "CONCERNING, therefore, imitative poetry in hexame­ ters, and comedy, we shall speak hereafter.", "7015": "Let us now, however, speak concerning tragedy, assuming the definition of its essence as arising from what has been already said.", "7016": "Tragedy, therefore, is an imita­ tion of a worthy or illustrious and perfect action, possessing magnitude, in pleasing language, using separately the several species of imitation in its parts, by men acting, and not through narration, through pity and fear effecting a purification from such like passions'.", "7017": "But by pleasing language, I mean lan- guage possessing rhythm, harmony, and melody.", "7018": "And it uses separately the several species [of imita­ tion], because some parts of the tragedy are alone perfected through metres, and others again through melody.", "7019": "But since they produce imitation by act­ ing, in the first place the ornament of the spectacle2 will be a certain part of the tragedy, and in the next place the melopœia 3 and the diction.", "7020": "For by these they produce imitation.", "7021": "But I call diction, indeed, the composition of the metres;", "7022": "and melopœia that, the whole power of which is apparent.", "7023": "Since, how- ever, [tragedy] is an imitation of action, and action is effected by certain agents, who must needs be per­ sons of a certain description both as to their manners and their sentiments 4, (for from these we say that actions derive their quality,) hence there are naturally two causes of actions, sentiments and moral habit, and through these actions all men obtain or fail of the object of their wishes.", "7024": "But a fable, indeed, is an imitation of action;", "7025": "for I mean by a fable here, the composition of incidents.", "7026": "By manners, I mean those things according to which we say that agents are persons of a certain character;", "7027": "and by sentiment, that through which those who speak demonstrate any thing, or explain their meaning.", "7028": "It is necessary, therefore, that the parts of every tragedy should be six, from which the tragedy derives its quality.", "7029": "But these are, fable and manners, diction and sentiment, spectacle and melopœia.", "7030": "Of these parts, however, two pertain to the means by which they imitate;", "7031": "one, to the manner;", "7032": "and three, to the objects5.", "7033": "And be- sides these, there are no other.", "7034": "[Not a few [tragic poets], therefore, as I may say, use all these parts 6.]", "7035": "For every tragedy has scenic apparatus, manners, and a fable, and melody, and, in a similar manner, sentiment.", "7036": "But the greatest of these is the combina- tion of the incidents.", "7037": "For tragedy is an imitation not of men, but of actions, [of life, and of felicity.", "7038": "For infelicity consists in action, and the end is a certain action, and not a quality7.]", "7039": "Men, however, are per­ sons of a certain character, according to their man­ ners ;", "7040": "but according to their actions, they are happy, or the contrary.", "7041": "The end of tragedy, therefore, does not consist in imitating manners, but it embraces manners on account of actions;", "7042": "so that the action and the fable are the end of tragedy.", "7043": "But the end is the greatest of all things.", "7044": "Moreover, without ac­ tion, tragedy cannot exist;", "7045": "but it may exist without manners.", "7046": "For most modern tragedies are without manners;", "7047": "and in short, many poets are such as among painters Zeuxis is when compared with Poly­ gnotus.", "7048": "For Polygnotus, indeed, painted the man­ ners of the good ;", "7049": "but the pictures of Zeuxis are without manners.", "7050": "Further still, if any one place in a continued series moral speeches, sayings, and senti­ ments well framed, he will not produce that which is the work of tragedy;", "7051": "but that will be much more a tragedy, which uses these things as subordinate, and which contains a fable and combination of incidents.", "7052": "Add to this, that the greatest parts by which fable allures the soul, are the revolutions and discoveries.", "7053": "Again, it is likewise an evidence of this, that those who attempt to write tragedies, acquire the power of expressing a thing in tragic diction and manners ac­ curately, before they can compose a fable, as was the case with nearly all the first poets.", "7054": "The fable, there­ fore, is the principal part, and as it were the soul of tragedy;", "7055": "but the manners are next in rank8.", "7056": "[Just as in painting, if any one were to spread the most beauti­ ful pigments on promiscuously, he would not please the view so much as by outlining an image with white colour only.", "7057": "Tragedy also is an imitation of action, and on this account, especially, [an imitation of agents.", "7058": "But the sentiments rank third.", "7059": "And by them [I mean] the power of explaining what is inherent in the subject, and adapted to it, which is the pecu­ liar province of politics9 and rhetoric.", "7060": "For the an­ cient poets represent those whom they introduce as speaking politically;", "7061": "but those of the present day, rhetorically.", "7062": "But the manners are, whatever shows what the deliberate choice is.", "7063": "Hence those speeches are without manners, in which there is altogether nothing that the speaker may choose or avoid 10.", "7064": "But sentiment is that through which they show that a cer­ tain thing is, or is not, or by which they universally enunciate something.", "7065": "And the fourth part of tragedy is diction.", "7066": "But I say, as was before observed, that diction is interpretation by the means of words, and which also has the same power in verse and prose.", "7067": "But of the remaining five, the melopœia is the great­ est of the embellishments.", "7068": "But the scenic decora­ tion is alluring indeed;", "7069": "yet it is most inartificial, and is in the smallest degree akin to poetry.", "7070": "For the power of tragedy remains, even when unaccom­ panied with scenic apparatus and players.", "7071": "And further still, the art of the mechanic possesses more power in constructing the scenic apparatus than that of the poet.]", "7072": "THESE things being defined, let us in the next place show what the combination of the incidents ought to be, since this is the first and greatest part of tragedy.", "7073": "But it is granted to us, that tragedy is the imitation of a perfect and whole action, and of one which pos­ sesses a certain magnitude;", "7074": "for there may be a whole which has no magnitude.", "7075": "But a whole is that which has a beginning, middle, and end.", "7076": "And the begin­ ning is that which necessarily is not itself posterior to another thing;", "7077": "but another thing is naturally ex­ pected to follow it.", "7078": "On the contrary, the end is that which is itself naturally adapted to be posterior to an­ other thing, either from necessity, or for the most part;", "7079": "but after this there is nothing else.", "7080": "But the middle is that which is itself after another thing, and after which there is something else.", "7081": "Hence, it is necessary that those who compose fables properly, should neither begin them casually, nor end them casually, but should employ the above-mentioned forms [of beginning, middle, and end].", "7082": "Further still, since that which is beautiful, whether it be an animal, or any thing else which is composed from certain parts, ought not only to have these parts arranged, but a magnitude also which is not casual", "7083": "For the beautiful consists in magnitude and order.", "7084": "Hence, neither can any very small animal be beautiful;", "7085": "for the survey of it is confused, since it is effected in a time nearly in­ sensible.", "7086": "Nor yet a very large animal;", "7087": "for it is not surveyed at once, but its subsistence as one and a whole escapes the view of the spectators;", "7088": "such as if, for instance, it should be an animal of ten thousand stadia in length.", "7089": "Hence, as in bodies and in animals it is necessary there should be magnitude;", "7090": "but such as can easily be seen;", "7091": "thus also in fables, there should be length, but this such as can easily be re­ membered 1.", "7092": "The definition, however, of the length with reference to contests2 and the senses, does not fall under the consideration of art.", "7093": "For if it were requisite to perform a hundred tragedies, [as is said to have been the case more than once 3,] the perform­ ance ought to be regulated by a clepsydra.", "7094": "But the definition [of the length of the fable] according to the nature of the thing, is this, that the fable is always more beautiful the greater it is, if at the same time it is perspicuous.", "7095": "Simply defining the thing, however, we may say, [that a fable has an appropriate magni­ tude,] when the time of its duration is such as to render it probable that there can be a transition from prosperous to adverse, or from adverse to prosperous fortune, according to the necessary or probable order of things as they take place.", "7096": "This is a sufficient definition of magnitude.", "7097": "ofTHE fable, however, is one, not as some suppose, if one person is the subject of it;", "7098": "for many things which are infinite in kind happen [to one man], from a certain number of which no one event arises.", "7099": "Thus, also, there are many actions of one man, from which no one action is produced.", "7100": "Hence all those poets appear to have erred who have written the Heracleid, and Theseid, and such like poems.", "7101": "For they suppose that because Hercules was one person, it was fit that the fable should be one.", "7102": "Homer, how­ ever, as he excelled in other things, appears likewise to have seen this clearly, whether from art, or from nature.", "7103": "For in composing the Odyssey, he has not related every thing which happened to Ulysses;", "7104": "such as the being wounded in Parnassus 1, and pretending to be insane at .-the muster of the Greeks;", "7105": "one of which taking place, it was not necessary or probable that the other should happen;", "7106": "but he composed the Odyssey, as also his Iliad, upon one3 action.", "7107": "It is requisite, therefore, that as in other imitative arts one imitation4 is the imitation of one thing, thus, also, [in tragedy,] the fable, since it is an imitation of action, should be the imitation of one action, and of the whole of this, and that the parts of the trans­ actions should be so arranged, that any one of them being transposed, or taken away, the whole would become different and changed.", "7108": "For that which when present or not present produces no sensible [difference], is not a part of the fable 5.BUT it is evident from what has been said, that it is not the province of a poet to relate things which have happened, but such as might have happened, and such things as are possible according to proba­ bility, or which would necessarily have happened1.", "7109": "For an historian and a poet do not differ from each other, because the one writes in verse and the other in prose;", "7110": "for the history of Herodotus might be written in verse, and yet it would be no less a history with metre, than without metre.", "7111": "But they differ in this, that the one speaks of things which have hap­ pened, and the other of such as might have happened.", "7112": "Hence, poetry is more philosophic, and more deserv­ ing of attention, than history.", "7113": "For poetry speaks more of universals, but history of particulars.", "7114": "But universal consists indeed in relating or performing certain things which happen to a man of a certain description, either probably or necessarily, [to which the aim of poetry is directed in giving names 2;", "7115": "] but particular consists in narrating what, [for example,] Alci blades did, or what he suffered.", "7116": "in comedy, therefore, this is now become evident.", "7117": "For [comic poets] having composed a fable through things of a probable nature, they thus give whatever names they please3 to their characters, and do not, like Iambic poets, write poems about particular persons.", "7118": "But in tragedy they cling to real names.", "7119": "The cause, how­ ever, of this is that the possible is credible.", "7120": "Things, therefore, which have not yet been done, we do not yet believe to be possible;", "7121": "but it is evident that things which have been done are possible;", "7122": "for they would not have been done, if they were impossible.", "7123": "Not, indeed, but that in some tragedies there are one or two of known names, and the rest are feigned;", "7124": "but in others there is no known name;", "7125": "as, for instance, in the Flower of Agatho.", "7126": "For in this tragedy, the things and the names are alike feigned, and yet it delights no less.", "7127": "Hence, one must not seek to ad­ here entirely to traditional fables, which are the sub­ jects of tragedy.", "7128": "For it is ridiculous to make this the object of search, because even known subjects are known but to a few, though at the same time they delight all men.", "7129": "From these things, therefore, it is evident that a poet ought rather to be the author of fables than of metres, inasmuch as he is a poet from imitation, and he imitates actions.", "7130": "Hence, though it should happen that he relates things which have happened, he is no less a poet.", "7131": "For nothing hinders but that some actions which have happened, are such as might both probably4 and possibly have happened, and by [the narration of] such he is a poet.", "7132": "But of simple plots and actions, the episodic are the worst.", "7133": "But I call the plot episodic, in which it is neither probable nor necessary that the episodes follow each other.", "7134": "Such plots, however, are com- posed by bad poets indeed, through their own want of ability5;", "7135": "but by good poets, on account of the players 6. For, introducing [dramatic] contests, and extending the plot beyond its capabilities, they are frequently compelled to distort the connexion of the parts.", "7136": "But, since tragedy is not only an imitation of a perfect action, but also of actions which are ter­ rible and piteous, and actions principally become such, [and in a greater degree, when they happen contrary to opinion, 7] on account of each other.", "7137": "* * * *", "7138": "For thus they will possess more of the marvellous, than if they happened from chance and fortune;", "7139": "since, also, of things which are from for­ tune, those appear to be most admirable, which seem to happen as it were by design.", "7140": "Thus the statue of Mityus at Argos, killed him who was the cause of the death of Mityus by falling as he was surveying it.", "7141": "8", "7142": "For such events as these seem not to take place casually.", "7143": "Hence it is necessary that fables of this kind should be more beautiful.", "7144": "OF fables, however, some are simple, and others complex;", "7145": "for so also are the actions of which fables are the imitations.", "7146": "But I call the action simple, from which taking place, as it has been defined, with continuity and unity, there is a transition with­ out either revolution or discovery;", "7147": "but complex, from which there is a transition, together with discovery, or revolution, or both.", "7148": "It is necessary, however, that these should be effected from the composition itself of the fable, so that from what has formerly happened it may come to pass that the same things take place either necessarily or probably.", "7149": "For it makes a great difference whether these things are effected on account of these, or after these.", "7150": "Now, revolution is a mutation, as has been stated, of actions into a contrary condition;", "7151": "and this, as we say, according to the probable, or the necessary.", "7152": "Thus in the \" Œdipus, 1” the messenger who conies with an intention of delighting CEdipus and liberating him from his fear respecting his mother, when he makes himself known, produces a contrary effect.", "7153": "Thus, too, in the “Lynceus,\" he indeed is introduced as one who is to die, and Danaus follows with an intention of killing him ;", "7154": "but it happens from the course of in­ cidents, that Lynceus is saved, and Danaus is slain.", "7155": "And discovery is, as the name signifies, a change from ignorance to knowledge, or into the friendship or hatred of those who are destined to prosperous or adverse fortune.", "7156": "The discovery, however, is most beautiful, when at the same time there are, as in the “Œdipus,2 revolutions.", "7157": "There are, therefore, other discoveries also.", "7158": "For sometimes it happens, as has been before observed, that there are discoveries of things inanimate3, and casual;", "7159": "or if some one has performed, or has not performed, a thing, there is a recognition of it;", "7160": "but the discovery which especially pertains to the fable and the action is that before mentioned.", "7161": "For a discovery and revolution of this kind will excite either pity or fear;", "7162": "and tragedy is supposed to be an imitation of such actions [as excite fear and pity].", "7163": "Again, it will happen that in­ felicity and felicity will be in such like discover- ies.", "7164": "But since discovery is a discovery of certain persons, some [discoveries] are of one person only with reference to another, when it is evident who the other person is, but sometimes it is necessary to dis­ cover both persons.", "7165": "Thus Iphigenia was recognised by Orestes through the sending an epistle4;", "7166": "but another discovery was requisite to his being known by Iphigenia.", "7167": "[Two parts of the fable, therefore, viz.", "7168": "revolution and discovery, are conversant with these things;", "7169": "but the third part is pathos.", "7170": "And of these, revolution and discovery have been already discussed.", "7171": "Pathos, however, is an action destructive, or lament­ able ;", "7172": "such as death when it is obvious, grievous pains, wounds, and such like particulars 6.][BUT we have before spoken of the parts of tragedy which are requisite to constitute its quality.", "7173": "The parts of tragedy, however, according to quantity, and into which it is separately divided, are as follow:", "7174": "prologue, 1 episode,2 exode,3 and chorus, of the parts of which one is the parodos,4 but the other is the sta­ simon.", "7175": "5", "7176": "These [five] parts, therefore, are common to all [tragedies];", "7177": "but the peculiar parts are [the songs] from the scene and the kommoi.", "7178": "And the prologue, indeed, is the whole part of the tragedy, prior to the entrance of the chorus.", "7179": "The episode is the whole part of the tragedy between two complete odes of the chorus.", "7180": "The exode is the whole part of the tragedy, after which there is no further melody of the chorus.", "7181": "And of the chorus, the parodos, in- deed, is the first speech of the whole chorus;", "7182": "but the stasimon is the melody of the chorus, without ana- pæst and trochee:", "7183": "and the commos 6 is the common lamentation of the chorus and from the scene.", "7184": "But we have before shown what the parts of tragedy are which must necessarily be used;", "7185": "but the parts of it according to quantity, and into which it is separately divided, are these 7.]", "7186": "IN the next place we must show, as consequent to what has been said, what those who compose fables ought to aim at, and beware of, and whence the purpose of tragedy is effected.", "7187": "Since, therefore, it is necessary that the composition of the most beau­ tiful tragedy should not be simple, but complex, and that it should be imitative of fearful and piteous ac­ tions—(for this is the peculiarity of such imitation) -in the first place it is evident, that it is not proper that worthy men should be represented as changed from prosperity to adversity, (for this is neither a subject of terror nor commiseration, but is impious,) nor should depraved characters [be represented as changed] from adversity to prosperity;", "7188": "for this is the most foreign from tragedy of all things, since it pos­ sesses nothing which is proper;", "7189": "for it neither appeals to moral sense, nor is piteous, nor fearful.", "7190": "Nor, again, must a very depraved man be represented as having fallen from prosperity into adversity.", "7191": "For such a composition will indeed possess moral tend­ ency, but not pity or fear.", "7192": "For the one is conversant with a character which does not deserve to be un­ fortunate;", "7193": "but the other, with a character similar [to one's own].", "7194": "[And pity, indeed, is excited for one who does not deserve to be unfortunate;", "7195": "but fear, for one who resembles oneself2] ;", "7196": "so that the event will neither appear to be commiserable, nor terrible.", "7197": "There remains therefore the character between these.", "7198": "But a character of this kind is one, who neither ex­ cels in virtue and justice, nor is changed through vice and depravity, into misfortune, from a state of great renown and prosperity, but has experienced this change through some [human] error;", "7199": "such as Œdipus and Thyestes;", "7200": "and other illustrious men of this kind.", "7201": "Hence it is necessary that a plot which is well constructed, should be rather single3 than twofold, (though some say it should be the latter,) and that the change should not be into prosperity from adversity, but on the contrary into adversity from prosperity, not through depravity, but through some great error, either of such a character las we have mentioned], or better rather than worse.", "7202": "But the proof of this is what has taken place.", "7203": "For of old the poets adopted any casual fables;", "7204": "but now the most beautiful tragedies are composed about a few families;", "7205": "as for instance, about Alcmæon, CEdipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, and Telephus4, and such other persons as happen either to have suffered or done things of a dreadful nature.", "7206": "The tragedy, there­ fore, which is most beautiful according to art, is of this construction.", "7207": "Hence they erroneously blame Euripides, who accuse him of having done this in his tragedies, and for making many of them terminate in misfortune.", "7208": "For this method, as we have said, is right;", "7209": "of which this is the greatest evidence, that in the scenes, and contests of the players, simple fables which terminate unhappily appear to be most tra­ gical, if they are properly acted.", "7210": "And Euripides, though he does not manage other things well, yet appears to be the most tragic of poets5.", "7211": "The fable, however, ranks in the second place, though by some it is said to be the first composition, which has a twofold construction, such as the Odyssey, and which terminates in a contrary fortune, both to the better and worse characters.", "7212": "It appears, however, to rank in the first place, through the imbecility of the spec... tators6.", "7213": "For the poets, in composing their plots, ac­ commodate themselves to the wish of the spectators.", "7214": "This pleasure, however, is not [properly] derived from tragedy, but is rather suited to comedy.", "7215": "For there, though the greatest enemies be introduced, as Orestes and AEgisthus, yet in the end they depart friends, and no one falls by the hand of the other7.", "7216": "TERROR and pity, therefore, may be produced from the sight1.", "7217": "But they may also arise from the com- bination of the incidents, which is preferable, and the province of a better poet.", "7218": "For it is necessary that the fable should be so composed, that he who hears the things which are transacted, may be seized with horror, and feel pity, from the events, without the assistance of the sight;", "7219": "and in this manner any one who hears the fable of CEdipus is affected.", "7220": "But to effect this through spectacle is more inartificial, and requires great expense 2.", "7221": "But they who produce not the terrible, but the monstrous alone, through scenic representation, have nothing in common with tragedy.", "7222": "For it is not proper to expect every kind of pleasure from tragedy, but that which is ap­ propriate.", "7223": "Since, however, it is necessary that the poet should procure pleasure from pity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this must be ef­ fected by the circumstances.", "7224": "Let us, then, ascertain what kind of events appear to be dreadful or lament­ able.", "7225": "But it is necessary that actions of this kind should either be those of friends towards each other, or of enemies, or of neither.", "7226": "If, therefore, an ene­ my kills an enemy, he does not show any thing which is an object of pity, neither while he does the deed, nor when he is about to do it, except what arises from the deed itself.", "7227": "And this will be the case, when one of those who are neither friends nor enemies do the same.", "7228": "But when these things hap­ pen in friendships3, as when a brother kills a brother, or a son his father, or a mother her son, or a son his mother, or intends to do it, or does any thing else of the like kind-such subjects are to be sought for.", "7229": "One must not, therefore, [completely] alter the re­ ceived fables.", "7230": "I mean, for instance, such as the fable of Clytemnestra being slain by Orestes, and of Eriphyle by Alcmæon.", "7231": "But it is necessary that the poet should invent the plot, and use in a becoming manner those fables which are handed down.", "7232": "What, however, we mean by [using fables] in a becoming manner, let us explain more clearly.", "7233": "Now, the action may take place in such a way as the ancients have represented it, viz.", "7234": "knowingly with intent;", "7235": "as Euri­ pides represents Medea killing her children.", "7236": "Men may also do an action, who are ignorant of, and afterwards discover their connexion [with, the in­ jured party,] as in the \" CEdipus\" of Sophocles.", "7237": "This, therefore, is extraneous to the drama4, but is in the tragedy itself;", "7238": "as in the \" Alcmæon \" of As­ tydamas, or Telegonus in the \" Ulysses Wounded 5.\"", "7239": "Further still, besides these there is a third mode, when some one is about to perpetrate, through ig­ norance, an atrocious deed, but makes the discovery before he does it6.", "7240": "And besides these there is no other mode.", "7241": "For it is necessary to act, or not;", "7242": "and that knowing, or not knowing.", "7243": "But of these, to in­ tend to perpetrate the deed knowingly, and not to perpetrate it, is the worst;", "7244": "for it is wicked and not tragical;", "7245": "because it is void of pathos.", "7246": "[Hence, no poet introduces a character of this kind except rarely;", "7247": "as in the \"Antigone,\" in which Hæmon [endeavours to kill his father] Creon, [but does not effect his purpose.]", "7248": "7 ] For the action here ranks in the second place.", "7249": "But it is better to perpetrate the deed ignorantly, and having perpetrated to discover;", "7250": "for then it is not attended with wickedness, and the discovery excites horror.", "7251": "The last mode, however, is the best;", "7252": "I mean, as in the \"Cresphontes, in which Merope is about to kill her son, but does not, in consequence of discovering that he was her son.", "7253": "Thus, too, in the \" Iphigenia in Tauris,\" in which the sister is going to kill the brother, [but recog­ nises him;", "7254": "] and in the \" Helle,\" the son is about to betray his mother, but is prevented by recognising her.", "7255": "Hence, as has been formerly observed, trage- dies are not conversant with many families;", "7256": "for poets were enabled to discover incident of this kind in fables, not from art, but from fortune 8.", "7257": "They were compelled, therefore, to direct their attention to those families in which calamities of this kind happened.", "7258": "And thus we have spoken sufficiently concerning the combination of the incidents, and have shown what kind of fables ought to be employed.", "7259": "WITH respect to manners, however, there are four things to which one ought to direct attention:", "7260": "one, indeed, and the first, that they be good.", "7261": "But the tragedy will indeed possess manners, if, as was said, the words or the action render any deliberate inten­ tion apparent;", "7262": "containing good manners 1, if the deliberate intention is good.", "7263": "But manners are to be found in each genus;", "7264": "for both a woman and a slave may be good;", "7265": "though perhaps of these, the one is less good2, and the other is wholly bad3.", "7266": "In the second place, the manners must be adapted to the per­ sons.", "7267": "For there are manners which are character­ ized by fortitude, but it is not suited to a woman to be either brave or terrible.", "7268": "In the third place, the manners must be similar.", "7269": "For this, as was before observed, differs from making the manners to be good and adapted4.", "7270": "In the fourth place, they must be uni­ form ;", "7271": "for if he is anomalous, who exhibits the imita­ tion, and expresses such like manners, at the same time it is necessary that he should be uniformly un- equal.", "7272": "The example, however, of depraved manners is indeed not necessary;", "7273": "such, for instance, as that of Menelaus in the \" Orestes,\" but an example of un­ becoming and unappropriate manners is, the lamenta­ tion of Ulysses in the tragedy of \" Scylla, 5\" and the speech of Menalippe;", "7274": "and the example of anomalous manners in the Iphigenia in AnUs.", "7275": "For Iphigenia supplicating does not at all resemble the Iphigenia in the latter part of the tragedy.", "7276": "It is requisite, how­ ever, in the manners as well as in the combination of the incidents, always to investigate, either the ne­ cessary or the probable;", "7277": "so that such a person should say or do such things, either necessarily or probably ;", "7278": "and that it be necessary or probable, that this thins should be done after that.", "7279": "It is evident, therefore, that the solutions of fables ought to happen from the fable itself, and not as in the \"Medea, 6\" from the machinery, and in the tragedy called the \"Iliad,\" from the particulars respecting the sailing away [from Troy 7].", "7280": "But we must employ machinery in things which are external to the drama, which either hap­ pened before, and which it is not possible for men to know, or which happened afterwards, and require to be previously foretold and announced.", "7281": "For we ascribe to the gods the power of seeing all things, but we do not admit the introduction of any thing absurd in the incidents 8, but if it is introduced it must be external to the tragedy;", "7282": "as in the \" Œdipus\" of Sophocles.", "7283": "Since, however, tragedy is an imitation of better things, it is necessary that we should im­ itate good painters.", "7284": "For these, in giving an ap­ propriate form to the image, depict the similitude, but increase the beauty 9.", "7285": "Thus, also, it is requisite that the poet, in imitating the wrathful and the indo­ lent, and those who are similarly affected in their manners, should form an example of equity, or as­ perity:", "7286": "such as Agatho and Homer have repre­ sented Achilles.", "7287": "These things, indeed, it is neces- sary to observe;", "7288": "and besides these, such perceptions of the senses as are attendant upon poetry, besides the necessary ones.", "7289": "10", "7290": "For in these, errors are fre-. quently committed.", "7291": "But concerning these things, enough has been said in the treatises already pub­ lished.[1 WHAT discovery, however, is, has been before stated.", "7292": "But with respect to the species of recognition, the first indeed is the most inartificial, and that which most poets use through being at a loss, and is effected through signs.", "7293": "But of these, some are natural, such as the lance with which the earth-born2 race are marked,\" or the stars [on the bodies of the sons] in the \" Thyestes\" of Carcinus.", "7294": "Others are adventi­ tious, and of these some are in the body, as scars;", "7295": "but others are external, such as necklaces;", "7296": "and such as [the discovery] through a small boat, in the \" Tyro3.\"", "7297": "These signs also may be used in a better or worse manner.", "7298": "Thus Ulysses,4 through his scar, is in one way known by his nurse, and in another by the swineherds.", "7299": "For the discoveries which are for the sake of credibility, are more in artificial, and all of them are of this kind;", "7300": "but those which are from revolution, as in the \" Washing of Ulysses5,\" are better.", "7301": "And those recognitions rank in the second place, which are invented by the poet, on which ac­ count they are inartificial.", "7302": "Thus Orestes in the \" Iphigenia\" discovers that he is Orestes6.", "7303": "For she indeed recognises her brother through a letter, but Orestes himself speaks what the poet designs, but not what the fable requires ;",

Sophocles, the \" voice of the shuttle\" [produced a recognition7].", "7308": "But the third mode of discovery is through memory, from the sensible perception of something by sight, as in the \"

the plots, and elaborate his diction, in such a manner that he may as much as possible place the thing before his own eyes1.", "7331": "For thus, the poet perceiving most acutely, as if present with the transactions themselves, will discover what is becoming, and whatever is re­ pugnant will be least concealed from his view.", "7332": "An evidence of this is the fault with which Carcinus is reproached.", "7333": "For Amphiaraus had left the temple, which was concealed from the spectator, who did not perceive it, and the piece was driven5 from the stage in consequence of the indignation of the spectators.", "7334": "For the poet as much as possible should co-operate with the gestures [of the actor] ;", "7335": "since those ,are naturally most adapted to persuade who are them­ selves under the influence or passion.", "7336": "Hence, also, he agitates others who is himself agitated 3, and he excites others to anger who is himself most truly enraged.", "7337": "Hence, poetry is the province either of one who is naturally clever, or of one who is insane4.", "7338": "For of these characters, the one is easily fashioned, but the other is prone to ecstasy.", "7339": "It is likewise necessary that the poet should in a general way lay down the fables composed by others, and those which he composes himself, and afterwards introduce epi­ sodes and lengthen out [the play].", "7340": "But I say that he should give a general sketch after this manner.", "7341": "Thus, for instance, in the \" Iphigenia5,\" a certain virgin on the point of being sacrificed, and vanishing from the view of those who were to sacrifice her, and being brought to another country in which it was a law to sacrifice strangers to a certain goddess, she is appointed the priestess of these rites.", "7342": "Some time after, it happened that the brother of the priestess came to this place ;", "7343": "[but on what account ?", "7344": "Because some god had ordered him, for a certain reason which does not pertain to the general view of the tragedy,] to come thither, [but why he did so is foreign to the fable6].", "7345": "The brother, therefore, coming, and being made captive, discovered [his sister], when he is going to be sacrificed ;", "7346": "whether, as Euripides says, [by an epistle,] or, as Poly ides feigns, speaking according to probability, because he said, it was not only requi­ site that the sister, but that he also should be sacri- ficed:", "7347": "—and hence safety arises.", "7348": "After these things, the poet having given names to the persons, should insert the episodes;",

Resultat seiner Bemühungen ist die Aristotelische Poetik in ihrer gegenwärtigen elend verstümmelten und vielfach interpolirten Gestalt.", "38": "Er ging nämlich dabei so zu Werke.", "39": "Zunächst nahm er die Einleitung (Kap.

Ritter sich als Ver­ fasser dieses Auszugs gedacht hat, geradezu als ein wah­ rer Tragelaph, ein Fabelthier von Albernheit und Leicht­ sinn.", "48": "In der That hat Hi. Ritter seiner Hypothese zu Liebe auf den Scheitel dieses seines unglücklichen Epi­ tomators und Interpolators alle Schimpfworte gehäuft, von denen das Latein der modernen Philologen ein so reiches Arsenal bildet.", "49": "Ich habe darüber in den An­ merkungen wiederholt gesprochen, und brauche daher hier nicht noch einmal darauf zurückzukommen.", "50": "Aller­ dings erforderte die Hypothese des Kritikers nothwendig die Annahme eines so unerhört einfältigen und geistlosen Tropfes als Epitomator und Interpolator;", "51": "aber desto schlimmer für die Hypothese!", "52": "Dieselbe hat dazu noch das Bedenkliche, daß sie ihren Vertheidiger zwingt, die Zeitgenossen jenes Vpitomators und Interpolators min­ destens als eben so einfältige, geschmack- und geistlose Menschen anzunehmen, da sie ja

nicht allgemeine Barbarei in der Litteratur herrschend, und jedenfalls noch Sinn und Geschmack für sprachliche Darstellung genügend vor­ handen war, um die hier und da auf das Aeußerste ! zerrissene Schreibart, wie sie zum Theil auf Rechnung des Epitomators und Interpolators gesetzt wird, unge­ ! meßbar zu finden?", "55": "Auch hat schon der Umstand in der Ritter'schen Hypothese etwas wider sich, daß ein Mann der Litteratur, ein Schriftsteller, der sich mit Ari­ stoteles'", "56": "Poetik zu beschäftigen den Trieb empfand, ein so ausbündig einfältiger Tropf gewesen sein soll, daß er selbst nicht einmal sein Geschäft des Ausziehens ver­ stand, und gleich zu Anfange Dinge abzuhandeln ver­ sprach, von denen nachher in seinem Auszugc nichts oder doch so gut wie nichts vorkommt.Mit der Ritter'schen Hypothese eines Auszugs ist es also nichts.", "57": "Aber dennoch gibt es wohl keinen Le­ ser der Aristotelischen Poetik, dem es nicht auf den ersten Blick klar sein sollte, daß wir hier keinenfalls ein vollständiges und von dem Autor selbst herausgege­ benes Schriftwerk, sondern nur mehr oder weniger aus­ führliche Bruchstücke eines solchen vor uns haben.", "58": "Um meine eigene Ansicht von der Entstehungsweise derselben mitzutheilen, muß ich etwas weiter ausholen.", "59": "Wenn die in meinen früheren Untersuchungen über die Schicksale der Aristotelischen Schriften ausführ­ lich behandelte Ueberlieferung, welche Strabo und Plutarch uns aufbehalten haben, irgend einen vernünftigen Sinn hat, so kann dies kaum ein anderer sein, als daß die eigentlichen streng wissenschaftlichen sogenannten esoteri­ schen Schriften, oder sagen wir, die Vorträge welche das System des Philosophen umfaßten, und die er viele Jahre lang vor einem auserwählten Kreise von Schülern im Lykeion zu Athen gehalten hat, nicht von Aristoteles selbst herausgegeben worden sind ^).", "60": "Diese Vorträgt, d. h. die denselben als Grundlage dienenden schriftlichen Aufzeichnungen des Philosophen mögen einzelnen ver­ trauteren Schülern vielleicht von ihrem Lehrer zur Pri­ vatbenutzung mitgetheilt worden sein;", "61": "im Ganzen aber verblieben sie in den Händen des Meisters, zu erneuer­ ter Bearbeitung, Verbesserung und Bereicherung aufbe­ wahrt (in eomiventsiils relivti), und es ist mir, Alles in Allem genommen, mehr als wahrscheinlich, daß die Schriften des Stagiriten, wie wir sie jetzt besitzen, in ähnlicher Weise von den Schülern desselben publizirt sein mögen, wie dies in unsern Tagen mit den meisten Wer­ ken, d. h. den Vorlesungen Hegels, des deutschen Ari­ stoteles, der Fall gewesen ist.", "62": "Wie Hegel ward auch Aristoteles vom Tode übereilt, und seinen Schülern, von denen Theophrast seine Bibliothek und seinen litterari­ schen Nachlaß erbte, blieb die Pflicht, diesen Nachlaß der Welt zugänglich zu machen.", "63": "Wann und in welcher Weise dies geschehen, ist uns natürlich unbekannt.", "64": "Daß aber die Aristotelischen Schriften in ihrer jetzigen Gestalt zahlreiche unverkennbare Spuren ihres Ursprungs aus Vorlesungen und ǭHeften« im modernen Sinne an sich tragen, wird kein Kundiger in Abrede stellen ^).Hiernächst ergeben sich zur Erklärung des gegenwär­ tigen Zustandes unserer Aristotelischen Poetik zwei Mög­ lichkeiten.", "65": "Entweder nämlich befand sich dasjenige, was Ari­ stoteles selbst davon niedergeschrieben hatte, unter den Schriften, die aus Theophrast's Besitz unherausgegeben durch Erbschaft nach dem kleinasiatischen Skepsis an Neleus und dessen Familie geriethen und die erst spät zur Zeit Sulla's durch Apellikon in jenem von Strabo und andern Alten beschriebenen traurigen Zustande an's Licht gezogen wurden.", "66": "In diesem Falle würde sich der defekte Zustand unseres jetzigen Textes von selbst erklä­ ren.", "67": "Oder aber:", "68": "unsere jetzige Poetik ist nichts mehr und nichts weniger als ein nach Aristotelischen Vorträ­ gen von einem Zuhörer des Philosophen aufgezeichnetes Heft, dessen Verfasser sich das ihn Interefsirende aus­ führlicher, Anderes kürzer anmerkte, Manches wegließ, hier und da auch ein Paar eigene Bemerkungen an den Rand schrieb, und überhaupt dem Vortrage nach sub­ jektiver Neigung und Belieben folgte.", "69": "An eine Ver­ öffentlichung seiner Aufzeichnungen dachte er schwerlich;", "70": "doch gingen dieselben darum keineswegs verloren, in einer Zeit, wo ein Schriftstück solcher Art ein großer Schatz - war.", "71": "Und als später die Zeit der großen öffentlichen , Büchersammlungen kam, wo die Nachfrage nach Aristo­ telischen Schriften ō deren damals wenige im Umlauf und Bücherhandel waren ō stark wurde, war jenes Bruch­ stück der Aristotelischen Poetik sicher nicht das einzige Schriftstück, das mit dem Namen des berühmten Den­ kers von Stagira an der Stirn in die Bibliotheken von Alexandria und Pergamus wanderte, und dort um so lieber auf- und angenommen ward, da ein anderes Ari­ stotelisches Werk über die Theorie der Dichtkunst nicht vorhanden war.", "72": "Diese Hypothese hat jedenfalls ebensoviel, wenn nicht mehr, Berechtigung, als alle bisher über die Aristote­ tische Poetik aufgestellten Vermuthungen.", "73": "Sie erklärt Form und sprachliche Darstellung, Ungleichheit in der > Behandlung des Stoffs, einzelne Lücken und Zusätze und alle sonstigen zum Theil sich widersprechenden Eigenschaf­ ten des kleinen Traktats.", "74": "Wem aber die Annahme solcher antiker nachgeschriebener Hefte zu modern erschei­ nen sollte, der möge nachlesen, was wir an einem an­ dern Orte 16) über diesen Gegenstand gesagt haben, und dazu noch Stellen wie Dingen.", "75": "I^sert. II. 48, VI.", "76": "3 und die bekannte Nachricht über Kleanthes den Stoiker hinzufügen, der zu arm war, um sich das zur Aufzeich­ nung der Lehrvorträge seines Lehrers Zeno nothwendige Schreibmaterial (/«Hr/«) zu kaufen.", "77": "Wie es sich indessen auch mit dieser Hypothese ver­ halten möge, folgende Punkte bleiben eben so fest stehen als sie sich mit derselben im Einklänge befinden.", "78": "Er­ stens:", "79": "die Stellen anderer Aristotelischer Schriften, in welchen auf die Untersuchungen über die Poetik Bezug genommen wird, beweisen nichts dafür, daß Aristoteles selbst ein Werk über die Theorie der Dichtkunst veröf­ fentlicht hat.", "80": "Wohl aber scheint der in unserer Poetik ^ vorkommende Ausdruck, daß über eine gewisse Materie ǭin den herausgegebenen\" Untersuchungen genügend ge­ handelt sei, unwidersprechlich zu beweisen, daß die Poe­ tik eben nicht zu den »herausgegebenen« Schriften ge­ hörte, sondern daß wir hier einen esoterischen Vortrag vor uns haben.", "81": "Zweitens:", "82": "kein alter Schriftsteller weiß etwas von einem ausführlicheren Werke des Ari­ stoteles über die Poetik in zwei Büchern, sondern die Existenz eines solchen beruht auf der alleinigen sehr schwachen Autorität des Katalogs Aristotelischer Schrif­ ten bei Diogenes von Laerte, dessen Angabe sich oben­ ein sehr wohl auf die gegenwärtig vorhandene Poetik beziehen kann, die man vielleicht nach ihren Hauptthei­ len, Epos und Tragödie, in zwei Bücher theilte.Schon mit dem Prinzip, welches Aristoteles an die Spitze seiner Poetik stellt, und auf welches seine ganze > Kunstlehre gebaut ist, beginnt die Polemik des Stagiri- ! ten gegen Platon, welche sich, wie wir sehen werden, durch seine ganze Poetik hindurchzieht.Dies Prinzip ist die Lehre von der Mimesis.", "83": "Da wir das griechische Wort seinem philosophischen Begriffe bei Aristoteles entsprechend durch unser deutsches Wort Nachahmung nur unvollkommen wiederzugeben vermö­ gen ,7^^ wie es denn eine bekannte Thatsache ist, daß unser Verständniß griechischer Philosophie durch die Schwierigkeit, viele Ausdrücke und Begriffe, die auf antiken Anschauungen und Vorstellungen beruhen, durch vollkommen entsprechende moderne Ausdrücke wiederzuge­ ben , wesentlich erschwert wird i) ō so sei es einstwei­ len gestaltet, den griechischen Ausdruck Mimesis so lange beizubehalten, bis es uns gelungen sein wird, das We­ sen der »Nachahmung«, welche Aristoteles als Prinzip aller Kunst aufstellt, erläuternd aufzuhellen.\"", "84": "Mimesis und mimeisthai (Nachahmung und nachah­ men) waren schon vor Aristoteles und Platon geläufige Ausdrücke zur Bezeichnung des Wesens der bildenden Künste, so wie der Musik und Poesie.", "85": "Doch erst Pla­ ton unterwarf dieses Prinzip aller Kunst einer ausführ­ lichen philosophischen Behandlung.", "86": "Durch seine ganze Betrachtungsweise der Kunst geht eine heftige Polemik gegen die Kunst und gegen die Stellung, welche zumal die Dichtkunst im hellenischen Volke und Leben einnahm.", "87": "Daß Poesie und Kunst sich ebenbürtig der Philosophie zur Seite zu stellen, daß sie mit ihren Leistungen eine hohe Bedeutung für die Bildung der Menschheit zu be­

welches er wie die gesammte hellenische Philosophie die Mimesis erkannte, die Waffen schmieden helfen.", "89": "Weil alle Künste auf diesem Prinzipe beruhen, alle »nachahmende« sind, so fehlt ihnen, nach Platon, alle Realität.", "90": "Sie vermögen nur den Schein der Wirklichkeit und Wesenheit der Dinge zu geben;", "91": "sie gehen nur auf Sinnenreiz und Täuschung des Hörers und Beobachters.", "92": "Die Künstler selbst haben keine Ein­ sicht in das wahre Wesen der Dinge, deren Scheinbilder sie hervorbringen;", "93": "ihr Thun und ihre Werke sind ein bloßes müßiges Spiel (ir«»äta), berechnet auf das, was dem Volke und den Unkundigen (den Nichtphilosophen) als schön erscheint, kein auf das Wesen gehender Ernst (»zroväH);", "94": "und selbst diejenige Kunstform, welche den höchsten Rang einnimmt, die Tragödie, macht davon um so weniger eine Ausnahme, als sie gerade die am mei­ sten und vollständigsten mimetische (nachahmende) von allen ist.", "95": "ō So gelangt Platon zu dem Resultat:", "96": "die nachbil­ dende Kunst ist an sich schlecht, sie wirkt auf und durch das Schlechte in uns, und was sie hervorbringt ist, im Lichte der Philosophie betrachtet, Schlechtes 2).Die logische Entwicklung, mittelst deren Plato seine Geringschätzung der Kunst und ihres Prinzips, der Mimesis, begründet, richtet sich gegen das Wesen der letzteren mit folgendem Schlüsse, dessen Unrichtigkeit Friedrich Bischer in seiner Aesthetik eben so kurz als schlagend nachgewie­ sen hat 3).", "97": "ǭDie Phantasie,\" so argumentirt er, »gibt ein Abbild des Gegenstandes;", "98": "dieser selbst ist ein Ab­ bild der Idee des Gegenstandes, wie sie im göttlichen Verstande wohnt.\"", "99": "Nun nimmt er die objective Dar­ stellung des Phantasiebildes durch die Kunst (das Kunst­ werk) hinzu, und sagt:", "100": "diese sei wieder ein Abbild des Phantasiebildes.", "101": "Folglich, schließt er, sei das Kunstwerk das Bild von dem Bilde eines Bildes.", "102": "Lassen wir das letzte Glied, das Kunstwerk, weg, so ist also das Phantasiebild Bild des Bildes;", "103": "es ist zwar nicht, wie Platon sagt, aus der dritten, aber doch immer nur aus der zweiten Hand.", "104": "Allein gerade diese zweite Hand hebt ja die Mängel des Bildes erster Hand, die Män­ gel des Naturschönen auf, und kehrt zum göttlichen Ur­ bilde zurück.", "105": "Das Naturschöne ist die Mitte zwischen diesem, dem göttlichen Urbitde, und seiner Herstellung durch den Menschengeist.", "106": "Grade weil das zweite Bild Scheinbild ist, tilgt es die Mängel des ersten Bildes (des naturschönen Gegenstandes), und nie steht Platon mit seiner Jdeenlehre in gröberem Widerspruch, als wenn er so den Schein verkennt.", "107": "\"", "108": "Durch diese seine falsche Auffassung des Begriffs der künstlerischen Mimesis wird es nun zugleich erklärt, wie Platon dazu kommen mußte, die ganze Kunst nur in so weit gelten zu lassen, als sie sich in den Dienst des sittlichen Ideals zu begeben, und nur dieses nach­ ahmend auszudrücken und nachzubilden habe, wenn sie in seinem Jdealstaate geduldet sein wollte.", "109": "Sobald sie dies versäume, sei sie für gefährlich und schädlich zu halten.", "110": "So die Tragödie, weil sie die Lust zu Klage und Jammer im Menschen nähre, die Komödie, weil sie das Gegentheil davon, den leichtsinnig spottenden Ueber­ muth in uns befördere.", "111": "Die erstere statuirt er also höch­ stens, wenn sie, wie das specifisch-christliche Trauerspiel zwei Jahrtausende später unternahm, vollkommne sitt­ liche Reinheit und übermenschliche Erhabenheit des Hel­ den im Leiden aufzeige;", "112": "die letztere, wenn sie sich dar­ auf beschränke, in moralischer Tendenz das Unwürdige, Verkehrte und Lächerliche warnend und belehrend darzu­ stellen.", "113": "Also Platon, der doktrinäre Idealist, der in allem Bestehenden nirgends das entsprechende Abbild der Idee zu finden vermochte, die er von Staat und Staatsleben, von Poesie und Kunst in sich trug.", "114": "Dieser radikalste Idealist, den die Geschichte der Menschheit kennt, der im vollen Glauben von der Ueberzeugung ausging, daß es möglich sein müsse, vom Standpunkte des Idealis­ mus aus die wirkliche Welt umzugestalten, scheute in ! seiner Kühnheit keine Konsequenz seiner Weltanschauung:", "115": "nicht die Nothwendigkeit einer staatspolizeilichen Censur des Aesthetischen, nicht den Widerspruch seiner ganzen Zeit und seines Volks gegen den moralischen Rigoris­ mus einer Anschauungsweise, durch welche nicht nur über eine ganze Welt unbefangener und harmloser Kunst- gestaltung des Bildners und Malers, sondern auch über einen Phidias und Homer, über einen Aeschylos und Sophokles der Stab gebrochen wurde ^).", "116": "Aber niemals ist auch der abstrakte Idealismus in seiner um die Wirklichkeit des Lebens unbekümmerten Naivetät je wie- der so unsterblicher Lächerlichkeit überwiesen worden, als der große hellenische Philosoph und sein radikaler Idealis­ mus von der lebendigen Wirklichkeit und von der Kunstge­ schichte seines Volks.", "117": "Es ist ein wunderbares Verhält­ niß, in welchem hier Theorie und Praxis der Aesthetik geschichtlich vor uns auftreten.", "118": "Während Phidias und Polyklet so eben erst ihrem Volke die unerreichten Ideale der plastischen Erhabenheit in ihren Götterbildern gege­ ben, Skopas und Praxiteles ihnen das Urbild der Schönheit in der schaumgebornen Göttin der Liebe und die höchste Tra­ gik des Menschenschicksals in der Gruppe der Niobe und ihrer Kinder vor die staunenden Augen gestellt, Aeschylos und Sophokles den Hellenen die Musterbilder tragischer Kunst geschaffen hatten ō sehen wir die Theorie bei Platon in den Kinderschuhen einer Aesthetik einhergehen, die von dem wahren Verständnisse und der richtigen Würdigung dieser Schöpfungen, um welche alle späteren Jahrhunderte das Hellenenvolk beneidet haben, fast noch weiter entfernt war, als wir von der Erreichung dersel­ ben entfernt sind!Gegen diese Platonische Kunstanschauung, welche über die gesammte Kunst seines Volks das Verdammungsur­ theil aussprach, und die Hellenen von den Schöpfungen ihrer großen Dichter und Künstler hinweg und über die­ selben hinaus auf das »Kunstwerk der Zukunft\" ver­ wies, wie er es in sich zu tragen wähnte, erhob sich nun sein großer Schüler Aristoteles, der wie überall in seinem Philosophiren so auch in seiner Anschauung der Kunst stets das Ganze der lebendigen Wirklichkeit und des wahren Daseins zur Grundlage machte.", "119": "Indem er den Grundirrthum Platons in dessen Ansicht von der Natur und dem Wesen des Begriffs der Mimesis nach­ wies, ō eines Begriffs, den auch Er an die Spitze seiner Theorie stellte, ō warf er alle von der Platonischen Aesthe­ tik gegen die Kunst erhobenen Anklagen über den Hau­ fen, und stellte zuerst die Würde und den Werth der Kunst für alle Zeiten fest auf der Grundlage des philo­ sophischen Gedankens.", "120": "Hatte Platon es der Kunst vor­ geworfen, daß sie nur Mimesis der Wirklichkeit, nur geistige »Nachahmung« der wirklichen Dinge sei:", "121": "so führte Aristoteles dagegen aus, daß und warum die Kunst grade deßhalb höher stehe als die Wirklichkeit.", "122": "Hatte Jener die Tragödie eine Verderben« des sittlichen Charakters genannt, weil sie die Menschen durch die Erre­ gung der Luft an Jammer und Leid verweichliche, so stellte Aristoteles dagegen der Tragödie vielmehr die große sittliche Aufgabe, diese Empfindungen in der mensch­ lichen Brust zu läutern und auf ihr richtiges Maaß zurück­ zuführen, den Menschen durch Einsicht in die wahren be­ stimmenden Mächte seines Schicksals zu beruhigen und zu erheben.", "123": "Hatte endlich Platon den schönen Schein gegen die Realität, das Kunstwerk gegen die Wirklichkeit zurückgesetzt, so sprach dagegen Aristoteles die erhabene Wahrheit aus:", "124": "daß die Dichtung gehaltvoller und philosophisch tiefer sei als die Geschichte, daß das ächte Kunstwerk höher stehe als die Wirklichkeit, deren gereinigtes Bild es widerzuspiegeln bestimmt sei.Wie vieles uns auch von den Aristotelischen Schrif­ ten über Dichter und Dichtkunst verloren gegangen sein mag ō und es ist mehr als wahrscheinlich, daß wir hier schwere Verluste zu beklagen haben ō die Polemik gegen Platon's feindselige Angriffe auf die Kunst und na­ mentlich auf die Poesie, diese Polemik, welche uns alte ! Schriftsteller bezeugen, ist von dem großen Meister des ! Gedankens vollständig und mit einer persönlichen Mäßigung geführt worden, wie sie nur bei dem vollen Bewußtsein sieghafter Ueberlegenheit und bei der Charaktergröße des Mannes möglich war, in welchem ein Alexander noch auf dem schwindelnden Gipfel feines Ruhmes seinen Lehrer und Bildner bewundernd verehrte.", "125": "In dieser ganzen Polemik ist sogar Platon's Name nie genannt, sie ist durchaus in reiner Sachlichkeit gehalten, so sehr auch die paradoxale Ueberschwenglichkeit in Platons An­ griffen gegen Poesie und Kunst den Unwillen und Spott herausforderte.", "126": "Wir werden übrigens in den folgenden Kapiteln dieser Einleitung sehen, daß der Kampf dieser beiden so entgegengesetzten Anschauungsweisen, der Kampf der peripatetischen Aesthetik gegen die Platonische An­ sicht über Kunst und Poesie, Jahrhunderte hindurch bis in die spätesten römischen Zeiten fortgedauert hat.Schon aus dem bisher Gesagten dürfte klar gewor­ den sein, in welchem Sinne von Aristoteles das Prin­ zip der Mimefis, im Gegensatze zu Platon, als Prin­ zip der Kunst gefaßt worden ist.Aristoteles geht dabei auf den dem Menschen vor allen gebenden Geschöpfen vorzugsweise eigenen Trieb zur Mimesis zurück, die er hier ganz wörtlich als Nach­ ahmung versteht, wenn er es im vierten Kapitel der Poetik ausspricht:", "127": "Dieser dem Menschen von der Na­ tur eingepflanzte Trieb nachzuahmen, verbunden mit der ihm eben so ursprünglich eigenen Freude an dem Pro­ dukte der Nachahmung, sei der natürliche Ursprung aller Poesie, und somit aller Kunst überhaupt.", "128": "Ich habe in den Bemerkungen zu jener Stelle darauf hinge­ wiesen, daß in dieser Ansicht von dem Triebe der Nach­ ahmung im Menschen, und von dem ersten ursprüng­ lichsten aber auch rohesten Kunstgenusse, welcher in der Vergleichung des Abbildes mit dem Urbilde, des »Nach­ geahmten\" mit dem Gegenstande besteht, Aristoteles und Goethe übereinstimmen.", "129": "Allein dies ist nur gleichsam die natürliche Grundlage, auf welcher der philosophische Begriff der Mimesis, der künstlerischen Nachahmung be­ ruht, die nach Aristoteles das Gemeinsame aller schönen Künste ist, welche er sämmtlich als Mimeseis, als Nach­ ahmungen auffaßt!", "130": "2) Der Ausdruck »Nachahmung\", der einzige, welcher dem griechischen Mimesis noch am näch­ sten kommt, erzeugt aber sogleich bei uns die falsche Vorstellung der Gebundenheit an das Objekt der Nach­ ahmung, der Unfreiheit, der Abwesenheit des Selbst- schöpferischen in dem nachahmenden Künstler.", "131": "Aber wir ha­ ben leider kein Wort, das in so naiver Einfachheit, und so allgemein anerkannt und verständlich wie das griechische, die künstlerische Thätigkeit und das gemeinsame Wesen aller künstlerischen Hervorbringungen bezeichnete.", "132": "Die Griechen hatten ohnehin, wenn sie die höchste aller Künste, die Poesie, als Mimesis, als Nachahmung faß­ ten, stets das lebendige Theater im Auge, durch welches ihnen, wie schon der Engländer Twinning 6) richtig bemerkt hat, dieser Begriff der Kunst als Nachahmung sinnlich vor Augen gestellt und vermittelt wurde.", "133": "Wir müssen uns also, wie in der Übersetzung geschehen, mit mehreren Ausdrücken und abwechselnden Umschrei­ bangen, wie nachahmend darstellen, nachbilden, bilden, nachahmend schaffen u. s. w. zu helfen suchen.", "134": "Denn um es kurz zu sagen, die Thätigkeit des Künstlers ist allerdings ein nachahmendes Bilden in sofern, als sie überall ein Objectives, sei es nun ein sinnliches oder geistiges, voraussetzt, dessen Bild sie her­ vorbringen will.", "135": "Bleiben wir zunächst bei der Poesie , stehen, so sind es Menschen und menschliche Empfindun­ gen, welche dieses Objektive ausmachen.", "136": "Aber auch die eigentlich bildenden Künste, Plastik und Malerei, haben es mit einem sei es in der Natur oder in der Vorstel­ lung Gegebenen zu thun, wie die Musik es mit objecti­ ven Empfindungen zu thun hat, denen sie sinnlichen Ausdruck zu geben (d. h. antik gesprochen, die sie »nach­ zuahmen«) strebt.", "137": "Wir haben gesehen, durch welchen logischen Irrthum Platon dahinkam, das so von dem Künstler, dem »Nachahmer« hervorgebrachte Bild als das Bild des Bildes von einem Bilde anzu­ sehen, und das Werk des Künstlers damit zugleich tief unter das reale Vorbild, ja das Kunstwerk unter das Produkt des gemeinen Handwerkers zu setzen.", "138": "Diese Verirrung Platons aufgedeckt und gezeigt zu haben, daß das Kunstwerk vielmehr über der Realität stehe, daß durch die künstlerische Thätigkeit die Realität gereinigt und geistig verklärt werde, ist Aristoteles' unsterbliches Verdienst.", "139": "Denn dieses nachahmende Bilden des Künst­ lers ist zugleich ein freies Schaffen, sein Nachschaffen ein veredelndes Umschaffen, und der Dichter ist zum Beispiel selbst da frei schöpferisch und muß es sein, wo seine Dichtung ein objectiv gegebenes, ein historisch Bestimmtes behandelt.", "140": "Er muß es sein, weil die Mi­ mesis, die Thätigkeit deren Produkt und Ausdruck das Kunstwerk ist, eben eine geistige ist, die es zu thun hat mit der Darstellung des Ewigen, Wesentlichen und Noth­ wendigen , gegenüber der mit den Schlaken der Zufällig­ , keit und Unwesentlichkeit behafteten Realität des Natur- Objekts.", "141": "Diese höhere Wahrheit des künstlerischen . Scheins, diese ideale Wahrheit des Kunstzwecks hatte der geistreiche Sophist Gorgias im Auge, als er nach der Manier seiner Zeit sein Urtheil über die Tragödie in den Ausspruch pointirte:", "142": "»sie sei freilich eine Täuschung (äzräry), ein Schein, aber ein solcher, der denjenigen, welchem er gelinge, über den stelle, dem er nicht gelinge, und bei dem der Getäuschte weiser und ge­ bildeter erscheine als der nicht Getäuschte« ?)", "143": ".Die höchste Stufe dieser Thätigkeit des Geistes, welche Aristoteles als das künstlerische Nachahmen bezeichnet, ist die des tragischen Dichters und das höchste Kunstwerk ebendeßhalb die Tragödie.", "144": "Denn der tragische Dichter schildert das Leben selbst in seiner höchsten Steigerung, seine Dichtung ist Mimesis, d. h. künstlerische Darstellung des handelnden Lebens und seiner Folgen, Darstellung einer ernsten bedeutungs­ vollen Handlung, welche ihr Ziel in sich selber hat (zr9«x»e ǭDas Leben aber ist,\" wie Aristoteles einmal sagt, »selbst Handlung.«", "145": "Auch der tragische Dichter hat also ein Objectives, das er »nachahmt«, das Leben.", "146": "Aber dies Nachahmen ist kein Kopiren im Sinne des deutschen Ausdrucks;", "147": "und die ganze Poetik des Aristoteles ist in ihrem wesentlichsten Bestandtheile, in der Lehre von der Tragödie, nichts anderes als der er­ klärende Nachweis der freien schöpferischen Thätigkeit des Dichters und der Erhabenheit seines Werks über der Realität des objectiv Gegebenen.", "148": "ō Dieser Nachweis, der sich in den berühmten Worten, welche das Verhält­ niß von Poesie und Geschichte zu einander aussprechen, zu epigrammatischer Schärfe zuspitzt, gibt sich eben so klar in dem Satze kund:", "149": "daß der epische Dichter nur in der Darstellung des Objectiven, niemals aber da »Nachahmer\" sei, wo er in eigener Person spreche, und seine Gedanken, seine Gefühle aus sich herausstelle.So gefaßt, erscheint der ganze Streit über eine von Aristoteles gepredigte Lehre von der direkten »Natur- nachahmung\" in der Kunst vollständig als ein müssi­ ger.", "150": "Denn nichts kann thörichter und lächerlicher sein, als wenn der Naturalismus und Realismus in der Kunst es sich beikommen lassen, sich auf die Autorität des großen alten Denkers zu berufen, der wie kein an­ derer die schöpferische Freiheit des Geistes und die ideale Erhabenheit des Kunstwerks über die Realität, der künst­ lerischen Wahrheit über die materiell äußerliche Wahr­ heit, die Erhabenheit endlich des von dem kunstbegabten Menschengeiste erschaffenen schönen Scheins über die objective Realität des Naturschönen für alle Zeiten fest­ gestellt hat.", "151": "ōDie Aristotelische Lehre von der Wirkung der Tra­ gödie, oder wie Er selbst sich ausdrückt, von der ab­ schließlich durch die Tragödie bewirkten Katharsis der Pathemata des Mitleids und der Furcht in den Hörern und Zuschauern, ist wesentlich eine Polemik, ein Protest gegen die Platonische Auffassung der Tragödie, wie denn die ganze Aristotelische Poetik als eine solche Po­ lemik des Philosophen gegen seinen großen Lehrmeister angesehen werden muß, und allen Andeutungen nach auch von den Zeitgenossen und von dem späteren Alterthume angesehen worden ist.Platon hatte in seinem abstrakt sittlichen Radika­ lismus, vor welchem selbst ein Aeschylos und Sophokles, geschweige denn ein Euripides, nicht bestehen konnten, als ein ächte» Fanatiker der Idee, die gesammte drama­ tische Poesie, die Komödie nicht minder wie die Tragö­ die, aus seinem Jdealstaate verbannt.", "152": "Er stand mit die­ ser seiner Feindschaft gegen Dramen und Theater genau auf dem Standpunkte des zelotischen Puritanismus und des gegen beide eifernden Christenthums der Götze und Consorten.", "153": "Wenn man die Hauptstelle seiner Polemik gegen das Drama und die Tragödie im zehnten Buche vom Staate') genau betrachtet, so läuft die Begrün­ dung seines verwerfenden Urtheils auf folgende Sätze hinaus.", "154": "»Die Tragödie, weit entfernt den Menschen sitt­ lich zu bilden und zu kräftigen, demoralisirt ihn viel­ mehr;", "155": "denn während es darauf ankommt, ihn gegen Lei­ den und Leidenschaften zu stählen und tapfer zu machen, verweichlicht sie ihn, indem sie die Empfindung des Mit­ leids (rö ^kk»»öv) mit dem allgemeinen Menschenloose in ihm nährt und großzieht, und nicht nur dieser, sondern allen andern Leidenschaften Thor und Thür öffnet.", "156": "Der Zuhörer und Zuschauer der Tragödie und der Komödie leidet Schaden an seiner Seele, und selbst der Beste kann sich ihres schädlichen Einflusses kaum erwehren.", "157": "Denn was wir im Leben nur mit Mühe in uns zügeln, die Neigung zu unmäßigem Schmerz- und Trauergefühl (Nkvv) auf der einen, und die Neigung zu leichtsinniger Verlachung menschlicher Dinge (rö auf der an­ dern Seite, das erhält dort durch die Tragödie, hier durch die Komödie, Nahrung und Förderung.", "158": "Wir überlassen uns dem schrankenlosen Mitgefühl mit dem Leidenden um so mehr, da wir uns sagen, daß es ja fremde Zustände und Leiden sind, an denen wir Theil nehmen, und da die Leidenden als gute und unserer Theilnahme würdige Menschen vom Dichter dargestellt werden.", "159": "Aber die fremden Zustände haben Einfluß auf den eignen Zustand des Menschen, und die Lust an Leid und Klage, die er bei jenen in sich aufgenährt hat, wird er bei den eignen Leiden gleichfalls nicht mehr zu zügeln vermögen.", "160": "\"", "161": "Zum Schlüsse dieses seines Verwerfungsurtheils, mit dem er gegen die gesammte öffentliche Meinung seines Volks und seiner Zeit in der schneidendsten Opposition zu stehen sich bewußt war, fordert nun Platon, dem doch einigermaßen bei seiner Gottähnlichkeit bange zu werden scheint, die Freunde dieser Poesie auf, dieselbe gegen seine Angriffe mit philosophischen Gründen zu ver­ theidigen, und »nicht nur den Genuß, den sie gewähre, sondern auch ihre Heilsamkeit für das staatliche Gemein­ wesen, ihren Nutzen und ihre versittlichende Ein­ wirkung auf das Leben der Menschen nachzu­ weisen« 2).Unter denen, welche den so hingeworfenen Fehde­ handschuh aufnahmen ō und es müssen derselben im Alterthume Viele und sehr leidenschaftliche gewesen sein, wie eine von Bernays angeführte Stelle aus Proklos' Vorlesungen über Platons Politeia andeutet^), steht nun Aristoteles in seiner Poetik oben an.", "162": "Und zwar bezeugt derselbe Proklos ausdrücklich, daß der Nachweis der versittlichenden Wirkung des Dramas und der Tragödie der Hauptpunkt in dem Kampfe gegen Platons ungerechte Verwerfung gewesen sei.", "163": "Dieser Ausgangspunkt wie ihn Proklos nennt) ent­ hält aber zugleich den Zielpunkt des ästhetischen Philo­ sophirens bei Aristoteles, den höchsten Gesichtspunkt, aus welchem er in der Politik die Musik, wie schließ­ lich in der Poetik die Tragödie betrachtet hat, — denn für die Komödie fehlt uns in der heutigen verstümmelt erhaltenen Poetik des Philosophen dieser Nachweis.", "164": "Je­ ner Ausgangs- und Zielpunkt aber ist die die sittliche und geistige Kultur des Menschen überhaupt, die Veredlung des ganzen Men­ schen 4).Aus diesem in sich nothwendigen und obenein vom Alterthum ausdrücklich bezeugten Zusammenhange der Aristotelischen und der Platonischen Lehre von der Wir­ kung der Tragödie geht nun zunächst umvidersprechlich hervor, daß und in welcher Weise die Aristotelische Auf­ fassung der Tragödie der Platonischen entgegentrat, näm­ lich als diametraler Gegensatz.", "165": "Platon hatte den Haupt­ hebel und das Hauptmittel der tragischen Dichtung, das Nr«? und das Mitleid und Mitleidswerthe, als Grund der verderblichen demoralisirenden Wirkung auf den Zuschauer und Zuhörer bezeichnet.", "166": "Es war also die Aufgabe des Aristoteles, den Nachweis zu führen, daß gerade dieses Element der Tragödie, zu dem er noch das ihm zunächst ver­ wandte des und des der Furcht und des Furchtbaren, gesellte, dasjenige sei, mittelst dessen die Tra­ gödie, wenn der Dichter es richtig anwende, ihre verfitt­ lichende und läuternde Wirkung auf den Menschen übe.", "167": "Dieser Nachweis aber ist die Aristotelische Lehre von der Katharsis der Pathemata, von der Reinigung der Leid­ empfindungen und der Leideindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht in den Gemüthern der Zuschauer und Zu­ hörer der Tragödie, d. h. der wahren und ächten, ihrem Begriffe entsprechenden Tragödie, wie ihn Aristoteles eben in der Poetik festgestellt und ausgeführt hat.Man hat neuerdings unternommen, an dieser Auf­ fassungsweise des historisch begründeten Sachverhältnisses zu rütteln und dem Aristoteles eine Erklärung seiner Katharsis unterzuschieben, nach welcher er als Wirkung der Tragödie nichts weniger als eine sittliche Läuterung, cme' erziehende und bildende Kraft (na»Sk/«), sondern lediglich und allein nur eine durch Erregung von Mit­ leid und Furcht bewirkte erleichternde Auslassung und gleichsam therapeutische Entladung solcher (mitleidigen und furchtsamen) Gemüthsaffektionen aufgestellt haben sollte 5).", "168": "Wir können indessen von einem direkten Ein- gehen auf diese mit großem Scharfsinne »erfochtene Pa­ radox« um so mehr absehen, da eine Widerlegung der­ selben in einer eigenen Schrift von uns gegeben wor­ den ist 6).Aristoteles selbst hat seine Lehre von der Katharsis der tragischen Pathemata?), d. h. der leidvollen Ein­ drücke des Mitleids und der Furcht, welche wir durch die Tragödie empfangen, an seine Lehre von der kathar- tischen Wirkung der Musik angeknüpft, deren er im achten Buche seiner Politik erwähnt, und zwar mit dem Zusätze erwähnt , »daß er über das, was er unter Ka­ tharsis verstehe, deutlicher und ausführlicher in der Poetik zu handeln gedenke.\"", "169": "Aus diesem Zusätze geht nun zwar unwidersprechlich hervor, daß Aristoteles selbst die in der Politik gegebenen Andeutungen nicht für aus­ reichend erachtete, um den Begriff dessen, was er mit Katharsis bezeichnete, in seinem vollen Umfange zu ver­ stehen.", "170": "Aber dennoch ist es wichtig, seine Lehre von der Wirkung der Musik, wie er sie in der Politik ent­ wickelt, im Zusammenhange zu betrachten, weil aus die­ ser Betrachtung eben so klar hervorgeht, daß auch die kathartische Wirkung, welche Aristoteles der Musik (d. h. einer gewissen Art von Musik, nicht aller Mu-> sik überhaupt) beilegt, als eine sittlich bildende und ver-'> edelnde, also eine läuternde und reinigende gedacht ist.", "171": "! Hier Häs nun L. Spengel in seiner zuvor angeführten Abhandlung 8) zunächst unwiderleglich nachgewiesen, daß die Katharsis (xSSn^x) 'als. kein für sich bestehender besonderer Zweck der Musik, sondern als eng verbunden mis dem Zwecke der Bildung (der ?r«tckk/a) von Aristo­ teles gefaßt ist, daß beide Begriffe sich gegenseitig erläu­ tern und ergänzen.", "172": "Derselbe Gelehrte hat ferner den Nachweis geführt, daß der Ausdruck »Katharsis« schon vor Aristoteles nicht bloß auf dem Gebiete der Religion und der Medizin — dort als re­ ligiöse weihende Reinigung, hier als Ableitimg und Aus- scheidung des überflüssigen oder schädlichen Stoffes aus dem Organismus — sondern auch als philosophischer Terminus in Gebrauch war, und in letzterer Beziehung eine sittliche Läuterung, ein Besserwerden des Menschen, ein Fortschreiten zur Tugend im antiken Sinne der Tugend und Tüchtigkeit («?«??) bedeutete ^).", "173": "Wenn nun Aristoteles in der Politik diejenige Katharsis, welche leicht hingerissene und erregbare Gemüther durch gewisse Liederweisen erfahren, und überhaupt die ange­ nehme Erleichterung, welche allen Menschen mehr oder weniger durch eine gewisse Art von Musik zu Theil wird, vergleichungsweise i\") eine Kur nennt, so ist dies Gleichniß eben kein anderes als dasjenige, welches Goethe anwendete, wenn er seine Wertherdichtung, wie überhaupt fast alle seine Dichtungen, als Herstellungs­ und Erleichterungsmittel, als sittliche »Hausmittel\", be­ zeichnete ü).", "174": "In dieser Herstellung aus einem krank­ haften und getrübten Seelenzustande zu derjenigen geisti­ gen Gesundheit, deren der Mensch zur Ausübung der Werke der Tugend unumgänglich bedarf, besteht nach Aristoteles die hauptsächliche erziehende und bildende Kraft der Musik.", "175": "Die Musik kann und soll nach Ari­ stoteles bessernd und bildend auf Geist und Gemüth einwirken, und fie ist eben dadurch ein so wichtiges Bildungs- und Erziehungsmittel, weil sie ergreifender! und lebendiger als die bildende Kunst naturähnliche Dar-! stellungen der Affekte und der geistigen und sittlichen, Tuchtigkeitseigenschaften (der und der «^«ra/) zu! geben vermag, und weil es nur der richtigen Gewöh­ nung bedarf, um durch sie den Menschen in seinem In­ nersten zu ergreifen und zu wecken 12).", "176": "Auf diese frühe Gewöhnung des Menschen an die richtige Beurtheilung und Handhabung aller Affekte:", "177": "Freude, Liebe, Haß, Mitleid, Trauer u. s. f. legt daher Aristoteles einen Hauptnachdruck in seiner musikalischen Erziehungslehre.", "178": "Der Mensch soll lernen, in seinem Empfinden über das Gute und Böse richtig zu unterscheiden;", "179": "er soll sich gewöhnen, an sittlich guten Gesinnungsarten «m», ?Sk<7tp) und an ihren entsprechenden sittlich schö­ nen Handlungen seine Freude zu haben, weil er sie dann, da die Tugend nicht im Wissen, sondern im Handeln besteht, auch selbst im Leben ausüben wird.", "180": "Denn die Gewohnheit, im ideellen Gebiete der Kunst nur an dem Ausdrucke des Guten, Edlen und Schönen seine Freude zu haben, ist die unmittelbare Vorstufe zu einem ähn­ lichen Verhalten in der Wirklichkeit.Dies ist die klare und einfache Ansicht des Aristo­ teles von der musikalischen Katharsis, d. h. von der ver­ sittlichenden Kraft und Wirkung, welche der richtig an­ gewandten Musik innewohnrDie durch die Musik bewirkte Katharsis führt die Seele »zu jener wirklich harmonischen gleichmäßigen Stimmung, wie sie Aristote­ les als Grundlage aller Moralität fordert«^):", "181": "das ist der Kern der Aristotelischen Lehre von der kathartischen Wirkung der Musik, und so hat diese Lehre, wie Spengel aus Plutarch '5) nachgewiesen hat, auch das Alterthum verstanden.Die Lehre von der tragischen Katharsis, d. h. von der in der Tragödie durch deren zwei Haupthebel Mit­ leid und Furcht abschließlich und letztlich bewirkten Läu­ terung dieser im Zuschauer erregten Leidempfindungen ist nun nichts weiter als eine Anwendung dessen, was in der Politik von der kathartischen Kraft und Wirkung der Musik gesagt worden ist, auf das ungleich höhere Gebiet der Poesie und ihrer höchsten Form:", "182": "der Tra­ gödie.Daß wir es mit einer sittlichen Wirkung, mit einer den Menschen erhebenden, läuternden Einwirkung in dieser Lehre des Aristoteles zu thun haben, ist nach dem bisher über die Aristotelische Lehre von der musika­ tischen Katharsis Entwickelten wohl eine unbestreitbare Thatsache.", "183": "Platon hatte die Tragödie als schädlich und unsittlich auf den Menschen wirkend angeklagt, und ihre Freunde herausgefordert, seine philosophische Be­ weisführung mit gleichen Waffen zu widerlegen.", "184": "Wenn Aristoteles diese Herausforderung annahm, — und er hat sie angenommen, und das Zeugniß des Proklos sagt ausdrücklich, daß seine ganze Lehre von der Tragödie auf eine Widerlegung Platons gestellt war — so mußte das Resultat seiner Theorie der Tragödie der Gegen­ satz zur Platonischen sein, er mußte den philosophischen Nachweis führen, daß die Tragödie sittlich veredelnd wirke;", "185": "und diese sittlich veredelnde Wirkung mußte schon in der Definition des Wesens der Tragödie (in dem wie er sie im vierten Kapitel der Poetik auf­ stellt, enthalten sein.Und so ist es in der That.", "186": "Die Katharsis, welche Aristoteles der Tragödie zuschreibt, ist wie die musika­ lische sittlicher und versittlichender Art.Es ist möglich, und selbst wahrscheinlich, daß Ari­ stoteles den Begriff der Katharsis in der unverstümmel­ ten Poetik ausführlicher behandelt, daß er eine übersicht­ liche Entwicklung dieses Begriffs, inwiefern er überhaupt bEialler Kunst in Anwendung komme, gegeben haben mag.", "187": "Aber es ist unnütz, sich darüber den Kopf zu zerbrechen, da der Verlust dieses Kapitels, wenn dasselbe existirte, ein unwiderbringlicher, und da, — was die Haupt­ sache ist, — die Poetik des Philosophen auch in ihrer jetzi­ gen lückenhaften Gestalt noch ausreichende Mittel an die Hand gibt, um die in der Definition der Tragödie aus­ gesprochene Wirkung der Tragödie genügend zu erklären.", "188": "Daß Aristoteles aber in seiner Politik die Ausführung dessen, »was er unter Katharsis verstehe«, auf die Poe­ tik versparte, hatte seinen guten Grund.", "189": "Denn eben in der Poesie, und zwar in der Tragödie, welche in der Darstellung des Mitleidwürdigen und Furchtbaren (der iXkk»?« und sich nicht wie die Musik des unbe­ stimmten Tons, sondern des deutlichen Worts bedient, und so nicht blos zum Herzen und Gemüth, sondern auch zum Verstände und Geiste spricht, mußte die ka­ thartische, d. h. die versittlichende Wirkung, die Aristo­ teles schon der Musik zuschreibt, in ihrer höchsten Po­ tenz l6), und in voller Klarheit zur Erscheinung kom­ men, weil hier di<r bewußte Einsicht an die Stelle des Gefühls, das begreifende Verständniß der Abbilder des Geistigen, an die Stelle der bloßen Gewöhnung an das Sittliche und Harmonische tritt.", "190": "Die Tragödie die den Menschen, den Zuhörer, dem allgemeinen Menschengeschicke gegenüberstellt, wie es sich in der verhängnißvollen Verket­ tung von der Schuld und ihren Folgen, von Fehl und Strafe geltend macht, die Tragödie die es mit den sittlichen Mäch­ ten des Lebens zu thun hat, sie kann nicht, — am »venigsten im antiken Sinne, — abstrahiren von der sitt­ lichen Wirkung auf den Zuschauer und Zuhörer, kann es um so weniger, als das

Augustus, kritisirt in dem ersten Buche seines großen geographischen Werks einen Ausspruch seines Vorgängers Eratosthenes, den er freilich als Philosophen sehr niedrig stellt, in­ dem er ihn »ein

Gewöhnung an das Harmonische, Geordnete, Maaßvolle, während sie den Leidenschaften des gereifte­ ren Alters befreiende Erleichterung schafft von der Ueber­ , macht des leidenschaftlichen Empfindens, und so das ge­ störte Gleichmaaß der Seele wieder herstellt.", "215": "Dagegen über das Wie? der sittlichen Wirkung, welche Aristoteles die Katharsis der Pathemata von Mitleid und Furcht in der

"228": "Hier oder nirgends muß also der Schlüssel sein zu der Katharsis, zu der Läuterung und Reinigung der Pathemata von Mitleid und Furcht, von welcher Aristoteles in der Definition uns gesagt hat,

Unglück gera­ thtnd, vorgestellt werden dürfen, — denn das ist weder Furcht noch Mitleid zu erwecken geeignet, sondern bloß gräßlich — noch Nichtswürdige aus Unglück in Glück, denn das ist das Allerun tragischste.", "234": "Ein solcher Fall hat nämlich gar nichts von dem, was ein tragischer Fall haben soll, denn er erregt weder unsere allgemcinmensch­ liche Theilnahme, noch unser Mitleid, noch unsre Furcht.", "235": "Drittens darf auch nicht der absolut Schlechte aus Glück in Unglück gerathen;", "236": "denn eine solche Komposi­ tion kann zwar wohl möglicherweise unsre allgemein-

Gegenstand verlangt, der un^resgleichen ist;", "238": "darum ist ein solcher Ausgang in der Tragödie weder unser Mitleid noch unsre Furcht zu^ erwecken geeignet.", "239": "Es bleibt also nur noch als tragischer Held ein solcher übrig, der zwischen jenen beide'n (d. i. zwischen dem durch­ aus Tugendhaften und dem durchaus Schlechten, zwi­ schen Engel und Teufel, wie wir sagen würden) in der Mitte

weiterhin, daß derselbe jedenfalls nicht unbedeutend sein dürfe, daß er vielmehr wesentlich in's Gewicht fallen 26), haß aber der tragische Held selbst doch in der Stufenleiter zwischen ausgezeichneter Vortrefflichkeit und überwiegender Schlech­ tigkeit »eher höher als niedriger stehen müsse«.»", "243": "Diese Art der Tragödie also,« fährt Aristoteles fort, »deren Komposition ich so eben beschrieben habe, ist, mit dem Maaßstabe des Begriffs der Kunst gemes­ sen , die schönste.«", "244": "Er meint diejenige, in welcher der Held, ein Mensch wie er ihn so eben geschildert hat, ein Wesen, in welchem wir unsres Gleichen erkennen, durch irgend einen bedeutungsvollen Fehl aus Glück in Unglück geräth.", "245": "Dagegen verwirft er jene zweite Art der tragischen Komposition, welcher

Person nicht verändert;", "389": "oder endlich so, daß die Nachahmen­ den als wirklich handelnde und thätige sich verhalten').2.", "390": "Innerhalb dieser drei Verschiedenheiten also bewegt sich die Nachahmung, wie wir zu Anfange gesagt haben, näm­ lich in der Verschiedenheit der Mittel, der Gegenstände und der Art und Weise.", "391": "Daher kann man sagen, daß in der einen Beziehung Sophokles als Nachahmer mit Homer inner­ halb derselben Kategorie steht, — denn beide stellen bedeutende Menschen dar — in der andern dagegen mit Aristophanes — denn sie stellen beide ihre Personen als handelnde, und zwar als dramatisch handelnde, hin.s.", "392": "Daher leiten auch Einige die Benennung „Dramen\" hiervon ab, weil diese Gedichte dramatisch Handelnde darstel­ len;", "393": "darum

viele und welche es giebt.1.", "399": "Meiner Ansicht nach haben im Allgemeinen zwei Ursachen die Poesie erzeugt, und zwar Ursachen, welche in der Natur des Menschen begründet sind ').2. Denn einmal ist das Nachahmen den Menschen von Kindheit an natürlich eigen, und sie unterscheiden sich von allen andern lebendigen Geschöpfen dadurch, daß der Mensch vor allen zum Nachahmen das geschickteste ist, wie er denn auch sein erstes Lernen vermittelst der Nachahmung bewerk­ stelligt;", "400": "und zweitens ist ebenso die Freude an den Produkten der Nachahmung eine natürliche Eigenschaft aller Menschen.3.", "401": "Ein Beweis dafür ist das was wir bei Werken der Nachahmung geschehen sehen.", "402": "Dieselben Gegenstände nämlich, welche wir in ihrer natürlichen Realität mit Unlust sehen, betrachten wir grade in ihren vollendetsten Abbildungen mit Vergnügen, wie z.", "403": "B. die Gestaltungen der allerverächtlichsten Thiere, ja von Leichnamen ^).4.", "404": "Der Grund auch hiervon ist der, daß das Erkennt­ nißgewinnen nicht bloß für die Philosophen höchster Genuß ist, sondern ganz ebenso auch für alle andere Menschen, nur mit dem Unterschiede, daß diese letzteren nur in geringem Maaße der Erkenntniß theilhaftig werden').5.", "405": "Der Grund nämlich, weßhalb sie beim Erblicken sol­ cher Abbildungen Lust empfinden, ist der, weil dieß Anschauen begleitet ist von der schließenden Erkenntniß, was ein jedes darstellt, z.", "406": "B. daß dies der und der ist ö);", "407": "denn in Fällen, wo der Betrachtende den Gegenstand selbst zuvor noch nie ge­ sehen hat, wird die Abbildung nicht als nachahmende °) sein Vergnügen erregen, sondern durch ihre technische Behandlung, oder durch ihr Kolorit, oder aus sonst einem ähnlichen Grunde.6.", "408": "Da nun das Nachahmen ebenso in unserer Natur liegt wie die Harmonie und der Rhythmus (denn daß die Versmaaße nur einzelne Arten der Rhythmen sind, ist ohne Weiteres einleuchtend), so waren es von Anfang her die da­ für durch die Natur befähigten, welche in allmäliger Entwick­ lung dieser Momente die Poesie aus den Anfängen der Im­ provisationen ins Leben riefen.7.", "409": "Es schied sich aber die Poesie nach den spezifisch eigen­ thümlichen Charakteren der Dichtenden in entsprechende Ver­ schiedenheiten.", "410": "Die ernsteren Charaktere ahmten edle Hand­ lungen und Handlungen eben solcher Menschen nach, die Leichtfertigeren dagegen die der Schlechten, indem sie zuerst Spottgedichte machten, wie jene andern Hymnen und Lob­ gedichte.8.", "411": "Von den Dichtern vor Homer nun

diesem Versmaße einander verhöhnte.9.", "414": "So wurden denn von den alten Dichtern die einen heroische die andern jambische.", "415": "Wie aber in der edlen und ernsten Gattung vorzugsweise Homer Dichter war — denn er allein hat nicht nur überhaupt schön gedichtet, sondern seine Poesie ist auch wesentlich dramatische Darstellung — so hat er auch zuerst die Grundformen der Komödie gegeben,

ob die Tragödie in ihren verschiedenen Arten bereits ausreichend entwickelt sei oder nicht, sowohl in Hinsicht auf ihr inneres Wesen als in Bezug auf die theatralische Darstellung, gehört einer andern

andere ist, daß ein Undenkbares unter gewissen Umständen nicht undenkbar ist;", "1013": "denn zum Wahrscheinlichen gehört, daß auch manchmal Unwahrschein­ liches geschehe^).18.", "1014": "Bei Dingen, in welchen die Ausleger Widersprüche gefunden zu haben meinen, muß man die Untersuchung von denselben Gesichtspunkten aus führen, wie bei Widerlegungen in gerichtlichen Reden 26):", "1015": "ob der Gegenstand derselbe ist ^), ob die Beziehung dieselbe 28), und auf dieselbe Weise 2»), so daß wir auch aus den Dichter selbst Rücksicht nehmen müssen und auf das, worauf seine Rede sich bezieht, und welchen Sinn ein Verständiger seinen Worten unterlegen kann.19.", "1016": "Richtig aber ist ein Tadel und als verwerflich vor dem Richterstuhl der Vernunft und der Moral ist es, wenn der Dichter ohne zwingende Nothwendigkeit das Undenkbare, wie Euripides in der Figur des Aegeus^), oder sittliche Schlechtigkeit, wie derselbe bei dem Menelaos in seinem Ore­ stes^') zur Anwendung bringt.20.", "1017": "In Summa also führen die Kritiker die tadelnden Einwendungen auf fünf Gattungsbegriffe zurück.", "1018": "Sie tadeln nämlich etwas entweder als unmöglich, oder als undenkbar, oder als der Moral schädlich, oder als widersprechend, oder als den Gesetzen der Kunsttechnik zuwiderlaufend.", "1019": "Die Be­ seitigungen aber sind aus den aufgezählten Gesichtspunkten zu finden;", "1020": "und zwar

pöbelmäßig überladene höher steht (eine solche aber ist die, die es mit einem gebil­ deteren Zuschauerpublikum zu thun hat), so folgt daraus, daß die, welche Alles nachahmend darstellen will, pöbelmäßig') überladen ist.", "1023": "Denn, als ob die Zuhörer nichts verstehen könnten, wenn der Vortragende nicht dazu thäte, bewegen sie sich in unaufhörlicher Bewegung, wie die schlechten Flöten­ tänzer sich wie ein Kreis zusammenbiegen, wenn sie den „Diskuswurf\" darstellen sollen, und die agirende Haupt­ person an der Schleppe zerren, wenn sie die „Skylla\" zur Flöte tanzen 3).2.", "1024": "Die Tragödie nun ist von dieser Art *), wie das auch in dem Urtheil ausgesprochen liegt, welches die älteren Schau­ spieler über ihre jüngeren Nachfährer fällten.", "1025": "So pflegte der Schauspieler Myniskos den Kallippides wegen seiner übertriebenen mimischen Aktion Affe zu nennen, und in demselben Rufe stand auch der Schauspieler Pindaros.", "1026": "So wie nun diese letzteren sich zu den ersteren verhalten, so verhält sich die ganze tragische Kunst zur Ependichtung.", "1027": "Also, sagen die Ver­ rleinerer der tragischen Kunst, die Kunst des Epos sei für ein gebildetes Publikum, das keiner mimischen Aktion bedarf, die tragische dagegen für ein niedriges.", "1028": "Somit dürfte klar sein, daß die letztere als eine pöbelmäßige tiefer stehe.3.", "1029": "Allein erstens trifft dieser Vorwurf nicht die Kunst des Dichters, sondern die des Schauspielers;", "1030": "denn auch beim epischen Vortrage kann der Rhapsode in der andeutenden Ge­ bärdensprache zuviel thun, wie es die Manier des Sosistratos war, und im lyrischen Gesangs-Vortrage ^), wie es die Manier des Opuntiers Mnasitheos war°).", "1031": "Zweitens ist auch nicht alle und jede Bewegung?) zu verwerfen, da ja doch auch der Tanz nicht verwerflich ist, sondern nur die übertriebene Aktion schlechter Schauspieler, wie sie nicht bloß dem Kallippides von seinen Zeitgenossen zum Vorwurfe gemacht wurde, sondern auch heutzutage andern Schauspielern, denen man vorwirft, daß ihre Frauendarstellung nicht edle Frauen darstelle.", "1032": "Dazu kommt, daß die Tragödie auch ohne alle mimische Aktion ihre Wirkung hervorbringt 6), so gut wie die epische Dichtung.", "1033": "Denn schon das bloße Vorlesen einer Tragödie läßt erkennen, wie sie beschaffen ist»).", "1034": "Steht also die Tragödie in allen andern Beziehungen über dem Epos, so ist jener obengerügte Fehler'\") gar nicht nothwendig mit ihrem Wesen verbunden.4.", "1035": "Ferner steht sie höher als das Epos, weil sie alte Elemente der epischen Dichtung in sich enthält, — denn sie kann, wenn sie will, selbst dasselbe Versmaß gebrauchen\") — und überdieß noch in der musikalischen Begleitung und in der:", "1036": "Kunstmitteln der Darstellung für das Auge einen nicht unbe­ deutenden Bestandtheil voraus hat, wodurch die Lusteindrücke auf das lebendigste hervorgerufen werden.", "1037": "Dazu kommt auch die lebendige Wirkung, welche sie mittelst der Erkennung und der sinnlichen Wirklichkeit der vorgestellten Handlungen übt.5.", "1038": "Ferner hat die Tragödie auch das voraus, daß sie innerhalb eines geringeren äußeren Umfangs ihren Abschluß erreicht.", "1039": "Denn das Konzentrirtere ist angenehmer als das durch Zeitlänge Verwässerte'^);", "1040": "man stelle sich nur vor, daß einer sich beikommen lassen wollte, den Sophokleischen Oedipus in eben so viel Verse als die Jlias zu bringen.6.", "1041": "Endlich hat die epische Poesie weniger Einheit\").", "1042": "Beweis:", "1043": "aus jeder beliebigen epischen Dichtung lassen sich meh­ rere Tragödien machen.", "1044": "Wenn also die epischen Dichter nur eine einheitliche Fabel bearbeiten, so wird dieselbe entweder, wenn kurz vorgetragen, kahl wie ein Rattenschwanz, oder wenn der Dichter sie dem gehörigen Maße der Länge anzunähern sucht, wässerig.", "1045": "Wenn sie dagegen mehrere Fabeln verbinden, das heißt, wenn das Epos aus mehreren Handlungen besteht.", "1046": "so hat es eben keine Einheit, wie denn auch in der That die Jlias und ebenso die Odyssee viele solche Theile haben, welche schon für sich einen genügenden Umfang haben.", "1047": "Und doch ist die Komposition dieser Gedichte so vortrefflich, als es (im Epos) nur irgend möglich, und die dargestellte Handlung ist, soweit sie es nur irgend sein kann, eine einheitliche\").7.", "1048": "Wenn somit die Tragödie in allen diesen Beziehungen im Vorzug vor dem Epos steht, und obenein noch durch dir ihrer Kunstform eigenthümliche Wirkung — denn beide Kunst formen sollen nicht überhaupt irgend welches Vergnügen be­ wirken, sondern das oben beschriebene'^) — so ist es einleuch­ tend, daß sie die höher stehende ist, indem sie in höherem Grade ihren Zweck erreicht als die epische Dichtung.Und so mag es denn über Tragödie und Epos, sowohl über ihr Wesen im Allgemeinen als über ihre Bestandtheile, deren Anzahl und Unterschiede, über die Ursachen der Schön­ heiten und

darauf hinaus, daß Aristoteles im ersten Buch dieses Werkes die e pischen, im zweiten die dramatischen Dichter behandelte und daß er gelegentlich die Geschichte der poetischen Nationallit­ teratur bis in ihre vereinzelten Traditionen verfolgte und Stil und sonstige Eigentümlichkeiten der verschiedenen Dich­ ter kritisch sonderte und charakterisierte.s", "30": "Namentlich sehen wir aus dem von Makrobius aufbehaltenen Fragmente, daß der Stagirit, ganz nach seiner genauen in das Ein­ zelne eingehenden historisch-antiquarischen Weise, bei den Dramatikern unter anderem auch die größere oder geringere Sorgfalt und Gelehrsamkeit kritisierte, mit welcher die ver­ schiedenen Tra'giker sich der überlieferten Sagengeschichte des Altertums angeschlossen hatten", "31": ".Die Aristotelische Poetik ist eines der rätselhaftesten Überbleibsel der gesamten litterarischen Verlassenschaft des hellenischen Altertums, eine Schrift, an deren Deutung im einzelnen wie an der Erklärung ihres Ursprungs und ihrer Beschaffenheit im ganzen, sich seit mehr als einem Jahrhundert der Scharfsinn der gelehrtesten Philologen und der tiefsten Denker versucht hat.Schon Lessing, von dessen Hamburgischer Dramatur­ gie eine neue Epoche des Verständnisses und der Wirksam­ keit dieser ältesten Ästhetik datiert, sprach es aus, daß eine Untersuchung über die Entstehung und Grundlage der Aristo­ telischen Poetik zur richtigen Würdigung dieser Schrift durchaus notwendig sei.", "32": "Daß ihn selbst diese Untersuchung zu einem von allen damaligen Ansichten abweichenden Resul­ tate geführt hatte, geht aus der Art und Weise hervor, wie er sich in dem Schlußkapitel der Hamburgischen Drama­ turgie^ über diesen Gegenstand ausdrückt.", "33": "Er, der den sichersten Beweis für die Richtigkeit seiner eigenen Ansich­ ten über das Wesen der dramatischen Dichtkunst darin zu finden bekannte, daß er dasselbe „vollkommen so erkenne, wie es Aristoteles aus den unzähligen Meisterstücken

sie für ein ebenso unfehlbares Werk halte, als die Elemente des Euklid nur immer sind.", "36": "Ihre Grundsätze sind eben so wahr und gewiß, nur freilich nicht so faßlich und daher mehr der Chicane ausgesetzt als alles, was diese enthalten.", "37": "Besonders getraue ich mir von der Tragödie, als über die uns die Zeit so ziemlich alles daraus gönnen wollen, unwidersprechlich zu beweisen, daß sie sich von der Richtschnur des Aristoteles keinen Schritt entfernen kann, ohne sich ebenso weit von ihrer Vollkommenheit zu entfernen.", "38": "\"", "39": "Lessing hat diese seine „eigenen Gedanken\" über die jetzige Beschaffenheit des rätselhaften kleinen Werks für sich behalten.", "40": "Denn der Plan, mit dem er laut seiner Auße­ rung in einem Brief an Mendelssohn damals ernstlich umging, einen eigenen ausführlichen Kommentar zu der Aristotelischen Poetik zu schreiben 8, ging, wie so manches andere, das sich an Lessings damalige dramaturgische Thä­ tigkeit knüpfte, mit dem Scheitern der Hamburger Theater­ unternehmuug zu Grunde.", "41": "Nur soviel läßt sich jedoch aus dm oben angeführten Worten des großm Mannes entneh­ men, daß es seiner Meinung nach mit dieser Aristotelischen Schrift eine ganz eigene Bewandtnis habe, daß sie ferner zwar lückenhaft und unvollständig, aber in demjenigen, was die Theorie der Tragödie betreffe, im wesentlichen vollstän­ dig sei.", "42": "Es ist nicht unwahrscheinlich daß Lessing (1768) in seiner Ansicht über die Poetik mit der Vermutung Gottfried Hermanns (1802) zusammentraf, der diese Schrift in ihrer jetzigen Gestalt für einen unausgeführ­ ten Entwurf hielt und dm Text demgemäß einer sehr energischen und gewaltsamen Behandlung unterwarf, sDiese Gewaltsamkeit aber des großen Kritikers war doch nur ein Kinderspiel gegen das Verfahren, welches ein Menschenalter später ein anderer Herausgeber, Professor Franz Ritter (1839), anwenden zu müssen glaubte und als dessen Resultat die philologische Welt mit Staunen und Unwillen die Erklärung vernahm:", "43": "daß nahezu ein Dritteil der ganzen Schrift als unecht und wertlos auszuscheiden sei!Das Wesentliche des Ritterschen Räsonnements war folgender Art.", "44": "Aristoteles

Aristoteles in seinen Untersuchungen über das We­ sen der Poesie'2 zu entwickeln verspricht oder abgehandelt zu haben versichert, findet sich nun in der uns erhaltenen Aristotelischen Poetik entweder gar nicht oder doch nur sehr kurz und ungenügend behandelt.", "46": "Es bleibt also, meint Ritter, nur zweierlei anzunehmen übrig:", "47": "entweder:", "48": "die Aristotelische Poetik ist in sehr ver­ stümmelter Gestalt auf uns gekommen;", "49": "oder:", "50": "das Werk, auf welches Aristoteles in jenen Stellen verweist, war ein anderes, als die uns erhaltene Abhandlung.", "51": "Ritter

I—V) über Wesen und Arten, Ursprung und Fortbildung der griechischen Poesie vollstän­ dig auf, wobei er sich nur einen längern eigenen gramma­ tisch-antiquarischen Zusatz erlaubte (Kap.

XI, ß 6), sowie das ganze zwölfte Kapitel sind neue eigene Zuthaten des Jnterpola'tors.", "67": "Dann folgt auszüglich ein Abschnitt über die tragischen Charaktere, aber das sechzehnte Kapitel ist wieder ein Zu­ satz des Verkürzers, dm Ritter bei dieser wie bei jeder an­ dern Gelegenheit als ein wahres Mo nstrum von Albernheit und Kopflosigkeit darstellt.", "68": "Kap. XVII—XXIH dagegen sind wieder echt Aristotelisch, nur allerdings verkürzt und mit einfältigen Zusätzen versehen, zu dem die Bemerkung über Schürzung und Lösung (»im:", "69": "und kü-l-) und über die vier Arten der Tragödie gehören!", "70": "Die Kap. XXI und XXII, wo von der Diktion gehandelt wird, sind stark verkürzte Auszüge und Kap.", "71": "XX völlig unechter Zusatz, ein Urteil, das auch auf die beiden letzten Kapitel (Kapitel XXV und XXVI) ausgedehnt wird.", "72": "Auf diese Weise wird also, wie gesagt, ein gutes Dritteil der Schrift als unechter und ge­ radezu alberner Zusatz fremder Hand verworfen!", "73": "Wenn es nun schon ein überaus wunderliches Ding ist um einen Auszug, der, während er ausdrücklich zu dem Zwecke gemacht worden sein soll, das allzu umfangreich scheinende Orginal auf möglichst populäre Weise in u'sruu vslxlü'oi abzukürzen, dies Orginal durch eigene Zusätze doch wieder noch um ein Dritteil vermehrt, so erscheint ande­ rerseits der Mann selbst, welchen Ritter sich als Verfasser dieses Auszuges gedacht hat, geradezu als ein wahrer Trage­ la'ph, ein Fabeltier von Albernheit und Leichtsinn.", "74": "In der That hat Ritter seiner Hypothese zu Liebe auf den Schei­ tel dieses seines unglücklichen Epitoma'tors und Jnterpolators alle Schimpfwörter gehäuft, von denen das Latein der moder­ nen Philologen ein so reiches Arsenal bildet.", "75": "Ich habe dar­ über in dm Anmerkungen wiederholt gesprochen und brauche daher hier nicht noch einmal darauf zurückzukommen.", "76": "Aller­ dings erforderte die Hypothese des Kritikers notwendig die Annahme eines so unerhört einfältigen und geistlosen Trop­ fen als Epitomator und Jnterpolator;", "77": "aber desto schlimmer für die Hypothese!", "78": "Dieselbe hat dazu noch das Bedenkliche, daß sie ihren Verteidiger zwingt, die Zeitgenossen jenes Epitomators und Jnterpolators mindestens als eben so ein­ fältige, geschmack- und geistlose Menschen anzunehmen, da sie ja diese elende Sudelarbeit, diesen stümperhaften und verfälschten Auszug nach Ritter dem echten, damals noch vorhandenen Aristotelischen Orginalwerke vorzogen und den­ selben überhaupt so beifällig aufnahmen, daß dadurch das Orginalwerk zuletzt völlig verdrängt worden ist!!", "79": "Kann dies aber auch nur einigermaßen glaublich sein für eine Zeit, wo doch durchaus noch nicht allgemeine Barbarei in der Litteratur herrschend und jedenfalls noch Sinn und Geschmack für sprachliche Darstellung genügend vorhanden war, um die hier und da auf das äußerste zerrissene Schreib­ art, wie sie zum Teil auf Rechnung des Epitomators und Jnterpolators gesetzt wird, ungenießbar zu finden?", "80": "Auch hat schon der Umstand der Ritterschen Hypothese etwas wi­ der sich, daß ein Mann der Litteratur, ein Schriftsteller, der sich mit Aristoteles Poetik zu beschäftigen den Trieb empfand, ein so ausbündig einfältiger Tropf gewesen sein soll, daß er selbst nicht einmal sein Geschäft des Ausziehens verstand und gleich zu Anfang Dinge abzuhandeln ver­ sprach, von denen nahcher in seinem Auszuge nichts oder doch so gut wie nichts vorkommt.Mit der Ritterschen Hypothese eines Auszugs ist es also nichts.", "81": "Aber dennoch gibt es wohl keinen Leser der Aristotelischen Poetik, dem es nicht auf den ersten Blick klar sein sollte, daß wir hier keinenfalls ein vollständiges und von dem Autor selbst herausgegebenes Schriftwerk, son­ dern nur mehr oder weniger ausführliche Bruchstücke eines solchen vor uns haben.", "82": "Um meine eigene Ansicht von der Entstehungsweise derselben mitzuteilen, muß ich etwas wei­ ter ausHolm.Wenn die in meinen früheren Untersuchungen\" über die Schicksale der Aristotelischen Schriften ausführlich be­ handelte Überlieferung, welche Stra'bo und Plutarch uns aufbehalten haben, irgend einen vernünftigen Sinn hat, so kann dies kaum ein anderer sein, als daß die eigentlichen streng wissenschaftlichen sogenannten esoterischen Schriften oder sagen wir die Vorträge, welche das System des Phi­ losophen umfaßten und die er viele Jahre lang vor einem auserwähltm Kreise von Schülern im Lykei'on zu Athen gehalten hat, nicht von Aristoteles selbst herausgegeben worden sind.\"", "83": "Diese Vorträge, d. h. die denselben als Grundlage dienenden schriftlichen Aufzeichnungen, des Phi­ losophen mögen einzelnen vertrauteren Schülern vielleicht von ihrem Lehrer zur Privatbenutzung mitgeteilt worden sein;", "84": "im ganzen aber verblieben sie in dm Händen des Meisters zu erneuerter Bearbeitung, Verbesserung und Be­ reicherung aufbewahrt (in oonimsllt»'rüs rsli'oti), und es ist mir, alles in allem genommen, mehr als wahrscheinlich, daß die Schriften des Stagiriten, wie wir sie jetzt besitzen, in ähnlicher Weise von den Schülern desselben publiziert sein mögen, wie dies in unserem Jahrhundert mit dm meisten Werken, d. h. den Vorlesungen, Hegels, des deutschen Aristo­ teles, der Fall gewesm ist.", "85": "Wie Hegel ward auch Aristote- les vom Tode übereilt, und seinen Schülern, von denen Theophra'st seine Bibliothek und seinen litterarischen Nach­ laß erbte, blieb die Pflicht, diesen Nachlaß der Welt zu­ gänglich zu machen.", "86": "Wann und in welcher Weise dies ge­ schehen, ist uns natürlich unbekannt.", "87": "Daß aber die Aristo­ telischen Schriften in ihrer jetzigen Gestalt zahlreiche unver­ kennbare Spuren ihres Ursprungs aus Vorlesungen und „Heften\" im modernen Sinne an sich tragen, wird kein Kundiger in Abrede stellen.", "88": "^Hiernächst ergeben sich zur Erklärung des gegenwärtigen Zustandes unserer Aristotelischen Poetik zwei Möglichkeiten.", "89": "Entweder nämlich befand sich dasjenige, was Aristote­ les selbst davon niedergeshcrieben hatte, unter dm Schriften, die aus Theophrasts Besitz unherausgegeben durch Erbschaft nach dem kleinasiatischen Skepsis an Ne'leus und dessen Fa­ milie gerieten und die erst spät zur Zeit Su'lla's durch Ape'llikon in jenem von Strabo und anderen Alten beschrie­ benen traurige Zustande ans Licht gezogen wurden.", "90": "In diesem Falle würde sich der defekte Zustand unseres jetzigen Textes von selbst erklären.", "91": "Oder aber:", "92": "unsere jetzige Poe­ tik ist nichts mehr und nichts weniger als ein nach Aristo­ telischen Vorträgen von einem Zuhörer des Philosophen aufgezeichnetes Heft, dessen Verfasser sich das Interesiserende ausführlicher, anderes kürzer anmerkte, manches wegließ, hier und da auch ein paar eigene Bemerkungen an den Rand schrieb und überhaupt dem Vortrage nach subjektiver Neigung und Belieben folgte.", "93": "An eine Veröffentlichung seiner Aufzeichnungen dachte er schwerlich;", "94": "doch gingen die­ selben darum keineswegs verloren, in einer Zeit, wo ein Schriftstück solcher Art ein großer Schatz war.", "95": "Und als später die Zeit der großen öffentlichen Büchersammlungen kam, wo die Nachfrage nach Aristotelischen Schriften — deren damals wenige im Umlauf und Bücherhandel waren — stark wurde, war jenes Bruchstück der Aristotelischen Poetik sicher nicht das einzige Schriftstück, das mit dem Namen des berühmten Denkers von Stagi'ra an der Stirn in die Bibliotheken von Alxandri'a und Per'gamus wander­ te und dort um so lieber auf- und angenommen ward, da ein anderes Aristotelisches Werk über die Theorie der Dicht­ kunst nicht vorhanden war.", "96": "Diese Hypothese hat jedenfalls ebensoviel, wenn nicht mehr, Berechtigung, als alle bisher über die Aristotelische Poetik aufgestellten Vermutungen.", "97": "Sie erklärt Form und sprachliche Darstellung, Ungleichheit in der Behandlung des Stoffs, einzelne Lücken und Zusätze und alle sonstigen zum Teil sich widersprechenden Eigenschaften des kleinen Trak­ tats..", "98": "Wem aber die Annahme solcher antiker nachgeschrie­ bener Hefte zu modern ershceinen sollte, der möge nachlesen, was wir an einem andern Orte\" über diesen Gegenstand gesagt haben, und dazu noch Stellen wie Diogenes von Laerte, II, 48;", "99": "VI, 3 und die bekannte Nachricht über Klea'nthes den Sto'iker hinzufügen, der zu arm war, um sich das zur Aufzeichnung der Lehrvorträge seines Lehrers Ze'no notwendige Schreibmaterial zu kaufen.", "100": "Wie es sich indessen auch mit der Hypothese verhalten möge, folgende Punkte bleiben eben so fest stehen, als sie sich mit derselben im Einklänge befinden.", "101": "Erstens:", "102": "die Stellen anderer Aristotelischen Schriften, in welchen auf die Untersuchungen über die Poetik Bezug genommen wird, be­ weisen nichts dafür, daß Aristoteles selbst ein Werk über die Theorie der Dichtkunst veröffentlicht hat.", "103": "Wohl aber scheint der in unserer Poetik\" vorkommende Ausdruck, daß über eine gewisse Materie „in den herausgegebenen\" Untersuchungen genügend gehandelt sei, unwidersprechlich zu beweisen, daß die Poetik eben nicht zu den „herausge­ gebenen\" Schriften gehörte, sondern daß wir hier einen es - terischen Vortrag vor uns haben.", "104": "Zweitens:", "105": "kein alter Schriftsteller weiß etwas von einem ausführlicheren Werke des Aristoteles über die Poetik in zwei Büchern, sondern die Existenz eines solchen bericht auf der alleinigen sehr schwachen Autorität des Katalogs Aristotelischer Schriften bei Diogenes von Laerte, dessen Angabe sich obenein sehr wohl auf die gegenwärtig vorhandene Poetik beziehen kann, die man vielleicht nach ihren Hauptteilen, Epos und Tra­ gödie, in zwei Bücher teilte.Schon mit dem Prinzip, welches Aristo'teles* an die Spitze seiner Poetik stellt und auf welches seine ganze Kunstlehre gebaut ist, beginnt die Polemik des Stagiriten gegen Platon, welche sich, wie wir sehen werden, durch seine ganze Poetik hindurchzieht.Dies Prinzip ist die Lehre von der Mime'sis.", "106": "Da wir das griechische Wort seinem philosophischen Begriffe bei Aristoteles entsprechend durch unser deutsches Wort Nachah­ mung nur unvollkommen wiederzugeben vermögen, — wie es denn eine bekannte Thatsache ist, daß unser Verständnis griechischer Philosophie durch die Schwierigkeit, viele Aus­ drücke und Begriffe, die auf antiken Anshcauungen und Vorstellungen beruhen, durch vollkommen entsprechende mo­ derne Ausdrücke wiederzugeben, wesentlich ershcwert wird! —, so sei es einstweilen gestattet, den griechischen Ausdruck Mi­ mesis so lange beizubehalten, bis es uns gelungen sein wird, das Wesen der „Nachahmung\", welche Aristoteles als Prin­ zip aller Kunst aufstellt, erläuternd aufzuhellen.Mimesis und mimei'sthai (Nachahmung und nach­ ahmen) waren schon vor Aristoteles und Platon geläufige Ausdrücke zur Bezeichnung des Wesens der bildenden Künste, so wie der Musik und Poesie.", "107": "Doch erst Platon unterwarf dieses Prinzip aller Kunst einer ausführlichen philosophischen Behandlung.", "108": "Durch seine ganze Betrachtungsweise der Kunst geht eine heftige Polemik gegen die Kunst und gegen die Stellung, welche, zumal die Dichtkunst, im hellenischen Volke und Leben einahm.", "109": "Daß Poesie und Kunst sich ebenbürtig der Philosophie zur Seite zu stellen, daß sie mit ihren Leistungen eine hohe Bedeutung für die Bildung der Mensch­ heit zu beanspruchen wagten, erschien dem Meister der Aka­ demie als eine durch nichts gerechtfertigte Anmaßung.", "110": "Zu dieser seiner Feindseligkeit gegen die Kunst mußte ihm das Prinzip derselben, als welches er, wie die gesamte helle­ nische Philosophie, die Mimesis erkannte, die Waffen schmie­ den helfen.", "111": "Weil alle Künste auf diesem Prinzipe beruhen, alle „nachahmende\" sind, so fehlt ihnen, nach Platon, alle Realität.", "112": "Sie vermögen nur den Schein der Wirk­ lichkeit und Wesenheit der Dinge zu geben;", "113": "sie gehen nur auf Sinnenreiz und Täuschung des Hörers und Beobach­ ters.", "114": "Die Künstler selbst haben keine Einsicht in das wahre Wesen der Dinge, deren Scheinbilder sie hervorbringen;", "115": "ihr Thun und ihre Werke sind ein bloßes müßiges Spiel a-so berechnet auf das, was dem Volk und den Unkundigen (den Nichtphilosophen) als schön erscheint, kein auf das Wesen gehender Ernst und selbst diejenige Kuntsform, welche dm höchsten Rang einnimmt, die Tragödie, macht davon um so weniger eine Ausnahme, als sie gerade die am meisten und vollständigsten mime'tische (nachahmende) von allen ist.", "116": "— So gelangt Platon zu dem Resultat:", "117": "die nachbildende Kunst ist an sich schlecht, sie wirkt auf und durch das Schlechte in uns, und was sie hervorbringt ist, im Lichte der Philo­ sophie betrachtet, Schlechtes.", "118": "2Die logische Entwickelung, mittelst deren Plato seine Geringschätzung der Kunst und ihres Prinzips, der Mimesis, begründet, richtet sich gegen das Wesen der letzteren mit folgendem Schlüsse, dessen Unrichtigkeit Friedrich Bis ch er in seiner Ästhe'tik eben so kurz als schlagend nachgewiesen hat.^", "119": "„Die Phantasie\", so argumentiert er, „gibt ein Abbild des Gegenstandes;", "120": "dieser selbst ist ein Abbild der Idee des Gegenstandes, wie sie im göttlichen Verstände wohnt.\"", "121": "Nun nimmt er die objektive Darstellung des Phantasiebildes durch die Kunst (das Kunstwerk) hinzu und sagt, diese sei wieder ein Abbild des Phantasiebildes.", "122": "Folglich, schließt er, sei das Kunstwerk das Bild von dem Bilde eines Bildes.", "123": "Lassen wir das letzte Glied, das Kunstwerk, weg, so ist also das Phantasiebild Bild des Bildes;", "124": "es ist zwar nicht, wie Platon sagt, aus der dritten, aber doch immer nur aus der zweiten Hand.", "125": "Allein gerade diese zweite Hand hebt ja die Mängel des Bildes erster Hand, die Mängel des Naturschönen auf und kehrt zum göttlichen Urbilde zurück.", "126": "Das Naturschöne ist die Mitte zwischen diesem, dem göttlichen Urbilde, und seiner Herstellung durch den Menschengeist.", "127": "Gerade weil das zweite Bild Scheinbild ist, tilgt es die Mängel des ersten Bildes (des naturschönen Gegenstandes), und nie steht Platon mit seiner Jdeeenlehre in gröberem Widerspruch, als wenn er so den Schein verkennt.Durch diese seine falsche Auffassung des Begriffs der künstlerischen Mimesis wird es nun zugleich erklärt, wie Platon dazu kommen mußte, die ganze Kunst nur in so weit gelten zu lassen,'als sie sich in den Dienst des sittlichen Ideals zu begeben und nur dieses nachahmend auszudrücken und nachzubilden habe, wenn sie in seinem Jdealstaate geduldet sein wollte.", "128": "Sobald sie dies versäume, sei sie für gefährlich und schädlich zu halten.", "129": "So die Tragödie, weil sie die Lust zu Klage und Jammer im Menschen nähre, die Komödie, weil sie das Gegenteil davon, den leichtsinnig spottenden Übermut, in uns befördere.", "130": "Die erstere statuiert er also höchstens, wenn sie, wie das spezifisch christliche Trauerspiel zwei Jahrtausende später unternahm, vollkommene sittliche Reinheit und übermenschliche Erhabenheit des Helden im Leiden auszeige, die letztere, wenn sie sich darauf beschränke, in moralischer Tendenz das Unwürdige, Verkehrte und Lächer­ liche warnend und belehrend darzustellen.", "131": "Also Platon, der doktrinäre Idealist, der in allem Bestehenden nirgends das entsprechende Abbild der Idee zu finden vermochte, die er von Staat und Staatsleben, von Poesie und Kunst in sich trug, dieser radikalste Idealist, den die Geschichte der Menschheit kennt, der im vollen Glauben von der Überzeugung ausging, daß es möglich sein müsse, vom Standpunkte des Idealismus aus die wirkliche Welt umzugestalten, scheute in seiner Kühnheit keine Konsequenz seiner Weltanschauung:", "132": "nicht die Notwendigkeit einer staats- polizeilichen Zensur des Ästhetischen, nicht den Widerspruch seiner ganzen Zeit Und seines Volkes gegen den moralishcen Rigorismus einer Anschauungsweise, durch welche nicht nur über eine ganze Welt unbefangener und harmloser Kunst- gestaltung des Bildners und Malers, sondern auch über einen Phi'dias und Homer, über einen Ä'schylos und Sophokles der Stab gebrochen wurdet", "133": "Aber niemals ist auch der abstrakte Idealismus in seiner um die Wirklichkeit des Lebens unbekümmerten Naivität je wieder so unsterblicher Lächerlich­ keit überwiesen worden, als der große hellenische Philosoph und sein radikaler Idealismus von der lebendigen Wirklich­ keit und von der Kunstgeschichte seines Volkes.", "134": "Es ist ein wunderbares Verhältnis, in welchem hier Theorie und Praxis der Ästhetik geschichtlich vor uns auftreten.", "135": "Während Phidias und Polykle't so eben erst ihrem Volke die unerreichten Ideale der plastischen Erhabenheit in ihren Götterbildern gegeben, Sko'pas und Praxi'teles ihnen das Urbild der Schönheit in der schaumgeborenen Göttin der Liebe und die höchste Tra'gik des Menschenshcicksals in der Gruppe der Ni'obe und ihrer Kinder vor die staunenden Augen gestellt, Äschylos und Sophokles den Hellenen die Musterbilder tragischer Kunst geschaffen hatten — sehen wir die Theorie bei Platon in dm Kinderschuhen einer Ästhetik einhergehen, die von dem wahren Verständnisse und der richtigen Würdigung dieser Schöpfungen, um welche alle späteren Jahrhunderte das Hellenenvolk beneidet haben, fast noch weiter entfernt war als wir von der Erreichung derselben entfernt sind!Gegen die Platonische Kunstanshcauug, welche über die gesamte Kunst seines Volkes das Verdammungsurteil aus- sprach und die Hellenen von den Schöpfungen ihrer großen Dichter und Künstler hinweg und über dieselben hinaus auf das „Kunstwerk der Zukunft\" verwies, wie er es in sich zu tragen wähnte, erhob sich nun sein großer Schüler Aristoteles, der, wie überall in seinem Philosophieren, so auch in seiner Anschauung der Kunst stets das Ganze der lebendigen Wirklich­ keit und des wahren Daseins zur Grundlage machte.", "136": "Indem er dm Grundirrtum Platons in dessen Ansicht von der Natur und dem Wesen des Begriffes der Mimesis nachwies, — eines Begriffes, dm auch er an die Spitze seiner Theorie stellte, — warf er alle von der Platonischen Ästhetik gegen die Kunst erhobenen Anklagen über den Haufen und stellte zuerst die Würde und dm Wert der Kunst für alle Zeiten fest auf der Grundlage des philosophischen Gedankens.", "137": "Hatte Platon es der Kunst vorgeworfen, daß sie nur Mimesis der Wirklich­ keit, nur geistige „Nachahmung\" der wirklichen Dinge sei:", "138": "so führte Aristoteles dagegen aus, daß und warum die Kunst gerade deshalb höher stehe als die Wirklichkeit.", "139": "Hatte jener die Tragödie eine Verderberin des sittlichen Charakters genannt, weil sie die Menschen durch die Erregung der Lust an Jammer und Leid verweichliche, so stellte Aristoteles da­ gegen der Tragödie vielmehr die große sittliche Aufgabe, diese Empfindungen in der menschlichen Brust zu läutern und auf ihr richtiges Maß zurückzuführen, den Menschen durch Einsicht in die wahren bestimmten Mächte seines Schicksals zu beruhigen und zu erheben.", "140": "Hatte endlich Platon den schönen Schein gegen die Realität, das Kunstwerk gegen die Wirklichkeit zurückgesetzt, so sprach dagegen Aristoteles die erhabene Wahrheit aus:", "141": "daß die Dichtung gehaltvoller und philosophisch tiefer sei als die Geschichte, daß das echte Kunst­ werk höher stehe als die Wirklichkeit, deren gereinigtes Bild es widerzuspiegeln bestimmt sei.Wie vieles uns auch von dm Aristotelischen Schriften über Dichter und Dichtkunst verloren gegangen sein mag — und es ist mehr als wahrscheinlich, daß wir hier schwere Verluste zu beklagen haben —, die Polemik gegen Platons feindselige Angriffe auf die Kunst und namentlich auf die Poesie, diese Polemik, welche uns alte Schriftsteller bezeugen, ist von dem großen Meister des Gedankens vollständig und mit einer persönlichen Mäßigung geführt worden, wie sie nur bei dem vollen Bewußtsein sieghafter Überlegenheit und bei der Charaktergröße des Mannes möglich war, in welchem ein Alexander noch auf dem schwindelnden Gipfel seines Ruhmes seinen Lehrer und Bildner bewundernd verehrte.", "142": "In dieser ganzen Polemik ist sogar Platons Name nie genannt, sie ist durchaus in reiner Sachlichkeit gehalten, so sehr auch die paradoxe Überschwenglichkeit in Platons Angriffen gegen Poesie und Kunst dm Unwillen und Spott herausforderte.", "143": "Wir werden übrigens in den folgenden Kapiteln dieser Ein­ leitung sehen, daß der Kampf dieser beiden so entgegengesetzten Anschauungsweisen, der Kampf der peripate'tischen Ästhetik gegen die Platonische Ansicht über Kunst und Poesie, Jahr­ hunderte hindurch bis in die spätesten römischen Zeiten fortgedauert hat.Schon aus dem bisher Gesagten dürfte klar geworden sein, in welchem Sinne von Aristoteles das Prinzip der Mime'sis, im Gegensatze zu Platon, als Prinzip der Kunst gefaßt worden ist.Aristoteles geht dabei auf den dem Menschen vor allen lebenden Geschöpfen vorzugsweise eigenen Trieb zur Mimesis zurück, die er hier ganz wörtlich als Nachahmung versteht, wenn er es im vierten Kapitel der Poetik ausspricht:", "144": "Dieser dem Menschen von der Natur eingepflanzte Trieb nach­ zuahmen, verbunden mit der ihm eben so ursprünglich eigenen Freude an dem Produkte der Nachahmung, sei der natürliche Ursprung aller Poesie und somit aller Kunst überhaupt.", "145": "Ich habe in den Bemerkungen zu jener Stelle darauf hingewiesen, daß in dieser Ansicht von dem Triebe der Nachahmung im Menschen und von dem ersten ursprünglichsten, aber auch rohesten Kunstgenusse, welcher in der Vergleichung des Abbildes mit dem Urbilde, des „Nachgeahmten\" mit dem Gegenstande besteht, Aristoteles und Goethe übereinstimmen.", "146": "Allein dies ist nur gleichsam die natürliche Grundlage, auf welcher der philosophische Begriff der Mimesis, der künstlerischen Nach­ ahmung beruht, die nach Aristoteles das Gemeinsame aller schönen Künste ist, welche er sämtlich als Mimesis, als Nach­ ahmung, auffaßt!", "147": "° Der Ausdruck „Nachahmung\", der ein­ zige, welcher dem griechischen Mimesis noch am nächsten kommt, erzeugt aber sogleich bei uns die falsche Vorstellung der Gebundenheit an das Objekt der Nachahmung, der Unfrei­ heit, der Abwesenheit des Selbstschöpferischen in dem nach­ ahmenden Künstler.", "148": "Aber wir haben leider kein Wort, das in so naiver Einfachheit, und so allgemein anerkannt und verständlich wie das griechische, die künstlerische Thätigkeit und das gemeinsame Wesen aller künstlerischen Hervor- bringungen bezeichnete.", "149": "Die Griechen hatten ohnehin, wenn sie die höchste aller Künste, die Poesie, als Mimesis, als Nachahmung, faßten, stets das lebendige Theater im Auge, durch welches ihnen, wie schon der Engländer Twinning\" richtig bemerkt hat, dieser Begriff der Kunst als Nachahmung sinnlich vor Augen gestellt und vermittelt wurde.", "150": "Wir müssen uns also, wie in der Übersetzung geschehen, mit mehreren Ausdrücken und abwechselnden Umschreibungen, wie „nach­ ahmend darstellen\", „nachbilden\", „bilden\", „nachahmend schaffen\" u. s. w. zu helfen suchen.", "151": "Denn um es kurz zu sagen:", "152": "die Thätigkeit des Künstlers ist allerdings ein nachahmendes Bilden insofern, als sie überall ein Objektives, sei es nun ein sinnliches oder geistiges, voraussetzt, dessen Bild sie hervorbringen will.", "153": "Bleiben wir zunächst bei der Poesie stehen, so sind es Menschen und menschliche Empfindungen, welche dieses Objektive ausmachen.", "154": "Aber auch die eigentlich bildenden Künste — Plastik und Malerei — haben es mit einem, sei es in der Natur oder in der Vorstellung Gegebenen, zu thun, wie die Musik es mit objektiven Empfindungen zu thun hat, denen sie sinn­ lichen Ausdruck zu geben (d. h. antik gesprochen, die sie „nachzuahmen\") strebt.", "155": "Wir haben gesehen, durch welchen logischen Irrtum Platon dahinkam, das so von dem Künstler, dem „Nachahmer\" hervorgebrachte Bild als das Bild des Bildes von einem Bilde anzusehm und das Werk des Künstlers damit zugleich tief unter das reale Vor­ bild, ja das Kunstwerk unter das Produkt des gemeinen Handwerkers zu setzen.", "156": "Diese Verirrung Platons aufgedeckt und gezeigt zu haben, daß das Kunstwerk vielmehr über der Realität stehe, 'daß durch die künstlerische Thätigkeit die Realität gereinigt und geistig verklärt werde, ist Aristoteles unsterbliches Verdienst.", "157": "Denn dieses nachahmende Bilden des Künstlers ist zugleich ein freies Schaffen, sein Nach­ schaffen ein veredelndes Umschaffen, und der Dichter ist zum Beispiel selbst da frei schöpferisch und muß es sein, wo seine Dichtung ein objektiv gegebenes, ein historisch Bestimmtes behandelt.", "158": "Er muß es sein, weil die Mimesis, die Thätig­ keit, deren Produkt und Ausdruck das Kunstwerk ist, eben eine geistige ist, die es zu thun hat mit der Darstellung des Ewigen, Wesentlichen und Notwendigen gegenüber der mit den Schlacken der Zufälligkeit und Unwesentlichkeit behafteten Realität des Natur-Objektes.", "159": "Diese höhere Wahrheit des künstlerischen Scheins, diese ideale Wahrheit des Kunstzwecks hatte der geistreiche Sophist Go'rgias im Auge, als er nach der Manier seiner Zeit sein Urteil über die Tragödie in dem Ausspruch pointierte:", "160": "„sie sei freilich eine Täuschung (ä^), ein Schein, aber ein solcher, der denjenigen, welchem er gelinge, über den stelle, dem er nicht gelinge, und bei dem der Getäuschte weiser (sv-xw-repo;", "161": ") und gebildeter ershceine als der nicht Getäuschte\".''", "162": "Die höchste Stufe dieser Thätigkeit des Geistes, welche Aristoteles als das künstlerishce Nachahmen bezeichnet, ist die des tragischen Dichters und das höchste Kunstwerk ebendeshalb die Tragödie.", "163": "Denn der tragische Dichter schildert das Leben selbst in seiner höchsten Steigerung, seine Dichtung ist Mimesis, d. h. künstlerische Darstellung des handelnden Lebens und seiner Folgen, Darstellung einer ernsten, bedeutungsvollen Handlung, welche ihr Ziel in sich selber hat (irpsk« «x-c»).", "164": "„Das Leben aber ist\", wie Aristo­ teles einmal sagt, „selbst Handlung.\"", "165": "Auch der tragische Dichter hat also ein Objektives, das er „nachahmt\", das Leben.", "166": "Aber dies Nachahmen ist kein Kopieren im Sinne des deutschen Ausdrucks;", "167": "und die ganze Poetik des Aristoteles ist in ihrem wesentlichsten Bestandteile, in der Lehre von der Tragödie, nichts anderes als der erklärende Nachweis der freien schöpferischen Thätigkeit des Dichters und der Erhabenheit seines Werkes über der Realität des objektiv Gegebenen.", "168": "— Dieser Nachweis, der sich in den berühmten Worten, welche das Verhältnis von Poesie und Geschichte zueinander aus­ sprechen, zu epigramma'tischer Schärfe zuspitzt, gibt sich eben so klar in dem Satze kund:", "169": "daß der epische Dichter nur in der Darstellung des Objektiven, niemals aber da „Nachahmer\" sei, wo er in eigener Person spreche und seine Gedanken, seine Gefühle aus sich herausstelle.So gefaßt, erscheint der ganze Streit über eine von Aristoteles gepredigte Lehre von der direkten „Naturnach­ ahmung\" in der Kunst vollständig als ein müßiger.", "170": "Denn nichts kann thörichter und lächerlicher sein, als wenn der Naturalismus und Realismus in der Kunst es sich bei­ kommen lassen, sich auf die Autorität des großen alten Denkers zu berufen, der wie kein anderer die schöpferische Freiheit des Geistes und die ideale Erhabenheit des Kunstwerks über die Realität, die künstlerische Wahrheit über die materiell äußerliche Wahrheit, die Erhabenheit endlich des von dem kunstbegabten Menschengeiste erschaffenen schönen Scheins über die objektive Realität des Naturschönen für alle Zeiten festgestellt hat.", "171": "—Die Aristotelische Lehre von der Wirkung der Tragödie oder, wie er selbst sich ausdrückt, von der abschließlich durch die Tragödie bewirkten Katharsis der Pathemata des Mit­ leids und der Furcht in den Hörern und Zuschauern, ist wesentlich eine Polemik, ein Protest gegen die Platonische Auffassung der Tragödie, wie denn die ganze Aristotelische Poetik als eine solche Polemik des Philosophen gegen seinen großen Lehrmeister angesehen werden muß und allen An­ deutungen nach auch von den Zeitgenossen und von dem späteren Altertum angesehen worden ist.Platon hatte in seinem abstrakt sittlichen Radikalismus, vor welchem selbst ein Äschylos und Sophokles, geschweige den ein Euripides, nicht bestehen konnten, als ein echter Fanatiker der Idee, die gesamte dramatische Poesie, die Ko­ mödie nicht minder wie die Tragödie, aus seinem Jdeal­ staate verbannt.", "172": "Er stand mit dieser seiner Feindschaft gegen Dramen und Theater genau auf dem Standpunkte des zelotischen Puritanismus und des gegen beide eifernden Christentums der Götze und Konsorten.", "173": "Wenn man die Hauptstelle seiner Polemik gegen das Drama und die Tra­ gödie im zehnten Buche vom Staate! genau betrachtet, so läuft die Begründung seines verwerfenden Urteils auf fol­ gende Sätze hinaus:", "174": "„Die Tragödie, weit entfernt, den Menschen sittlich zu bilden und zu kräftigen, demoralisiert ihn vielmehr;", "175": "denn während es darauf ankommt, ihn gegen Leiden und Leidenschaften zu stählen und tapfer zu machen, verweichlicht sie ihn, indem sie die Empfindung des Mitleids (-rv e mit dem allgemeinen Menschenlose in ihm nährt und großzieht und nicht nur dieser, sondern allen anderen Leidenschaften Thor und Thür öffnet.", "176": "Der Zuhörer und Zu­ schauer der Tragödie und der Komödie leidet Schaden an seiner Seele, und selbst der Beste kann sich ihres schädlichen Ein­ flusses kaum erwehren.", "177": "Denn was wir im Leben nur mit Mühe in uns zügeln, die Neigung zu unmäßigem Schmerz­ und Trauergefühl (ex-o«) auf der einen und die Neigung zu leichtsinniger Verlachung menschlicher Dinge 0° 7?x<>r<») auf der anderen Seite, das erhält dort durch die Tragödie, hier durch die Komödie Nahrung und Förderung.", "178": "Wir überlassen uns dem schrankenlosen Mitgefühl mit dem Leidenden um so mehr, da wir uns sagen, daß es ja fremde Zustände und Leiden sind, an denen wir teilnehmen, und da die Leidenden als gute und unserer Teilnahme würdige Menschen vom Dichter dargestellt werden.", "179": "Aber die fremden Zustände haben Einfluß auf den eigenen Zustand des Menschen, und die Lust an Leid und Klage, die er bei jenen in sich aufgenährt hat, wird er bei den eigenen Leiden gleichfalls nicht mehr zui zügeln vermögen.", "180": "\"", "181": "Zum Schlüsse dieses seines Verwerfungsurteils, mit dem er gegen die gesamte öffentliche Meinung seines Volkes und seiner Zeit in der schneidendsten Opposition zu stehen sich bewußt war, fordert nun Platon, dem doch einigermaßen bei seiner Gottähnlichkeit bange zu werden scheint, die Freunde der Poesie auf, dieselbe gegen seine Angriffe mit philosophischen Gründen zu verteidigen und „nicht nur dm Genuß, den sie gewähre, sondem auch ihre Heilsamkeit für das staat- liche Gemeinwesen, ihren Nutzen und ihre versittlichende Einwirkung auf das Leben der Menschen nachzu­ weisen\".", "182": "2Unter denen, welche den so hingeworfenen Fehdehand­ schuh aufnahmen — und es müssen derselben im Altertume viele und sehr leidenschaftliche gewesen sein, wie eine von Bernays angeführte Stelle aus Pro'klos' Vorlesungen über Platons Politei'a andeutet' —, steht nun Aristoteles in seiner Poetik oben an.", "183": "Und zwar bezeugt derselbe Proklos ausdrücklich, daß der Nachweis der versittlichenden Wir- kung des Dramas und der Tragödie der Hauptpunkt in dem Kampfe gegen Platons ungerechte Verwerfung ge­ wesen sei.", "184": "Dieser Ausgangspunkt wie ihn Proklos nennt) enthält aber zugleich den Zielpunkt des ästhetischen Philosophierens bei Aristoteles, dm höchsten Gesichtspunkt, aus welchem er in die Politik die Musik, wie schließlich in der Poetik die Tragödie betrachtet hat, — denn für die Komödie fehlt uns in der heutigen verstümmelt erhaltenen Poetik des Philosophen dieser Nachweis.", "185": "Jener Ausgangs­ und Zielpunkt aber ist die na-Sel«, die sittliche und geistige Kultur des Menschen, überhaupt die Veredelung des ganzen Menschen.", "186": "^Aus diesem in sich notwendigen und obenein vom Altertum ausdrücklich bezeugten Zusammenhange der Aristo­ telischen und der Platonischen Lehre von der Wirkung der Tragödie geht nun zunächst unwidersprechlich hervor, daß und in welcher Weise die Aristotelische Auffassung der Tra­ gödie der Platonischen entgegentrat, nämlich als diametraler Gegensatz.", "187": "Platon hatte den Haupthebel und das Haupt- mittel der tragischen Dichtung, das kXes? uud erset t, das Mitleid und Mitleidswerte, als Grund der verderblichen demoralisierenden Wirkung auf den Zushcauer und Zuhörer bezeichnet.", "188": "Es war also die Aufgabe des Aristoteles, den Nachweis zu führen, daß gerade dieses Element der Tragödie, zu dem er noch das ihm zunächst verwandte des e und des pa?es-dv, der Furcht und des Furchtbaren, gesellte, das­ jenige sei, mittelst dessen die Tragödie, wenn der Dichter es richtig anwende, ihre versittlichende und läuternde Wirkung auf den Menschen übe.", "189": "Dieser Nachweis aber ist die Aristo­ telische Lehre von der Katharsis der Pathemata, von der Reinigung der Leidempfindungen und der Leideindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht in den Gemütern der Zuschauer und Zuhörer der Tragödie, d. h. der wahren und echten, ihrem Begriffe entsprechenden Tragödie, wie ihn Aristoteles eben in der Poetik festgestellt und ausgeführt hat.Man hat neuerdings unternommen, an dieser Auf­ fassungsweise des historisch begründeten Sachverhältnisses zu rütteln und dem Aristoteles eine Erklärung seiner Katharsis unterzuschieben, nach welcher er als Wirkung der Tragödie nichts weniger als eine sittliche Läuterung, eine erziehende und bildende Kraft Statt-sieh, sondern lediglich und allein nur eine durch Erregung von Mitleid und Furcht bewirkte er­ leichternde Auslassung und gleichsam therapeutische Entladung solcher (mitleidigen und furchtsamen) Gemüthsaffektionen aufgestellt haben sollte.", "190": "° Wir können indessen von einem direkten Eingehen auf diese mit großem Scharfsinne verfochtene Paradoxie um so mehr absehen, da eine Wiederlegung dersel­ ben in einer eigenen Schrift von uns gegeben worden ist.", "191": "\"Aristo'teles* selbst hat seine Lehre von der Katha'rfis der tragischen Pathe'matad.", "192": "h. der leidvollen Eindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht, welche wir durch die Tragödie empfangen, an seine Lehre von der kathartischen Wirkung der Musik angeknüpft, deren er im achten Buche seiner Politik erwähnt und zwar mit dem Zusätze erwähnt, „daß er über das, was er unter Katharsis verstehe, deutlicher und aus­ führlicher in der Poetik zu handeln gedenke\".", "193": "Aus diesem Zusätze geht nun zwar unwidersprechlich hervor, daß Aristoteles selbst die in der Politik gegebenen Andeutungen nicht für aus­ reichend erachtete, um den Begriff dessen, was er mit Katharsis bezeichnete, in seinem vollen Umfange zu verstehen.", "194": "Aber dennoch ist es wichtig, seine Lehre von der Wirkung der Musik, wie er sie in der Politik entwickelt, im Zusammenhange zu betrachten, weil aus dieser Betrachtung eben so klar hervorgeht, daß auch die kathartische Wirkung, welche Aristoteles der Musik (d. h. einer gewissen Art von Musik, nicht aller Musik über­ haupt) beilegt, als eine sittlich bildende und veredelnde, also eine läuternde und reinigende gedacht ist.", "195": "Hier hat nun L. Spengel in seiner zuvor angeführten Abhandlung ^ zunächst unwiderleglich nachgewiesen, daß die Katharsis (x-Ä-p?-:", "196": ") als kein für sich bestehender besonderer Zweck der Musik, sondern als eng verbunden mit dem Zwecke der Bildung (der n-iSst-) von Aristoteles gefaßt ist, daß beide Begriffe sich gegenseitig erläutern und ergänzen.", "197": "Derselbe Gelehrte hat ferner den Nachweis geführt, daß der Ausdruck „Katharsis\" (x-Napa-c) schon vor Aristoteles nicht bloß auf dem Gebiete der Religion und der Medizin — dort als religiöse weihende Reinigung, hier als Ableitung und Ausscheidung des über­ flüssigen oder schädlichen Stoffes aus dem Organismus — sondern auch als philosophischer Te'rminus im Gebrauch war und in letzterer Beziehung eine sittliche Läuterung, ein Besser- werden des Menschen, ein Fortschreiten zur Tugend im antiken Sinne der Tugend und Tüchtigkeit bedeutete.", "198": "° Wenn nun Aristoteles in der Politik diejenige Katharsis, welche leicht hingerissene und erregbare Gemüther durch gewisse Liederweisen erfahren, und überhaupt die angenehme Erleichte­ rung, welche allen Menschen mehr oder weniger durch eine gewisse Art von Musik zu teil wird, Vergleichungsweise eine Kur nennt, so ist dies Gleichnis eben kein anderes, als dasjenige, welches Goethe anwendete, wenn er seine Werther- dichtung, wie überhaupt fast alle seine Dichtungen, als Her­ stellungs- und Erleichterungsmittel, als sittliche „Hausmittel\", bezeichnete.\"", "199": "In dieser Herstellung aus einem krankhaften und getrübten Seelenzustande zu derjenigen geistigen Gesund­ heit, deren der Mensch zur Ausübung der Werke der Tugend unumgänglich bedarf, besteht nach Aristoteles die hauptsächlich erziehende und bildende Kraft der Musik.", "200": "Die Musik kann und soll nach Aristoteles bessernd und bildend auf Geist und Gemüt einwirken, und sie ist eben dadurch ein so wichtiges Bildungs- und Erziehungsmittel, weil sie ergreisender und lebendiger als die bildende Kunst naturähnliche Darstellungen der Affekte und der geistigen und sittlichen Tüchtigkeits­ eigenschaften (der naSy und der -hn-l) zu geben vermag und weil es nur der richtigen Gewöhnung bedarf, um durch sie den Menschen in seinem Innersten zu ergreifen und zu wecken\".", "201": "Auf diese frühe Gewöhnung des Menschen an die richtige Beurteilung und Handhabung aller Affekte:", "202": "Freude, Liebe, Haß, Mitleid, Trauer u. s. f. legt daher Aristoteles einen Hauptnachdruck in seiner musikalischen Erziehungslehre.", "203": "Der Mensch soll lernen, in seinem Empfinden über das Gute und Böse richtig zu unterscheiden;", "204": "er soll sich gewöhnen, an sittlich guten Gesinnungsarten G-s-v) und an ihren entsprechenden sittlich schönen Handlungen seine Freude zu haben, weil er sie dann, da die Tugend nicht im Wissen, sondern im Handeln besteht, auch selbst im Leben ausüben wird.", "205": "Denn die Gewohnheit, im ideellen Gebiete der Kunst nur an dem Ausdrucke des Guten, Edlen und Schönen seine Freude zu haben, ist die unmittelbare Vorstufe zu einem ähnlichen Verhalten in der Wirklichkeit.Dies ist die klare und einfache Ansicht des Aristoteles von der musikalischen Katharsis, d. h. von der versittlichenden Kraft und Wirkung, welche der richtig angewandten Musik inne­ wohnt.\"", "206": "Die durch die Musik bewirkte Katharsis führt die Seele „zu jener wirklich harmonischen, gleichmäßigen Stimmung, wie sie Aristoteles als Grundlage aller Moralität fordert\" das ist der Kern der Aristotelischen Lehre von der kathartischen Wir­ kung der Musik, und so hat diese Lehre, wie Spengel aus Pluta'rch ^ nachgewiesen hat, auch das Altertum verstanden.Die Lehre von der tragischen Katharsis, d. h. von der in der Tragödie durch deren zwei Haupthebel Mitleid und Furcht abschließlich und letztlich bewirktm Läuterungen dieser im Zuschauer erregten Leidempfindungen ist nun nichts weiter als eine Anwendung dessen, was in der Politik von der kathartischen Kraft und Wirkung der Musik gesagt worden ist, auf das ungleich höhere Gebiet der Poesie und ihrer höchsten Form:", "207": "der Tragödie.Daß wir es mit einer sittlichen Wirkung, mit einer den Menschen erhebenden, läuternden Einwirkung in dieser Lehre des Aristoteles zu thun haben, ist nach dem bisher über die Aristotelische Lehre von der musikalischen Katharsis Ent­ wickelten wohl eine unbestreitbare Thatsache.", "208": "Platon hatte die Tragödie als schädlich und unsittlich auf den Menschen wirkend angeklagt und ihre Freunde herausgefordert, seine philosophische Beweisführung mit gleichen Waffen zu wider­ legen.", "209": "Wenn Aristoteles diese Herausforderung annahm, — und er hat sie angenommen, und das Zeugnis des Pro'klos sagt ausdrücklich, daß seine ganze Lehre von der Tragödie auf eine Widerlegung Platons gestellt war — so mußte das Resultat seiner Theorie der Tragödie der Gegensatz zur Platonischen sein, er mußte den philosophischen Nachweis führen, daß die Tragödie sittlich veredelnd wirke;", "210": "und diese sittlich veredelnde Wirkung mußte schon in der Definition des Wesens der Tragödie (in dem s?-»- oü-c«), wie er sie im vierten Kapitel der Poetik aufstellt, enthalten sein.Und so ist es in der That.", "211": "Die Katharsis, welche Aristoteles der Tragödie zuschreibt, ist, wie die musikalische, sittlicher und versittlichender Art.Es ist möglich und selbst wahrscheinlich, daß Aristoteles den Begriff der Katharsis in der unverstümmelten Poetik ausführlicher behandelt, daß er eine übersichtliche Entwickelung dieses Begriffs, inwiefern er überhaupt bei aller Kunst in Anwendung komme, gegeben haben mag.", "212": "Aber es ist unnütz, sich darüber den Kopf zu zerbrechen, da der Verlust dieses Ka­ pitels, wenn dasselbe existierte, ein unwiederbringlicher und da — was die Hauptsache ist — die Poetik des Philosophen auch in ihrer jetzigen lückenhaften Gestalt noch ausreichende Mittel an die Hand gibt, um die in der Definition der Tragödie ausgesprochene Wirkung der Tragödie genügend zu erklären.", "213": "Daß Aristoteles aber in seiner Poetik die Ausführung dessen, „was er unter Katharsis verstehe\", auf die Poetik versparte, hatte seinen guten Grund.", "214": "Denn eben in der Poesie, und zwar in der Tragödie, welche in der Darstellung des Mitleids- würdigen und Furchtbaren (der iXee-vc- und Poßep-e) sich nicht wie die Musik des unbestimmten Tones, sondern des deut­ lichen Wortes bedient und so nicht bloß zum Herzen und Gemüt, sondern auch zum Verstände und Geiste spricht, mußte die kathartische, d. h. die versittlichende Wirkung, die Aristoteles schon der Musik zuschreibt, in ihrer höchsten Potenz\" und in voller Klarheit zur Erscheinung kommen, weil hier die bewußte Einsicht an die Stelle des Gefühls, das begreifende Verständnis der Abbilder des Geistigen an die Stelle der bloßen Gewöhnung an das Sittliche und Harmonische tritt.", "215": "Die Tragödie, die den Menschen, den Zuhörer, dem allge­ meinen Menschengeschicke gegenüberstellt, wie es sich in der verhängnisvollen Verkettung von der Schuld und ihren Folgen, von Fehl und Srafe geltend macht, die Tragödie, die es mit den sittlichen Mächten des Lebens zu thun hat, sie kann nicht — am wenigsten im antiken Sinne — abstrahieren von der sittlichen Wirkung auf dm Zushcauer und Zuhörer, kann es um so weniger, als das ganze Altertum überwiegend den Dichter als Lehrer der Sittlichkeit angesehen hat.", "216": "Schon in dieser unwidersprechlichen Thatsache\" ist, abgesehen von allen anderen zwingenden Gründen, die Auffassung der tra­ gischen Katharsis, der Wirkung der Tragödie als einer sitt­ lichen gegeben, zumal da Aristoteles in der Poetik als ein Verteidiger der Tragödie gegen Platon auftritt.", "217": "Für jene Thatsache selbst, für die Ansicht des Altertums von dem Berufe des wahren Dichters, ein Lehrer und Bildner seines Volks zur Sittlichkeit zu sein, genügt es, auf die Ausführungen zu verweisen, welche in den zuvor angeführten Schriften gegeben sind.", "218": "Hier will ich nur noch ein dort übergangenes Zeugnis eines alten Schriftstellers nachtragen, das um so mehr ins Gewicht fällt, als es ein Peripate'tiker der späteren Zeit ist, welcher dm alten Kampf zwischen den Plato'nikern und Aristote'likern wieder aufnimmt.", "219": "Der griechische Geograph Stra'bon, welcher unter Augustus lebte, kritisiert in dem ersten Buche seines großen grundlegenden Werkes einen Ausspruch seines Vorgängers Erato'sthenes, den er freilich als Philo­ sophen sehr niedrig stellt, indem er ihn „ein Mittelding\" nennt „zwischen einem, der philosophieren möchte, und einem, der es doch nicht wage, sich dieser Beschäftigung ganz hin­ zugeben\".^", "220": "Erato'sthenes hatte den Ausspruch gethan:", "221": "„alle Dichtung habe nur Gemütsergötzuug, nicht geistige Bildung zum Zwecke\".", "222": "Strabon bestreitet dies zunächst durch die Autorität der allgemeinen Ansicht seiner Nation.", "223": "„Im Gegenteil\", sagt er, „nennen die Alten nnd alle Einsichtsvollen, welche gründlich über die Dichtkunst gesprochen haben, die Poesie eine Art Vorschule der Philosophie, die uns vom Knabenalter an in das Leben einführe und uns unter Er­ götzung Sitten, Gefühle und Handlungen lehre.\"", "224": "Daher unterrichte man auch in den hellenischen Städten die Jugend zunächst in der Dichtkunst, sicher nicht einer bloßen Ergötzung, sondern der daraus hervorgehenden Bildung zur Weisheit und Einsicht wegen, „da ja\" — fährt er fort — „selbst die Lehrer der Musik, welche die Jugend im Singen und in der Instrumentalmusik unterrichten, sich dasselbe Verdienst zu­ sprechen, denn sie behaupten, Erzieher und Veredler der Sitten zu sein.\"", "225": "Freilich sei es Übertreibung, wenn manche Leute im Homer alle Wissenschaft und Kunst enthalten glaubten, aber es sei eben Übertreibung eines an sich Richtigen.\"So finden wir also bei Strabon, der die Aristotelische Philosophie studiert hatte, den alten Streit über Wert und Würde der Poesie und ihrer Wirkung erneut, der zu Platons und Aristoteles'", "226": "Zeit die Geister so lebhaft beschäftigt hatte.", "227": "Eratosthenes vertritt die Platonische Ansicht in ihrer ganzen einseitigen Strenge.", "228": "Strabon dagegen steht ganz auf Aristo­ telischem Standpunkte.", "229": "Ihm ist die Poesie „diejenige Kunst, welche das Leben durch Rede nachbildet\".", "230": "Dies könne aber nur derjenige leisten, der das Leben in allen Tiefen kenne;", "231": "und damit erhebt sich der alte wackere Ra­ tionalist zu der erhabenen Wahrheit der Ansicht:", "232": "daß im Dichter die edelste geistige und sittliche Bildung des Menschen die Voraussetzung der Trefflichkeit des wahren und echten Dichters sei.", "233": "Dieser ganze Satz, der, wie die vorherigen, dm innersten Kern Aristotelischer Lehre ausspricht, lautet in der schlichten Ausdrucksweise der Alten:", "234": "„Diese Kunst, das Leben durch Rede nachzubilden, wie könnte sie ausüben ein des Lebens Unkundiger und Unverständiger?", "235": "Denn die Trefflichkeit des Dichters beurteilen wir nicht wie etwa die der Zimmerleute 2° oder Erzarbeiter;", "236": "— diese hängt freilich nicht mit Schönheit und Würde zusammen;", "237": "dagegen die Trefflichkeit des Dichters ist innig verbunden mit der des Menschen, und es ist nicht möglich, daß der ein guter Dichter werde, der nicht schon vorher ein guter Mensch war!\"Über die sittliche Wirkung der Musik, welche Aristoteles mit dem Ausdrucke Katharsis bezeichnet, sind wir durch die Aufschlüsse, welche der Philosoph über das Wie? derselben in seiner Politik gegeben hat, vollkommen im klaren.", "238": "Die Musik, richtig angewendet, bildet nach seiner Ansicht Geist und Herz der Jugend durch Gewöhnung an das Harmonische, Geordnete, Maßvolle, während sie dm Leidenschaften des gereisteren Alters befreiende Erleichterung schafft von der Übermacht des leidenschaftlichen Empfindens und so das ge­ störte Gleichmaß der Seele wieder herstellt.", "239": "Dagegen über das Wie? der sittlichen Wirkung, welche Aristoteles die Katharsis der Pathe'mata von Mitleid und Furcht in der Tagödie nennt, fehlt uns nach der allgemeinen Ansicht die Erklärung, fehlt jedenfalls eine direkt ausge­ sprochene Erklärung des Philosophen.", "240": "Wir wissen nur so viel, daß diese Katharsis, diese Wirkung der Tragödie durch die von ihr in Bewegung gesetzten Hebel des Mitleids und der Furcht eine sittliche, daß sie nicht, wie Platon behauptet hatte, eine die Seele des Zuhörers verweichlichende, demorali­ sierende, sondern eine kräftigende, erhebende sein soll;", "241": "daß die Empfindungen des Mitleids und der Furcht, welche der tragische Dichter durch seine Dichtung im Zuschauer hervor­ ruft oder, um ganz genau zu reden, die schmerzvollen Ein­ drücke (Pathemata), welche die Zuschauer und Zuhörer oder auch selbst schon die Leser durch die Tragödie empfangen, schließlich durch die Dichtung selbst gereinigt und geläutert werden und daß diese Reinigung zum Wesen der wahren und echten Tragödie gehört, um deren Begriff es sich handelt.Das Kapitel der Poetik, in welchem\" Aristoteles sich über die Katharsis ausführlich ausgesprochen hat, fehlt uns und mit ihm, wie es scheint, der Schlüssel, welcher uns das Verständnis dieses Teiles der Definition zu vollkommner Klarheit erschließen könnte.", "242": "Indessen findet sich doch in den erhaltenen Kapiteln über die Tragödie noch Material genug, um nns für die Erklärung der Katharsis einen Nachschlüssel zu machen.", "243": "Sehen wir uns zunächst die Worte der Definition der Tragödie im sechsten Kapitel genauer an, so finden wir in den Worten „durh cMitleid und Furcht\" die wesentliche Inhaltsbestimmung der Tragödie ausgedrückt;", "244": "denn die Worte „die nachahmende Darstellung, welche Tragödie heißt — voll­ bringt durch Mitleid und Furcht die Katharsis der Pathemata dieser Art\" können nichts anderes bedeuten und bedeuten in der That nichts anderes als:", "245": "Mitleid und Furcht sind die notnendigen Elemente der tragischen Handlung, sind die Hebel, welche der Dichter durch seine Darstellung in Bewegung setzen muß, um die spezifische Wirkung, welche die Tragödie abschließlich ausübt, hervorzubringen.", "246": "Welches Gewicht Aristo­ teles auf diese Fundamentalbestimmung der Tragödie legt, sieht man deutlich aus dem Umstände, daß er wiederholt auf dieselbe zurückkommt und sie mehr als einmal den Dichtem einschärft.", "247": "Gleich im neunten Kapitel^ heißt es:", "248": "die tra­ gische Dichtung hat es nicht nur mit einer Handlung zu thun, welche in sich abgeschlossen ist, sondern mit dem, was furcht­ bar und mitleidswert ist;", "249": "das heißt, wie er im elften Kapitel^ mit ausdrücklicher Verweisung auf seine Definition erklärend sagt:", "250": "„Diejenigen Handlungen, deren nachahmende Darstellung nach unserer Definition die Tragödie ist, sind solche, welche Mitleid und Furcht (im Zushcauer und Zuhörer)

zu der Läuterung und Reinigung der Pathemata von Mitleid und Furcht, von welcher Aristoteles in der Definition uns gesagt hat, daß die Tragödie sie abschließlich vollbringe.", "254": "Denn was ein

Aufgabe bezeichnet aber Aristoteles in seiner Definition die Katharsis der Pathemata, die Reinigung der durch die Tragödie, durch die Kunst des Dichters in dem Hörer wachgerufenen leidvollen Empfindungen von Mitleid und Furcht.Was lehrt mm Aristoteles über die Mittel und Wege (über das n<wev), durch welche diese der Tragödie eigentümliche Leistung bewirkt werden kann?", "256": "„", "257": "Wir haben gezeigt,\" sagt er, „daß die Verknüpfung der Thatsachen, die Sy'nthesis, die Komposition der Handlung in der ästhetisch vollendetsten Tragödie nicht einfach, sondern verwickelt sein muß, so wie daß die Tragödie Darstellung furchtbarer und mitleiderregender Vorfälle ist, denn\" — zum dritten Male schärft der Philosoph dies ein — „denn dies ist das Eigentümliche dieser Kunstgattung.", "258": "Aus diesen beiden Bestimmungen ergibt sich zunächst, daß in der Tragödie weder absolut tugendhafte Männer^, aus Glück in Unglück geratend, vorgestellt werden dürfen, — denn das ist weder Furcht noch Mitleid zu erwecken geeignet, sondern bloß gräßlich — noch Nichtswürdige aus Unglück in Glück, denn das ist das alleruntragischste.", "259": "Ein solcher Fall hat nämlich gar nichts von dem, was ein tragischer Fall haben soll, denn er erregt weder unsere allgemeinmenschliche Teilnahme, noch unser Mitleid, noch unsere Furcht.", "260": "Drittens darf auch nicht der absolut Schlechte aus Glück in Unglück geraten;", "261": "denn eine solche Komposition kann zwar wohl möglicherweise unsere allgemeinmenschliche Teilnahme in Anspruch nehmen, aber weder Mitleid noch Furcht in uns erwecken.", "262": "Denn unser Mitleid gilt dem, der sein Unglück nicht voll verdient, während unsere Furcht einen Gegenstand verlangt, der unseres- gleichen ist;", "263": "darum ist ein solcher Ausgang in der Tragödie weder unser Mitleid noch unsere Furcht zu erwecken geeignet.", "264": "Es bleibt also nur noch als tragischer Held ein solcher übrig, der zwischen jenen beiden (d. i. zwischen dem durchaus Tugendhaften und dem durchaus Schlechten, zwischen Engel und Teufel, wie wir sagen würden,) in der Mitte steht.", "265": "Ein solcher aber ist derjenige, der, während er einer­ seits weder durch Tugend und Gerechtigkeit über der Mensch­ heit steht, doch andererseits auch wieder nicht durch Schlechtig­ keit und Verruchtheit aus Glück in Unglück gerät, sondern durch irgend einen Fehltritt;", "266": "und zwar einer von denen, die in großem Ansehen und Glücke sich befinden, wie Ö'dipus und Thye'stes und andere hervorragende Männer solcher vor­ nehmen Geschlechter.\"", "267": "Über den „Fehltritt\" d. i. die tragische Schuld), der das Schicksal des Helden herbei­ führe, bemerkt Aristoteles dann weiterhin, daß derselbe jeden­ falls nicht unbedeutend sein dürfe, daß er vielmehr wesentlich ins Gewicht fallen^, daß aber der tragische Held selbst doch in der Stufenleiter zwischen ausgezeichneter Vortrefflichkeit und überwiegender Schlechtigkeit „eher höher als niedriger stehen müsse\".", "268": "„", "269": "Diese Art der Tragödie also,\" fährt Aristoteles fort, „deren Komposition ich soeben beschrieben habe, ist, mit dem Maßstabe des Begriffs der Kunst gemessen, die schönste.\"", "270": "Er meint diejenige, in welcher der Held, ein Mensch, wie er ihn so eben geschildert hat, ein Wesen, in welchem wir unseres- gleichen erkennen, durch irgend einen bedeutungsvollen Fehl aus Glück in Unglück gerät.", "271": "Dagegen verwirft er jene zweite Art der tragischen Komposition, welcher andere Ästhetiker, wie er hinzusetzt, dm ersten Rang anwiesen,

hier diejenigen anzapft, Dichter wie Philosophen, welche die Tragödie zur nackten Moralpredigt, das Theater zum moralischen Korrekttonshause machten — „gilt als die erste wegen der Schwächlichkeit des Publikums, welcher sich die Poeten akkommodieren.", "272": "Aber diese Befriedigung (HTovH), welche wir empfinden, wenn die Guten schließlich für ihre Leiden belohnt und die Schlechten für ihre

warnende Beispiele vorhält.", "274": "An die Jämmer­ lichkeit einer solchen Wirkung durch die erhabene Kunst der Tragödie hat der tiefsinnigste der alten Denker mit seiner Lehre von der Katharsis der

B. an dem Helden, der den Todesstreich empfängt, oder bei einem O'dipus in dem Momente der furchtbaren Ent- hüllung des Abgrundes, in den er gestürzt ist, wir können uns an Sprache und Spiel einer Mede'a, die ihre Kinder gemordet hat, auf der Bühne oder bei der Lesung sogar be­ wundernd erfreuen, — erfreuen, eben weil die Darstellung des Dichters und die Aktion des Schauspielers so ganz

Unglück, das ja für sie niemals ein wahres Unglück ist, nicht zu erschütternder Charaktere Gerechtigkeit widerfahren lassen konnte\" ^ und der sich also durchaus auf dem von Lessing bekämpften Standpunkte des christlichen Trauerspiels mit seinen makellosen Helden befand, welche, über die Menschlichkeit erhaben, den Menschen würdige Vorbilder des Handelns und Leidens sein sollten.", "316": "Aristoteles dagegen stellt sich mit seiner Theorie der Tragödie auf den rein menschlichen Standpunkt.", "317": "Nach ihm soll freilich die Tragödie ein Abbild der Menschheit in ihrer erhabenen und edleren Gestaltung geben, aber doch immer ein lebenswahres, menschliches Abbild, das uns in den handelnden und leidenden, irrenden und büßenden Helden stets Menschen vorführt, Menschen, denen wir uns ver­ wandt und ähnlich fühlen, mit denen wir Mitgefühl, für die wir Furcht empfinden können, weil wir selbst uns be­ wußt sind, daß ihre Fehler auch von uns begangen werden, ihre Leiden auch uns treffen können.", "318": "Darum stellt es Aristoteles als eine Hauptforderung hin:", "319": "daß in der Tra- gödie eine Schuld, ein „Fehl\", und zwar ein bedeutender, Ursache sei von dem Unglücksausgange des tragischen Helden, dm wir als einen notwendigen begreifen sollen.", "320": "Und wenn er daneben doch auch wieder ideale Haltung und Er­ habenheit der Charaktere und Gestalten der Tragödie über das gemeine und alltägliche Maß sittlicher Größe ^ fordert, so thut er dies in der richtigen Ansicht, daß sittliche Erhaben­ heit im Unglück mehr als alles Andere unser Mitgefühl (sxeo«) steigert, während sie zugleich durch ihre Kraft erhebend auf unser Gemüt wirkt.\"", "321": "Und hier hat Aristoteles sogar den Begriff der Erhabenheit der Kraft in dem Bösen nicht unbemerkt gelassen, wenn er an dm Begriff der Notwen­ digkeit einerseits und der Schuld andererseits dm Begriff der tragischen Gerechtigkeit mit dm inhaltschweren Worten knüpft:", "322": "„Wenn der tapfere und heldenhafte aber ungerechte Mann trotz seiner Heldenhaftigkeit und Tapferkeit besiegt, wenn der Kluge aber Schlechte trotz seiner Klugheit doch zuletzt betrogen wird, das ist tragisch und erregt unsere menschliche Teilnahme.\"", "323": "Damit können Shakespeare's Macbeth und Richard der Dritte sehr wohl bestehen;", "324": "und Lessing wird diese Stelle nicht unbeachtet gelassen haben, als er den kühnen Ausspruch that, er finde Shakespeare durchaus mit Aristo­ teles in Übereinstimmung.So wären wir den der endlichen Feststellung der Wirkung, welche die wahre Tragödie letztlich als Resultat in dem Zuhörer hervorbringen soll, bis zu dem Punkte nahe gerückt, wo wir nur die einzelnen Fäden unserer Darstellung ver­ bindend zusammenzufassen haben, um den Weg aus einer Unter­ suchung zu finden, die seit Jahrhundertmunter den Händen zahl­ loser Erklärer zu einem wahren Labyrinthe geworden schien.", "325": "Zunächst steht fest, daß die Wirkung der Tragödie, von welcher Aristoteles spricht, eine sittliche und sittlich bil­ dende sein muß.Es steht ferner ebenso fest, daß Aristoteles im diame­ tralen Gegensatze zu Platon, der die Erregung von Mitleid (und Furcht) in der Tragödie derselben zum Vorwurfe macht, weil eine solche Erregung verweichlichend und demo­ ralisierend auf den Zuhörer wirke, seine versittlichende Wir­ kung der Tragödie gerade umgekehrt auf die Erregung dieser Empfindungen, auf die Eindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht baut, welche wir durch die Tragödie empfangen.Es steht endlich drittens fest, daß nach Aristoteles die Begriffe der Notwendigkeit oder Wahrscheinlichkeit in den tragischen Charakteren wie in der Handlung der Tragödie, verbunden mit dm Begriffen der Verschuldung und der aus ihr für den Helden hervorgehenden tragischen Folgen, die Seele der Tragödie bilden, welche diesen Namen verdient;", "326": "daß diese Elemente, welche zuletzt in den Begriff der Gerech­ tigkeit aus münden, die Teilnahme des Zuschauers und Zu­ hörers wesentlich bedingen und daß aus ihnen die Befrie­ digung (HSovH) hervorgeht, welche die Tragödie gewähren soll.", "327": "Sind diese Sätze auf richtigem Verständnis der Ansichten des Aristoteles über die Tragödie begründet, so ergibt sich das aus ihnen folgende Resultat für die von ihm als Wirkung der Tragödie ausgesprochene „Katharsis\", für die Reinigung der Eindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht, welche der Zu­ hörer durch die Tragödie empfangen hat, gleichsam von selbst.", "328": "Es ist die Einsicht in die notwendige Verkettung von Ursache und Wirkung im Laufe der tragischen Hand­ lung, die Erkenntnis der Schuld im Leiden und Un­ glück des tragischen Helden, — dem wir doch unsere volle Teilnahme bewahren, weil wir uns ihm menschlich ver­ wandt fühlen — und die aus beiden zusammen in uns hervorgerufene tröstliche Überzeugung von der ewigen Vernünftigkeit und Gerechtigkeit — welche wir zwar nicht immer in der wirklichen Welt, wohl aber stets in der von dem echten tragischen Dichter dargestellten Welt erkennen, — dies ist es, wodurch die Tragödie, trotzdem daß ihr Inhalt furchtbar und jammervoll ist, daß er in der Seele des Zu­ hörers die Affekte des thränenvollen Mitleids und der schauernden Furcht aufregt, dennoch in demselben schließlich eine eigentümliche Lustempfindung, ein Gefühl der Befriedigung (HSovih) hervorbringt.", "329": "Dies und nichts anderes ist die Rei­ nigung und Läuterung, die Katharsis, welche nach Aristo­ teles die schmerzvollen Eindrücke, die wir durch die Tragödie, die sich an unser Mitleid und unsere Furcht wendet, em­ pfangen, — durch die Kunst des Dichters empfangen.", "330": "Sie steht im innigsten Zusammenhange mit dem schon erwähnten berühmten Satze des Philosophen:", "331": "daß die Poesie philoso­ phischer und gehaltvoller sei, als die geschichtliche Wirklichkeit, d. h. als das wirkliche Leben selbst.", "332": "Denn nur die Poesie gewährt in ihrer höchsten Form, in der Tragödie, was die Wirklichkeit selten oder nie zu leisten vermag:", "333": "die Erkenntnis und unmittelbare Anschauung der absoluten Vernünftigkeit durch die innere Notwendigkeit der tragischen Entwickelung und des tragischen Abschlusses.", "334": "Von dieser Art des tragischen Abschlusses sagt Hegel, im vollkommensten Einverständnis mit Aristoteles:", "335": "„Nur wenn man diese Einsicht festhält, läßt sich die alte Tragödie (sagen wir:", "336": "die Tragödie, wie sie Aristoteles auffaßte) begreifen.", "337": "Denn nur dann ist nicht das Unglück und Leiden (die d sondern die Befreiung des Geistes (die Katharsis) das letzte, in­ sofern am Ende die Notwendigkeit dessen, was den Individuen geschieht, als absolute Vernünftigkeit ershceinen kann und das Gemüt wahrhaft sittlich beruhigt ist:", "338": "erschüttert durch das Los der Helden (St' iXiou xai -xöfiou), versöhnt in der Sache.\"So ist die Tragödie nach Aristoteles'", "339": "Auffassung das erhebende und veredelnde Spiegelbild des menschlichen Lebens und der dasselbe bedingenden Mächte.", "340": "Das Mitleid mit dem der Menschheit und zumal ihren bedeutendsten Vertretern auf­ erlegten Leiden und das schauernde Gefühl der Furcht, daß dies Schicksal, welches wir die Helden in der Tragödie treffen sehen, auch uns treffen könne, wird gereinigt und geläutert durch den Dichter, der uns durch seine Darstellung zu der Einsicht in den Zusammenhang der Dinge erhebt.", "341": "Indem er uns einerseits das Leiden und Unglück seiner Helden als ein von ihnen selbst durch einen bedeutenden Fehltritt (»c' p t ste7<k7,v) herbeigeführtes notwendiges aufzeigt, also neben der Notwendigkeit der Folge von Ursache und Wirkung zugleich die Idee des menschlichen Handelns aufrecht erhält, zeigt er uns andererseits durch seine Dichtung, wie tüchtige Menschen ihr schweres Geschick würdig hinzunehmen und zu ertragen wissen, zeigt er uns ferner, was der Klage wert und was ihrer im Leben unwert ist.", "342": "So gewöhnt sich der Zuhörer — und dies ist eine weitere erziehende und läuternde Kraft der Tragödie nach dem Sinne des alten Philosophen, in dessen Erziehungssysteme die „richtige Gewöhnung\" eine so große Rolle spielt — durch das Anschauen fremden großen Leides und Unglücks, an dem er mitempfindend in Mitleid und Furcht teilnimmt, das eigene, wenn es ihn treffen sollte, richtig zu würdigen, nicht über Kleines in schwächlichen Jammer auszubrechen und gegenüber dem wirklich Schweren, durch die Einsicht in den Zusammenhang desselben mit seinem eigenen Thun, Erleichterung zu suchen und, wo diese Ver­ kettung von Ursache und Wirkung für ihn nicht zu entdecken ist, dem allgemeinen Menschenschicksal sich zu unterwerfen, das dem Menschen die Leidensfähigkeit als Bedingung des Daseins stellte und das den am höchsten Stehenden, den Mächtigen und Großen, den Glücklichen und Tüchtigsten, wie die tragische Dichtung lehrt, gerade am schwersten trifft.", "343": "In der letztern Weise finden wir die tröstliche Wirkung der Tragödie in Ernst und Scherz sehr oft bei den Alten aus­ gesprochen.", "344": "Und wenn ein Zeitgenosse des Aristoteles, der geistreiche Komödiendichter Ti'mokles, von der Tragödie rühmt, daß sie allerdings dem Menschen für seine sittliche Bildung und Erhebung „nützlich\", und zwar „auf angenehme Weise Ost-s nützlich bildend sei\" — was bekanntlich Platon leugnete — wenn er ihr nachrühmt, daß sie zu den „Beschwihctigungen der Sorgen\" gehöre, welche das Im Leiden überreiche Wesen, Mensch genannt, Des Leben so viel Schmerzen mit sich bringt, sich erfunden habe, — wenn Ti'mokles, sage ich, es ohne Bedenken als Wirkung der Tragödie aussprach, daß Des Hörers Geist, vergessend seines eignen Selbst, Versenkend sich in fremdes Leid uud Mißgeschick, Belehrt und mit Genuß belehrt von dannen geht! — so sprach er damit zugleich die allgemeine Ansicht und Über­ zeugung seiner Zeit und seines Volkes aus, welcher Platon mit seinem abstrakt einseitigen moralischen Radikalismus sich entgegenstellte.Aber die philosophische Begründung und Zurück­ führung dieser Wirkung auf das Wesen und den Begriff der Tragödie selbst ist das unsterbliche Verdienst des großen hellenischen Denkers, dem über die Kluft von dritthalbtausend Jahren das Verständnis des größten deutschen Denkers die Hand reicht.", "345": "Aristoteles' Lehre von der Katharsis der durch die Tragödie hervorgebrachten Eindrücke des Mitleids und der Furcht ist nichts anderes als der Nachweis:", "346": "daß auch hier nach jenem tiefsinnigen Spruche das Verwundende auch zugleich das Heilende sei, der Nachweis, daß die Tragödie, indem sie jene großen Grundgefühle alles Tragischen, die das Herz bedrückenden Affekte des Mitleids und der Furcht in uns aufregt, zugleich durch die Weise, wie sie es thut, durch ihre ganzeKomposition derHandlung und der Charaktere— diese Affekte auf das richtige sittliche Maß zurückführt.", "347": "Die bekannte Äußerung des Aristoteles über den von seiner Zeit eben so leidenschaftlich bewunderten als ange­ feindeten Dichter, welche unseren Romantikern so viele Not gemacht, ist nur dann richtig zu verstehen, wenn man sie im Zusammenhange mit demjenigen Teile der Aristotelischen Untersuchung über das Wesen des Tragischen betrachtet, in welchem sie als beiläufige Bemerkung vorkommt.Aristoteles hat es ausgesprochen, welche Art der Tra­ gödie er nach dem Maßstabe der Kunst gemessen als die vollendetste (x-xxian,) ansehe.", "348": "Es ist dies, um es kurz zu sagen, die Tragödie mit einfachem und zwar mit unglücklichem Ausgange, die Tragödie, in welcher der Held, ein Mensch wie wir, durch irgend einen bedeutenden Fehl aus Glück in Unglück gerät.", "349": "Dies ist nach Aristoteles der richtige Aus­ gang, die wahrhaft kunstgemäße Wandlung der Tragödie.", "350": "Nun fanden sich im Altertume Kunstrichter, welche dem Euripides gerade dies zum Vorwurfe machten, nämlich daß er seinen Tragödien fast durchweg einen solchen „unglücklichen Ausgang\" gebe.", "351": "Gegen diesen Vorwurf, aber auch nur gegen diesen, nimmt Aristoteles dm Dichter in Schutz.", "352": "„Jene Kunstrichter\", sagt er.", "353": "„begehen einen Fehler;", "354": "denn Euripides ist hier gerade im Rechte.", "355": "Dafür liefert auch die Erfahrung einen sehr bedeutungsvollen Beleg.", "356": "Denn wo nur Euripide'ische Stücke bei den Festwettkämpfen auf den Bühnen zur Darstellung kommen, da erklärt das Publikum dieselben allemal — vorausgesetzt daß sie gut dargestellt werden, — für die am meisten tragischen, und Euripides gilt ihm — trotz aller sonstigen vielfachen Mängel in dem inneren Baue seiner Tragödien — doch immer jedenfalls für dm tragischsten Dichter.\"", "357": "Schon dies „jedenfalls\" (7-), welches den Superlativ des Vorzugs auf eine einzige Eigenschaft, auf das spezifisch Tragische 7«) im Sinne des Aristoteles, d. h. im Sinne des ergreifenden unglück­ lichen Ausganges seiner Dichtungen beschränkt, hätte diejenigen stutzig machen sollen, welche, wie Voltaire und seine Nach­ beter, diese Stelle so verstanden, als erkläre Aristoteles dm Euripides schlechthin für dm größten tragischen Dichter;", "358": "— ganz abgesehen davon, daß Aristoteles selbst hier gar kein Urteil fällt, sondern nur das Urteil des Publikums seiner Zeit anführt, welches aber auch nur in einem be­ stimmten und beschränkten Punkte dem Euripides dm Vor­ rang einräumte.Dies Urteil des Publikums, das Aristoteles mit den nötigen Modifikationen zu dem seinigen macht, müssen wir noch heute richtig finden.", "359": "Kein Dichter regt durch die Kon­ flikte und Schicksale seiner Helden so im Innersten und mit einer so leidenschaftlichen Gewalt die Seele des Hörers und Zuschauers auf wie Euripides, von dem Bernays mit Recht sagt:", "360": "„Man denke über ihn wie man wolle, sittlichen und künstlerischen Frieden wird man in ihm selbst so wenig wie in seinen Tragödien finden können;", "361": "vielmehr eine Wollust des Zerreißens und der Zerrissenheit, eine ekstatische Ver­ zweiflung, ein aus allen Tiefen des Verstandes und des Herzens aufstöhnendes Mitleid mit der zusammenbrechenden alten Welt, eine im Schaudern schwelgende Furcht vor dem Eintritts einer neuen Zeit.\"", "362": "Ist es doch gerade dies über­ wiegende Hervorheben des jammervollen Menschenshcicksals gewesen, was Aristo'phanes und andere als ein Übermaß an der Dichtung des Euripides so bitter rügten, während gerade die leidenshcaftliche Bitterkeit dieser Rügen und An­ griffe ein Beweis mehr ist für die hinreißende Wirkung, welche eben dieser Eigenschaft wegen Euripides'", "363": "Tragödien auf das Publikum übten, eine Wirkung, die wir von Ari­ stoteles mit klaren Worten bezeugt sehen.", "364": "Aber während Aristoteles durch seine Bemerkung den Dichter der leidenvollen Leidenschaft gegen einen ungerechten Tadel in Schutz nahm, wenn er in einer ganz genau um­ schriebenen Beziehung ihn mit dem Publikum seiner Zeit als den „tragischsten\" (d. h. den leidenvollsten) gelten ließ, so war er doch himmelweit davon entfernt, in ihm, wie Bernays meint, den tragischsten und kathartischsten Dichter zugleich zu sehen, und ihn damit ohne weiteres hoch über Sophokles und Ä'schylos als den vollendetsten Dichter der Tragödie zu proklamieren.", "365": "Im Gegenteil!", "366": "Aristoteles sagt es mit den klarsten Worten, daß er „in allem andern\" keineswegs ein richtiges Verfahren bewähre (ei -rä sxx« ad, s oixovo^l).", "367": "Und welches muß nach Aristoteles das wesent­ lichste von diesem „allem andern\" sein in der Ökonomie der Tragödie?", "368": "Doch wohl dasjenige, wodurch die letztliche befreiende und läuternde Wirkung auf den Zushcauer von der Tragödie hervorgebracht wird, die Art und Weise der Kom­ position der Handlung, die innere Notwendigkeit ihres Ver­ laufs und die demselben Gesetze entsprechende Beschaffenheit und Haltung der Charaktere.Denn das Tragische eines Dichters, das Tragische in dem weiteren Umfange, in welchem es das kathartische Element einschließt, besteht eben nach Aristoteles und nach der Natur der Sache selbst in zwei Dingen.", "369": "Erstens in der Kraft, mit welcher der tragische Dichter die beiden großen Hebel des Tragischen, Mitleid und Furcht, in Bewegung zu setzen versteht;", "370": "und zweitens in der erhebenden, befreienden und versöhnenden Wirkung, die er gerade durch die Art und Weise, wie er

"1153": "denn es ist zulässig, auch manches von demjenigen zu definiren, was durch eine Aussage ausgedrückt ist.", "1154": "Wenn man aber irgendwie die Erklärung nur durch ein einzelnes Wort gibt, so ist damit offenbar keine Definition der Sache ge­ geben, denn jede Definition ist ja eine Aussage, ein Satz.", "1155": "In­ dessen kann man immerhin sagen, daß auch derartiges in das Gebiet der Definition gehöre, z.", "1156": "B. daß das Geziemende schön sei, uud ebenso auch, ob sinnliche Wahrnehmung und Wissen iden­ tisch seien oder verschieden;", "1157": "denn auch bei den Definitionen han­ delt eS sich in erster Linie darum, ob Identität oder Verschieden­ heit stattfindet.", "1158": "Ueberhaupt kann man von allem, was unter die gleiche methodische Behandlung fällt, wie die Definitionen, sagen, daß eS mit der Definition verwandt ist.", "1159": "Es ist aber unmittel­ bar klar, daß alles das eben Angeführte in diese Klasse gehört.", "1160": "Sind wir nemlich im Stand,

Definition genügt es nämlich nicht zu zeigen, daß Iden­ tität der Definition und des zu Besinnenden stattfindet.", "1164": "Dage­ gen zur Aufhebung einer Definition genügt es vollständig zu zei­ gen, daß keine Identität vorhanden ist.Eigenthümlich ist das, was zwar nicht das eigentliche Wesen bezeichnet, aber einem Gegenstand allein zukommt und in der Aussage mit demselben verwechselt werden kann,

man nicht, das Schlafen sei dem Menschen eigen­ thümlich, auch nicht, wenn eS einmal für einige Zeit ihm allein zukommt.", "1169": "Wenn man je etwas Derartiges als eigenthümlich bezeichnen wollte, so gälte diese Bezeichnung nicht allgemein, schlechthin, sondern für einige Zeit und in relativer Weise;", "1170": "denn z. B. „sich rechts befinden\" ist für eine gewisse Zeit eigenthüm­ lich, die Eigenschaft „zweifüßig\" aber kann in relativer Weise als eigenthümlich bezeichnet werden, sie kommt z. B. so dem Menschen zu im Verhältniß zum Pferd, zum Hund.", "1171": "Daß aber das, was möglicherweise einem Andern zukommt, in der Aussage nicht mit dem betreffenden Gegenstand verwechselt werden kann,

ein Accidens, wenn aber Einer allein sitzt, so ist es für ihn ein Eigenthümliches, sitzt er aber nicht allein, so ist eS für die Sitzen­ den ein Eigenthümliches im Verhältniß zu denen, welche nicht

nicht sein.Es ist hier wohl zu beachten, daß alles das, waS in Be­ ziehung auf das Eigenthümliche, die Gattung und das Accidens gesagt werden kann, auch auf die Definitionen zutreffen wird.", "1193": "Die Definition ist nemlich aufgehoben, sobald man zeigt, daß et­ was dem unter der Definition begriffenen Gegenstand nicht allein zukommt — wie dieß auch beim Eigenthümlichen der Fall ist, — oder daß

be­ handeln.", "1198": "Man muß also, wie oben gesagt, ganz allgemeine Un­ terschiede machen, das Uebrige^) aber jedesmal in Verbindung setzen mit dem, womit es am meisten verwandt ist, wobei man eS denn bezeichnet als zur Definition oder zur Gattung u. s. f. gehörig.", "1199": "So ist im Allgemeinen daS oben Genannte mit dem Betreffenden in Verbindung gebracht.", "1200": "Zunächst müssen wir eine Definition des Identischen geben und sagen, in wie vielerlei Beziehungen dieß zu verstehen ist.", "1201": "Man kann unseres Erachtens das Identische im Allgemeinen in drei Gassen eintheilen.", "1202": "Wir pflegen nemlich die Bezeichnung „identisch, eins und dasselbe\" zu gebrauchen entweder in Hinsicht der Art oder der Zahl oder der Gattung, und zwar hinsichtlich der Zahl bei solchen Dingen, wobei eS mehrere Namen gibt, die Sache aber Eine ist, wie z. B. bei Rock und Kleid, — der Art nach bei dem, was ein Mehrfaches, aber der Art nach ununter­ schieden ist, wie Mensch und Mensch, Pferd und Pferd;", "1203": "derarti­ ges nemlich wird der Art nach identisch genannt, sofern es unter Eine und dieselbe Art fällt.", "1204": "Ebenso ist der Gattung nach iden­ tisch das, was unter Eine und dieselbe Gattung fällt, z. B. Pferd und Mensch.", "1205": "Man könnte denken, das aus derselben Quelle kommende Wasser, welches als identisch bezeichnet wird, unterscheide sich doch etwas von den eben genannten Arten, in­ dessen werden wir doch auch dieses in Eine Reihe stellen müssen mit dem, was als Einer Art angehörig so bezeichnet wird.", "1206": "Denn alles Derartige ist doch offenbar mit einander verwandt und ein­ ander ähnlich.", "1207": "Denn jedes Wasser wird als mit jedem andern der Art nach identisch bezeichnet, weil es einige Aehnlichkeit damit hat, das Wasser aber, welches aus Einer und derselben Quelle kommt, ist davon durch nichts anderes vershcieden als dadurch, daß die Aehnlichkeit eine stärkere ist;", "1208": "daher trennen wir dieß nicht von demjenigen, was als Einer Art angehörig so genannt wird.", "1209": "Am geläufigsten und allgemeinsten ist es, dasjenige identisch zu nennen, was der Zahl nach Eins ist.", "1210": "Aber auch dieß pflegt in mehr als Einem Sinn verstanden zu werden, im eigentlichsten und ersten in dem Fall, wenn etwas durch Definition oder Na­ men als identisch bezeichnet wird, wie Kleid und Gewand, auf Füßen gehendes, zweifüßiges Geschöpf und Mensch;", "1211": "in zweiter Linie, wenn die Identität beruht auf dem Eigenthümlichen, z.", "1212": "B. empfänglich für Wissenschaft und Mensch, der Natur nach auf­ wärts strebend und Feuer;", "1213": "drittens wenn man ausgeht vom Accidentellen, z.", "1214": "B. sitzend oder gebildet und Sokrates.", "1215": "Denn in allen diesen Fällen soll das der Zahl nach Eine bezeichnet werden.", "1216": "Daß das eben Gesagte richtig ist, wird man gleich am leichtesten wahrnehmen, wenn man die Bezeichnungen vertauscht.", "1217": "Es kommt ja nicht selten vor, wenn wir einen Dasitzenden bei Namen rufen lassen wollen und der, welcher rufen soll, nicht recht versteht, daß wir dann die Bezeichnung vertaushcen und in der Voraussetzung, daß der mit dem Rufen Beauftragte vom Accidentellen aus es besser verstehen werde, sagen, er solle den Dasitzenden oder Sprechenden zu uns rufen, wobei wir offenbar von der Annahme ausgehen, daß die Bezeichnung nach dem Na­ men und die Bezeichnung nach dem Accidentellen Eins und das­ selbe sind.So zerfällt also das Identische in der angegebenen Weise in drei Klassen.Daß die Behauptungen aus den oben angegebenen Mo­ menten bestehen und durch dieselben zu Stand kommen und dar­ auf sich beziehen, läßt sich einmal durch Induktion beweisen;", "1218": "faßt man nemlich jeden einzelnen Satz oder jedes einzelne Pro­ blem ins Auge, so wird man finden , daß dabei entweder die

Definition oder Eigenthümliches, nemlich Definition, wenn das eigentliche Wesen bezeichnet wird, Eigenthümliches, wenn dieß nicht der Fall ist;", "1222": "unter dem Eigenthümlichen haben wir ja eben das verstanden, wobei zwar Vertauschung von Subjekt und Prädikat stattfindet, aber nicht das Wesen selber bezeichnet wird.", "1223": "Ist aber eine solche Vertauschung nicht zulässig, so ist das Ausgesagte entweder etwas von dem, was zur Definition der Sache gehört oder nicht.", "1224": "Ist eS etwas von dem, was zur Definition gehört, so ist es Gattung oder Unterschied, denn die Definition besteht ja aus Gattung und Unterschied;", "1225": "gehört es aber nicht zu dem in der Definition Ent­ haltenen, so muß es offenbar AccidenS sein;", "1226": "denn als Accidens haben wir ja eben das bezeichnet, was weder Definition, noch Gattung, noch Eigenthümliches ist, dabei aber der Sache zukommt.", "1227": "Hienach müssen wir nun die einzelnen Kategorieen bestim­ men, in welchen die

ausdrückt, bald die Qualität, bald irgend eine andere Kategorie.", "1233": "Hat man es nemlich mit einem Menschen zu thun und sagt man, der Gegenstand, um welchen es sich handelt, sei ein Mensch oder ein lebendes Wesen, so wird damit das Was, d. h. die Substanz bezeichnet;", "1234": "hat man es mit einer weißen Farbe zu thun und sagt man, der betreffende Gegenstand sei eine ellenlange Größe, so

werden oder mag die Gattung von dem Gegenstand ausgesagt werden 2);", "1237": "sagt man aber etwas aus von einem Andern, so wird nicht das Was bezeichnet, sondern die Quantität oder Qualität oder sonst eine Kategorie.", "1238": "Dieß sind also die verschiedenen Be­ tsimmungen, welche den Inhalt der Behauptungen bilden und aus welchen die letzteren gebildet werden;", "1239": "wie wir sie aber gewinnen können und auf welchem Weg wir mit ihnen umzugehen haben, das ist nun weiter zu erörtern.", "1240": "Zunächst wollen wir bestimmen, waS man unter einem dialektischen Satz und unter einem dialektischen Problem zu ver­ stehen hat;", "1241": "man darf nemlich nicht jeden Satz und ebensowenig jedes Problem ohne weiteres als dialektisch bezeichnen.", "1242": "ES wird ja keinem verständigen

hat, daß wir nemlich in jeder Beziehung wohl geübt und in Allem bewandert scheinen;", "4551": "denn wenn man beim Dispu­ tiren nur zu tadeln weiß, ohne daß man im Stand ist, über den Unwerth der gegnerischen Behauptungen etwas Bestimmtes zu sagen, so gibt man dem Verdacht Raum, daß man Schwierigkeiten mache nicht um der Wahrheit willen, sondern weil man nichts verstehe.Wie man ferner beim Antworten solchen Beweisführungen entgegenzutreten hat, ist klar, wenn unsere früheren Angaben über die Ursachen der Trugschlüsse richtig sind und wenn die Einthei­ lung der unredlichen Vortheile beim Fragen der Sache entspricht.", "4552": "Es ist aber nicht dasselbe, ob man die Beweisführung durchschaut und die Schwierigkeit zu lösen versteht, und ob man im Stand ist, auf die gestellten Fragen rasch zu entgegnen.", "4553": "Denn was wir wissen, das erkennen wir oft nicht, wenn es eine andere Form erhält.", "4554": "Wie ferner sonst die größere oder geringere Rasch­ heit sich nach dem größeren oder geringeren Maß der Uebung richtet, so ist es auch beim Disputiren, daher wir, wenn wir etwas ganz wohl erkennen, aber keine Uebung haben, die günstige Gelegenheit oft versäumen, indem wir erst hintendrein kommen.", "4555": "Es geht hier oft wie bei geometrischen Zeichnungen:", "4556": "auch dort verstehen wir oft wohl die Analysis, aber nicht die Synthests;", "4557": "so wissen wir auch oft bei den Elenchen wohl, wie die Beweis­ führung zusammenzufügen ist, sind aber mit der Auflösung in Verlegenheit.Erstens:", "4558": "wie wir für den Schluß die Regel geben, daß man mehr — nemlich je und je — den Schein eines Schlusses als einen wirklichen Schluß zu Stande bringen muß, so muß man auch bei den Lösungen je und je mehr auf den Schein als auf eine wirkliche Lösung es absehen.", "4559": "Ueberhaupt darf man ja im Kampf gegen die Eristiker, diejenigen, welchen es bloß ums Strei­ ten zu thun ist, nicht davon ausgehen, daß man sie wirklich zu widerlegen, sondern daß man nur den Schein einer Widerlegung hervorzurufen hat.", "4560": "Wir geben ja nicht zu, daß dieselben in Wirk­ lichkeit einen Schluß zu Stande bringen, also dürfen wir auch mit unsern Berichtigungen nur den Schein einer Widerlegung zerstören.", "4561": "Ist nemlich der Elenchos, die Widerlegung, ein von gewissen Sätzen ausgehender, nicht homonymer Widerspruch, so braucht man nichts zu bestimmen Aber Amphibolie und Homony­ mie;", "4562": "denn es wird ja kein wirklicher Schluß bewirkt.", "4563": "Allein die besonderen Bestimmungen haben eben keinen andern Grund als den, daß der Schlußsatz einer Widerlegung nur ähnlich zu sein scheint.", "4564": "Also nicht vor wirklicher Widerlegung, sondern vor dem Schein einer solchen muß man sich hüten, da ja die Fragstellung zweideutig ist und so auch das Homonyme und was es sonst noch für Kunstgriffe zum Täuschen gibt, und da dieß die wirkliche Widerlegung nicht zu Tag treten läßt und es unklar macht, ob es eine wirkliche Widerlegung ist oder nicht.", "4565": "Da es nemlich mög­ lich ist, daß man schließlich beim Schlußsatz sagt, es sei nicht das verneint worden, was man wirklich behauptet habe, sondern eS sei zweideutig, — wenn die Identität der Fassung auch noch so sehr vorhanden ist — so bleibt es unklar, ob eine wirkliche Wider­ legung gegeben ist;", "4566": "denn es ist unklar, ob der Betreffende mit seinem jetzigen Vorgeben die Wahrheit sagt.", "4567": "Wenn man dagegen mit bestimmter Unterscheidung des Homonymm und Zweideutigen fragen würde, so wäre keine solche Unklarheit in Betreff der Wider­ legung und es würde das herauskommen, auf was die Eristiker es jetzt weniger abgesehen haben, als früher, daß nemlich der Ge­ fragte entweder Ja oder Nein antwortet.", "4568": "Jetzt, wo die Frag­ stellung nicht die richtige ist, muß nothwendig der Gefragte seiner Antwort noch etwas beifügen, um die Unrichtigkeit der gegnerischen Sätze zu berichtigen, während bei gehöriger Unterscheidung der Antwortende entweder Ja oder Nein sagen müßte.Wenn man annehmen wollte, der aus Homonymie gegründete Gegenschluß sei wirklich ein solcher, so würde es eigentlich nicht möglich sein, daß der Antwortende der Widerlegung entgienge;", "4569": "denn bei den sichtbaren Dingen müßte er das Wort, welches er bejaht hat, verneinen und was er verneint hat, bejahen.", "4570": "Denn die Lösung, welche Manche angeben, hat keinen

dieselbe Bedeutung haben, ob man sagt, dieser Koriskos') — oder dieser Koriskos sei gebildet resp, ungebildet;", "4575": "was man nun eben bejaht und verneint.", "4576": "Aber vielleicht ist die Bedeutung nicht dieselbe, wie auch dort bei dem Namen.", "4577": "Also ist ein Unter­ schied.", "4578": "Wenn man aber das einemal schlechthin den Koriskos zu meinen behauptet, daS anderemal dazusetzt:", "4579": "ein gewisser, oder:", "4580": "dieser, so hat das keinen Sinn;", "4581": "denn ebenso ist es auch beim Namen und es kommt nichts darauf an, welchem Koriskos er mehr zukommt.Allein da es nicht klar ist, ob der, welcher die Zweideutig­ keit nicht bestimmt unterscheidet, widerlegt ist oder nicht, die Unter­ scheidung aber beim Disputiren gestattet ist, so ist eS offenbar ein Fehler, wenn man die Frage schlechthin, ohne Unterscheidung, zu­ gibt, wovon die Folge ist, daß, wenn auch nicht der Disputirende, doch die Behauptung widerlegt zu sein scheint.", "4582": "Es kommt übrigens oft vor, daß man die Amphibolie wohl bemerkt, aber doch die Unterscheidung nicht aussprechen mag, weil derartige Fälle so gar häufig sind, damit man nicht gegen alle? und jedes

gestellt.", "4588": "Wenn es nun nicht richtig ist, auf zwei Fragen Eine Antwort schlechthin zu verlangen, so ist klar, daß man auf nichts Homonymes schlechthin antworten darf, auch wenn die Antwort

sein oder nicht da sein;", "4590": "in beiden Fällen hat man mehr als Einen Satz;", "4591": "denn wenn auch eine zusammenfas­ sende Antwort sachlich richtig ist, so ist es deßhalb doch nicht Eine Frage.", "4592": "Es ist ja auch möglich, auf tausend verschiedene Fragen durchaus entweder mit Ja oder mit Nein zu antworten und es mögen diese Antworten ganz richtig sein, aber dennoch darf man nicht mit Einer Antwort antworten, weil so das Disputiren unmöglich gemacht wird.", "4593": "Es ist das Gleiche, wie wenn man verschiedenen Dingen Einen und denselben Namen geben wollte.", "4594": "Darf man nun auf zwei Fragen nicht Eine Antwort geben, so ist klar, daß auch hinsichtlich des Homonymen Ja und Nein nicht zuläßig ist.", "4595": "Denn auch wer es sagt, hat keine eigentliche Ant­ wort gegeben, sondern hat eben etwas gesagt.", "4596": "Allein es wird doch wohl beim Disputiren verlangt, weil so das Endresultat versteckt bleibt.Da nun, wie gesagt, Widerlegungen vorkommen, welche nur scheinbar sind, ohne wirkliche Widerlegungen zu sein, so wird es auf dieselbe Weise auch scheinbare Lösungen geben, die nicht wirk­ liche Lösungen sind;", "4597": "von diesen nun sagen wir, daß

in seiner medicinischen Bedeutung, als medicinische Metapher aufzufassen, und sowohl jene entha­ siastischen Gesänge des Olympus in den Fällen deS Koryban­ tiaSmuS als auch die Tragödie gegenüber den

ihrer Allgemeinheit nichts aufkläre\";", "673": "und die auf diese Bedeutung gegründete Erklärung Lessing's und Andrer, welche diese Reinigung in einem moralischen Sinne verstehen, von der Mäßigung, Besserung, Veredlung der Affecte oderLeidenschasten, verwirft er auf das Entschiedenste.", "674": "AuS dem waS Aristoteles an der oben auS der Politik (VIII, 6) mitge­ theilten Stelle über daS Theater

bemüht sei ihm den Charakter eines Vergnügungsortes für die verschiedenen Classen der Gesellschaft zu wahren.\"", "675": "Gegen die andre Erklä­ rung der aristotelischen Katharsis, als hergenommen von der religiösen Lustration, führt Bernays als Widerlegung nur an »die Unmöglichkeit daß Aristoteles hier, ganz gegen seine sonstige Weise, einen philosophischen Terminus aus den populären Cul­ tuSgebräuchen entlehnt habe, um sein eigentliches Ziel nun vollends zu verfehlen.", "676": "Denn da er doch nicht die Cerimoyien selbst, sondern höchstens die gemütlichen Wirkungen welche der Lustrierte empfindet, im Auge haben könnte, so würde er eine erklärungsbedürstige Gemütserscheinung durch Vergleichung mit einer andern um Nichts klareren haben erklären wollen (S. 14Z).Diese beiden Widerlegungen kann man bei näherer Be­ trachtung nur als sehr ungenügend finden.", "677": "Zwar ist Lessing'S Erklärung der tragischen Katharsis, wornah csie in nichts Anderm beruhen soll als „in der Ver­ wandlung der Leidenschaften in tugendhafte Fertigkeiten\", wenn man diese Verwandlung als unmittelbar vorgehend ver- steht, unrichtig und daher jedenfalls ungenau.", "678": "Denn die tugend­ haften Fertigkeiten (A«,s) gehören dem EthoS, dem sittlichen Charakter an, und das Ethos wird, nach jener Auseinander­ setzung des Aristoteles in der Politik, vielmehr durch fortgesetzte Anwendung ruhiger ästhetischer Eindrücke, durch Gesänge und Instrumentalmusik in der dorischen Tonart, gebessert und ge­ bildet, welchen er gerade die „kathartischen Lieder\" entgegen- stellt, da sie nur momentan und vorkommenden Falles die er­ regten Affecte beruhigen und läutern.", "679": "Aber die Wirkung der Musik und des Theaters so ganz und gar von dem moralischen Gesichtspunkte zu trennen, waS Bernays dem Aristoteles mit übergroßem Eifer zuschreibt, ist ganz gegen den Geist und die AuffassungSweise deS Philosophen.", "680": "Die ganze Abhandlung über Musik als Erziehungsmittel in dem achten Buche der Politik zeigt daß Aristoteles bei den ästhetischen Eindrücken vor­ zugsweise den moralischen Gesichtspunkt festhält.", "681": "Bei der Frage welche er dort untersucht:", "682": "„ob die Musik zu dem sitt­ lichen Charakter, zu dem EthoS beitrage\", bejaht er dieses für den Fall wenn die Musik auf unsre innere Beschaffenheit, wenn sie in moralischer Beziehung wirke.", "683": "Daß dieses Letztere wirk­ lich der Fall sei wird nun aber gerade durch jene alten enthusia­ stischen Lieder deS Olympus bewiesen, von denen Bernays be­ hauptet daß der Philosoph bei ihrer etwas weiter unten von ihm geschilderten Wirkung lediglich nur einen rein pathologi­ schen Gesichtspunkt festhalte, und daher auch bei der tragischens Katharsis.", "684": "DaS Pathos steht in der genauesten Beziehung zum EthoS, „der Enthusiasmus (sagt dort Aristoteles) ist ein Affect (Pathos) des sittlichen Zustandes der Seele\" (x. 1340. a. 1t).Nicht minder ist es ganz lrrthümlich wenn Bernays dar­ aus daß Aristoteles bei dem Theater daS Vergnügen hervor­ hebt und dasselbe einem jeden Theile deS Publikums gewahrt wissen will schließt, eS liege ihm die Betrachtung deS Theaters von moralischer Seite so ganz fern.", "685": "Bei der Betrachtung der Musik (Polit.

für jeden nur einigermaßen unterrichteten Leser die Polemik gegen denselben unverkennbar ist.", "746": "Der Terminus Katharsis, welcher bei Aristoteles für diese Sache die stehende Bezeichnung ist.",

Schriftsteller gebrauch­ ten stehenden Terminus beibehalten haben sollte, besonders da gerade in dieser Verbindung durchaus kein Mißverständniß ent­ stehen konnte.", "752": "Hinsichtlich der von BernayS behaupteten aus­ schließlich medicinischen Bedeutung der aristotelischen Katharsis ist außerdem der nicht gerade für diese Behauptung sprechende Umstand nicht zu übersehen daß an den angeführten Stellen der Neuplatoniker, mit und neben dem Ausdrucke der nur die medicinische Evakuation auch hier bedeuten soll, von demselben Vorgänge im Gemüte auch Bezeichnungen von gerade ent­ gegengesetzter Bedeutung (erfüllen, erfüllt fein) gebraucht werden t).Wenn wir aber auch zugeben daß wir an jenen drei Stel­ len deS JamblichoS und Proklos Gedanken und Ausdrücke aus deS Aristoteles Poetik haben (waS wir nicht für durchaus un­ zulässig, nur nicht für gewiß und bewiesen halten):", "753": "so geht doch jedenfalls auch aus diesen Stellen der Neuplatoniker und der dort geführten Discussion hervor daß Aristoteles die von ihm angenommene Katharsis der Affecte durch Musik und Poesie und namentlich durch daS Theater nicht ausschließlich von dem pathologischen Standpunkt aus betrachtete und darin lediglich ein medicinischeS Verhältniß sah, sondern daß im Gegentheil, wenn ihm auch eine Analogie mit körperlichen pathologischen Zuständen und deren Heilung dabei vorschwebte, die moralische Seite der Sache für ihn die Hauptsache war und er als Zweck dieser Reinigung der Affecte die sittliche Erziehung und Vervollkommnung im Auge hatte.Nach der bisherigen Besprechung des Begriffes und Ge­ brauches deS Wortes Katharsis, nach seiner allgemeinen und nach seiner medicinischen Bedeutung, zu dem Zwecke um die aristotelishceKatharsiS richtig aufzufassen, ist jetzt noch von dem liturgisch-theologischen Sinne und Gebrauche desselben Wortes zu demselben Zwecke zu handeln.ES war bei den Griechen (wie nicht minder bei den Römern) der religiöse Gebrauch, die religiöse Institution, bei vielfachen Veranlassungen und in vielfältiger Form gewisse Cerimonien vorzunehmen (bestehend in Waschungen, Bespren­ gn« gen, Räucherungen mit Opfern, Gesängen und Gebeten), welchen man die Kraft zuschrieb die Menschen von Befleckungen im rituellen Sinne (wie Berührung eineS Todten und Anderes dergleichen), von einer Sündenschuld, von solchen Krankheiten die man göttlicher Strafe oder dämonischer Einwirkung zu­ schrieb, zu befreien.", "754": "Alle diese Cerimonien werden unter dem Namen Reinigung (Katharsis, KatharmoS, Qustratio) zusam­ mengefaßt.", "755": "Solche Reinigungscerimonien, eine solche Katharsis wurde insbesondere vorgenommen zur Heilung von Geistestsörungen, namentlich zur Heilung des ekstatischen Zustandes, der Verrückt­ heit, die man mir dem Namen KorybantiaSmos, Enthustasmos bezeichnete.", "756": "Diese Katharsis wurde gewöhnlich von Frauen (»ttSce^t««) vorgenommen, und der Haupttheil derselben be­ stand in wild aufgeregter orgiastischer Musik des phrygischen BlaSinstrumenteS (AuloS), in Gesängen und Tänzen von ähn­ lichem Charakter ^).", "757": "Es war dieselbe orgiastische Musik, die­ selben Lieder des OlympuS welche gerade diese exaltierte Stim­ mung und diesen ekstatischen Zustand in andern Fällen hervor­", "758": "brachten.", "759": "Diese Art der Heilung, durch das Mittel der religiösen ^ oder liturgischen Katharsis, hebt Aristoteles in seiner Betrachtung der Musik als Unterrichtsgegenstand und als Erziehungsmittel VIII, 5—7) unter den Wirkungen derselben, wie wir oben schon dargelegt haben, besonders hervor.", "760": "Er führt daS orgiastische Spiel des Aulos an, welches anzuwenden sei wo eine Katharsis nöthig werde;", "761": "er nennt „die heiligen Lieder\", die „kathartischen Lieder\", durch welche solche Patienten „gleich­ sam Heilung erlangen und eine Katharsis\".", "762": "Von jener religiösen Katharsis, als Heilungsmittel bei ekstatischen Zuständen, und der dabei gemachten Beobachtung geht Aristoteles auS bei seiner Theorie der tragischen Katharsis.", "763": "Wie dort der ekstatische Zustand des Enthusiasmus durch neue enthusiastische Eindrücke zu dem normalen Zustand zurückgeführt wird, so werden die durch die Tragödie aufgeregte Gemütsaffectionen des Mitleide? und der Furcht auch wieder durch die Tragödie zu der rechten Stimmung und dem normalen Zustand zurückgeführt.", "764": "WaS lag bei dieser Zusammenstellung und Begründung dem Aristo­ teles näher als daß er, wenn er von der Wirkung der Tragödie die Bezeichnung „Katharsis\" gebraucht, diese Bezeichnung von jener analogen Heilungsart des Enthusiasmus herübernahm welche durch die Cerimonien der religiösen Katharsis geschah und wofür eben dieses Wort Katharsis die gewöhnliche und allgemein bekannte Benennung war?", "765": "Wie auch Aristoteles sonst noch den von ihm aufgestellten Begriff der Reinigung der Affecte nach den verschiedenen Seiten der Sache und nach den verschiedenen Bedeutungen des Wortes „Katharsis\" gewendet und erweitert haben mag, so scheint der Ausgangspunkt dieser Theorie, welche in der oft genannten Stelle seiner Politik« liegt, unabweiSlich zu fordern daß die aristotelische Katharsis, als ästhetisch-moralischer Terminus, von dem theologisch-liturgischen Gebiete, von der religiösen Katharsis des KorybantiaSmuS an­ fänglich herübergenommen worden ist.", "766": "LambinuS, welcher den ursprünglichen Sinn deS aristotelischen Terminus so auffaßte, scheint damit das Richtige getroffen zu haben;", "767": "jedenfalls ist diese Erklärung nicht mit einigen satirischen Seitenblicken wider­ legt, wie Bernays (S. t42) zu glauben scheint.", "768": "Die Behaup­ tung von Reiz in einer Anmerkung zu der betreffenden Stelle der Politik, auf dessen Autorität sich BernayS beruft, als habe die Cerimonie der Katharsis nur statt gefunden zur Reinigung von Schuld, bei der Einweihung in die Mysterien und vor einem Opfer, ist unrichtig, da dieselbe Cerimonie auch bei Geisteskrankheiten unzweifelhaft vorkam.", "769": "Dieß beweist nicht nur daS bei Platon und bei Aristoteles selbst angeführte Bei­ spiel der Heilung des Enthusiasmus durch „kathartische\" Ge­ sänge, sondern auch andre Zeugnisse *).", "770": "Insbesondre fragen wir aber jeden unbefangenen Beurteiler, in welchem Sinne ein griechischer Leser diesen Terminus verstanden haben wird, an der Stelle in Aristoteles Politik (VIII, 6. x. 1341. a.), wo er zuerst ohne alle wettere Erklärung, demnach als bekannt voraus­ gesetzt, vorkommt in folgenden Worten:", "771": "»der Aulos ist nicht ethisch, vielmehr orgiastisch, so daß man denselben in solchen Momenten anzuwenden hat wo eher eine Katharsis als Unter­ richt erfordert wird.\"", "772": "Wird der griechische Leser hier ein medi­ cinischeS Purgativ verstanden haben, oder die bekannte Ceri­ monie der Katharsis, bei welcher, wenn sie zur Heilung deS kurz vorher (Cap. 5. x. 1340. a. 10) von Aristoteles erwähn­ ten Enthusiasmus oder KorybantiaSmus angewendet wurde, die phrygische Flöte (oder vielmehr Pfeife) niemals fehlte", "773": "?Wir fassen zum Schlüsse die Ergebnisse der ganzen bis­ herigen Auseinandersetzung über die in der aristotelischen De­ finition der Tragödie genannte Katharsis in folgenden Sätzen zusammen:", "774": "1) DaS Wort Katharsis (Reinigung), als moralifch-ästhe­ ttscher Terminus zur Bezeichnung einer gewissen Wirkung welche Poesie und Musik aus das menschliche Gemüt und dessen Affecte hervorbringen, ist nicht zuerst von Aristoteles gebraucht worden, sondern war schon vor Aristoteles in diesem Sinne bei den Py­ thagoreern im Gebrauch.2)", "775": "Nach dem Charakter der pythagoreischen Schule und nach der Natur der Sache ist anzunehmen daß, wenn man bei der ersten Anwendung dieses Terminus außer dem allgemeinen Sinn des Wortes noch an eine specielle Nebenbedeutung ge­ dacht hat, diese specielle Bedeutung die liturgisch-theologische war und daß man diese Bezeichnung von den religiösen Ceri­ monien der Katharsis auf das moralisch-ästhetische Gebiet übertrug.3)", "776": "Aristoteles befindet sich mit seiner Aufstellung der Ka­ tharsis der Tragödie auf demselben Gebiete und schließt sich jenem frühern Sprachgebrauchs an.", "777": "Er hatte aber noch eine besondre Veranlassung zur Annahme oder Beibehaltung dieser Bezeichnung Katharsis für die Wirkung der Tragödie, weil er dabei auSgteng von der Beobachtung einer analogen Wirkung der Cerimonien der religiösen Katharsis bei den ekstatischen Zu­ ständen des Enthusiasmus oder Korybantiasmus.4)", "778": "Bei der Anwendung deS Heilmittels der religiösen Ka» tharsis wurde vermittelst einer neuen enthusiastischen Aufregung durch die kathartischen Lieder und die Weisen des phrygischen BlaSinstrumenteS der vorhandene, in vielen Fällen durch die­ selben Einwirkungen früher herbeigeführte Zustand dieser Art der Verrücktheit (Enthusiasmus, KorybantiaSmuS) gleichsam mit Gewalt auS dem Gemüte hinausgetrieben und so geheilt.", "779": "AehnlicheS geschieht hinsichtlich der Erregung und Beruhigung »der Affecte in der Tragödie, wofür Aristoteles gleichfalls die Bezeichnung Katharsis gebraucht.", "780": "Die pathologischen Zustände der Seele in diesen beiden Fällen (des Enthusiasmus und der Tragödie) haben eine Analogie mit gewissen körperlichen patholo­ gischen Zuständen, wobei krankhafte oder überflüssige Stoffe durch purgative Mittel auS dem Körper weggeführt werden, und welches medicinische Verfahren gleichfalls mit dem Worte Katharsis be­ nanntwird.", "781": "Auf dieser Analogie beruht eS wenn beider Erwäh­ nung der Katharsis deS Enthusiasmus durch Lieder und Instru­ mentalmusik und der Tragödie einige Ausdrücke bei Aristoteles und bei spätern Schriftstellern vorkommen („Heilung\", „Erleich­ tert werden\", „Ableitung\" welche auch auf jene medicinische Katharsis passen, obgleich sie sehr wohl nicht min­ der in einem allgemeinem Sinne verstanden werden können.", "782": "Aber wenn auch dem Aristoteles bei der Katharsis des Enthusiasmus und bei der tragischen Katharsis die Analogie mit der medicini­ schen Katharsis vorgeschwebt hat, ja sogar zur Erklärung der erstern angewendet wird, so ist dieses nur zur bessern Veran­ schaulichung dieser Vorgänge geschehen.", "783": "Diese pathologische Seite der tragischen Katharsis erschöpft aber das Wesen und den Zweck derselben keineswegs.", "784": "Das Wesen und der Zweck der von Aristoteles aufgestellten Katharsis oder Reinigung der Affecte in der Tragödie ist moralischer Art und gehört in daS Gebiet nicht der Medicin, sondern der Ethik.", "785": "Dabei bleiben beiden Gebieten, der religiösen und der nach ihr benannten moralisch-ästhetischen Katharsis einerseits, der medicinischen Katharsis andrerseits, manchfache Berührungen und Analogien, so wie

ist, haben wir im Folgenden zu sagen.Da die Zusammensetzung der schönsten Tragödie nicht einfach, sondern verwickelt sein, und dazu Furcht und Mitleiden erregende Gegenstände darstellen muß (denn gerade das ist bei dieser Darstellung eigenthümlich), so ist vorerst klar daß weder biedere Männer, vom Glück ins Unglück versetzt, dargestellt werden dürfen (denn dieß erregt weder Furcht noch Mitleid, sondern Abscheu), noch schlechte vom Un­ glück ins Glück versetzt (denn dieß ist das Alleruntragischste, da eS keines der nöthigen Erfordernisse hat;", "1039": "denn es erregt weder Theilnahme, noch Mitleid, noch Furcht), noch darf der vollendete Bösewicht vom Glück ins Unglück versetzt werden.", "1040": "Eine solche Zusammenstellung würde zwar Theilnahme erregen, aber weder Mitleid, noch Furcht;", "1041": "denn das eine Gefühl zeigt sich bei den unschuldigerweise Unglücklichen, daS andre bei dem unseres Gleichen, Mitleid bei dem Unschuldigen, Furcht bei dem unseres Gleichen.", "1042": "Ein solcher Fall wird daher weder Mit­ leid noch Furcht erregen.", "1043": "ES bleibt also nur der in der Mitte zwi­ schen diesen Stehende übrig;", "1044": "nämlich eine Person die sich weder durch Tugend und Gerechtigkeit auszeichnet, noch wegen Laster und Schlech­ tigkeit in Unglück versetzt wird, sondern wegen eines Fehlers, und zwar eine solche Person welche in großen:", "1045": "Ruhm und Glück steht, wie Oedi­ puS und Thyestes und die glänzenden Männer aus solchen Geschlech­ tern.", "1046": "Nothwendig also muß der wohl eingerichtete Mythus eher ein­ fach als, wie Einige sagen, doppelt sein, und nicht vom Unglück zum Glück, sondern im Gegentheil vom Glück zum Unglück übergehen;", "1047": ", nicht wegen Schlechtigkeit, sondern wegen eines großen Fehlers einer Person die entweder so ist wie sie beschrieben wurde oder eher besser als schlechter ist.", "1048": "Dieß beweist auch die Geschichte.", "1049": "Denn vordem nahmen die Dichter alle möglichen Mythen vor;", "1050": "jetzt aber werden die schönsten Tragödien über wenige Häuser gedichtet, wie Alkmäom Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus und einige Andere, welche Arges litten oder thaten.",

in der Komödie gehen die welche in der Handlung des Stückes (im Mythus) die größten Feinde sind, wie Orestes und Aegisthus in der Tragödie sind, am Ende als Freunde ab, und Keiner fällt durch die Hand des Andern.Furcht und Mitleid kann durch den unmittelbaren Anblick erregt werden, aber auch durch die Zusammenstellung der Begebenheiten selbst, was den Vorzug verdient und von den bessern Dichtern geschieht.", "1060": "Denn der Mythus (die Handlung) muß auch ohne Rücksicht auf das Sehen so eingerichtet sein daß der welcher den Hergang der Begeben­ heiten hört ob dem Geschehenen schaudert und Mitleid empfindet, wie es Einem gehen muß wenn er den Mythus des Oedipus hört.", "1061": "Dieß durch das Auge zu bewirken ist unkünstlerisch, und macht Aufwand äußerer Bühnenmittel nöthig.", "1062":

Staatsbürger auf diejenigen Classen denen das Merkmal der vollkommenen Freiheit wirklich zukommt, und damit die Ausschließung der banausischen Berusöarten (Handwerker «.) von der direkten oder indirekten Theilnahme an der Politik (Mitregierung oder Wahlrechte).Um den Mängeln der beiden Abarten Oligarchie und Demokratie abzuhelfen und eine relativbeste Verfassung herzu­ stellen, ist es nun nothwendig ihre beiderseitigen Principien, Reichthum und Freiheit (Rechtsgleichheit), zu kombinieren und aus den besseren Elementen beider Verfassungen eine Mittel­ form zu schaffen, in welcher auch

Mitte zwischen zwei Ertremen bilde.Dadurch unterscheidet sich der aristotelische Staat wesent­ lich und vortheilhast von dem platonischen Staatsideal.Die Verfassung deZ platonischen Staates ist ein

betrifft, so will zwar Platon daß die Philosophen herrschen oder die Regenten Philosophie treiben, was sich in der Praxis noch nicht bewährt hat;", "1776": "Aristoteles dagegen wirft nur die Frage

sich auch in der gänzlichen Vernachläßigung seines dritten Standes ausdrückt, während es bei Aristoteles blos die Rücksicht auf die Vermeidung der Ertreme ist die ihn veran­ laßte diese

von dem Verhältniß deS Herrn und Sklaven, theils um für daS praktische Bedürfniß die nöthigen Regeln zu ermitteln, theils um zu versuchen ob wir nicht zur wissen­ schaftlichen Begründung dieses Verhältnisses etwas Besseres finden können als die jetzt herrschenden Ansichten.Den Einen nämlich erscheint die Herrschaft des Herrn über den Knecht als eine Art von Kunst die zu lernen sei, und gleichbedeutend mit der HauShaltungskunst, Staatskunst und königlicher Regierungs­ kunst, wie wir gleich zu Anfang bemerkt haben;", "1866": "Andere halten die Herrschaft über Sklaven für naturwidrig, denn nur nach Gesetz und Herkommen, sagen sie, sei der Eine ein Sklave, der Andere ein Freier;", "1867": "von Natur sei kein Unterschied;", "1868": "deßhalb sei auch das Verhältniß nicht gerecht, denn eS beruhe aus Gewalt.4.", "1869": "Sofern nun der Besitz ein Bestandtheil des Hauswesens ist ist auch die Erwerbökunde ein Theil der HauShaltungskunst.", "1870": "Denn ohne die nöthigen Mittel ist weder Leben noch Lebensgenuß möglich.", "1871": "Wie aber bei den auf bestimmte Zwecke gerichteten Künsten die geeigneten Werkzeuge vorhanden sein müssen, wenn das Werk vollendet werden soll, so ist es auch bei den Verrichtungen der Haushaltung.", "1872": "Nun gibt es theils leblose, theils lebendige Werkzeuge, wie der Steuermann zum Beispiel an dem Steuerruder ein lebloses, an dem Untersteuermann ein lebendiges Werkzeug hat, denn der Gehülfe in der Kunst ist als Werkzeug anzusehen.", "1873": "Ebenso ist auch das einzelne Besitzthnm ein Werkzeug zum Leben, und der Besitz ein Vorrath von Werkzeugen.", "1874": "Der Knecht ist ein lebendiges Besitzthum und als Gehülfe ein Werk­ zeug vor andern Werkzeugen.", "1875": "Denn wenn jedes der Werkzeuge auf Geheiß oder gar demselben zuvorkommend seine Arbeit verrichten könnte, wie es von den Werken des Daedalos ') und von den Dreifüßen des Hephaestos heißt, von denen der Dichters sagt daß sie „aus eigenem Antrieb geh'n in die Götterversammlung\", ebenso wenn die Weberschiffchen selbst hin und her flögen und die Plektren die Zither selbst anschlügen, so brauchten weder die Werkmeister Gehülfen noch die Hausherren Knechte.", "1876": "Nur sind die eigentlich, sogenannten Werk­ zeuge schaffende, das Besitzthum dagegen ein Werkzeug zum Handeln:", "1877": "das Weberschiffchen dient zur Hervorbringung von etwas Anderem außer seinem Gebrauch, das Kleid dagegen und das Bett nur zum unmittelbaren Gebrauch.", "1878": "Sofern nun Hervorbringung und Handeln der Art nach verschieden sind, beide Verrichtungen aber eigener Werk­ zeuge bedürfen, so muß nothwendig auch zwischen diesen derselbe Unterschied stattfinden.", "1879": "DaS Leben aber ist Handeln, nicht Hervor- bringen:", "1880": "darum ist auch der Knecht ein Gehülfe dessen was zum Han­ deln gehört.Von dem Besitzthum gilt dasselbe was vom Gliede:", "1881": "das Glied ist nicht nur eines Andern Glied sondern durchaus abhängig von einem Andern;", "1882": "ebenso auch daS Besitzthum.", "1883": "Deßwegen ist der Herr nur Herr des Knechtes, nicht aber abhängig von ihm;", "1884": "der Knecht aber ist nicht blos des Herren Knecht sondern auch durchaus abhängig von ihm.", "1885": "Hieraus ist klar, was die Natur des Knechtes und was die Be­ deutung des Namens sei.", "1886": "Wer nämlich von Natur nicht sein eigen ist, sondern einem Andern angehört, und doch Mensch ist, der ist von Natur Sklave.", "1887": "Ein einem Andern angehöriger Mensch aber ist wer, obgleich Mensch, doch Besitzthum ist.", "1888": "Besitzthum aber ist jedes für sich bestehende zum Handeln taugliche Werkzeug.5.", "1889": "Ob es nun von Natur solche Menschen gibt oder nicht, und ob es gerecht und für sie selbst besser sei daß sie einem Andern dienen, oder ob im Gegentheil alle Knechtschaft der Natur zuwider sei, das ist noch zu untersuchen.Es ist jedoch nicht schwer die Frage sowohl aus dem Begriff der Sache als aus der Erfahrung zu entscheiden.", "1890": "Das Verhältniß deS Beherrschens und Beherrschtwerdens gehört nicht blos zu den noth­ wendigen sondern auch zu den nützlichen Dingen, und gleich von der Entstehung scheidet sich Einiges mit der Bestimmung zum Herrschen, Anderes zum Beherrschtwerden.", "1891": "Auch gibt eS viele Arten deS Herrschenden und des Beherrschten, und je vorzüglicher die Beherrsch­ ten sind, desto vorzüglicher ist auch die Herrschaft, z.", "1892": "B. die Herrschaft über einen Menschen besser als über ein Thier.", "1893": "^ Denn was die Besseren vollbringen, das ist auch ein besseres Werk;", "1894": "wo aber daS Eine herrscht, das Andere beherrscht wird, da gibt eS immer ein ge­ meinsames Werk.Bei Allem was ans mehreren Theilen besteht und zu einem ge­ meinsamen Ganzen verbunden ist, sei es aus zusammenhängenden oder an sich getrennten Theilen, erscheint immer auch das.Herrschende und das Beherrschte.", "1895": "Und dieses Verhältniß ist unter der gesammten Natur eine wesentliche Eigenschaft der beseelten Geschöpfe.", "1896": "Denn auch in den leblosen Dingen gibt es eine Art von Herrschaft, z. B. m der Harmonie;", "1897": "doch das gehört vielleicht einer anderweitigen Unter­ suchung an.", "1898": "Am Lebenden aber bemerken wir zuerst daß es aus Seele und Leib besteht, von denen daS Eine von Natur das Herrschende, das Andere das Beherrschte ist.", "1899": "Das Naturgemäße muß man aber an den Dingen im natürlichen Zustand, nicht an den verdorbenen beobachten.", "1900": "Daher haben wir den Menschen im vollkommensten Zustand nach Seele und Leib zu betrachten, an welchem sich dieses Verhältniß offenbart.", "1901": "Denn bei Lasterhaften und Schwächlingen scheint freilich oft der Leib über die Seele zu herrschen, weil sie in einem schlechten und naturwi­ drigen Zustande sich befinden.", "1902": "Wir können also, sage ich, zunächst in dem lebenden Einzelwesen beides, das Verhältniß des Herrn und des Knechts und das des Re­ genten und der Unterthanen, wahrnehmen:", "1903": "die Seele beherrscht den Körper wie der Herr den Knecht, die Vernunft aber die Begierden wie der Regent die Untergebenen.", "1904": "Dabei ist es einleuchtend daß es natur­ gemäß und zuträglich ist wenn der Körper von der Seele und der leiden­ schaftliche Theil von der Vernunft und dem verständigen Theile be­ herrscht wird, die Gleichheit aber oder gar Umkehrung des Verhält­ nisses allen Theilen schädlich.", "1905": "Dasselbe Verhältniß findet sodann unter Menschen und unter den Thieren zu einander statt:", "1906": "die zahmen Thiere sind ihrer Natur nach besser als die wilden;", "1907": "für diese alle aber ist es besser von dem Men­ schen beherrscht zu werden, denn das ist die Bedingung ihrer Erhal­ tung.", "1908": "Vergleicht-man ferner das Männliche und Weibliche, so ist auch hier das Eine stärker, daS Andere schwächer, das Eine herrschend, daS Andere beherrscht.Auf dieselbe Weise muß es sich nothwendig mit den Mensche» überhaupt verhalten.", "1909": "Soviel ihrer hinter den andern so weit zurück- stehen wie der Leib hinter der Seele und das Thier gegen den Men­ schen (dieß ist aber der Fall bei allen denen deren Aufgabe im Ge­ brauch der Körperkräfte besteht und deren beste Leistung dieses ist), diese sind von Natur Knechte, und diesen ist es besser auf solche Art regiert zu werden, so sehr als den vorhergenannten Dingen.", "1910": "Denn von Natur Sklave ist derjenige welcher eines Andern Eigenthum sein kann (und darum eben ist er es auch) und der an der Vernunft nur so viel Antheil hat um Vernunft annehmen zu können, ohne selbst Vernunft zu besitzen;", "1911": "während die übrigen lebenden Wesen auch nicht einmal Vernunft annehmen, sondern den sinnlichen Trieben gehorchen.", "1912": "Der Nutzen von beiden ist übrigens wenig verschieden:", "1913": "denn beide, die Sklaven und die zahmen Thiere, leisten durch ihre Körperkräfte Bei­ stand zur Erwerbung deS Nothwendigen.", "1914": "Nun liegt es zwar in der Absicht der Natur auch die Körper der Freien und der Sklaven verschiedenartig zu bilden, diese kräftig zum Nothwendigen Gebrauch, jene dagegen aufrecht und unbrauchbar zu körperlichen Arbeiten, um so mehr aber zum staatsbürgerlichen Leben geschickt (doch auch dieses ist wiederum geschieden in die kriegerische und die friedliche Thätigkeit);", "1915": "häufig aber trifft es sich umgekehrt daß die Einen nur die Körper freier Menschen haben, die Andern aber die Seelen.Nun ist gewiß einleuchtend:", "1916": "wenn es Menschen gäbe die an Körpergröße allein so weit hervorragten als die Bilder der Götter, so würde Jedermann gestehen daß die übrigen von Rechtswegen sich die­ sen unterwerfen müssen.", "1917": "Ist aber dieß in Beziehung auf den Körper wahr, so kann mit n^ch größerem Rechte eben diese Unterscheidung unter den Seelen gemacht werden;", "1918": "nur ist es nicht ebenso leicht die Schönheit der Seele zu erkennen wie die des Körpers.", "1919": "Somit ist es denn einleuchtend daß von Natur Einige frei.", "1920": "Andere Sklaven sind, und für diese ist es sowohl vortheilhaft als recht daß sie Sklaven­ dienste thun.i6.", "1921": "Es ist übrigens nicht schwer einzusehen daß auch diejenigen welche das Gegentheil behaupten in gewisser Beziehung Recht haben.", "1922": "Denn die Ausdrücke „Sklave sein\" und „Sklave\" haben eine doppelte Bedeutung.", "1923": "Es gibt nämlich auch Sklaven nach dem Gesetz.", "1924": "Dieses Gesetz ist eine Art Uebereinkunft wodurch man das im Krieg Eroberte als Eigenthum des Eroberers anerkennt.", "1925": "Dieses positive Recht klagen nun manche Gesetzeskundige wie einen Vplksredner der Gesetzwidrig­ keit an *), weil es empörend sei daß der überwältigte Theil Sklave und Unterthan dessen werden soll der ihn zu überwältigen vermag weil er an Macht der Stärkere ist.", "1926": "Und so sind die Meinungen getheilt, auch unter den Philosophen.Die Ursache dieser Meinungsverschiedenheit, welche eben Gründe für und wider zuläßt, liegt in dem Umstand daß die Tüchtigkeit in gewisser Hinsicht, wenn sie mit äußern Mittel ausgestattet ist, am mei­ sten zu überwältigen vermag und daß die siegende Kraft immer auf irgend einem sittlichen Vorzug beruht, daher denn die Uebermacht nicht ohno innere Ueberlegenheit zu sein scheint und der Streit sich nur um die Berechtigung dreht.", "1927": "Mit Rücksicht aus diesen Punkt nämlich sehen die Einen in der Gerechtigkeit eine wohlwollende Gesinnung, während Andern eben das gerecht scheint daß der Stärkere herrsche.", "1928": "Bei diesen einander entgegengesetzten Ansichten finden sich einmal auf der einen Seite durchaus keine stichhaltigen Gründe um den Satz umzustoßen daß eS dem an Tüchtigkeit Bevorzugten zukomme zu regieren und zu herrschen.", "1929": "Dagegen halten sich Einige ausschließlich an ein gewisses Recht, wie sie meinen (denn das Gesetz ist eine Berechtigung), und erklären die Sklaverei in Folge eines Krieges für gerecht;", "1930": "eben damit aber leugnen sie das auch.", "1931": "Denn der Anfang des Krieges kann auch ungerecht sein, und dann wird doch gewiß Niemand behaupten wollen daß der welcher es nicht verdient Sklave zu sein Sklave sei;", "1932": "sonst müßte­ die Folge sein daß Leute von der edelsten Geburt Sklaven werden und (ihre Kinder) Sklavenkinder, wenn der Fall eintritt daß sie gefangen genommen und verkauft wurden.", "1933": "Deßwegen wollen sie den Namen „Sklave\" nicht von den Hellenen gebrauchen, sondern nur von den Barbaren.", "1934": "Allein, wenn sie sich so ausdrücken, haben sie nichts Anderes als die natürliche Sklaverei im Auge, wie wir sie von vornherein bestimmt haben.", "1935": "Denn das muß man zugeben daß eS Menschen gibt die überall Sklaven sind, und andere die es nir­ gends sind.Es verhält sich damit wie mit dem Geburtsadel:", "1936": "sich selbst achten die Hellenen für edelgeboren, nicht allein in der Heimat sondern überall, die Barbaren aber nur in ihrer Heimat, weil es ein unbe­ dingt Edles und Freies gebe, und ein Anderes nur unter Umständen, wie Helena bei Theodektes *) sagt:", "1937": "Von beiden Eltern aus der Götter Stamm ein Sproß, Wer dürst' es wagen Sklavin anzureden mich?", "1938": "Indem sie so sprechen unterscheiden sie das Sklavische und das Freie, daS Edelgeborne und das Unedle nur nach dem innern Werth und Unwerth.", "1939": "Denn sie setzen voraus daß wie ein Mensch nur einen Men­ schen, ein Thier nur ein Thier, so auch Edle nur einen Edlen zeugen.", "1940": "Allerdings will dieß die Natur gewöhnlich bewirken, sie vermag eS aber nicht immer.Daß also die Meinungsverschiedenheit einigen Grund hat und die Menschen nicht durchaus von Natur entweder frei oder Sklaven sind ist klar, so wie auch daß dieser Unterschied bei Einigen bestimmt ehervortritt, so daß es dem Einen vortheilhast ist zu dienen, dem An­ dern zu herrschen.", "1941": "In diesem Fall ist es somit ^uch gerecht daß der eine Theil gehorche, der andere regiere, in der ihrer eigenthümlichen Natur angemessenen Weise, also beziehungsweise auch als Herr.", "1942": "Ein schlimmer Gebrauch der Herrschaft ist freilich beiden Theilen nach­ theilig.", "1943": "Denn was dem Theil nützlich ist ist es auch dem Ganzen, wie der Seele so auch dem Körper.", "1944": "Der Sklave aber ist ein Theil seines Herrn, gleichsam wie ein für sich bestehender beseelter Theil des KörperS.", "1945": "Deßhalb besteht auch ein Verhältniß des gegenseitigen Vortheils und der Freundschaft zwischen Sklaven und Herrn, so weit sie von Natur dazu bestimmt sind;", "1946": "sind sie aber nicht auf diese Weise, sondern nach dem Gesetz und durch Zwang zusammengekommenso findet das Gegentheil statt.7.", "1947": "Hieraus ist aber auch einleuchtend daß Hausherrschast und Staatsverwaltung nicht einerlei und überhaupt nicht alle Negierungs­ arten einander gleich sind, wie Einige behaupten').", "1948": "Denn das Eine ist Herrschaft über Freie von Natur, das Andere über Sklaven, und die Haushaltungskunst ist Alleinherrschaft (denn jedes Haus wird von Einem regiert), die republikanische Regierung aber ist eine unter Freien »amd Gleichen getheilte Herrschaft.", "1949": "Herr heißt also Einer nicht wegen seiner Wissenschaft, sondern wegen einer natürlichen Eigenschaft.", "1950": "Ebenso auch der Sklave und der Freie.", "1951": "Doch kann es auch eine Wissenschaft von dem Berufe des Herrn und des Sklaven geben.", "1952": "Für Sklaven eine wie die welche Jener in Syrakus lehrte.", "1953": "Dort nämlich unterrichtete Einer um Lohn die Diener in dem Kreis ihrer Dienstverrichtungen.", "1954": "Der Unterricht in diesen Dingen ließe sich noch weiter ausdehnen, z. B. auf die Koch­ kunst und andere ähnliche Arten der Bedienung.", "1955": "Denn es ist eine Dienstverrichtung vor der andern bald anständiger, bald nothwen­ diger, und nach dem SprüchwortEin Sklave vor dem Sklaven, vor dem Herrn ein Herr.Das also wären lauter Kenntnisse für Sklaven.", "1956": "Die Wissenschaft des Herrn dagegen betrifft die Benutzung der Sklaven.", "1957": "Denn nicht in der Erwerbung von Sklaven, sondern in der Benutzung derselben zeigt sich der Herr.", "1958": "Diese Wissenschaft hat aber nichts Großes und Er­ . habeneS;", "1959": "was der Knecht zu verrichten verstehen muß, das soll Jener zu befehlen wissen.", "1960": "Wer daher nicht nöthig hat sich selbst damit zu Plagen, der überläßt diese Ehre seinem Hausmeister;", "1961": "er selbst aber beschäftigt sich mit Staatsgeschäften oder mit Philosophie.", "1962": "Eine dritte Art von Beschäftigung neben diesen beiden ist die Erwerbskunde, ' so weit sie gerecht ist, wie Kriegskunde und Jagdwissenschaft.", "1963": "So viel von dem Verhältniß des Herrn und Sklaven.s s8. (3.)", "1964": "Run wollen wir in der angefangenen Weise den Besitz im Allgemeinen und die Bereicherungskunst in ihrem ganzen Umfang betrachten, da ja auch der Sklave uns als ein Theil des Besitzes er­ schien.", "1965": "Zunächst könnte man nun die Frage aufwerfen:", "1966": "ob die Be­ reicherungskunst einerlei sei mit der Haushaltungskunst, oder ein Theil von ihr, oder eine ihr untergeordnete Hilfswissenschaft, und wenn untergeordnet, ob in der Art wie die Weberschiffmacherkunst der Webe­ kunst oder wie die Erzschmelze der Bildgießerei;", "1967": "denn diese beiden helfen nicht auf die gleiche Art, sondern die eine liefert Werkzeuge, die» andere den Stoff.", "1968": "Stoff aber nenne ich das Gegebene, aus welchem ein Werk verfertigt wird, was für den Weber die Wolle, für den Bild­ gießer das Erz ist.Daß nun die Bereicherungskunst nicht einerlei ist mit der Haus­ haltungskunst ist klar;", "1969": "denn jene hat es mit der Anschaffung, diese mit dem Verbrauch zu thun.", "1970": "Welche andere Kunst sollte sich mit der Ver­ wendung der Norräthe des Hauses beschäftigen, außer der Haushal- tungskunst?", "1971": "Ob sie aber ein Theil von dieser oder eine Wissenschaft für sich sei, darüber läßt sich streiten.", "1972": "Denn wenn es die Aufgabe des Bereicherungskundigen ist darauf zu sehen woher Geld und Gut kom­ men soll, Besitz und Reichthum aber so vielerlei Bestandtheile umfaßt, so ist zuerst zu untersuchen ob der Ackerbau und überhaupt die Be­ sorgung und Erwerbung der Nahrungsmittel ein Theil der Bereiche­ rungskunft oder von anderer Art sei.Nun gibt es freilich viele Arten von Nahrungsmitteln, und deß­ wegen auch vielerlei Lebensweisen der Menschen sowohl als der Thiere.", "1973": "Ohne Nahrung kann man nicht leben;", "1974": "daher bedingt die Verschieden­ heit der Nahrung auch den Unterschied in der Lebensweise der Ge­ schöpfe.", "1975": "Bon den Thieren leben die einen heerdenweis, die andern vereinzelt, je nachdem es ihnen zum Behuf der Nahrung zuträglich ist, weil einige von Fleisch, andere von Früchten, wieder andere von Allem leben.", "1976": "Darum hat die Natur mit Rücksicht auf die leichtere Auffin­ dung und die Wahl ihrer Nahrungsmittel ihre Lebensweisen gesondert.", "1977": "Weil aber nicht jeder Art von Thieren dieselbe Nahrung von Natur mundet, sondern der einen diese, der andern eine andere, so sind auch die Lebensweisen der fleischfressenden sowohl als der pflanzenfressenden unter sich wieder verschieden.Ebenso verhält es sich mit den Menschen:", "1978": "ihre Lebensweise ist sehr vershcieden.", "1979": "Die trägsten sind Nomaden, denn die Nahrung von den zahmen Thieren wird ihnen ohne Mühe in völliger Unthätigkeit zu Theil:", "1980": "wird es aber für ihre Heerden nöthig der Waide wegen den Aufenthalt zu verändern, sind auch sie genöthigt ihnen zu folgen, und so treiben sie gleichsam einen lebendigen Landbau.", "1981": "Andere leben von der Jagd, und auch von dieser in verschiedener Weise:", "1982": "nämlich bald vom Seeraub *), bald von der Fischerei, so weit sie an Seen, Süm­ pfen, Flüssen oder an einem geeigneten Meere wohnen, bald von der Jagd auf Vögel oder wilde Thiere.", "1983": "Der größte Theil der Menschheit aber lebt von der Erde und von angebauten Früchten.Dieß also sind ungefähr die Lebensweisen, so weit sich die Men­ schen ihren Unterhalt durch eine von der Natur angewiesene Thätig­ keit unmittelbar und nicht durch Tausch und Handel verschaffen:", "1984": "die des Nomaden, des Ackerbauers, des Seeräubers, deS Fischers, des Jägers.", "1985": "Einige machen sich das Leben angenehmer durch eine Ver­ bindung einiger dieser Lebensarten, indem sie daS dringendste Bedürf­ niß da wo es gerade fehlt aus der andern ergänzen, wie die Einen daS Hirten- und Seeräuberleben, Andere den Landbau und die Jagd ver­ binden.", "1986": "Und so ist es auch mit den übrigen Lebensweise»:", "1987": "wie daS Bedürfniß es erfordert, so treiben sie es.Diese Art von Besitz hat also die Natur offenbar allen lebenden' Wesen angewiesen, wie gleich bei der Entstehung so auch wenn sie ausgewachsen sind.", "1988": "Denn gleich im Augenblick des Gebärens bringen i die Thiere zum Theil so viel Nahrung mit hervor als genügt, bis das Erzeugte sich selbst damit versorgen kann, wie diejenigen welche Wür­ mer^) oder Eier legen;", "1989": "was aber lebendige Junge gebiert hat für das Erzeugte auf einige Zeit die Nahrung in sich:", "1990": "das ist die Milcherzeu­ gung.", "1991": "Wenden wir dieß auf die Erwahcsenen an, so läßt sich daraus abnehmen daß die Pflanzen der Thiere wegen und die Thiere der Men­ schen wegen da sind, die zahmen sowohl zur Nutzung als zur Nah­ rung, von den wilden wo nicht alle so doch die meisten zur Nahrung und auch für andere Bedürfnisse, um Kleider und Werkzeuge von ihnen zu bekommen.", "1992": "Wenn nämlich die Natur einerseits nichts Mangelhaftes, anderseits nichts vergeblich schafft, so folgt nothwendig daß sie alles Andere der Menschen wegen geschaffen hat.", "1993": "Darum ist auch die Kriegskunst in gewissem Sinn eine Erwerbs­ kunst.", "1994": "Denn die Jagd ist ein Theil von ihr, deren man sich nicht allein gegen die Thiere sondern auch gegen solche Menschen bedienen muß welche, obgleich von Natur dazu bestimmt, sich nicht wollen be­ herrschen lassen, weil ein solcher Krieg von Natur gerecht ist -).Eine Art des natürlichen Erwerbs bildet also einen Theil der Haushaltungskunst, so fern die zum Leben nothwendigen und zum ge­ meinen Nutzen des Staates oder der Familie dienlichen Gegenstände, die man im Vorrath halten kann, entweder dasein oder durch die Er­ werbskunst beschafft werden müssen.", "1995": "Und wirklich scheint in diesen Sachen der wahre Reichthum zu bestehen.", "1996": "Denn das zum Lebens­ genuß hinreichende Maß von solchem Besitz ist nicht unbegrenzt, wie Solon in dem Verse behauptet:", "1997": "Reichthum hat kein Ziel das kenntlich den Menschen gesteckt ist.", "1998": "Es ist allerdings auch hier ein solches gesteckt, wie für jede andere Kunst.", "1999": "Denn in keiner einzigen Kunst ist die Zahl oder die Große der Werkzeuge unbegrenzt;", "2000": "der Reichthum aber ist ein Vorrath von Werkzeugen zum Gebrauch in der Haus- und der Staatswirtschaft.", "2001": "So­ mit ist es ausgemacht daß es eine naturgemäße Erwerbskunt sfür Haus­ halter und Staatsmänner gibt;", "2002": "und warum es eine solche gibt ist klar.9.", "2003": "Es gibt aber noch eine andere Art von Erwerbskunst, die man vorzugsweise und mit Recht Bereicherungskunst nennt, und für diese scheint allerdings Reichthum und Besitz kein Ziel zu haben.e", "2004": "Viele halten sie wegen der nahen Verwandtschaft für eine und dieselbe Wissenschaft mit der ebenbesprochenen.", "2005": "Sie ist aber weder einerlei mit der genannten noch auch sehr entfernt von ihr.", "2006": "Die eine ist von der Natur an die Hand gegeben, die andere nicht, sondern sie beruht auf Uebung und Kunstfertigkeit:", "2007": "es ist der Unterschied von natürlicher und künstlicher Wirtschaft.", "2008": "Nehmen wir bei ihrer Betrachtung einmal folgenden Ausgangs­ punkt.", "2009": "Jedes Besitzthum läßt eine doppelte Benutzung zu.", "2010": "Beide Arten betreffen die Sache an sich, aber nicht in gleicher Weise:", "2011": "die eine Benutzungsart ist dem Gegenstand eigenthümlich, die andere nicht, z. B. das Anziehen eines Schuhes und der Umtausch.", "2012": "Beides ist Benutzung des Schuhes.", "2013": "Auch der welcher ihn an den der einen Schuh bedarf um Geld oder Eßwaare vertauscht benutzt den Schuh als Schuh, aber nicht nach seiner eigenthümlichen Bestimmung, denn der Schuh ist nicht für den Umtausch gemacht.", "2014": "Ebenso verhält eS sich mit den andern Besitzstücken.", "2015": "Denn der Umtausch läßt sich auf AlleS anwenden, obgleich er zunächst von dem natürlichen Bedürfniß ausgeht, weil die Menschen von dem Einen mehr haben als nöthig, . von dem Andern weniger.Offenbar ist darum auch der Kleinhandel seinem Ursprung nach noch kein Theil der Bereicherungskunst, denn der nothwendige Tausch war auf die Befriedigung des nächsten Bedürfnisses beschränkt.", "2016": "In der ersten Gesellschaft (dieß ist die Familie) hat man ihn offenbar nicht nöthig, sondern erst mit der Vergrößerung der Gesellschaft.", "2017": "Denn die Glieder der erstern hatten Alles mit einander gemein was zu dem­ selben Eigenthum gehörte;", "2018": "die Andern aber, bei getrennten Besitzungen, noch vieles Andere dazu, wovon sie nach Bedürfniß einander'mittheilen mußten, und das geschah mittelst des Tausches, wie sich jetzt noch manche barbarische Völker zu helfen suchen.", "2019": "Denn sie tauschen nur Bedürfnisse gegen Bedürfnisse, weiter hinaus nichts, z.", "2020": "B. sie geben und nehmen Wein gegen Getreide und dergleichen mehr.Dieser Tauschhandel geht also weder über die Natur hinaus, noch ist er eine Art von Bereicherungskunst, denn er dient blos zur Ergänzung des naturgemäßen und hinlänglichen Bedarfes.", "2021": "Aber auS diesem Handel ist jene Kunst in nothwendiger Folge entstanden.", "2022": "Da nämlich die Aushülse immer weiter hergeholt wurde, indem man ein­ führte woran man Mangel, und ausführte woran man Ueberfluß hatte, so kam man nothwendigerweise auf den Gebrauch des Geldes.", "2023": "Dein nicht jedes der natürlichen Bedürfnisse ist leicht verführbar.", "2024": "Deßwegen kamen sie zum Behuf des Tauschhandels überein etwas zu geben und anzunehmen was, selbst zu den Bedürfnissen gehörig, im täglichen Verkehr leicht von Hand zu Hand gieng, wie Eisens Silber u. dgl.", "2025": "Zuerst wurde es einfach nach Größe und Gewicht bestimmt, zuletzt aber drückte man ihm einen Stempel auf, um sich das Abwägen zu ersparen;", "2026": "denn der Stempel ward als Zeichen des Werthes dar­ aufgesetzt.", "2027": "Nachdem nun einmal aus dem Bedürfniß des Tausches das Geld hervorgegangen war, entstand die andere Art der Bereicherungskunst, 5«r Kaufhandel, von Anfang wahrscheinlich sehr einfach, bald aber, in Folge der Uebung, schon künstlicher, indem man darauf dachte wie und Woher der Umsatz des Geldes am meisten Gewinn bringen werde.", "2028": "Darum scheint die Bereicherungskunst sich hauptsächlich mit dem Geld zu beschäftigen, und ihre Aufgabe ist darauf zu speculieren woraus sich recht viel Geld machen lasse.", "2029": "Denn sie ist als die Kunst anzusehen Reichthum und Schätze zu erwerben.", "2030": "Auch setzt man ja häufig den Keichthum in.großen Geldvorrath, weil die Bereicherungskunst und Her Handel darauf gerichtet ist.", "2031": "Unter Umständen erscheint aber das Geld auch wieder als bloßer Tand und eine willkürliche Satzung, dem Wesen nach nichts;", "2032": "denn wenn diejenigen bei denen es im Gebrauch ist es abschätzen, so ist eS werthlos und zu keinem Bedürfniß mehr nütze, und beim größten Geldreichthum kann man oft an der nothdürftigsten Nahrung Mangel leiden;", "2033": "es wäre nun doch ein sonderbares Ding um den Reichthum, in dessen Vollbesitz man Hunger sterben könne, wie die Fabel von MidaS erzählt, dem in Folge seines unersättlichen Wunsches Alles was ihm vorgesetzt werden mochte zu Gold wurde.", "2034": "Daher sucht man den Reichthum anders zu bestimmen als die Bereicherungskunst, und thut recht daran.", "2035": "Denn die Bereicherungs­ kunst ist verschieden vom natürlichen Reichthum:", "2036": "letztere Art sich zu bereichern ist Sache der Haushaltungskunst, die andere des Handels, die nicht auf alle Weise, sondern nur durch den Umsatz Reichthum erwirbt.", "2037": "Sie hat es nur mit dem Gelde zu thun, denn das Geld ist Anfang und Ende des Tausches;", "2038": "und der Reichthum, der aus dieser Art von Bereicherungskunst stammt, ist wirklich ohne Grenzen.", "2039": "Wie nämlich die Heilkunde auf das Gesundmachen ins Unendliche ausgeht, und jede Kunst ins Unendliche ihr Ziel verfolgt, denn dieses zu erreichen ist fort und fort ihre Absicht, während sie nach Mitteln zum Zweck nicht ins Unendliche strebt, denn das erreichte Ziel ist die Grenze für deren Anwendung —:", "2040": "so hat auch diese Bereicherungskunst keine Begrenzung ihres Ziels;", "2041": "ihr Zweck (nicht Mittel zum Zweck) ist diese Art von Reichthum, der Geldbesitz.Die Haushaltungskunst dagegen, die nicht aufs Geldmachen aus­ geht, hat ihre Grenze;", "2042": "nicht die Bereicherung ist ihre Aufgabe.", "2043": "Daher scheint einerseits aller Reichthum eine nothwendige Grenze zu haben;", "2044": "in der Wirklichkeit sehen wir aber das Gegentheil, denn Alle die sich bereichern wollen vermehren ihr Geld ins Unendliche.", "2045": "Die Ursache der Verwechselung liegt in der nahen Verwandtschaft beider Arten.", "2046": "Da nämlich beide Arten von Erwerb denselben Gegenstand haben, so spielen sie in der Anwendung ineinander:", "2047": "die Anwendung wird von einem und demselben Besitz gemacht, aber nicht zum gleichen Zwecke, sondern die eine Art hat einenZweck außer dem Besitz, die andere blos den der Vermehrung desselben.", "2048": "Daher halten Einige das Letztere für die Aufgabe der Haushaltungskunst und bleiben dabei daß man den Geldbesitz entweder unverändert erhalten oder ins Unendliche ver­ mehren müsse", "2049": ".Der Grund dieser Ansicht liegt darin daß das Trachten der Men­ schen nur auf das Leben gerichtet ist, nicht aber auf den Lebensgenuß;", "2050": "weil nun die Lust zu leben ins Unendliche geht, so verlangen sie auch nach endloser Anhäufung der Mittel dazu.", "2051": "Andere, die es zwar auch auf den Lebensgenuß anlegen, suchen nur die Mittel zu sinnlichen Ge­ nüssen, und da auch diese natürlich mit dem Besitz gegeben sind, so geht ihr ganzes Treiben auf Gelderwerb, und daraus ist eben die andere Art der Bereicherungskunst hervorgegangen.", "2052": "Denn da der Sinnengenuß im Uebermaß besteht, so suchen sie die Mittel zu diesem Uebermaß des Genusses;", "2053": "und können sie diese nicht durch die Bereiche­ rungskunst anschaffen, so versuchen sie es auf anderem Wege, indem sie jede ihrer Anlagen und Kräfte der natürlichen Bestimmung zuwider dazu verwenden.", "2054": "Die Mannhaftigkeit ist nicht bestimmt Geld zu ver­ schaffen, sondern Mut;", "2055": "eben so wenig die Kriegskunst oder Heilkunde, sondern die eine um Sieg, die andere Gesundheit zu verleihen.", "2056": "Jene Leute aber machen alle Künste zu Mitteln der Bereicherung, da ja dieß ihr Zweck sei und auf den Zweck Alles bezogen werden müsse.Betreffend die nicht durch daS Bedürfniß gebotene Bereichernngs­ kunst ist nun auseinandergesetzt was sie sei und warum wir sie treiben ;", "2057": "- zugleich ist von der nothwendigen Erwerbskunst gesagt daß sie etwas Anderes sei, und zwar naturgemäß ein Theil der Haushal­ tungSkunst, derjenige

ob die Bereicherungskunst Sache des Haushalters und des Staats­ mannes sei oder nicht.", "2059": "Offenbar müssen die Mittel gegeben sein:", "2060": "denn wie die Staatskunst nicht erst Menschen schafft, sondern sie von der Natur empfängt und Gebrauch von ihnen macht, so muß die Natur auch den Unterhalt hergeben, sei es von der Erde oder vom Meer oder sonst woher;", "2061": "diese Mittel

unbrauchbaren zu unterscheiden.", "2063": "Sonst könnte man auch fragen, warum die Bereicherungskunst ein Theil der Haus­ haltungskunst sein soll, die Heilkunde aber nicht;", "2064": "bedürfen doch die Hausgenossen der Gesundheit sowohl als des Lebens und anderer Bedingungen.", "2065": "Allein wie der Hausvater und Regent in einer Be­ ziehung allerdings auch auf die Gesundheit sehen muß, in anderer aber der Arzt, so ist auch der Gelderwerb in einer Beziehung Sache der Haushaltung, in anderer nicht, sondern Sache der Hülfswissen­ schaft ;", "2066": "hauptsächlich aber muß, wie gesagt, das Vermögen von der Natur gegeben sein.", "2067": "Denn Sache der Natur ist es ihrem Geschöpfe Nahrung zu gewähren, und jedes hat seine Nahrung in den übrigen Erzeugnissen dessen woraus es geworden

theils zur Haushaltung gehörig, und die letztere nothwendig und löblich, die > andere, die sich mit dem Umsatz beschäftigt, wird mit Recht getadelt.", "2070": "denn sie ist nicht naturgemäß, sondern auf Uebervortheilung gegründet;", "2071": "mit vollstem Recht aber ist das Wucherhandwerk verhaßt, weil eS auS dem Gelde selbst den Gewinn zieht und eS nicht dazu verwendet wozu eS erfunden ist.",

ist übrigens die Theorie der freie, die Praxis der gebundene Theil.", "2078": "Folgendes sind die praktischen Elemente der Bereicherungskunst:", "2079": "die Gegenstände des Besitzes genau zu kennen

Sicherheit, theils durch größeren Gewinn;", "2086": "ein zweiter ist daS Geldgeschäft, ein dritter das Lohngewerbe.", "2087": "Zu letzterem gehören theils das Handwerk, theils die Classe der Gewerblofen die nur mit ihren Körperkräften nützlich werden.", "2088": "Nun gibt es aber noch eine dritte Art von Bereicherungskunst, zwischen dieser und der ersten mitten inne.", "2089": "denn sie hängt einerseits mit der natürlichen, anderseits mit der künst­ lichen zusammen und umfaßt Alles was aus der Erde kommt und von den Erzeugnissen der Erde die zwar nicht fruchttragenden aber doch nützlichen, z.", "2090": "B. die Holzung und der gesammte Bergbau.", "2091": "Der letztere begreift wieder so viele Zweige als es Arten von Mineralien gibt.", "2092": "Von jedem dieser Theile ist im

Leichtes wäre reich zu werden, wenn sie wollten, daß eS aber das nicht sei wonach sie streben.Thales also soll auf diese Art eine Probe seiner Weisheit abge­ legt haben;", "2105": "es ist aber, wie gesagt, eine allgemeine Regel der Be­ reicherungskunk, wenn Einer sich den ausschließlichen Handel mit etwas zu verschaffen weiß.", "2106": "Deßhalb machen sich auch'manche Staaten auf diesem Weg ihre Einnahmen, wenn sie in Geldverlegenheit sind:", "2107": "sie ziehen den Alleinhandel der Waaren an sich.", "2108": "In Sicilien kaufte Einer bei dem eine Summe Geldes hinterlegt war alles Eisen aus

B. Weisheit, Tapferkeit, Gerechtigkeit und sonstige Vorzüge dieser Art, oder über­ haupt gar keine außer der körperlichen Dienstleistung.", "2131": "Die Sache hat nämlich eine doppelte Schwierigkeit:", "2132": "gibt es eine solche Tugend, worin unterscheiden sie sich noch von den Freien?", "2133": "Und gibt es keine, so ist das im Widerspruch mit ihrer Eigenschaft als Menschen und ver­ nunftbegabte Wesen.", "2134": "Fast derselbe Zweifel entsteht aber auch in Betreff der Frau und der Kinder, ob auch sie sittliche Eigenschaften haben können, ob die Frau weise, tapfer und gerecht sein soll, und ob der Knabe sowohl un­ gesittet als sittsam sein kann oder nicht?", "2135": "Man muß also die Frage allgemein stellen in Betreff des von Natur gehorchenden und deS regie­ renden Theils:", "2136": "ob

des Dienenden, und ebenso verhält es sich mit den übrigen Tugen­ den.", "2155": "Dieß wird auch klar wenn man die Tugenden mehr im Einzelnen betrachtet;", "2156": "denn man täuscht sich wenn man so im

für den Erzieher.Ebenso ist es mit der Tugend des Sklaven im Verhältniß zum Herrn.", "2160": "Nun haben wir angenommen daß der Sklave nur zu den nothwendigen Geschäften brauchbar sei;", "2161": "er bedarf also offenbar einer geringeren Tugend, und zwar nur so viel daß er nicht auS Unbändigkeit oder aus Trägheit seine Arbeiten vernach­ läßige.", "2162": "l iNun könnte man weiter fragen:", "2163":

irgend ein anderer Handwerker ist das waS er ist keineswegs von Natur.Mithin ist es einleuchtend daß der Herr es ist der dem Sklaven die ihm eigenthümliche Tugend beibringen muß, ohne daß er die Kunst verstehen müßte ihn in seinen Arbeiten zu unterrichten.", "2171": "Deßhalb ist es unrichtig den Sklaven die Belehrung zu entziehen und zu behaupten man dürfe nur den Befehl gegen ihn anwenden *);", "2172": "denn die Sklaven bedürfen einer vernünftigen Zurechtweisung noch viel mehr als die Kinder.", "2173": "Hiemit soll nun dieses Verhältniß naher bestimmt sein.", "2174": "Ueber Mann und Weib, Kinder und Vater, über die jedem Theil entspre­ chende Tugend, ihren Umgang mit einander, darüber was für sie an­ ständig und was nicht anständig sei und wie sie dem Guten nachjagen, das Schlechte aber fliehen sollen, werden wir noch in der Untersuchung über die Staatsverfassuugen zu sprechen nöthig haben.", "2175": "Denn da diese Verhältnisse der Familie angehören und die Familie ein Theil deS Staates ist, die Tugend des Theils aber in Beziehung auf das Ganze stehen soll, so folgt nothwendig daß man auch in der Erziehung der Kinder und Weiber stets Rücksicht auf die Staatsverfassung neh­ men muß, wenn eS anders für die Tüchtigkeit des Staates darauf ankommt daß auch die Weiber und Kinder tüchtig werden.", "2176": "Und eS muß darauf ankommen, denn die Weiber machen die Hälfte der Freien aus und auS den Kindern wachsen die Mitglieder des Staates heran.", "2177": "Nachdem wir also daS Eine so weit erledigt, über das Andere aber im Folgenden noch zu sprechen haben, so wollen wir hier ab­ schließen und einen neuen Abschnitt beginnen.", "2178": "Zunächst werden wir unsere Aufmerksamkeit auf diejenigen richten die über die beste StaatS- Verfassung geschrieben haben.1.", "2179": "Da wir beabsichtigen zu untersuchen, welches die beste von allen bürgerlichen Gesellschaften sei für Leute die möglichst nach Wunsch leben können, so müssen wir auch die vorhandenen Staats­ verfassungen in Betracht ziehen, und zwar sowohl diejenigen welche in gewissen für wohleingerichtet geltenden Staaten im Gebrauch sind, als auch solche die etwa von Schriftstellern dargestellt und mit Beifall aufgenommen sind, damit man einestheils das Richtige und Nützliche daran erkenne, anderntheils damit es nicht als blose Eitelkeit, welche die eigene Weisheit zur Schau stellen will, erscheine, wenn wir über jene hinausgehend etwas Anderes aufsuchen, vielmehr der Beweis ge­ liefert werde daß wir diese Untersuchung deßwegen aufgenommen haben weil die bis jetzt vorhandenen Verfassungen unzureichend sind.", "2180": "Dabei müssen wir von einem Satze ausgehen der die natürliche Grundlage dieser Untersuchung bildet.", "2181": "Nothwendig müssen entweder alle Bürger eines Staates an Allem Antheil haben, oder an Nichts, oder an einigen Rechten, an anderen nicht.", "2182": "Daß sie an gar Nichts Antheil haben ist offenbar unmöglich, denn der Staat ist eine Gemein­ schaft;", "2183": "und vor allen Dingen muß wenigstens der Wohnort gemein­ sam sein, denn der eine Wohnort ist die Gemeinsamkeit einer Stadt, die Bürger aber sind Theilhaber der einen Stadt.", "2184": "Die Frage ist also vielmehr ob es besser sei daß in einem Staate welcher wohl einge­ richtet sein soll AlleS gemeinsam sei waS gemeinsam sein kann, oder aber Einiges zwar gemeinsam.", "2185": "Anderes nicht.", "2186": "Denn die Bürger können möglicherweise auch Weiber und Kinder und Güter mit ein­ ander gemein haben, wie in Platon's Staat.", "2187": "Dort nämlich*) behauptet Sokrates, es müssen die Kinder, die Weiber und das Vermögen ge­ mein sein.", "2188": "Es fragt sich also, ob es nach der gegenwärtig bestehen­ den Ordnung besser sei oder nach dem im platonischen Staate entwor­ fenen Gesetz.2.", "2189": "Abgesehen von vielen andern Schwierigkeiten welche die allgemeine Weibergemeinschaft hat, scheint auch die von Sokrates behauptete Nothwendigkeit einer solchen Staatseinrichtung gar nicht auS seinen Voraussetzungen zu folgen.", "2190": "Ueberdieß ist auch der End- zweck welchen er damit dem Staat gesetzt wissen will nach der vor- liegenden Darstellung ein Unding;", "2191": "wie aber der Widerspruch zu lösen sei ist nirgends bestimmt.", "2192": "Ich meine die Einheit des ganzen Staats, welche er als das möglichst beste Ziel desselben setzt.", "2193": "Denn dieß ist der Grundgedanke des-Sokrates.", "2194": "Offenbar muß ja doch der Staat, je mehr er zum Einswerden fortschreitet, am Ende aufhören Staat zu sein.", "2195": "Denn der Staat ist seiner Natur nach eine Vielheit;", "2196": "je mehr' er nun (numerisch) Eins wird, wird aus dem Staate eine Familie, aus der Familie eine Einzelperson;", "2197": "denn eine Familie kann man doch eher Eins nennen als einen Staat und den Einzelnen eher als eine Familie.", "2198": "Wenn also auch Jemand im Stande wäre den Staat so ein- fach zu machen, so dürfte er es nicht thun, weil er den Staat auf­ heben würde.Der Staat besteht aber

zweierlei.", "2201": "Jener nützt durch die Masse, wenn sie auch noch so gleich­ artig ist, wie ein weiteres Gewicht stärker zieht;", "2202": "denn die BundeS­ genossenschast ist zur Abwehr da.", "2203": "Durch die Art und Weise wird sich ein Staat auch von einer Völkerschaft unterscheiden, wo die Volksmenge nicht in Dörfern zerstreut ist, sondern vereinigt, wie die Arkadier ^).Wo eine organische Einheit entstehen soll müssen die Bestand- theile verschieden sein.", "2204": "Darum ist die wechselseitige Gleichheit (daS Gleichgewicht der Kräfte) das erhaltende Prinzip der Staaten, wie wir schon in der Ethik*) bemerkt haben;", "2205": "ja auch unter Freien und Gleichen muß nothwendig dieses statthaben, denn Alle zugleich können nicht regieren, sondern nur entweder Jahr um Jahr oder nach irgend einer anderen Ordnung und Zeitfolge.", "2206": "So ist es dann möglich daß Alle zur Regierung kommen, wie wenn die Schuster und Zimmerleute mit einander tauschten und nicht immer die nämlichen Personen Schu­ ster oder Zimmerleute blieben.", "2207": "Da es aber besser ist daß sie bleiben, so ist es offenbar auch für die bürgerliche Gesellschaft vortheilhafter daß wo möglich immer dieselben Personen regieren;", "2208": "wo es aber nicht möglich ist, weil Alle von Natur gleich sind (in diesem Fall ist es dann auch gerecht daß Alle am Regieren Theil bekommen, sei dieses nun etwas Gutes oder etwas Schlimmes), da ist es vortheilhafter die Einrichtung zu treffen daß die Gleichen der Reihe nach sich denen unterordnen die gerade an der Regierung sind.", "2209": "Die Einen regieren, die Andern ge­ horchen abwechselnd, als wären sie andere Leute geworden.", "2210": "In glei­ cher Weise bekleidet ja auch unter Regierenden der Eine dieses, der Andere ein anderes Amt.Hieraus erhellt nun doch daß diese Einheit des Staates ^) nicht seiner Natur gemäß ist, wie Einige meinen, daß vielmehr das was als das höchste Gut für die Staaten bezeichnet wird die Staaten auf­ hebt;", "2211": "und doch muß gerade dasjenige was für ein Ding gut ist daS erhaltende Prinzip desselben sein.Es ergibt sich aber auch noch auf anderem Wege daß das Be­ streben den Staat allzusehr zu vereinfachen nicht taugt.", "2212": "Eine Familie ist eher'sich selbst genügend als ein Einzelner, ein Staat eher als eine Familie;", "2213": "und erst dann will eS ja ein Staat heißen wenn die Ge­ meinschaft der

größere Vereinfachung.3.", "2215": "Allein wenn es auch daS Beste wäre daß die bürgerliche Ge­ sellschaft möglichst eine sei, so läßt sich das doch offenbar nicht daraus erweisen daß Alle zugleich von demselben Mein und Nichtmein reden.", "2216": "Dieß nämlich, meint Sokrates, sei ein Zeichen daß der Staat vollkommen eins sei.", "2217": "Das Wort „Alle\" ist doppelsinnig.", "2218": "Wäre eS so viel als jeder Einzelne, so möchte sich noch eher ergeben waS So­ krateS will.", "2219": "Denn dann müßte jeder Einzelne denselben Jungen seinen Sohn nennen und dieselbe Frau die seinige und vom Vermögen und jedem einzelnen Gegenstand ebenso sprechen.", "2220": "So aber, bei der wirk­ lichen Gemeinschaft der Weiber und Kinder, können sie nicht so reden, sondern nur Alte zusammen, nicht jeder Einzelne für sich;", "2221": "und ebenso können auch nur Alle vom Eigenthum sprechen, nicht ein Einzelnen ES liegt also offenbar ein Trugschluß in dem Ausdruck „Alle\"*).", "2222": "Denn die Begriffe Alle und Beides, Gerades und Ungerades erzeugen wegen des Doppelsinnes auch in philosophischen Untersuchungen die eristischen Schlüsse.", "2223": "Daher ist der Satz „Alle sagen dasselbe\" in dem einen Sinne zwar schön, er enthält aber etwas Unmögliches, im andern ist er kein Moment der Einmütigkeit.Zudem hat die gedachte Einrichtung noch zinen andern Fehler.", "2224": "Was möglichst Vielen gemein ist wird immer am wenigsten besorgt.", "2225": "Denn man bekümmert sich zumeist nur um sein Eigenthum, um daS Gemeinsame weniger oder nur so weit als es den Einzelnen berührt.", "2226": "Außer anderen Gründen vernachläßigt man, eS auch in der Voraus­ setzung daß ein Anderer dafür sorge, wie bei den häuslichen 'Dienst­ Verrichtungen viele Diener manchmal schlechter aufwarten als wenige.", "2227":

zwölf Tausenden Alle denselben Gegenstand so benennen, oder vielmehr wie man jetzt in den Staaten das Mein gebraucht?", "2234": "Hier benennt man eine und dieselbe Person verschieden, der Eine seinen Sohn, der Andere seinen Bruder, der Dritte seinen Vetter oder sonstigen Verwandten, sei es nach der Blutsverwandtschaft oder der Verschwägerung zunächst mit sich oder mit den Seinigen, weiterhin dann auch Stammgenossen oder Zunftgeuossen.", "2235": "Es ist doch gewiß besser ein wirklicher Vetter zu sein als auf jene Art ein Sohn.Es wird aber auch nicht einmal zu vermeiden sein daß nicht Einer und der Andere seinen Bruder oder Sohn, Vater oder Mutter errathe, denn aus der Ähnlichkeit die zwischen Eltern und Kindern besteht müssen sie nothwendig die Beweise der gegenseitigen Verwandtschaft entnehmen, wie dieß nach der Erzählung der Reisebeschreibet wirklich vorkommt.", "2236": "Bei einigen Stämmen des oberen Libyen nämlich soll Weibergemeinschaft herrschen, e die erzeugten Kinder hingegen nach der Ähnlichkeit ausgesucht werden.", "2237": "Gibt es ja sogar unter den Thieren Weibchen welche, wie die Stuten und Kühe, eine auffallende Neigung haben den Erzeugern ähnliche Junge zur

Vertraulihckeiten, wie sie zwi­ schen Vater und Sohn, zwischen Bruder und Bruder doch ganz uns' schicklich sind, da ja schon das blose Liebesverhältniß es ist.", "2242": "Wider­ sinnig ist ferner daß er den Beischlaf zwischen Solchen aus keinem an­ dern Grunde verbietet als weil die sinnliche Begierde dadurch allzu­ heftig aufgeregt werde, darauf aber daß Vater und Sohn oder Brüder eS mit einander haben können kein Gewicht legt.Die Weiber- und Kindergemeinschaft scheint übrigens bei dem niederen Stande der Landleute mehr am Platze zu sein als bei den „Wächtern\".", "2243": "Denn wenn die Kinder und Weiber Gemeingut sind, so wird viel weniger Zuneigung vorhanden sein;", "2244": "so müssen aber die Unterthanen sich zu einander verhalten, damit sie willig gehorchen und nicht an Neuerungen

und Weibern treffen zu müssen glaubt.", "2245": "Die Zuneigung der Freunde, betrachten auch wir als das größte Gut für die Staaten (denn unter solchen Verhältnissen dürften sie am wenigsten in Parteien zerfallen), nnd Sokrates selbst erhebt über Altes das Einssein des Staates, das, allgemein und auch nach seiner Ansicht für ein Werk der Freundschaft gilt.", "2246": "So läßt er *) ja auch in den Reden über den Eros den Aristo- HhaneS behaupten daß die Liebenden im Drang der Liebe zusammenzu­ wachsen und aus Zweien Eins zu werden wünschen.", "2247": "Dabei müßten freilich Beide daraufgehen

nicht.", "2259": "Doch kann man diese Frage auch abgesondert von den Bestimmungen über die Weiber und Kinder für sich in Betracht ziehen.", "2260": "Ich meine so:", "2261": "ob, wenn auch jene Verhältnisse gesondert sind, wie es jetzt überall der Fall ist, die Besitzungen und Nutzungen besser gemeinsam seien, und zwar so daß entweder der Grundbesitz gesondert, der Ertrag aber als Gemeingut eingeheimst und verwendet wird (waS einige Völker thun), oder umgekehrt daS Land und der Anbau desselben gemein ist, der Ertrag aber zum Privatverbrauch vertheilt wird (nach diese Art von Gemeinschaft soll bei einigen Barbarenvölkern zu Hause sein), oder endlich daß beides, Grundstücke und Ertrag, gemeinschaft­ lich sind.Wären nun freilich diejenigen welche daS Land bauen Leibeigene, so würde die Sache sich anders und leichter machen;", "2262": "arbeiten sie aber für sich selbst, so dürften die Besitzverhältnisse größere Schwierigkeiten verursachen.", "2263": "Denn wenn nicht im Genuß wie in der Arbeit Alle gleich bedacht werden, so müssen nothwendig Klagen entstehen von Seiten derer die weniger empfangen, aber mehr arbeiten, gegen diejenigen welche viel empfangen und genießen, aber wenig arbeiten.Ueberhaupt ist daS Zusammenleben und die Gemeinschaft in allen Beziehungen des Lebens etwas Schwieriges, und ganz besonders in diesen Dingen.", "2264": "Das sieht man schon an den Reisegesellschaften:", "2265": "fast immer entzweien sie sich über Etwas daS ihnen in den Weg kommt und erzürnen sich über Kleinigkeiten.", "2266": "Auch vom Gesinde ärgern uns diejenigen am meisten die wir zu der alltäglichen Bedienung am häu­ sigflen beiziehen.", "2267": "Diese und ähnliche Schwierigkeiten hat also die Gütergemeinschaft.", "2268": "Dagegen dürste das bestehende Verhältniß, zu­ mal wenn es durch Sitten und gute Gesetze verbessert wird, keinen geringen Vorzug haben;", "2269": "denn es vereinigt das Gute von beiden Besitzarten, ich meine das der Gütergemeinschaft und das des Eigen- besitzeS.", "2270": "Denn in gewisser Beziehung muß der Besitz Gemeingut sein, an und für sich aber Eigenthum.", "2271": "Die getheilten Interessen lassen jene Klagen gegen einander nicht aufkommen;", "2272": "vielmehr wird Jeder daS Seinige zu vermehren suchen, weil er für sein Eigenthum arbeitet.", "2273": "Die Bürgertugend aber wird machen daß es beim Gebrauch davon nach dem Sprüchwort geht:", "2274": "Freunden ist Alles gemein.", "2275": "In einigen Staaten ist sogar jetzt schon dieses Verhältniß vorgezeichnet, ein Beweis daß es nicht unmöglich ist;", "2276": "zumal in den wohlgeordneten Staaten ist eS theils verwirklicht, theils kann eS noch werden:", "2277": "daß nämlich Jeder seinen Eigenbesitz hat und gleichwohl Einiges seinen Freunden zur Benützung überlaßt, Anderes dagegen als Gemeingut benützt.", "2278": "In Lakedämon z.", "2279": "B. gebrauchen sie die Sklaven von ein­ ander so zu sagen als eigene, nicht minder auch Pferde und Hunde, und Zehrung von den Feldfrüchten, wenn sie unterwegs eS nöthig haben ').", "2280": "Es ist also einleuchtend daß eS besser ist wenn Jeder sein Eigenthum hat, für die Nutznießung aber eS gemein macht.", "2281": "Die Bürger aber dazu heranzubilden ist eine besondere Aufgabe des Gesetzgebers.Endlich gewährt auch die Vorstellung etwas eigen zu haben ein unbeschreiblich höheres Vergnügen.", "2282": "Nicht umsonst wohl besitzt Jeder die Liebe zu sich selbst;", "2283": "dieß ist ein Naturtrieb.", "2284": "Nur die Eigenliebe ist verwerflich;", "2285": "diese ist aber nicht Selbstliebe, sondern daS Uebermaß derselben.", "2286": "ES ist wie mit der Habsucht, da doch so ziemlich Alle zu jedem einzelnen Besitzthum eine Liebe haben.", "2287": "Der größte Genuß ist vollends seinen Freunden, Gästen oder Genossen gefällig und hülfreich zu sein, was nur bei eigenem Besitz möglich ist.Dieß Alles also ist bei der zuweitgehenden Vereinfachung des Staates nicht möglich, und zudem hebt man damit die Ausübung zweier Tugenden auf:", "2288": "der Enthaltsamkeit gegenüber den Frauen (und eS ist eine schöne Handlung auS Selbstbeherrschung sich eines fremden Weibes zu enthalten) und der Freigebigkeit in Beziehung auf das Vermögen, denn die freigebige Gesinnung kann sich nicht offenbaren und Niemand wird irgend eine freigebige Handlung ausüben, weil die Ausübung der Freigebigkeit auf dem freien Gebrauche des Eigen­ thums beruht.Anziehend freilich und menschenfreundlich mag eine solche Gesetz­ gebung erscheinen, und der Zuhörer gibt ihr gern seinen Beifall, weil er sich denkt daß in einem solchen Gemeinwesen der höchste Grad von FreundschaftAller mit Allen herrschen werde, zumal wenn mau') die in den gegenwärtigen Staaten bestehenden Uebel der Ungleichheit des Vermögens zur Last legt, die Prozesse über Verträge, die Unter­ suchungen gegen falsche Zeugnisse und die Kriecherei gegen Reiche;", "2289": "was doch Alles nicht von dem Mangel an Gemeinschaft des Besitzes, sondern von der Verdorbenheit der Menschen herrührt.", "2290": "Sehen wir doch daß diejenigen welche gemeinsame Güter besitzen und sich in den Genuß theilen weit mehr sich entzweien als die welche ihr Vermögen für sich allein haben;", "2291": "nur in Vergleichung mit der großen Anzahl der Eigenthümer erscheint uns die Zahl derer die sich in Folge der Güter­ gemeinschaft streiten gering.", "2292": "Zudem ist es billig nicht blos die Uebel alle aufzuzählen, deren man in der Gütergemeinschaft überhoben sein werde, sondern auch die Vortheile die man verliert.", "2293": "sEs ist aber augenscheinlich daß daS Leben in einer solchen Ver­ fassung geradezu unmöglich wird.", "2294": "Der Grund des sokratischen Irr­ thums ist in der Unrichtigkeit seines Grundgedankens zu suchen.", "2295": "In gewisser Beziehung muß allerdings die Familie und selbst der Staat Eins sein, aber nicht durchaus.", "2296": "Sonst wird er entweder anf die Länge gar nicht mehr Staat sein, oder er wird zwar noch bestehen, aber, nahe daran nicht mehr Staat zu sein, ein schlechterer Staat sein;", "2297": "wie wenn Einer die Symphonie zur Monotonie und den Rythmus zum Fuß machen wollte.Will man den Staat, der eine Vielheit ist, zum Gemeinwesen und zur Einheit machen, so muß dieß, wie schon gesagt, durch Erziehung geschehen.", "2298": "Und wer nun Erziehung einführen will und mittelst der­ selben einen tüchtigen Staat herstellen zu können glaubt, der täuscht sich wenn er durch solche Mittel den Zweck erreichen zu können meint, anstatt durch die Sitten, die Philosophie und die Gesetze, wie in Lake­ dämon und Kreta der Gesetzgeber durch die Tischgenossenschaften das Besitzwesen gemeinsam gemacht hat.", "2299": "Auch das darf man nicht übersehen daß die lange Zeit und die vielen Jahre Beachtung verdienen, während welcher es wohl nicht verborgen geblieben wäre, wenn diese Einrichtung sich bewährte.", "2300": "Denn erfunden ist beinahe Alles;", "2301": "nur ist Einiges noch nicht zusam­ mengestellt, Anderes kennt man ohne eS anzuwenden.", "2302": "Und doch würde die Sache am besten klar werden wenn man in der Wirklichkeit eine solche Verfassung einfiihren sähe.", "2303": "Denn der Erfinder wird seinen Staat gar nicht herstellen können ohne jene Abtheilung und Gliederung theils in Tischgenossenschaften theils in Stämme und Zünfte;", "2304": "so daß von der ganzen Gesetzgebung nichts weiter übrig bleiben wird als daß die Wächter nicht Ackerbau treiben, was die Lakedämonier auch jetzt noch aufrecht zu halten suchen.", "2305": "Davon abgesehen hat Sokrates nicht einmal gesagt, wie die ganze Staatsversassung für diese Gemeinschaft einzurichten sei, und es ist auch nicht leicht eS zu sagen.", "2306": "Und doch besteht die Bevölkerung des Staats beinahe ganz ans der Masse der übrigen Bürger, über welche nichts bestimmt ist;", "2307": "man weiß nicht ob auch die Landbauer Gütergemeinschaft haben sollen oder Privateigenthum;", "2308": "eben so wenig ob ihre Weiber und Kinder eigen oder gemeinschaftlich sein sollen.", "2309": "Wenn auch sie Alles gemein haben, wodurch werden sie sich von dem Stande der Wächter unterscheiden?", "2310": "Was werden sie von ihrem Ge­ horsam gegen diese ihre Obrigkeit für Vortheil haben?", "2311": "Durch welche Vorstellungen werden sie im Gehorsam erhalten werden, wenn nicht die Andern etwas Aehnliches ausklügeln wie die Kreter, die ihren Sklaven in Allem gleiche Rechte eingeräumt haben mit Ausnahme des Besuchs der Gymnasien und des Besitzes von Waffen?", "2312": "— Sollen aber diese Verhältnisse bei den Bauern dieselben sein wie in den übrigen Staaten, wie wird es dann mit dem System der Gemeinschaft sein?", "2313": "Nothwendig sind dann in einem Staat zwei Staaten, und zwar einander entgegengesetzte.", "2314": "Denn er macht die Wächter so zu sagen zur Besatzung, die Bauern, die Handwerker und die übrigen Bewohner zu Bürgern.", "2315": "Klagen und Prozesse aber und was er sonst für Nebel in den bestehenden Staaten findet wird Alles auch bei ihnen vor­ kommen.", "2316": "Gleichwohl behauptet Sokrates'), sie werden in Folge der Er­ ziehung nicht viele Gesetze nöthig haben, namentlich nicht stadtpolizei­ liche, marktpolizeiliche und andere dergleichen, während er doch nur der Classe der Wächter eine Erziehung gibt.", "2317": "Ferner macht er die Land­ bauer gegen Entrichtung einer Abgabe zu Eigenthümern ihrer Be­ sitzungen ;", "2318": "dann aber ist es von ihnen weit eher wahrscheinlich daß sie übermütig und schwierig werden als von den Heloten und Penesten in einigen Staaten *) und von den Sklaven.Mögen nun diese Dinge gleich nothwendig sein oder nicht, es ist einmal nichts darüber bestimmt;", "2319": "eben so wenig über die damit zusam-.men hängende Frage, welche Verfassung, Erziehung und Gesetze diese Classe haben soll.", "2320": "Freilich ist es nicht leicht das auszumitteln, so wichtig es auch für die Erhaltung der Gemeinschaft mit den Wächtern ist wie die Verhältnisse dieser Classe geordnet sind.", "2321": "Wenn er ja auch nur die Weiber für sie gemeinsam, die Güter aber abgesondert haben will, wer wird dann das Hauswesen besorgen, wie die Männer die Feldwirtschaft? und nicht minder, wenn die Güter und Weiber des Bauernstandes gemeinschaftlich sind?UvstcMhafi ist es ferner auch ans der Nergleichuag mit den ZM­ ren, die doch gar kein Hauswesen haben, zu folgern daß die WeMr dieselben Geschäfte versehen müssen wie die Männer *).Nachtheilig ist eS auch wie Sokrates die Regierung einrichtet, denn er läßt immer dieselben Personen regieren", "2322": "Dieß gibt Ver­ anlassung zum Aufstand auch bei Solchen die gar kein Selbstgefühl besitzen, wie viel mehr bei Männern von Mut und kriegerischem Geist!", "2323": "i Daß er aber gezwungen ist immer die nämlichen Personen herrschen i zu lassen ist einleuchtend, denn daS „von Gott in die Seelen gemischte Gold\" findet sich, naturlich nicht bald bei diesen bald bei jenen sondern immer bei den Nämlichen.", "2324": "Nach seiner Ansicht mischt er ja gleich bei der Geburt in die Einen Gold, in die Andern Silber;", "2325": "Erz und Eisen aber in diejenigen die zu Handwerkern und Ackerbauern be­ n stimmt sind.Ueberdieß behauptet er, der Gesetzgeber müsse den ganzen Staat i glücklich machen, während er selbst die Glückseligkeit der Wächter aus­ hebt*).", "2326": "Die allgemeine Glückseligkeit ist etwas Unmögliches, wenn nicht die Mehrzahl, oder vielmehr nicht alle Theile, sondern nur einige Wenige sie besitzen.", "2327": "Denn mit der Glückseligkeit ist es nicht wie mit s der geraden Zahl.", "2328": "Die letztere kann wohl dem Ganzen zukommen und doch zugleich keinem von den Theilen, die Glückseligkeit aber un­ l möglich.", "2329": "Wenn nun aber nicht einmal die Wächter glücklich sind, wer soll eS sonst sein?", "2330": "doch gewiß nicht die Künstler und die Masse der niedrigen Handwerker.Diese und andere nicht geringere Bedenken hat der Staat welchen Sokrates entworfen hat.l6. (3.) i Fast ebenso verhält sieh?", "2331": "aber auch mit den später ge­ schriebenen «Gesetzen\";", "2332": "weßhalb eS gut sein wird auch die dort zu Orund gelegte Verfassung ins Auge zu fassen.", "2333": "In der „Republik\" Hat Sokrates nur ganz wenige Bestimmungen gegeben, nämlich über das Verhältniß der Weiber-, Kinder- und Gütergemeinschaft und über die allgemeine Staatsordnung.", "2334": "Er theilt nämlich die Masse der Be­ völkerung in zwei Classen, die der Bauern und die der Landesverthei­ diger;", "2335": "eine dritte aus diesen ist die berathende und regierende Classe.", "2336": "Ueber die Bauern und Handwerker aber gibt Sokrates keine Bestim­ , mung, ob sie an der Regierung Theil haben sollen oder nicht, ob sie Waffen besitzen und gleichfalls mitkämpfen dürfen oder nicht, kein . Wort darüber;", "2337": "die Frauen dagegen, meint er, müssen mit den Wäch­ tern zusammen ins Feld ziehen und an der gleichen Erziehung Theil haben;", "2338": "im Uebrigen hat er die Unterredung mit Nebendingen aus­ , gefüllt, außer daß er noch von der Art der Erziehung der Wächter spricht.Die Abhandlung „von den Gesetzen\" enthält eigentlich größten­ theils wirkliche Gesetze;", "2339": "von der Staatsverfassung spricht er nur wenig darin, und obgleich er diese den bestehenden Staaten angemes­ ssener machen will kommt er doch allmählich wieder auf seine andere Verfassung zurück.", "2340": "Denn mit Ausnahme der Weiber- und Güter­ gemeinschaft gibt er im Uebrigen den beiden Verfassungen die gleichen Einrichtungen:", "2341": "die gleiche Erziehung, die Befreiung von gemeinen Arbeiten^), dieselben Tischgenossenschaften;", "2342": "nur daß er in der letzteren auch Tischgenossenschaften der Weiber anordnet *), und der früheren nur 4 VW Waffentragende gibt, der späteren 5000.Den Charakter des Überschwenglichen, deS Gekünstelten, des Originellen Und Tiefsinnigen tragen freilich alle Reden des Sokrates;", "2343": "daß aber Alles richtig sei ist schwerlich zu fordern.", "2344": "So darf auch bei der so eben angegebenen Zahl nicht übersehen werden daß für so viele Menschen ein babylonisches oder ein anderes unbegrenztes s Gebiet nöthig wäre, auS dem 5000 Menschen ohne Arbeit sich nähren könn­ ten, und darüber noch ein Vielmal größerer Troß von Weibern und i Dienern.", "2345": "Nun darf man zwar wohl Bedingungen voraussetzen wie man sie wünscht, nur nicht gerade daS Unmögliche.", "2346": "sWeiter heißt es, der Gesetzgeber müsse mit Rücksicht auf zwei Dinge seine Gesetze geben, auf das Land und auf die Menschen z man darf aber wohl mit Recht hinzusetzen:", "2347": "auch auf die angrenzenden Ge­ biete '), wenn der Staat ein politisches Leben führen soll.", "2348": "Denn eS ist nicht allein nothwendig sein Kriegswesen zum Behuf der Verthei­ digung deS eigenen Landes einzurichten, sondern auch für den Krieg im Auslande.", "2349": "Wenn man aber auch den kriegerischen Beruf weder für den Einzelnen noch für den Staat im Ganzen billigt, so müssen doch gleichwohl die Staatsbürger den etwaigen Feinden furchtbar sein, nicht nur wenn sie in daS Land einfallen, sondern auch wenn sie sich zurückgezogen haben.Auch in Beziehung auf das Maß des Besitzes ist zu bedenken, ob es nicht besser wäre es anders, d. h. genauer, zu bestimmen.", "2350": "Er verlangt einen Besitz von dem Umfange daß man mäßig davon leben könne ;", "2351": "vielleicht wollte er sagen:", "2352": "daß man gut leben könne, denn dieß ist doch allgemeiner.", "2353": "Man kann ja auch mäßig und dabei recht elend leben.", "2354": "Eine bessere Bestimmung wäre:", "2355": "mäßig und freigebig (denn jede dieser Bestimmungen für sich genommen, kann daS Eine Folge deS Wohllebens, das Andere des mühseligen Lebens sein).", "2356": "Diese beiden Eigenschaften sind ja eben die einzigen Tugenden in Beziehung auf den Gebrauch deS Vermögens.", "2357": "Man kann nicht sein Vermögen sanftmütig oder tapfer gebrauchen, wohl aber mäßig und freigebig, also müssen dieß auch die Velwendungsarieu des­ selben sein.Sonderbar ist ferner auch daß er, der die Besitzungen gleich macht, nichts über die Volksmenge im Staat festsetzt, sondern die Kinderzeugung unbeschränkt läßt, in der Voraussetzung daß sie wegen der Fälle von Kinderlosigkeit sich ungefähr innerhalb der gleiches Zahl halten werde, wenn auch sonst noch so viele geboren werden weil dieß auch jetzt in den Staaten der Fall zu sein pflegt.", "2358": "Allein dieses Verhältniß muß in den jenseitigen Staaten nicht genau das­ selbe sein wie in den bestehenden.", "2359": "Denn jetzt leidet Niemand Mangel, weil die Güter unter eine beliebige Anzahl vertheilt werden können;", "2360": "dort aber, wo sie untheilbar sind, müssen die überzähligen Glieder noth­ wendig leer ausgehen, ob ihrer wenige an Zahl sind oder viele.Man könnte erwarten daß noch eher dieKinderzengung beschränkt sein müsse als das Vermögen, so daß nicht mehr als eine gewisse An­ zahl erzeugt werden dürfte.", "2361": "Diese Zahl müßte mit Rücksicht auf die Zufälligkeiten, sofern einige der Geborenen gleich wieder sterben, und auf die Fälle von Kinderlosigkeit festgestellt werden*).", "2362": "Die Frei­ gebung, wie sie in den meisten Staaten stattfindet, müßte im platoni­ schen Staat nothwendig Verarmung der Bürger zur Folge haben, die Verarmung aber veranlaßt Aufruhr und Verbrechen.", "2363": "So gieng der Korinther Pheidon, einer der ältesten Gesetzgeber, von der Ansicht auS daß die Zahl der Familien und der gesammten Volksmenge die gleiche bleiben müsse, wenn auch Alle von Anfang ungleiche Güterloose er­ halten hätten.", "2364": "In diesen „Gesetzen\" dagegen ist's umgekehrt.", "2365": "Doch wie diese Verhältnisse besser einzurichten wären, darüber soll weiter unten gesprochen werden.", "2366": "Dann fehlt in den „Gesetzen\" auch eine Bestimmung über den Unterschied der Herrschenden und der Beherrschten.", "2367": "Er sagt nämlich nur:", "2368": "wie der Zettel aus einer andern Wolle sei als der Einschlag, so müssen auch die Herrschenden sich zu den Beherrschten verhalten.", "2369": "Wen« er ferner-gestattet das Gefammtvermögen bis z«U Fünf­ fachen*) zu vermehren,Warum sollte das nicht auch

für die Staaten gemeine satnste von allen darstellt, so mag er Recht haben;", "2376": "wenn aber als die beste nach jener ersten StaatSverfassung, so hat er Unrecht;", "2377": "denn leicht dürste man die lakonische oder irgend eine andere etwa noch aristokta» tischere vorziehen.Manche behaupten, die beste Verfassung müsse aus allen bestehen- s den gemischt sein, und deßhalb loben sie die lakedämonische, denn sie- bestehe, sagen sie, aus Oligarchie, Monarchie und Demokratie, wobei die Einen die Monarchie im Königthum, die Oligarchie in der Behörde der Alten, das demokratische Element aber in der Gewalt der Ephores sehen, weil die Ephoren aus dem Volke gewählt werden;", "2378": "wogegen Anderedie Ephorie als etwas Despotisches betrachten und das demokra­ tische Element in die gemeinsamen Mahlzeiten (Tischgenossenschaften> und in die übrigen Einrichtungen des täglichen Lebens setzen.In den platonischen „Gesetzen\" aber heißt eS, die beste Verfaft sung müsse aus Demokratie und Despotie zusammengesetzt sein, Fok-. men die man entweder für keine Verfassungen oder doch für die tzhkechtesten von. allen holten sollte.", "2379": "Da verdient die Mischung aus Mehreren doch den Vorzug:", "2380": "denn die aus mehreren Formen zusammen-? gesetzte Verfassung ist wirklich die bessere.", "2381": "Der platonische Staat hat' tffenbar gar nichts Monarchisches, sondern oligarchische und demokra­ tische Elemente, neigt sich aber noch mehr zur Oligarchie hin.", "2382": "Dieß ergibt sich aus der Besetzung der Aemter;", "2383": "denn daß die Beamten aus der Zahl der dazu gewählten

"2393": "Da werden also die Wähler aus den höchsten Vermögensclassen zahlreicher und stärke? sein, weil Manche von den niedern Classen nicht wählen, wenn sie nicht dazu gezwungen sind.", "2394": "Daß also diese Staatsform nicht aus Demokratie nnd Monarchie zusammengesetzt sein darf, ist schon hieraus klar und wird es aus dem Folgenden noch mehr werden, wenn wir in unserer Untersuchung auf diese

jetzt die Staaten Verwaltet werden, näher als jene beiden.", "2400": "Denn kein Anderer hat Neuerungen wie die Weiber- und Kindergemeinschaft oder die Tisch­ genossenschaften der Frauen aufgebracht, sondern sie gehen mehr von der Wirklichkeit aus.", "2401": "Einige halten nämlich die richtige Anordnung der Vermögensverhältnisse für daS Wichtigste, weil nach ihrer Ansicht die Empörungen durchaus darin ihren Grund haben.", "2402": "Aus diesem Grunde schlug PhaleaS von Chalkedon zuerst fok gende Einrichtung vor:", "2403": "die Besitzungen der Bürger, sagt er, müssen alle gleich sein.", "2404": "Dieß sei, meinte er, gleich bei der Anlage der Staaten Sicht schwer zu machen, bei den schon eingerichteten sei es zwar schwie­ riger, dennoch ließe sich die Gleichheit am leichtesten dadurch herstellen wenn nur die Reichen Mitgiften gäben, aber nicht empsiengen, die Armen dagegen keine gäben, sondern nur empsiengen.", "2405": "Platon aber glaubte bei der Abfassung seiner „Gesetze\" bis zu einem gewissen Maße die Ungleichheit gestatten zu müssen;", "2406": "über das Fünffache deS geringsten Besitzes hinaus solle kein Bürger erwerben dürfen, wie schon früher') bemerkt worden ist.Solche Gesetzgeber sollten aber auch das nicht vergessen waS ihnen wirklich entgeht, daß, wenn man die Summe deS Vermögens festsetzt, auch die Zahl der Kinder bestimmt werden muß.", "2407": "Denn wenn die Anzahl der Kinder daS Maß des Vermögens überschreitet, so wird die Aufhebung des Gesetzes nothwendig, und außer der Aufhebung ist es eine schlimme Folge daß Viele aus Reichen Arme werden, denn es ist schwer zu verhindern daß solche Leute nicht neuerungssüchtig werden.", "2408": "In wie fern übrigens die Gleichheit des Besitzes einen Einfluß auf die bürgerliche Gesellschaft habe, haben offenbar auch einige von den alten Gesetzgebern erkannt.", "2409": "So hat Solon ein Gesetz gegeben, und auch bei Andern besteht ein solches, welches verbietet Grundbesitz zu erwerben so viel man will.", "2410": "Ebenso verbieten anderSwo die Gesetze den Besitz zu verkaufen, z.", "2411": "B. bei den Lokriern *) ist der Verkauf nur dann gestattet wenn Jemand nachweisen kann daß ihn ein augenschein­ licher Unfall betroffen hat.", "2412": "Auch ist verordnet die alten Staimnloose beizubehalten, und die Aufhebung dieser Bestimmung hat in LeukaS') die Verfassung allzu demokratisch gemacht, denn es konnte nun nicht mehr so gehalten werden daß man nur von den vorgeschriebeneu Ver­ mögensclassen zu den Staatsämtern gelangte.Möglicherweise ist jedoch die Gleichheit des Besitzes vorhanden, aber dieser entweder zu groß, so daß man üppig wird, oder zu klein, daß man elend lebt.", "2413": "Offenbar ist es also nicht hinreichend daß der Gesetzgeber die Besitzungen gleich macht, sondern auf das Mittelmaß muß er be­ dacht sein.", "2414": "Wenn man aber auch einen mäßigen Besitz für Alle be­ stimmt hätte, so ist damit noch nicht geholfen;", "2415": "denn es ist weit mehr nöthig die Begierden in ein gleiches Maß zu bringen als die Be­ sitzungen.", "2416": "Dieß aber ist nicht möglich ohne eine ordentliche Erziehung durch die Gesetze.PhaleaH würde vielleicht erwiedern daß er das eben selbst sage, so fern er annimmt daß in Beidem Gleichheit in den Staaten statt­ finden müsse, in Besitz und Erziehung.", "2417": "Aber er muß auch sagen wie die Erziehung beschaffen sein soll;", "2418": "mit der Bestimmung daß sie eine und dieselbe sei ist nicht geholfen.", "2419": "Denn sie kann eine und dieselbe sein, aber zugleich von der Art daß ihre Zöglinge doch nach dem Vorzug des Reichthums oder der Ehre oder nach beiden trachten lernen.", "2420": "Empörungen entstehen auch nicht blos wegen der Ungleichheit deS Besitzes, sondern auch auS Ehrsucht.", "2421": "Doch verhält sich'S mit diesen

befriedigen.", "2426": "Denn wenn ihre Be­ gierde über das Maß des Nothwendigen hinausgeht, so werden sie zu deren Befriedigung Unrecht begehen, und nicht allein ihretwegen son­ dern auch, wenn sie

"2429": "für den zweiten Mäßigung des Ehrgeizes;", "2430": "im dritten Fall die Befriedigung aus sich selbst zu schöpfen.", "2431": "Das Mittel dazu ist nur bei der Philosophie zu suchen, denn alle andern Genüsse bedürfen der Beihülfe von Menschen.", "2432": "Und dieser Fall ist der wichtigste;", "2433": "denn gerade das größte Unrecht begehen die Menschen nicht aus Noth, sondern in der Ausschweifung der Begierden.", "2434": "Man wird z.", "2435": "B. nicht Tyrann um sich vor Frost zu schützen.", "2436": "Darum ist es auch eine so große Ehre, nicht einen Dieb, aber einen Tyrannen .

aber nicht unbeachtet bleiben, welches Maß von Eigenthum einem Staate zu­ ttäglich sei.", "2445": "Die richtigste Grenze möchte vielleicht diejenige sein daß der Stärkere nicht wegen des Uebermaßes von Besitz ein Interesse hat ihn anzugreifen, sondern nur in so weit als er es auch gegen gerin­ geren BesitzHgethan haben würde.", "2446": "In diesem Falle war Eubulos als er dem Autophradates *),

geringere Summe als diese Atarneus sogleich zu verlassen.", "2448": "Durch diesen Vorschlag bewog er den AutophradateS nach besserer Ueber­ legung von der Belagerung abzustehen.ES ist also wohl die

mögen gleich zu machen, die von Natur Mäßigen dazu bringt nichts voraushaben zu wollen, die Schlechten aber dahin daß sie nichts vor­ aushaben können;", "2455": "und dieß ist der Fall wenn sie l in Abhängigkeit stehen, ohne ein Unrecht zu erleiden.", "2456": "Aber auch nicht einmal die Besitzgleichheit hat PhaleaS gehörig bestimmt, denn er spricht nur von der Gleichheit des Grundbesitzes, und

Grund gelegt, denn in Folge der Verzärtelung werden sie schon in den Schulen nicht zum Gehorchen gewöhnt);", "3617": "die Andern werden in Folge des übermäßigen Mangels an all diesen Vortheilen

Aufständen und Kämpfen zwischen dem Volk und den Reichen kommen muß, so stellt in diesem Fall die siegende Partei nicht eine gemeinsame Verfassung auf dem Boden der Rechtsgleichheit her, sondern sie nimmt das Uebergewicht im Staate als Siegespreis in Besitz und macht entweder Demokratie oder Oligarchie.So führten auch die Staaten welche die Hegemonie in Griechen­ land behaupteten, je nach dem Muster ihrer eigenen Verfassung, die einen Demokratieen, die andern Oligarchieen in den unterworferien Städten ein, nicht weil sie auf den Vortheil dieser Städte bedacht waren, sondern auf ihren eigenen.", "3649": "Daher kommt es denn auch daß eine Verfassung welche die Mitte hält entweder gar nie oder doch nur selten und nur bei wenigen Staaten inS Leben tritt.", "3650": "Nur ein ein­ ziger

die besondere Art von Oligarchie.", "3670": "In allen Fällen muß aber der Gesetzgeber in seiner Verfassung den Mittelstand herbeiziehen:", "3671": "gibt er seine Gesetze in oligarchischem Sinn, so muß

Verfassungsänderung handelt und um die Verordnungen der Regierung zu vernehmen.", "3723": "Eine zweite Form ist daß Alle in voller Versammlung be­ schließen, aber nur zusammentreten nm die Wahlen

zur Berathung über Krieg und Kriegsbündnisse zusammenkommen, das Uebrige aber durch die Be­ hörden besorgt wird, welche, soweit es möglich ist, durch Wahl besetzt Werden, d. h. alle diejenigen deren Geschäfte nur durch Sachverstän­ dige versehen werdenstönnen.Die vierte Form ist wenn Alle über Alles in voller Versamm­ lung berathen, die Beamten aber über Nichts zu entscheiden, sondern nur Anträge zu machen haben.", "3727": "Dieß ist die Form wie jetzt die extreme Demokratie eingerichtet ist, die wir der dynastischen Oligarchie und der tyrannischen Monarchie gleich stellen.", "3728": "Dieß also

Be­ rathungen Theil haben, sondern nur Gewählte, ihre Gewalt aber, wie im ersten Fall, in den Schranken des Gesetzes bleibt, so ist diese Form rein oligarchisch.", "3732": "Wenn aber die Mitglieder der berathenden Körper­ schaft zu den Staatsämtern sich selbst wählen und der Sohn an die Stelle des Vaters tritt und wenn ihre Gewalt über den Gesetzen steht da ist nothwendigerweise die strenge Oligarchie.Wenn dagegen nur über gewisse Gegenstände bestimmte Personen entscheiden, also über Krieg und Frieden und über Amtsrechenschaft Alle, über die übrigen Staatssachen aber Beamte, seien es gewählte oder durch's Loos bestimmte, so ist die Verfassung aristokratisch.", "3733": "Da aber wo der eine Zweig der Geschäfte durch gewählte, der andere durch ausgelooste (ausgeloost entweder ohne Unterschied aus der Ge­ sammtheit oder aus einer vorhergegangenen Auswahl), oder Alles durch gewählte und ausgelooste Beamte gemeinschaftlich verwaltet wird, da ist halb aristokratisch-republikanisches, halb eigentlich repu­ blikanisches Gemeinwesen.", "3734": "Auf diese Art gestaltet sich das Verhältniß des berathenden Körpers je nach den Verfassungen vershcieden, und die Verwaltung jedes Staats richtet sich nach den angegebenen Unter­ scheidungen.Für die jetzt vorzugsweise so genannte Demqkratie (ich meine eine solche in welcher das Volk unumschränkter Herr auch über die Gesetze ist) wäre es aber von Vortheil wenn sie, um den Zweck der Berathung zu sichern, für die Volksversammlungen eine Einrichtung annähme die in den Oligarchieen für die Gerichte besteht.", "3735": "Hier be­ droht man nämlich die welche zum Richteramt berufen sind mit einer Strafe, damit sie ihrem Berufe nachkommen, während die Demokraten den Armen dafür eine Entschädigung reichen.", "3736": "Denn die Berathung wird besser ausfallen wenn Alle zusammen an der Berathung Theil nehmen, das Volk mit den Vornehmen und diese mit der Menge.", "3737": "Vortheilhaft ist es aber auch wenn der berathende Körper gewählt oder etwa aus den vershciedenen Klassen ausgelöset wird.", "3738": "Endlich ist eS auch vorheilhast, in dem Fall wo die demokratische.", "3739": "Partei die republikanische (Mittelpartei) an Zahl weit übertrifft, entweder nicht Allen eine Entschädigung zu geben, sondern nur einer der Stärke der angesehenen Partei gleichkommenden Anzahl, oder aber den Neberschuß durch's Loos auszuscheiden.In den Oligarchieen dagegen ist eS rathsam entweder Einige aus dem Volk zu wählen oder eine Behörde zu schaffen wie in gewissen Staaten die Vorberathungscommisisonen und Gesetzeswächter, und nur dasjenige öffentlich zu verhandeln was diese voraus berathen haben.", "3740": "So nämlich bekommt das Volk einigen Antheil an der Be­ rathung,

wendig, aber nützlich.In den großen Staaten ist es natürlich ebenso wohl möglich als nöthig daß für jedes Geschäft ein eigenes Amt bestellt sei.", "3764": "Denn da der Bürger viele sind, so können auch Viele nach einander in obrig­ keitliche Aemter eintreten, so daß einige Aemter erst nach langer Pause wieder, andere nur einmal an dieselbe Person kommen.", "3765": "Und besser ist es für jedes Geschäft wenn der damit Beauftragte nur daS Eine zu thun hat, und nicht vielerlei.In kleinen Staaten dagegen ist man genöthigt viele Aemter auf wenige Personen zu häufen, weil es bei der geringen Bevölkerung nicht angeht daß Viele sich mit öffentlichen Aemtern befassen.", "3766": "Denn wer sollen ihre Amtsnachfolger sein?", "3767": "Nun haben aber oft kleine Staaten dieselben Aemter und Gesetze nöthig wie die großen, nur brauchen diese die nämlichen Behörden oft, während bei jenen der Fall nur von Zeit zu Zeit eintritt.", "3768": "Deßwegen hat es auch keinen Anstand hier mehrere Geschäfte einer Person zugleich zu übertragen, ohne daß eins dem andern hinderlich sein wird;", "3769": "denn bei der geringen Bevölkerung ist es unumgänglich die Behörden wie gewisse Werkzeuge

unentbehrlich.", "3771": "aber doch zweckmäßig, so läßt sich auf Grund dieser Unterscheidung leichter ermitteln, welcherlei Aemter schicklihcerweise in eins zusammen- gezogen werden können.", "3772": "Man darf aber dabei auch nicht unbeachtet lassen welche Behörden nach der örtlichen Beschaffenheit Vielerlei zu besorgen haben und welche Gegenstände überall unter der Aufsicht einer und derselben

Reichen.", "4153": "Auch kann man versuchen die Masse der Armen und der Reichen unter einander zu mischen, oder den Mittelstand zu heben.", "4154": "Dadurch beseitigt man die aus der Ungleichheit hervorgehenden Reibungen.Von der größten Wichtigkeit ist ferner in jeder Verfassung daß durch die Gesetze und durch die ganze Einrichtung dafür gesorgt sei daß die Staatsämter nicht zu Mitteln der Bereicherung werden.", "4155": "Und darüber hat man besonders in Oligarchieen zu wachen.", "4156": "Denn die Menge läßt eS sich schon gefallen von der Regierung ausgeschlossen zu sein, ja der Einzelne ist sogar froh wenn er ungestört seinen Privat­ ￇgeschäften nachgehen kann, außer wenn sie glauben daß die Beamten den Staat berauben, In diesem Fall erbittert sie Beides, sowohl von der Ehre als von den Vortheilen sich ausgeschlossen zu sehen.", "4157": "Unter einer solchen Vorkehrung allein ist es auch möglich De­ mokratie und Aristokratie in einem Staate zu vereinigen.", "4158": "Denn so läßt es sich möglich denken daß die Vornehmen und die Menge haben was jeder Theil wünscht.", "4159": "Daß Alle an der Regierung Theil nehmen können ist demokratisch;", "4160": "daß nur die Vornehmen wirklich regieren ist aristokratisch.", "4161": "Dieß wird der Fall sein sobald man an den Staats­ ämtern sich nicht bereichern kann.", "4162": "Denn die Armen werden keine Aemter begehren, weil nichts dabei zu gewinnen ist, sondern lieber ihren Privatgeschäften nachgehen;", "4163": "die Reichen aber werden sie an­ nehmen können, weil sie keine Belohnung aus dem Staatsvermögen bedürfen.", "4164": "Und der Vortheil davon wird der sein daß die Armen wohlhabend werden, weil sie sich ausschließlich ihrem Gewerbe widmen können, die Vornehmen dagegen nicht nöthig haben von dem gemeinen Manne sich befehlen zu lassen.Um nun die Beraubung des Staatsvermögens zu verhindern, muß die Uebergabe des Schatzes in Gegenwart aller Bürger geschehen und müssen Abschriften der Rechnung in den Phratrien, Klassen und Zünften niedergelegt werden;", "4165": "und um die uneigennützige Verwaltung - zu befördern, müssen Ehrenauszeichnungen für das Verdienst durch das Gesetz in Aussicht gestellt sein.", "4166": "Ferner muß man in Demokratien die Reichen schonen, indem man nicht blos ihre Besitzungen nicht zu theilen verlangt sondern auch nicht einmal ihre Einkünfte, was doch in einigen Staaten ') unver­ merkt geschieht;", "4167": "es ist im Gegentheil besser sie davon abzuhalten wenn sie kostspielige und doch nutzlose öffentliche Leistungen, wie Schau­ spiele, Fackelauszüge und Anderes dergleichen mehr freiwillig über­ nehmen wollen.", "4168": "In den Oligarchieen dagegen muß man ganz be­ sonders für die Armen Sorge tragen, ihnen die mit kleinen Vortheilen verbundenen Aemter zukommen lassen, und wenn Einer der Reichen sich eine Mißhandlung der Armen erlaubt, so muß eine größere Strafe darauf gesetzt sein als wenn es Einer ihresgleichen thut.Auch dürfen die Erbschaften nicht durch Schenkung vergeben werden, sondern nur nach der Geschlehctsfolge, und Einer soll nicht mehr als eine Erbschaft antreten dürfen.", "4169": "Denn auf diesem Wege kann das Vermögen der Einzelnen gleichmäßiger erhalten und eine immer größere Anzahl von Armen in Wohlstand versetzt werden.", "4170": "Auch ist es sowohl in der Demokratie als in der Oligarchie rath­ sam denen welche weniger Antheil an der Regierung haben in allen anderen Dingen entweder gleiche Berechtigung oder auch einen Vor­ zug einzuräumen, in der Demokratie den Reichen, in der Oligarchie den Armen, mit alleiniger Ausnahme der höchsten Staatsämter;", "4171": "dennￇ diese dürfen nur der nach der Verfassung bevorrechteten Klasse oder mehreren Mitgliedern derselben anvertraut werden.S.", "4172": "Drei Eigenschaften aber müssen diejenigen besitzen welche die höchsten Staatsämter bekleiden sollen:", "4173": "erstlich Liebe zu der be­ stehenden Verfassung;", "4174": "zweitens die größte Befähigung für die Re­ gierungsgeschäfte, drittens die der jedesmaligen Verfassung besonders entsprechende Tugend und Gerechtigkeit.", "4175": "Denn wenn das Recht nicht ￇin allen Verfassungen eines und dasselbe ist, so muß nothwendig auchￇ der Begriff der Gerechtigkeit in jeder wieder ein anderer sein.", "4176": "Dabei entsteht die Frage:", "4177": "Wenn sich diese drei Eigenschaften nicht in einer Person beisammen sinden sollten, wie ist dann die Entscheidung zu treffen?", "4178": "Z. B. wenn Einer ein ausgezeichnetes Feldherrntalent be­ säße, aber ein unredlicher Mann und der Verfassung nicht zugethan wäre, ein Anderer aber (ohne die erste Eigenschaft) ein rechtschaffener Mann und Freund der Verfassung, wie hätte man da zu wählen?Ich denke, man muß hier zweierlei berücksichtigen:", "4179": "welche Eigen­ schaft häufiger und welche seltener unter Menschen überhaupt vor­ komme.", "4180": "Bei der Wahl eines Feldherrn also ist mehr auf Kriegser­ fahrung als auf Tugend zu sehen.", "4181": "Denn Feldherrntalent ist seltener, Rechtlichkeit häufiger.", "4182": "Bei der Wahl eines Gesetzwächters oder eines Finanzverwalters verhält es sich umgekehrt;", "4183": "denn das Amt erfordert größere Tugend als die Meisten gewöhnlich besitzen, die nöthigeￇ Kenntniß dazu aber ist Allen zugänglich.", "4184": "Nun könnte man aber fragen:", "4185": "Wenn sowohl die Fähigkeit zur Führung des Amtes als Liebe zur Verfassung vorhanden ist, was bedarf es da noch der Tugend?", "4186": "Diese beiden Eigenschaften werden schon ausrichten was dem Staate kommt.", "4187": "Doch, es kann ja Mancher jene beiden Eigenschaften besitzen und dabei unfähig sein sich selbst zu beherrshcen, so daß er trotzdem gegen das Gemeinwesen ebenso handelt wie er bei allem Wissen und aller Liebe zu sich selbst doch sich selbst schlechte Dienste thut.Mit Einem Wort:", "4188": "Alles dasjenige was wir in der Gesetzgebung als heilsam für die Verfassungen erkennen ist auch ein Mittel zur Erhaltung der Verfassung;", "4189": "und in dieser Beziehung gilt besonders die oft erwähnte Grundregel, darüber zu wachen daß die Partei welche die Verfassung will der Zahl nach stärker sei als die andre, welche sie nicht will.", "4190": "ￇNeben all' diesem darf man aber etwas nicht außer Acht lassen was jetzt in den ausgearteten Verfassungen nicht beachtet wird, das Mittelmaß.", "4191": "Denn manche für demokratisch geltenden Maßregeln sind der Ruin der Demokratie, und manche scheinbar oligarchischen der der Oligarchie.", "4192": "Staatsmänner aber welche in der Anwendung solcher Maßregeln die einzige politische Tugend sehen treiben die Sache auf die Spitze.", "4193": "Sie übersehen etwas was ich durch ein Gleichniß aus­ drücken will.", "4194": "Eine Nase z.", "4195": "B. kann von der Linie der vollkommenen Schönheit zur Form der Habichts- oder Stülpnase abweichen und doch immer noch schön sein und ihren Reiz haben, aber nicht mehr so bald man die Abweichung noch weiter bis zur Uebertreibung ausdehnt, ￇsondern dann zerstört man erstlich das Ebenmaß des Gliedes und macht am Ende daß sie gar keiner Nase mehr gleicht, wegen des Uebermaßes und des Mißverhältnisses zu den übrigen Partieen.", "4196": "Und ebenso ver­ hält es sich mit jedem andern Gliede.", "4197": "Dasselbe ist nun auch bei den von der Norm abweichenden Verfassungen der Fall.Die Oligarchie und Demokratie kann noch erträglich beschaffen sein, wenn sie auch die Grenzlinie der besten Staatsform überschreiten;", "4198": "treibt man aber in der einen oder andern die Abweichung noch weiter, so macht man zuerst daß die Verfassung schlechter wird, und am Ende daß sie aufhört Verfassung zu sein.", "4199": "Darum muß der Gesetzgeber und der Staatsmann wohl beachten welche demokratische Maßregeln die Demokratie und welche oligarchische die Oligarchie erhalten urd welche andere ihr verderblich sind.", "4200": "Nun kann keine von beiden Formen auf die Dauer bestehen ohne den Gegensatz der Reichen und der Masse, sondern sobald Gleichheit des Vermögens eintritt muß nothwendig die Verfassung eine andere werden.", "4201": "Wer also die Gegenpartei durch übertriebene Gesetze zu Grunde richten will richtet die Verfassung zu Grunde.In diesem Punkte sündigt man aber sowohl in den Demokratieen als in den Oligarchieen.", "4202": "In den ersteren sind es die Demagogen, da wo das Volk sich über die Gesetze erhebt *), denn sie spalten durch ihren Kampf gegen die Reichen immer den Staat in zwei Parteien.", "4203": "Sie sollten aber im Gegentheil immer im Interesse der Reichen zu sprechen scheinen, und ebenso in den Oligarchieen die Oligarchifchge­ sinnten im Interesse des Volkes, und die Eide der Letzteren sollten gerade entgegengesetzt lauten von dem den sie jetzt schwören.", "4204": "Jetzt nämlich schwören sie in einigen Oligarchieen:", "4205": "ǧUnd dem Volke will ich abhold sein und zu seinem Schaden rathen was ich vermag\", während sie vielmehr das Gegentheil sich zum Grundsatz machen und auf ihre Fahne schreiben sollten, mit der ausdrücklichen Versicherung in ihren Eiden:", "4206": "ǧich will dem Volke nicht Unrecht thun\".Das wichtigste von allen besprochenen Mitteln zur Erhaltung der Verfassungen, das jetzt allgemein vernachläßigt wird, ist die Er­ ziehung im Geiste der Verfassung.", "4207": "Denn die zweckmäßigsten Gesetze, wenn sie auch von allen Gliedern der Staatsgesellschaft einstimmig gutgeheißen sind, sind erfolglos wenn die Einzelnen nicht von Jugend auf im Geiste der Verfassung erzogen sind, d. h. volksthümlich, wenn die Gesetze volksthümlich, oligarchisch, wenn sie oligarchisch sind.", "4208": "Denn herrscht die Zügellosigkeit über den Einzelnen, so herrscht sie auch im Staate.Im Geiste der Verfassung erzogen sein heißt aber nicht:", "4209": "thun was die Oligarchen oder was die Anhänger der Demokratie gerne sehen, sondern verstehen wie man sich einerseits als Oligarch, anderseits als Demokrat behaupten kann.", "4210": "Heutzutag aber wachsen in den Olig­ archieen die Söhne der Regierenden in Weichlichkeit heran;", "4211": "die der Armen dagegen werden durch Leibesübungen und Arbeit gestählt, so daß sie viel eher Lust und Kraft bekommen Neuerungen anzufangen.", "4212": "In den vorzugsweise für demokratisch geltenden Demokratieen ist

Königthum oder in der TyranniS vorkommen den bei den freien Verfassungen er­ wähnten Fällen ziemlich ähnlich.", "4224": "Denn das Königthum nähert sich der Aristokratie, wie die Tyrannis aus der extremen Oligarchie und Demokratie hervorgeht;", "4225": "deßwegen ist denn auch die letztere für die Unterthanen die nachtheiligste Form, sofern sie aus zwei Uebeln zu­ sammengesetzt ist und die Auswüchse und Fehler beider Verfassungen in sich vereinigt.Schon die Entstehung beider Arten von Monarchie beruht auf ganz entgegensetzten Urfachen.", "4226": "Das Königthum ist zum Schutze der Gebildeten gegen das Volk entstanden, und der König wird aus der Mitte der Gebildeten wegen seiner Ueberlegenheit in der Tugend oder wegen seiner tapferen Thaten oder wegen der Vorzüge eines darin hervorragenden Geschlechtes ausgestellt;", "4227": "der Tyrann dagegen wird aus der Masse des Volkes gegen die Vornehmen eingesetzt, um das i Volk gegen ihre Bedrückungen zu schützen.Den Beweis liefert die Geschichte.", "4228": "Fast die meisten Tyrannen sind eigentlich aus Demagogen entstanden, die durch die Verfolgung der Vornehmen das Vertrauen des Volkes gewonnen hatten.", "4229": "Auf diese Art entstand wenigstens ein Theil der Gewaltherrschaften, als die Staaten schon mächtig geworden waren;", "4230": "die früheren dagegen ent­ standen theils durch Könige welche die väterlichen Satzungen überschritten und nach einer despotischeren Gewalt tsrebten, theils durch Männer die zu den höchsten Staatsämtern gewählt waren (denn vor Zeiten übertrugen die Volksgemeinden ihre staatlichen und priesterlichen ￇVor­ steherschaften auf lange Dauer an dieselbe Person), theils aus Olig­ archien in denen Einer mit unumschränkter Vollmacht zum Staats- oberhaupt gewählt wurde.", "4231": "Denn in allen diesen Füllen war es ihnen leicht sich vollends zum Alleinherrn zu machen, wenn sie nur wollten, weil ihnen zum Voraus schon die Macht entweder der königlichen Würde oder des hohen Ansehens zu Gebot stand.", "4232": "So erhob sich Pheidon ￇin Argos und Andere auf der Grundlage des Königthums zu Tyrannen;", "4233": "die Tyrannen in Jonien ￇdagegen, so wie auch Pha­ laris

konnten, sei es daß sie im Kriege das Volk vor Sklaverei bewahrt hatten, wie Kodros ￇￇ, oder daraus befreit, wie KyroS ￇￇ, oder den Staat ge­ gründet und Land erobert, wie die Könige der Lakedämonier ￇder Makedonier *) und der Molosser ^).Der König hat die Bestimmung ein Wächter darüber zu sein daß die besitzende Klasse keine Beeinträchtigung, das Volk dagegen keine Mißhandlung erleide;", "4237": "die Tyrannenherrschaft aber hat, wie schon oft bemerkt worden, nie das allgemeine Interesse im Auge, außer wo eS der Privatvortheil des Tyrannen mit sich bringt.", "4238": "Das Ziel des Tyrannen ist das Wohlleben, das des Königs die Bildung.", "4239": "Deßhalb liegt auch der Vorzug auf den der Tyrann Anspruch macht im Reichthum, der deS Königs mehr in der Ehre;", "4240": "und die Wache des l

darin daß er beim Gelage in Gesellschaft seines Lieblings an diesen die Frage richtete, ob er schon von ihm schwanger sei.Der Angriff des Pausanias auf Philipp ') war dadurch veranlaßt daß dieser ihn von SttaloS un­ gestraft hatte beschimpfen lassen;", "4256": "der des Derdas auf AmyntaS ') den Kleinen dadurch daß dieser sich des Mißbrauchs seiner Jugendlichkeit gerühmt hatte.", "4257": "Einen

Umgang, so daß auch ein geringerer Vorwand zu seinem Anschlag genügte.", "4260": "Dieser war daß ihm der König gegen sein Versprechen keine seiner beiden Tochter zur Frau gab, sondern die ältere, weil

Regel auch bis an ihr Ende behauptet haben, ihre Nachfolger aber fast ohne Ausnahme sie sogleich verlieren, weil sie durch genußsüchtiges Lebenￇ in Verachtung sinken und dem heimlichen Ueberfall viele Blößen darbieten.", "4310": "Als ein Moment des Hasses ist auch der Zorn zu rechnen, denn gewissermaßen hat er dieselbe Wirkung.", "4311": "Ja er ist oft noch wirksamer als der Haß, denn der Uebergang

Eintreibung der Geldstrafen zu theilen versuchen.", "4697": "Ferner sollten einige Erkenntnisse von anderen Beamten vollstreckt werden, und zwar die von wechselnden Behörden (den Gerichten) von der

und ein Auskunstsmittel für dasselbe zu erdenken.", "4704": "Denn nothwendig ist es so sehr als das vorhingenannte;", "4705": "nun suchen aber rechtliche Leute^ bekanntlich gerade diesem Amte sich möglichst zu entziehen, und schlechte dafür anzustellen ist nicht räthlich, weil sie selbst eher eine Überwa­ chung nöthig haben als daß sie Andere zu bewachen im Stande wären.", "4706": "Es darf daher nicht eine Behörde allein für diesen Dienst bestimmt sein, und auch nicht fortwährend dieselbe obrigkeitliche Person;", "4707": "sondern von der jungen Mannschaft, da wo sie ohnehin zum regelmäßigen Wachdienst berufen ist, sowie von den Beamten müssen immer Andere der Reihe nach diese Aufsicht führen.", "4708": "Diese Aemter also sind als die nothwendigsten voranzustellen.", "4709": "Nach ihnen kommen die nicht minder nothwendigen, aber mit höherem Range ausgestatteten, weil sie viel Erfahrung und großes Vertrauen erfordern.", "4710": "Dergleichen sind etwa die welche die Bewachung der Stadt zu besorgen haben, nnd alle die für Kriegszwecke bestimmt sind.", "4711": "Denn man hat im Frieden wie im Krieg Aufseher über die Wachen an den Thoren und auf den Mauern und Offiziere zur Musterung und Einreihung der Bürger nöthig.An dem einen Orte sind nun für alle diese Zwecke mehrere, an dem andern weniger Beamte, in den kleinen Staaten sogar Einer für , alle.", "4712": "Man nennt sie Strategen nnd Polemarchen lFeldherrn und Kriegsoberste).", "4713": "Hat ein Staat auch Retterei, Leihctbewaffnete, Bo­ genschützen, Seetruppen, so werden auch für diese

die Rechnungßabnahme und Prüfung, die Verantwortlichkeit der Be­ amten, und den Schluß machen die für die Berathung der allgemeinen Angelegenheiten aufgestellten Behörden.Staaten welche größere Ruhe und größeren Wohlstand genießen und auch für die öffentliche Sittsamkeit Sorge tragen wollen haben noch besonders Behörden für Weiberzucht, Wahrung der Gesetze, Kinderzucht, Aufsicht über die Gymnasien, außerdem für Besorgung der gymnischen Spiele, der DionysoSseste und anderer etwaiger Schau­ spiele dieser Art.", "4734": "Von diesen Aemtern sind einige offenbar nicht demokratisch, wie die Aufsicht über Weiber und Kinder, denn die Armen sind aus Mangel an Sklaven genöthigt ihre Weiber und Kinder als Dienerschaft zu gebrauchen.", "4735": "Von den drei Behörden aber aus denen in einigen Staaten die höchste Gewalt gebildet wird, den Gesetzeswächtern, den Probulen und dem Rath, sind die GesetzeS­ wächter ein aristokratisches, die Probulen ein oligarchisches, der Rath ein volkstümliches

bestimmt haben, welches das wünschenswerteste Leben sei.", "4738": "Denn so lang dieß nicht ausge­ macht ist, so lang muß auch die beste Staatsverfassung eine ungelöste Frage bleiben.", "4739": "Zur besten Staatsverfassung gehört daß man unter ihr in Folge der daraus entspringenden Vortheile, wenn nicht unvor­ hergesehene Umstände eintreten, sich am wohlsten befinde.", "4740": "Deßwegen muß zuerst entschieden sein, welches im Ganzen für Alle das wün­ schenswerteste Leben sei, und dann, ob dieses Leben für die Gesell­ schaft und für den Einzelnen ein und dasselbe oder ein verschiedenes

nun, um von der einfachsten Eintheilung auszugehen, Niemand in Zweifel ziehen wollen daß der Glückselige von den drei Arten von Gütern die es gibt, den äußeren, den leiblichen und den geistigen, alle

jedes beliebige Maß für hinreichend, aber den Besitz von Reichthum, Geld, Macht, Ehre und dergleichen sucht man bis ins Unendliche zu steigern.", "4748": "Wir entgegnen ihnen daß es leicht ist in diesen Dingen sich anS der Erfahrung zu überzeugen, wenn man sieht daß die Tugenden nicht durch die äußeren Güter, sondern diese durch jene erworben und erhalten werden, und daß die Glückseligkeit des Lebens, ob sie nun im Genusse oder in der Tugend oder in Beidem bestehe, weit eher solchen Menschen zu Theil wird die Herz und Geist bis zu einem vorzüglichen Grad ausgebildet haben und sich mit einem mäßigen Besitz äußerer Güter begnügen als denen welche die letzteren zwar in einem daS Bedürfniß übersteigenden Maße besitzen, aber an den ersteren Mangel leiden.Jedoch auch auf dem Wege der vernunftmäßigen Betrachtung ist dieses leicht einzusehen.", "4749": "Die äußeren Güter haben ihre Schranken, wie ein Werkzeug.", "4750": "Alles waS zum Gebrauch angewendet wird ist von der Art daß daS Uebermaß desselben nothwendig entweder schadet oder doch dem Besitzer nichts nützt;", "4751": "aber jedes geistige Gut wird nur um so nützlicher je höher eS gesteigert wird, wenn man überhaupt diesen

zufalle als ihm Tugend und Einsicht und ein entsprechendes Handeln zukommt, daS sei bei uns ausgemacht, und dafür kann uns die Gottheit zum Beweise dienen, die gewiß glücklich und selig ist, aber nicht durch irgend ein äußeres Gut, sondern durch sich selbst allein und durch ihr innerstes Wesen.", "4757": "Deßwegen ist bekanntlich auch das Glück etwas wesentlich Anderes als die Glückseligkeit.", "4758": "Denn die Güter welche außer der Seele liegen sind Gaben des Zufalls und des Glücks;", "4759": "gerecht aber und weise wird Niemand durch Zufall oder Glück.", "4760": "Daraus

haben dieselbe Bedeutung und Ausdrucksform wie die Eigenschaften um deretwillcn jeder einzelne Mensch gerecht, verständig und weise genannt wird.", "4764": "Soviel glaubte ich über diese Frage der folgenden Untersuchung vorausschicken zu müssen;", "4765": "denn sie ganz unberührt zu lassen war ebenso wenig möglich als sie in allen ihren Beziehungen zu erledigen.", "4766": "DaS Letztere gehört in einen andern Vortrag.", "4767": "Jetzt soll soviel fest­ gestellt sein daß das beste Leben sowohl für den Einzelnen besonders.", "4768": "als für die Staatsgesellschaft im'Ganzen dasjenige sei in

einleuchtend.", "4772": "Jedermann wird wohl zugeben daß Glückseligkeit immer dasselbe sei.", "4773": "Wer das Glücklichleben für den Einzelnen in den Reichthum setzt, der wird auch den ganzen Staat,

offenbar die eifrigsten Verehrer der Tugend in alter nnd neuer Zeit sich theilen, die politische meine ich und die philosophische.Nun kommt aber nicht wenig darauf an auf welcher Seite die Wahrheit

Ansichten.", "4789": "Noch Andere behaupten daß gerade die despotische und tyrannische Form der Staats­ gewalt allein glücklich mache.", "4790": "Ja, in manchen Staaten ist eS Grund- bestimmung der Verfassung, über die Nachbarn despotisch zu herrschen.", "4791": "So sehr daher auch in den meisten Staaten der größte Theil der Ge­ setze so zu sagen zusammen gewürfelt ist, so ist doch da wo

Wünschen freien Lauf lassen;", "5095": "aber die Ausführung hängt von Um­ ständen ab.", "5096": "Deßhalb lassen wir für jetzt weitere Erörterungen hier­ über bei Seite.13.", "5097": "(12)", "5098": "Nun haben wir von der Staatskörperschaft selbst zu reden, d. h. wer und von welcher Art die Leute sein müssen aus wel­ chen ein glücklicher und wohlregierter Staat bestehen soll.", "5099": "Hier sind es nun zwei Bedingungen auf welchen unter allen Umständen das „Wohl\" beruht, erstens nämlich daß Zweck und Ziel der Handlungen richtig bestimmt sei, und zweitens daß man die zum Ziele führenden Mittel zu wählen wisse.", "5100": "Denn zwischen beiden kann ebensowohl Widerstreit als Uebereinstimmung stattfinden.", "5101": "Bisweilen ist das Ziel vortrefflich ausgesteckt, und doch verfehlt man es in der Anwendung der Mittel.", "5102": "Ein ander Mal hat man alle zum Zweck führenden Mittel in der Hand, setzt sich aber einen falschen Zweck.", "5103": "Und endlich kann es der Fall sein daß man Beides verfehlt, wie in der Arzneikunde, wo sie manchmal weder das richtig erkennen wie der Körper im ge­ sunden Zustand beschaffen sein muß, noch auch die für den vorgesetzten Zweck wirksamen Mittel treffen.", "5104": "Darum muß man in den Künsten und Wissenschaften dieser beiden Bestimmungen mächtig sein, deS Zwecks und der Mittel zum Zweck.", "5105": "iDaß nun Alle nach Wohlergehen und nach der Glückseligkeit streben ist offenbar.", "5106": "Aber nur Einige sind im Stande dieses Ziel zu erreichen, Andere — sei eS aus zufälligen Ursachen oder auS eigener Unfähigkeit — nicht.", "5107": "Denn um glücklich zu leben bedarf man auch äußerer Hülfsmittel, bessere Naturen nur in geringerem Maße, schlimmere in höherem.", "5108": "Andere suchen gleich von Anfang die Glück­ seligkeit nicht aus dem rechten Wege, obgleich ihnen alle Mittel dazu z^ Gebot stehen.", "5109": "Da nun hier unsere Absicht ist die beste Verfassung zu betrachten, dieß aber diejenige ist nach welcher ein Staat am besten regiert werden sann, am jbesten regiert aber derjenige Staat sein dürfte in welchem es der Gesammtheit am ehesten möglich gemacht ist glückselig zu leben, so kommt es offenbar daraus an zu wissen waS Glückseligkeit sei.Schon in der Ethik (wenn anders jene Untersuchungen einigen Werth haben) sagte ich '), sie sei die vollendete Wirksamkeit und Aus­ übung der Tugend, und zwar nicht blos bedingt, sondern absolut.", "5110": "Unter bedingt verstehe ich das Nothwendige, unter absolut das Schöne:", "5111": "z.", "5112": "B. in der Sphäre der gerechten Handlungen haben die gerechten Bestrafungen und Züchtigungen zwar auch ihren Grund in der Tugend, aber sie sind nothwendig und haben daS Schöne nur in der Form deS Rothwendigen an sich;", "5113": "denn es wäre ja wünschenswerther wenn weder Personen noch Staaten überhaupt eine solche Handlung nöthig mach­ ten;", "5114": "Handlungen dagegen welche die öffentliche Achtung und den Wohlstand bezwecken sind absolut die schönsten.", "5115": "Denn das Eine ist Aufhebung eines Uebels- letztere Art von Handlungen ist daS Gegen­ theil:", "5116": "sie sind Bewirkung und Erzeugung des Guten.", "5117": "Nun kann zwar der tugendhafte Mann auch Armut, Krankheit und andere widrige Zufälle schön ertragen;", "5118": "aber die Glückseligkeit liegt in den entgegen­ gesetzten Zuständen.", "5119": "In den ethischen Untersuchungen sind wir auch auf den weiteren Satz gekommen daß der Tugendhafte ein solcher Mann sei dem vermöge seiner Tugend die äußern Güter zum Absolut- -guten werden.", "5120": "Offenbar muß aber auch die Anwendung der Güter tugendhaft und absolutschön sein;", "5121": "was die Menschen zu dem Irrthum verleitet, Ursache der Glückseligkeit seien die äußeren Güter, gerade wie wenn man das reine und schöne Citherspiel mehr dem Instrument als der Kunst zuschreiben wollte.Aus dem Gesagten ergibt sich als nothwendig daß der Gesetz­ geber Einiges vorfinden, Anderes schaffen muß.", "5122": "Daher können wir das Zusammentreffen derjenigen Bedingungen des Staates worüber das Glück Herr ist (und daß es Herr darüber sei setzen wir voraus) nur herzlich wünschen;", "5123": "daß aber der Staat tugendhaft werde ist nicht mehr das Werk des Glückes, sondern der Einsicht und des Willens.", "5124": "Tugendhaft wird aber ein Staat gewiß nur dadurch daß die an der Verwaltung Theil habenden Bürger tugendhaft sind.", "5125": "Nach unserer Ansicht haben aber alle Bürger an der Verwaltung Antheil.", "5126": "Dem­ nach ist die Frage:", "5127": "wie wird ein Mann tugendhast?", "5128": "Denn selbst wenn es möglich wäre daß Alle tugendhaft seien ohne daß jeder ein­ zelne Bürger es sei, so wäre doch das Letztere vorzuziehen;", "5129": "denn daraus daß jeder Einzelne tugendhast ist folgt von selbst daß es auch Alle zusammen sind.", "5130": "Nun werden aber die Menschen gut und tugendhast durch drei Dinge.", "5131": "Diese sind:", "5132": "Anlage, Gewöhnung, Vernunft.", "5133": "Zuerst muß man dazu geboren, d. h. ein Mensch, nicht irgend ein Thier, und dann an Leib und Seele so und so beschaffen sein.", "5134": "Einiges ist uns ver­ geblich angeboren, weil die Gewöhnung es verändert, denn wir haben manche Anlagen von Natur die sich durch die Gewöhnung der Sitte zum Schlimmeren oder zum Besseren wenden.", "5135": "Nur bei den Thieren ist es der Fall daß sie meist nach dem Naturtrieb leben, wenige in einigen Beziehungen nach Gewohnheiten;", "5136": "der Mensch dagegen lebt auch nach der Vernunft, denn er allein hat Vernunft.", "5137": "Diese zwei Eigenschaften müssen also mit einander in Ueber­ einstimmung gebracht werden.", "5138": "Denn oft handelt der Mensch gegen seine Gewohnheiten und seinen Naturtrieb nach der Richtschnur der Vernunft, wenn er sich überzeugt hat daß es anders besser sei.", "5139": "Von welcher natürlichen Anlage nun diejenigen sein müssen welche für den Gesetzgeber lenksam genug sein sollen, haben wir oben (VII, 7) schon auseinandergesetzt:", "5140": "das Weitere ist Sache der Erziehung;", "5141": "denn Einiges lernen die Menschen durch Gewöhnung, Anderes » durch Unterricht.14. (13)", "5142": "Da jedes politische Gemeinwesen aus Regierenden und Regierten besteht, so ist nunmehr die Frage, ob die Regierenden und die Gehorchenden mit einander abwechseln oder lebenslänglich immer dieselben sein sollen.", "5143": "Denn eS ist klar daß auch die Erziehung sich nach dieser Unterscheidung richten muß.", "5144": "Wenn nun freilich die eine dieser Klassen so sehr über die andere hervorragte wie wir glauben daß die Götter und Heroen über die Menschen hervorragen, zunächst also durch ein weit höheres Maß des Körpers und dann auch des Geistes, so daß die Ueberlegenheit der Regierenden ihren Untergebenen ganz unzweifelhaft und augenscheinlich wäre, so würde es offenbar besser sein daß immer dieselben ein Mal wie daS andere einerseits be­ fehlen , anderseits gehorchen.", "5145": "Da aber dieß nicht leicht anzunehmen ist, und sonst der Fall nicht vorkommt daß die Könige ihre Unterthanen soweit überragen wie Skylar von den Indern erzählt, so ergibt sich augenscheinlich aus vielen Gründen die nothwendige Folge daß Alle ohne Unterschied abwechselnd am Befehlen und Gehorchen An­ theil haben müssen.", "5146": "Denn die Gleichheit für Ebenbürtige besteht in der völligen Gleichstellung, und eine im Widerspruch mit dem Rechte stehende freie Verfassung kann sich schwerlich halten, weil in diesem Fall an die Partei der Beherrschten zum Zweck eines Umsturzes sich alle Bewohner des Landes anschließen;", "5147": "daß aber die am Ruder sitzende Partei zahlreich genug sein sollte um diesen Allen überlegen zu sein, gehört zu den unmöglichen Dingen.Daß jedoch gleichwohl die Regierenden vor den Gehorchenden etwas voraushaben müssen ist ganz unleugbar.", "5148": "Wie nun dieses Verhältniß stattfinden, und wie dennoch beide Theile gleichen Antheil haben sollen, darauf hat der Gesetzgeber sein Augenmerk zu richten.", "5149": "Es ist aber vorhin schon davon die Rede gewesen.", "5150": "Die Natur selbst hat einen Ausweg an die Hand gegeben, indem sie aus dem der Gattung nach identischen Stande zwei Klassen gemacht hat, eine jüngere und eine ältere, von denen der einen das Gehorchen zukommt, der andern das Befehlen.", "5151": "Da fühlt sich denn Keiner beschwert daß er seinem Alter gemäß gehorchen muß, noch hält er sich für zu gut dazu, zumal da er in Aussicht hat ebenfalls in jenen Rang vorzu­ rücken , sobald er das gehörige Alter erreicht hat.", "5152": "Man kann also einerseits sagen daß immer Dieselben regieren und regiert werden, anderseits daß es Verschiedene nach einander seien.", "5153": "So muß also auch die Erziehung in der einen Beziehung dieselbe, in der andern eine verschiedene sein.", "5154": "Und das Gehorchen selbst ist die Schule des Befehlens, denn es heißt:", "5155": "wer gut befehlen soll muß zuerst gehorcht haben.", "5156": "Nun besteht aber alle Herrschaft, wie in den ersten Büchern ge­ sagt worden ist, entweder zum Besten des Herrschenden oder des Be­ herrschten.", "5157": "Erstere nennen wir die despotische, letztere die Regierung über Freie.", "5158": "So ist auch unter dem was geboten wird ein Unterschied nicht der Dienstleistung sondern dem Zwecke nach.", "5159": "Deßwegen sind auch manche Geschäfte, welche sich nur für Diener zu eignen scheinen, anständig genug um von freigebornen Jünglingen versehen zu werden;", "5160": "denn unter dem Gesichtspunkte deS Anständigen und Nichtanständigen unterscheiden sich die Handlungen nicht sowohl an sich als nach dem Zweck und nach ihrer Bestimmung für wen.Nach unserem Grundsatz, daß die Tugend des Bürgers und die des Regenten eine und dieselbe sei mit der Tugend des tugendhaftesten Mannes und daß dieselbe Person zuerst Untergebener und nachher Regierender werden müsse, hätte der Gesetzgeber auszumitteln, wie und durch welche Beschäftigungen die Menschen tugendhaft werden, und das hängt von der Frage ab, was das Ziel des tugendhaftesten Lebens sei.Die Seele zerfällt in zwei Theile, deren einer an sich Vernunft hat, der andere sie zwar nicht an sich hat, aber ihr zu gehorchen fähig ist.", "5161": "Die Tugenden dieser beiden Theile bedingen es nach unserer Ansicht daß ein Mensch tugendhaft genannt wird.", "5162": "Welcher von beiden nun vorzugsweise als Selbstzweck zu betrachten sei, kann denen die unserer Eintheilung folgen nicht schwer zu entscheiden sein.", "5163": "Denn immer ist das Geringere um des Besseren willen da;", "5164": "das ist sowohl an den Werken der Kunst als denen der Natur klar.", "5165": "Das Bessere aber ist hier der vernünftige Theil.Nun unterscheidet man an der Vernunft nach unserer gewohnten Eintheilung zwei Seiten, die praktische und die theoretische Vernunft.", "5166": "Dieselbe Eintheilung muß also natürlich auch auf den vernünftigen Theil der Seele Anwendung finden.", "5167": "Ein ähnliches Verhältniß wie bei der Seele werden wir aber auch unter den Handlungen annehmen, und zwar müssen die Handlungen des von Natur besseren Theils einen höheren Werth haben für denjenigen der entweder unter allen oder doch unter jenen beiden Arten zu wählen im Stande ist:", "5168": "denn immer und Jedem ist das am wünschenswertesten was das höchste für ihn Erreichbare ist.Endlich theilt sich das Leben überhaupt in Arbeit und Muße, Krieg und Frieden, und alle Thätigkeit einerseits in nothwendige und nützliche, anderseits in schöne.", "5169": "Unter diesen Gegensätzen muß noth­ wendig dasselbe Verhältniß stattfinden wie zwischen den Theilen der Seele und ihren Aeußerungen:", "5170": "Krieg um des Friedens willen, Arbeit um der Muße willen, das Nothwendige und Nützliche um des Schönen willen ^).Nun hat der Staatsmann bei der Gesetzgebung zwar auf Alles Rücksicht zu nehmen nach Maßgabe sowohl der?verschiedenen Seelen- kräfte als ihrer Aeußerungen, besonders aber auf die bessere Seite, die eigentlichen Zwecke.", "5171": "In gleicher Weise sind die verschiedenen Berufskreise und die Arten der Beschäftigung zu unterscheiden.", "5172": "Die Bürger sollen nämlich im Stande sein Geschäfte zu treiben und Krieg zu führen, noch mehr aber in Frieden und Muße zu leben;", "5173": "das Noth­ wendige und Nützliche zu schaffen, noch mehr aber das Schöne.", "5174": "Für diese Zwecke also müssen sie schon in der Jugend und sofort in jedem Alter das der Erziehung noch bedarf erzogen werden.", "5175": "Die hellenischen Staaten deren Verfassungen heutzutage für die besten gelten, und die Gesetzgeber welche diese Versassungen aufge­ stellt haben, haben offewbar weder den Staatseinrichtungen die Rich­ tung auf den höheren Zweck gegeben, noch die Gesetze und die Er­ ziehung auf die Entwicklung aller Tugenden berechnet, sondern sich ans materiellem Interesse auf die Beförderung der nützlich scheinenden und gewinnbringenden Tugenden geworfen.", "5176": "In ihre Fußstapfen tretend haben nachher einige Schriftsteller sich zu denselben Grundsätzen bekannt.", "5177": "Denn indem sie die Verfassung der Lakedämonier preisen bewundern sie die Absicht des Gesetzgebers, nach der er alle seine Ein­ richtungen auf die Ueberlegenheit im Kriege berechnet hat.", "5178": "So leicht aber diese Ansichten aus Gründen der Vernunft zu widerlegen sind, so sehr sind sie jetzt auch durch die Erfahrung widerlegt.", "5179": "Die meisten Menschen haben allerdings einen Hang zur Gewaltherrschaft über die Masse, weil sie die Mittel zu einer Menge von Vortheilen darbietet.", "5180": "Aus diesem Grunde scheint auch Thibron ^), und jeder Andere der über ihre Verfassung geschrieben hat, den Gesetzgeber der Lakonen darum zu bewundern weil sie in Folge ihrer körperlichen Uebung für die Gefahren des Kampfes viele Menschen unterjocht hatten.", "5181": "Und doch ist es klar daß die Lakonen jetzt, da sie keine Herrschaft mehr besitzen, auch nicht glücklich sind, folglich ihr Gesetzgeber kein guter war.", "5182": "Es wäre doch gar zu lächerlich zu glauben daß sie mit Beibehaltung dieser Gesetze und völlig ungehindert in ihrer Befolgung die Frucht davon, das glückliche Leben, freiwillig verschmäht haben.", "5183": "Schon über die Form der Herrschaft welcher der Gesetzgeber den Vorzug geben müsse herrscht eine irrige Ansicht.", "5184": "Die Regierung über Freie ist doch schöner und weit günstiger für die Ausübung der Tugend als eine despotische Gewalt.", "5185": "Also darf man einen Staat nicht deßwegen für glücklich halten nnd seinen Gesetzgeber darum preisen weil er die Bürger zur Tapferkeit erzogen hat, um über ihre Nachbarn zu herrschen.", "5186": "Zudem hat diese Richtung nochleinen großen Nachtheil.", "5187": "Wenn dieser Grundsatz richtig wäre, müßte ja auch jeder einzelne Bürger der die Macht dazu hat danach trachten sich zum Herrn des eigenen Staates zu machen;", "5188": "ein Versuch den die Lakedämonier ihrem König Paufamas zum Verbrechen machen, in so hohen Ehren er bei ihnen stand.", "5189": "Grundsätze und Gesetze dieser Art sind also weder staats­ klug noch nützlich noch richtig.", "5190": "Nur was dem einzelnen Bürger und dem Staate zugleich das Beste ist muß der Gesetzgeber den Gemütern der Menschen einpflanzen.", "5191": "Mithin soll man auch die kriegerischen Uebungen nicht dazu betreiben um Andere, die eS nicht verdienen, zu unterjochen, sondern zunächst um selbst nicht unter ein fremdes Joch zu gerathen, sodann aber auch um die Oberanführung zum Vortheil der Untergebenen, nicht aber zum Behuf einer Zwangsherrschaft über Alle, zu gewinnen, und endlich drittens um diejenigen zu beherrschen welche Sklaven zu sein verdienen.Daß aber der Gesetzgeber vielmehr darauf Bedacht nehmen muß das Kriegswesen und die ganze übrige Gesetzgebung dem Zwecke der Muße und des Friedens unterzuordnen, bezeugt neben den Vernunft­ gründen auch die Erfahrung:", "5192": "die meisten solcher kriegerischen Staaten erhalten sich zwar so lange sie Krieg führen, sobald sie aber die Herr­ schaft erlangt haben neigen sie sich zum Untergang.", "5193": "Im Frieden verlieren sie wie das Eisen ihre Stählung.", "5194": "Die Schuld davon trägt aber der Gesetzgeber, der sie nicht dazu erzogen hat der Muße leben zu können.15.", "5195": "Wenn also die Menschen sowohl einzeln als in Gemein­ schaft offenbar ein und dasselbe Ziel haben und der Begriff des besten Mannes und des besten Staates nothwendig derselbe sein muß, so ist klar daß auch die friedlichen Tugenden zur Grundlage des Staates gehören;", "5196": "denn, wie schon oft gesagt worden, Zweck des Krieges ist der Friede, Zweck der Arbeit die Ruhe.Die der Ruhe und Erholung dienenden Tugenden sind nun nicht blos solche die in der Muße, sondern auch solche die in der Geschäftig­ keit zur Anwendung kommen.", "5197": "Denn es müssen viele nothwendigen Bedürfnisse befriedigt sein um sich der Muße ergeben zu können.", "5198": "Deßhalb muß die Staatsgenossenschaft Mäßigung, Mut und Aus­ dauer besitzen;", "5199": "denn „Muße ist nicht für Sklaven\" nach dem Sprüch­ ivort, wer aber Gefahren nicht mit Mut bestehen kann ist der Sklave jedes Angreifers.", "5200": "Nun sind Mut und Ausdauer für das geschäftige Leben, Philosophie für die Muße nöthig, Mäßigung und Gerechtig­ keit aber für^ beide Zustände, und nur noch mehr für ein Leben in Frieden und Ruhe.", "5201": "Denn der Krieg zwingt schon von selbst dazu gerecht und mäßig zu sein, der Genuß des Glückes aber und die Ruhe des Friedens macht gern übermütig.", "5202": "Darum haben diejenigen welche für die Glücklichsten gelten und alle Herrlichkeit des Lebens genießen,, wie etwa die auf den Inseln der Seligen, wie die Dichter sagen, Ge­ rechtigkeit und Mäßigung in hohem Grade nöthig.", "5203": "Denn die Se­ ligen werden der Philosophie, der Mäßigung und Gerechtigkeit am meisten bedürfen, je mehr sie im Ueberfluß des GlückeS sorglos dahinleben.", "5204": "Somit ist es einleuchtend warum ein Staat welcher glücklich und gut sein soll diese Tugenden besitzen muß.", "5205": "Denn wenn es überhaupt schimpflich ist die GlückSgüter nicht zu gebrauchen wissen, so ist eS . Noch viel schimpflicher sie mitten in der Ruhe nicht zu gebrauchen wissen, sondern nur in der Unruhe und im Krieg sich tapfer zu zeigen, in Frieden und Ruhe dagegen als Sklavenseele", "5206": ".Der Staat der Lakedämonier darf also nicht das Muster sein wie man die Tugend üben müsse.", "5207": "Jene weichen von den Andern nicht darin ab daß sie nicht dieselben Güter wie die Andern als die höchsten betrachteten, sondern vielmehr durch die Meinung, diese Güter werden durch eine einzige Tugend erworben.", "5208": "Wenn nun dieß höhere Güter sind, so folgt von selbst daß auch ihr Genuß , höher steht als der der Tugenden und daß er Zweck derselben ist.", "5209": "Demnach haben wir jetzt zu untersuchen, wie und durch welche Mittel man dazu gelange.Wir haben bereits oben auseinandergesetzt daß Anlage, Ge­ wöhnung und Vernunft dazu nöthig seien.", "5210": "Was unter diesen drei Bedingungen die Naturanlage dem Menschen mitgegeben haben müsse, ist oben erklärt worden;", "5211": "es bleibt nur noch zu untersuchen, ob die Er­ ziehung zuerst von der Vernunft oder von der Gewöhnung ausgehen soll.", "5212": "Denn diese beiden müssen mit einander im vollkommensten Ein­ klang stehen, weil es ebensowohl möglich ist daß die Vernunft des besten Zwecks verfehle als daß man durch die Gewohnheit für sich auf den gleichen Weg geführt werde.", "5213": "Für's Erste ist es augenscheinlich daß beim Menschen wie bei andern Wesen die Geburt ein Anfang (ein Werden) ist und ihr Ziel (die Reife) wieder der Anfang zu einem andern Ziele.", "5214": "Nun sind Ver­ nunft und Geist das letzte Ziel unserer Natur;", "5215": "auf diesen Zweck muß also die Erzeugung sowohl als die Gewöhnung gerichtet werden.", "5216": "Ferner, wie Leib und Seele zwei verschiedene Dinge sind, so unterscheiden wir auch an der Seele zwei Theile:", "5217": "den vernunftlosen und den vernünftigen, und ebenfalls zwei Vermögen derselben, das Begehrungsvermögen und das Denken *).", "5218": "Wie nun der Leib der Entstehung nach früher da ist als die Seele, so auch der vernunftlose Theil der Seele vor dem vernünftigen.", "5219": "Auch dieß lehrt die Beob­ achtung.", "5220": "Denn Erregung, Verlangen, Begierde sind schon in den Kindern gleich nach der Geburt vorhanden;", "5221": "das Denken und die Ver­ nunft aber entwickeln sich erst mit der weiteren Ausbildung.", "5222": "Dem­ zufolge muß die Pflege des Körpers nothwendig früher beginnen als die der Seele, alsdann erst die des Begehrungsvermögens, und zwar hat die Pflege des letztern ihren Zweck in der Vernunft, wie die des Körpers in der Seele.16.", "5223": "(14)", "5224": "Wenn also der Gesetzgeber gleich von Anfang darauf sehen soll daß seine Zöglinge schon körperlich möglichst vollkommen werden, so hat er vor Allem sein Augenmerk auf die Schließung der Ehen zu richten und zu bestimmen wann und was für Personen die ehliche Verbindung mit einander eingehen dürfen.", "5225": "Er muß bei den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen über diese Gemeinschaft sowohl auf die Personen als auf die Lebensdauer Rücksicht nehmen, damit sie nach ihren Altersstufen in demselben Zeitpunkt der Reife zusammentreffen und ihre Kräfte nicht in ein Mißverhältniß gerathen, was der Fall wäre wenn z.", "5226": "B. der Mann noch zeugungsfähig ist, die Frau aber nicht mehr, oder wenn sie es noch ist, aber der Mann nicht;", "5227": "denn dieses Verhältniß erzeugt MißHelligkeit und Entzweiung unter ihnen.Sodann muß er auch die Zeit der Nachfolge der Kinder berück­ sichtigen.", "5228": "Denn die Kinder dürfen an Alter hinter den Vätern weder allzu weit zurück sein, sonst ernten weder die Aeltern den Dank der Kinder, noch genießen die Kinder die Unterstützung der Väter;", "5229": "noch auch ihnen zu nahe stehen, denn dieß bringt mancherlei Uebelstände mit sich.", "5230": "Einmal ist die Achtung bei solchen Kindern geringer, weil sie gleichsam Altersgenossen der Aeltern sind, und dann führt dieses Nahestehen in der Vermögensverwaltung mancherlei Verdruß herbei.Ferner — und davon sind wir eben ausgegangen — hat er darauf zu sehen daß die Körperbeshcaffenheit der Neugebornen der Absicht des Gesetzgebers entspreche.", "5231": "Alles dieß läßt sich vielleicht durch eine einzige Vorkehrung er­ reichen.", "5232": "Da nämlich die Zeugungsfähigkeit im Durchschnitt ihre bestimmte Grenze hat, bei Männern im äußersten Fall das siebenzigste, bei Weibern das fünfzigste Jahr, so muß bei Eingehung der Ehe das beiderseitige Alter in diesem Verhältniß stehen.", "5233": "Auch die Paarung zu junger Leute ist der Kindererzeugung nachtheilig.", "5234": "Bei allen Thieren sind die Geburten der allzujungen unvollkommen, meist Weib­ chen und von kleiner Gestalt, folglich muß dasselbe auch bei den Men­ schen der Fall sein.", "5235": "Ein Beweis davon ist daß in allen Staaten wo es Sitte ist die Kinder sehr jung zu verheiraten die Leute unvoll­ kommen nnd von kleinem Wuchs sind.", "5236": "Zudem leiden die jungen Mütter bei den Geburten viel mehr und gehen häufiger dabei zu Grunde.", "5237": "Daher deuten denn auch Einige den Orakelspruch den die Trözenier auf die Frage erhielten warum so viele Menschen bei ihnen sterben ,- anstatt auf die Bestellung der Flur, dahin daß die Mädchen zu jung heiraten').", "5238": "Endlich ist es auch der Zucht förderlich nur ältere Mädchen zu verheiraten;", "5239": "denn junge Mädchen Pflegen durch den ' geschlehctlichen Umgang wollüstiger zu werden.", "5240": "Der männliche Körper dagegen wird am Wachsthum gehindert wenn", "5241": "Einer die Bei­ wohnung vollzieht so lang er noch im Wachsen ist;", "5242": "denn auch das hat seine bestimmte Zeit, über welche hinaus keine Zunahme mehr stattfindet.", "5243": "Diesem nach ist es passend die Mädchen etwa mit achtzehn, die jungen Männer ungefähr mit siebenunddreißig Jahren zu verheiraten;", "5244": "denn um diese Zeit werden sie in der Blüte der Körperkraft zusammen­ kommen und das Aufhören der Kinderzeugung wird bei Beiden richtig zusammentreffen.", "5245": "Auch wird der Eintritt der Kinder an die Stelle der Eltern zu einer Zeit erfolgen wo die Ersteren im Anfang ihrer Blüte stehen, vorausgesetzt daß ihre Geburt nach der Regel sogleich erfolgt, die Letzteren aber Altershalber bereits im Abgang begriffen sind, d. h. um das siebenzigste Lebensjahr (des Vaters).Soviel über das Alter in welchem die Ehe zu schließen ist.", "5246": "Hin­ sichtlich der Jahreszeit ist der auch jetzt noch herrschende Gebrauch zu empfehlen welcher bestimmt diese Beiwohnung im Winter vorzu­ nehmen Dann müssen natürlich die Eheleute selbst bei der Kinder­ zeugung auch die Anweisungen der Aerzte und der Physiker beachten.", "5247": "Die Aerzte geben gehörige Auskunft über die geeignete Stimmung des Körpers, die Physiker über die günstigen Winde.", "5248": "Im Allge­ meinen empfehlen sie die Nordwinde mehr als die Südwinde.Welche Leibesbeshcaffenheit übrigens für die Zeugung am vortheil­ haftesten sei, davon ist ausführlicher in dem Abschnitt über die öffent­ liche Erziehung zu sprechen, hier mögen einige Andeutungen genügen.", "5249": "Zur Geschäftstüchtigkeit, zur Gesundheit und zur Kinderzeugung ist weder die Körperverfassung des Athleten noch eine weichliche und schwächliche ersprießlich, sondern eine von mittlerer Stärke.", "5250": "Abge­ härtet muß sie freilich sein, aber abgehärtet nicht durch allzustrenge Arbeit und nicht durch einseitige Uebung, wie die Constitution eineS Athleten, sondern wie die Beschäftigungen eines freien ManneS eS erfordern.", "5251": "Und diese Beschaffenheit muß bei Männern und Weibern die gleiche sein.Auch die Schwangeren müssen ihren Körper sorgfältig Pflegen, und dürfen weder sich träger Ruhe ergeben noch von magerer Kost leben.", "5252": "Dieß kann nun der Gesetzgeber leicht bewirken, wenn er ver­ ordnet daß sie jeden Tag einen Gang zum Dienst einer Gottheit zu machen haben welche um Hülfe bei der Geburt angerufen wird.", "5253": "In geistiger Beziehung jedoch ist eS im Gegentheil rathsam daß sie sich ruhiger verhalten als in körperlicher, denn offenbar nimmt die Leibes­ frucht Eindrücke von der Schwangeren auf, wie die Gewächse die Einflüsse des Bodens.In Betreff der Aussetzung oder Auferziehung der Geborenen soll es Regel sein kein verkrüppeltes Kind aufzuziehen.", "5254": "Blos wegen zu vieler Kinder aber darf, wenn die bestehende Sitte der Ueberzahl vor­ beugt, kein NeugeborneS ausgesetzt werden;", "5255": "denn in diesem Falle ist ja die Kinderzeugung auf eine gewisse Zahl beschränkt.", "5256": "Sollten jedoch Eheleute darüber hinaus noch eins bekommen, so ist die Ab­ treibung anzuwenden, ehe die Frucht Empfindung und Leben erhält *).", "5257": "Denn von dem Vorhandensein der Empfindung und des Lebens wird s die Bestimmung des Erlaubten und Nichterlaubten abhängen.", "5258": "Nachdem nun für Mann und Weib das Alter bestimmt ist in welchem sie die Ehe eingehen sollen, soll nun auch bestimmt werden wie lange Zeit sie sich der Kinderzeugung widmen dürfen, denn die Frucht der allzu alten Personen wird, wie die der allzu jungen, unvoll­ kommen an Leib und Seele, die von hochbejahrten aber schwächlich.", "5259": "Man setze also die höchste Stufe der Berstandesentwicklung als Grenze.", "5260": "Diese fällt bei den meisten Menschen , wie sie auch einige Dichter an­ gegeben haben welche die Lebensdauer nach der Siebenzahl abmessen *), in die Zeit der Fünfzigerjahre.", "5261": "Wer also vier oder fünf Jahre über diesen Zeitpunkt hinaus ist muß von der Zeugung lebender Kinder abstehen;", "5262": "im Uebrigen darf er nur der Gesundheit wegen oder auS ähnlichen Gründen den ehelichen Umgang erklärtermaßen fortsetzen.Die Vermischung mit einer andern Frau oder einem andern Manne soll in der öffentlichen Meinung durchaus nie und nirgends und unter keinen Umständen für erlaubt gelten, so lange eins Gatte ist oder heißt, und wenn Jemand während der Periode der gesetzlichen Kinderzeugung sich so etwas zu Schulden kommen läßt, so soll er mit einer dem Verbrechen angemessenen Ehrenstrafe belegt werden.47. (45) Wenn die Kinder geboren sind, so bildet zuerst die Beschaffenheit der Nahrung ein wichtiges Moment für die Kräftigung des Körpers.", "5263": "Aus der Beobachtung der Thiere sowohl als derjenigen Völker welche sich angelegen sein lassen eine kriegerische Haltung an­ zuerziehen ergibt sich daß Muttermilch in genügendem Maße die zu­ träglichste Nahrung für den Körper ist;", "5264": "geistiges Getränke muß fern bleiben i), weil die Kinder leicht davon erkranken.Auch Bewegung , so weit sie in einem solchen Alter zuläßig ist, hat ihren Nutzen.", "5265": "Damit aber die Glieder in ihrer Zartheit nicht verdreht werden, bedienen sich heute noch einige Völkerschaften ge­ wisser künstlicher Vorrichtungen welche den Körper der Kleinen un­ verdreht erhalten.", "5266": "Zweckmäßig ist es ferner die Kinder gleich von klein auf an Kälte zu gewöhnen;", "5267": "denn dieß ist von dem günstigsten Einfluß auf Gesundheit sowohl als auf kriegerische Thätigkeit.", "5268": "Deß­ halb ist es bei vielen Barbaren Sitte die Neugebornen entweder in einen kalten Fluß zu tauchen oder nur mit einer leichten Hülle zu bekleiden, wie bei den Kelten Denn zu Allem woran man sie gewöhnen kann gewöhnt man sie besser gleich von der Geburt an, jedoch nur stufenweise.", "5269": "Auch ist der Körper des Kindes wegen seiner natürlichen Wärme zur Abhärtung gegen die Kälte besonders fähig.", "5270": "Diese und ähnliche Sorgfalt ist demnach bei der ersten Altersstufe anzuwenden.Das darauf folgende Alter bis in das fünfte Jahr, das man vernünftiger Weise noch nicht zum Lernen oder zu harten Arbeiten anhalten kann, um das Wachsthum nicht zu hindern, muß Bewegung genug haben um nicht in körperliche Trägheit zu verfallen.", "5271": "Diese mag man ihm neben andern Beschäftigungen auch durch das Spiel verschaffen.", "5272": "Doch auch die Spiele dürfen weder für Freigeborne un­ schicklich noch zu anstrengend oder erschlaffend sein.Auch auf die Erzählungen und Märchen, soweit sie dieses Alter hören darf, müssen die sogenannten Knabenausseher Acht haben.", "5273": "Denn alle solche Unterhaltungen sollen den Weg bahnen für den künftigen Beruf.", "5274": "Darum müssen die Spiele in der Regel Nach­ ahmungen der späteren ernsten Beschäftigungen sein.DaS Schreien und Weinen der Kinder verwehren Einige mit Unrecht in ihren Gesetzen '), denn es trägt zum Wachsthum bei.", "5275": "ES ist eine Art von Leibesübung für die jungen Körper.", "5276": "Wie das An­ halten des Athems den Arbeitenden Kraft gibt, so ist es auch mit den Kindern wenn sie ihre Stimme anstrengen", "5277": ".", "5278": "Die Knabenaufseher müssen aber aus die Unterhaltungen der Kinder überhaupt und namentlich darauf Acht haben daß sie so wenig als möglich mit den Sklaven zusammen sind.", "5279": "Denn dieses Alter,i und zwar bis zum isebenten Jahr, muß nothwendig zu Hause erzogen werden.", "5280": "Nun ist es natürlich daß sie schon in diesem Alter von Allem was sie Unedles hören oder sehen die Eindrücke in sich aufnehmen.", "5281": "Muß also der Gesetzgeber so sehr als irgend sonst etwas altes schänd­ liche Geschwätz überhaupt aus der Stadt verbannen, weil der Leicht- fertigkeit Schändliches zu reden auch das Thun sehr naheliegt, so ganz besonders aus dem Kreise der Jugend, damit sie dergleichen Dinge weder rede noch höre.", "5282": "Wenn aber Einer in Worten oder in Werken sich etwas Verbotenes der Art erlaubt, so soll man ihn, wenn es ein Freier ist, der aber zu den gemeinsamen Mahlen noch nicht Zutritt hat, mit Ehrenstrafen und Schlägen züchtigen;", "5283": "wenn er aber dieses Alter hinter sich hat, seiner sklavischen Gesinnung wegen mit ' der Erniedrigung in den unfreien Stand bestrafen.", "5284": "Wenn wir aber das schändliche Reden verbannen, so versteht eS sich von selbst daß auch das Anschauen unzüchtiger Gemälde und Darstellungen verboten sein muß.", "5285": "Deßhalb soll die Obrigkeit darauf achten daß kein Bildwerk, kein Gemälde solche Handlungen darstelle, ausgenommen in Tempeln solcher Gottheiten bei denen das Gesetz den Mutwillen gestattet*);", "5286": "aber auch dort erlaubt das Gesetz nur den Erwachsenen sowohl für sich als für Weib und Kinder die Feier zu begehen.", "5287": "Die Jüngeren dürfen weder zu den Possenspielen noch zur Komödie als Zuschauer zugelassen werden, ehe sie das Alter erreicht haben in welchem sie ihren Platz bei den Mahlen und Trinkgelagen bekommen 2) und die genossene Erziehung sie alle gegen die daraus entspringenden Nachtheile sichern wird.", "5288": "Hier haben wir jedoch diesen Gegenstand nur im Vorbeigehen besprochen;", "5289": "im Folgenden müssen wir länger bei der Erörterung desselben verweilen, indem wir die Frage auswerfen werden ob über­ haupt dergleichen zu gestatten sei oder nicht;", "5290": "und dann in welcher Weise.", "5291": "Für den Augenblick mußten wir der Frage Erwähnung thun weil sie nicht umgangen werden kann.", "5292": "Denn vielleicht urteilte der tragische Schauspieler Theodor *) in dieser Beziehung ganz richtig.", "5293": "Er ließ nie einen Schauspieler, auch keinen von den untergeordneten, vor sich auftreten, weil, wie er meinte, die Zuschauer sich gern von dem einnehmen ließen was sie zuerst hören.", "5294": "Das Gleiche ist ja auch im Verkehr mit Personen und mit Sachen der Fall.", "5295": "Immer haben wir eine Vorliebe für das Erste was uns vorkam.", "5296": "Deßwegen muß man alles Schlechte von der Jugend fern halten, besonders aber was zu Lasterhaftigkeit und Bosheit führt.Sobald aber die ersten fünf Jahre vorüber sind, so müssen sie in den zwei folgenden bis zum siebenten bereits Zuschauer bei den Vnterrichtsgegenständen werden die sie nachher lernen sollen.", "5297": "ES sind aber zwei Altersstufen nach welcher der Unterricht abgetheilt werden muß, die erste vom siebenten Jahre bis zur Mannbarkeit, die zweite von der Mannbarkeit bis zum einundzwanzigsten Jahre.", "5298": "Die Einteilung der Altersstufen von sieben zu sieben Jahren ist nicht zweckmäßig ').", "5299": "Man muß sich an die natürliche Scheidung halten.", "5300": "Denn alle Kunst und Bildung will nur das Mangelhafte der Natur ergänzen.", "5301": "Wir haben also zuerst zu untersuchen ob überhaupt eine allge­ meine Anordnung für die Erziehung getroffen werden soll;", "5302": "zweitens, ob eS zweckmäßiger sei die Sorge für dieselbe dem Staat oder, wie es gegenwärtig in den meisten Staaten der Fall ist, der einzelnen Familie aufzuerlegen;", "5303": "und drittens, worin diese Fürsorge bestehen müsse.5.", "5304": "Daß der Gesetzgeber sich vorzugsweise mit der Erziehung der Jugend beschäftigen müsse, dürfte Niemand wohl bezweifeln, denn die Vernachläßigung dieser Aufgabe von Seiten der Staaten bringt sogar den Verfassungen Gefahr.", "5305": "Die politische Bildung muß überall der Verfassung gemäß sein, denn der jeder Verfassung eigenthümlich entsprechende Volksgeist bürgt am meisten für den Bestand der Ver­ fassung, wie er sie auch von Anfang an begründet;", "5306": "also der demokra­ tische die Demokratie, der oligarchische die Oligarchie, und immer ist der bessere Volksgeist auch die Quelle einer besseren Verfassung.", "5307": "Zu­ dem gibt es in allen Fertigkeiten und Künsten eine vorbereitende Unterweisung und Gewöhnung zu deren Ausübung, folglich auch für die Handlungen der Tugend.Da nun der Zweck des ganzen Staates nur einer ist, so muß offenbar auch die Erziehung eine und dieselbe für Alle und die Sorge für dieselbe eine Aufgabe des Staates sein, nicht Privatsache, wie jetzt, wo Jeder nur für seine eigenen Kinder sorgt, indem er ihnen für sich besonders den besondern Unterrricht ertheilt der ihm gut dünkt.", "5308": "Was aber gemeinsame Angelegenheit ist, das muß auch gemeinsam geübt werden.", "5309": "Zudem darf man auch nicht glauben daß der einzelne Bürger nur sich selbst angehöre, sondern alle zusammen gehören dem Staate;", "5310": "denn Jeder ist ein Glied deS Staates, und die Sorge für das einzelne Glied muß der Natur der Sache nach immer die Sorge für das Ganze im Auge haben.", "5311": "Und gerade dieß könnte man an den Zakedämoniern loben, denn sie verwenden die meiste Sorgfalt auf die Jugend, und zwar von Staatswegen.", "5312": "Demnach ist einleuchtend daß die Gesetzgebung für die Erziehung sorgen und sie zur gemeinsame» Angelegenheit machen muß.2.", "5313": "Nun muß man aber wissen was Erziehung ist und wie man erziehen soll.", "5314": "Denn in unserer Zeit streitet man sich über die Lehr­ gegenstände.", "5315": "Nicht Alle sind einig darüber waS die Jugend lernen soll, sei es zur Ausübung der Tugend oder für den schönsten Lebens­ genuß.", "5316": "Eben so wenig ist ausgemacht ob man mehr auf den Ver­ stand oder auf den sittlichen Charakter wirken soll.", "5317": "Auf dem Boden der alltäglichen Erziehungsweise ist die Frage verwirrt, und keineswegs ist klar ob man mehr die zum Lebensbedarf erforderlichen oder die zur Tugend führenden Fertigkeiten oder die darüber hinaus gehenden (höheren) Studien treiben soll;", "5318": "denn jede dieser Ansichten hat ihre Vertheidiger gefunden.", "5319": "Und hinsichtlich der zur Tugend gehörigen Kenntnisse selbst ist man eben so wenig einig, denn auch von der Tugend haben sogleich wieder nicht Alle denselben Begriff, daher es natürlich ist daß sie auch über die Erziehung zur Tugend verschiedener Meinung sind.(2)", "5320": "Daß nun unter den nützlichen Kenntnissen vorzugsweise die nothwendigen gelehrt werden müssen, ist außer Zweifel;", "5321": "aber eS müssen keineswegs alle sein, sondern gemäß der Unterscheidung in freie und unfreie Beschäftigungen darf man sich nur mit demjenigen Theil des Nützlichen befassen welcher den der es treibt nicht zum Handarbeiter stempelt.", "5322": "Als handwerksmäßig ist aber diejenige Arbeit, Kunst oder Wissenschaft anzusehen welche den Leib oder die Seele oder den Verstand des Freien zur Uebung und den Geschäften der Tugend untüchtig macht;", "5323": "deßwegen nennen wir solche Künste welche den Körper entstellen, sowie alle Lohnarbeiten gemeine, denn sie geben dem Geist eine unfreie und niedrige Richtung.", "5324": "Aber auch von den freien Wissenschaften gilt eS daß man einige anständigerweise bis zu einem gewissen Grade betreiben darf;", "5325": "sich aber allzu eifrig darauf zu verlegen, um zur Meisterschaft darin zu gelangen, dringt die erwähnten Nachtheile mit sich.", "5326": "Auch kommt viel darauf an zu welchem Zweck man etwas treibt oder lernt.", "5327": "Um seiner selbst oder der Freunde willen oder der Tugend halber es zu thun ist eines Freien nicht unwürdig;", "5328": "wenn man aber dasselbe um Anderer willen thut, so dürste es sehr häufig als Taglöhner- und Sklaven- Arbeit erscheinen.", "5329": "Die jetzt eingeführten Nnterrichtsgegenstände neigen sich, wie schon gesagt, auf beide Seiten.3.", "5330": "In der Regel sind es vier Fächer in denen man die Jugend unterrichtet:", "5331": "Grammatik, Gymnastik, Musik, und als viertes bei Einigen Zeichenkunst.", "5332": "Die Grammatik und Zeichenkunst, weilte zum Lebensbedarf brauchbar und sonst von vielseitigem Nutzen sind;", "5333": "die Gymnastik, weil sie zur Tapferkeit erzieht;", "5334": "über den Zweck der Musik kann man bereits im Zweifel sein.", "5335": "Gegenwärtig besassen sich die Meisten mit ihr blos zum Vergnügen;", "5336": "vor Zeiten dagegen rechnete man sie zu den Erziehungsmitteln, weil die menschliche Natur selbst, wie schon oft gesagt worden.", "5337": "das Bedürfniß hat nicht blos in der rechten Weise thätig sondern auch in schöner Weise müßig sein zu können;", "5338": "denn sie (die Natur) ist, um es noch einmal zu sagen, daS bestimmende Prinzip in Allem.Da einmal Beides nöthig ist, die Muße aber der Geschäftigkeit vorzuziehen, so entsteht die Frage, womit man überhaupt in der Muße sich beschäftigen soll.", "5339": "Offenbar doch nicht mit Spielen, sonst imüßte ja daS Spiel für uns Lebenszweck sein.", "5340": "Dieß ist aber unstatthaft.", "5341": "Die Spiele sind vielmehr nur im Geschäftsleben zuläßig, sofern das Spiel zur Erholung dient, der Arbeitende aber der Erholung bedarf, weil die Geschäftigkeit mit Arbeit und Anstrengung verbunden ist.", "5342": "Daraus folgt daß man den Spielen nur mit sorgfältiger Wahl der Zeit Eingang gestatten darf und sie wie eine Arzenei gebrauchen muß.", "5343": "Denn diese Art von Gemütsbewegung ist Abspannung und — in Folge des damit verbundenen Vergnügens — Erholung.", "5344": "Die Muße dagegen enthält gewiß an sich schon das Vergnügen, die Glückseligkeit und seliges Leben.", "5345": "Diesen Genuß hat man aber nicht vom Geschäfts­ leben, sondern nur von der Muße.", "5346": "Denn der Geschäftige arbeitet für einen Zweck der noch nicht erreicht ist;", "5347": "die Glückseligkeit aber ist ein Ziel das Jedermann nicht mit Unlust, sondern mit Lust verbunden denkt.", "5348": "Diese Lust jedoch finden nicht Alle in der nämlichen Empfin­ dung, sondern je nach Eigenthümlichkeit und Charakter Jeder in etwas Anderem;", "5349": "der Beste in der edelsten Empfindung, die nur aus dem Schönsten hervorgeht.Es ist also klar daß man auch für den Genuß der Muße Manches lernen und darin gebildet werden muß und daß dieses Bilden und Lernen um seiner selbst willen geschieht, während das was für das Geschäftsleben gelernt wird nur unentbehrliches Mittel zu andern Zwecken ist.", "5350": "In diesem Sinn haben auch die Alten die Musik zur Erziehung gerechnet, nicht als unentbehrliches Mittel zum Leben, denn dazu ist sie gar nicht geeignet;", "5351": "noch als etwas Nützliches, sei es wie die Sprachkenntniß zu Geldgeschästen, zur HauSwirthschaft, zu den Wissenschaften und zu mancherlei öffentlichen Geschäften, oder wie das Zeichnen als Mittel um die Werke der Künstler besser beurteilen zu können, oder wie die Gymnastik für Gesundheit und Stärke;", "5352": "denn in keiner dieser Beziehungen sehen wir aus der Beschäftigung mit der Musik einen Nutzen hervorgehen.", "5353": "Es bleibt also nur übrig daß sie der Unterhaltung in der Muße diene, und zu diesem Zweck ist sie offen­ bar von den Alten angewandt, denn sie rechnen sie zu den Gegenständen der Unterhaltung der Freigebornen.", "5354": "Darum sagt auch Homer Sondern wen sich geziemt zum fröhlichen Schmause zu laden, und nach Aufzählung einiger Andern:", "5355": "Welche den Sänger berufen, der Alle zusammen ergötze.", "5356": "Und an einer andern Stelle sagt Odysseus, das sei die beste Unter­ haltung wenn unter fröhlichen Menschen Sitzet die schmausende Schaar in der Halle, dem Sänger zu lauschen, Reihnweis nebeneinander.(3)", "5357": "Daß es also eine Bildung gibt die man seinen Kindern ertheilen muß, nicht als ob sie von besonderem Nutzen oder unent­ behrlich wäre, sondern weil sie einem Freien anständig und schön ist, leuchtet ein;", "5358": "ob es aber ein einziger Gegenstand ist oder der Zahl nach mehrere, und welches diese sind und wie zu betreiben, davon ist später zu reden ').", "5359": "Für jetzt haben wir vorläufig soviel gewonnen daß wir auch von den Alten ein Zeugniß in Betreff der hergebrachten Unterrichtsgegenstände besitzen.", "5360": "Ein Beleg dazu ist eben die Musik.Ebenso einleuchtend ist es ferner daß man auch in den nützlichen Gegenständen seine Kinder unterrichten lassen muß, nicht blos wegen des unmittelbaren Nutzens, wie z. B. im Lesen und Schreiben, sondern auch weil sie das Mittel sind viele andere Kenntnisse sich zu erwerben.", "5361": "So auch im Zeichnen, nicht dazu daß sie bei Privateinkäufen keine Mißgriffe thun, oder beim Kauf und Verkauf von Kunstsachen sich vor Betrug verwahren können, als vielmehr darum weil es das Urteil über schöne Körperformen schärft.", "5362": "Ueberall nur nach der Nützlichkeit zu fragen schickt sich am wenigsten für edelgesinnte und freie Menschen.Da es nun ausgemacht ist daß man früher durch Gewöhnung als durch Unterricht, und den Körper früher als den Verstand bilden muß, so folgt von selbst daß man die Kinder zuerst der Gymnastik und der Ringkunst übergeben muß, denn jene bildet die Haltung des Körpers, diese die Fertigkeiten.4.", "5363": "Heutzutage Pflegen die Staaten welche im Rufe stehen am meisten für die Jugend zu sorgen einerseits ihr nur eine athletische -Haltung zu verleihen, mit Beeinträchtigung der Gestalt und des Wachsthums der Körper.", "5364": "Die Lakonen verfielen zwar nicht in diesen Fehler, sie versetzen sie aber durch Anstrengungen in thierische Wild­ heit, als ob dieß der beste Weg zur Tapferkeit sei.", "5365": "Allein man darf, wie schon oft gesagt worden, bei der Erziehung weder überhaupt nur auf eine einzige noch vorzugsweise auf diese Tugend sehen.", "5366": "Und wäre auch das Letztere richtig, so erreichen sie diesen Zweck nicht ein­ mal.", "5367": "Denn weder bei den Thieren noch bei den Völkern sehen wir die Tapferkeit im Gefolge der wildesten, sondern vielmehr der ruhigeren und löwenartigen Charaktere.", "5368": "ES gibt viele Völker welche zum Morden und Menschenfressen gleich bei der Hand sind, wie die Achäer und Heniochen am schwarzen Meere und einige andere Stämme des Binnenlandes, theils in ähnlichem theils in noch höherem Grade;", "5369": "es sind raublustige Völker, aber Tapferkeit besitzen sie nicht.", "5370": "Wissen wir ja doch von den Lakonen selbst daß sie, so lange sie in ihrer Lust zu schweren Arbeiten beharrten, den Andern überlegen waren, jetzt aber in den Leibesübungen wie in den kriegerischen Kämpfen den Uebrigen nachstehen.", "5371": "Denn nicht durch die Art und Weise wie sie die Jünglinge übten bekamen sie die Uebermacht, sondern allein da­ durch daß sie keine Gegner hatten die sich ebenfalls übten.Also das Schöne, nicht die Wildheit, soll den ersten Rang ein­ nehmen.", "5372": "Denn nicht ein Wolf oder sonst ein wildes Thier vermag irgend einen schönen Kampf zu bestehen, sondern allein der tapfere Mann.", "5373": "Wer die Knaben in dieser einseitigen Richtung zu weit gehen läßt und ihre Ausbildung in den nothwendigen Kenntnissen versäumt, der gerade richtet sie in Wahrheit zu handwerksmäßigen Menschen ab, indem er sie nur zu einerlei Dienstleistung für den Staatszweck brauch­ bar macht und dazu noch, wie bewiesen ist, schlechter als Andere.", "5374": "Man muß aber die Lakonen nicht nach ihren früheren Thaten beurteilen, sondern nach ihren jetzigen.", "5375": "Jetzt haben sie ebenbürtige Gegner in ihrer Erziehungsart, früher hatten sie deren keine.(4)", "5376": "Ueber die Anwendung gymnastischer Uebungen also und über das Maß dieser Anwendung sind wir einverstanden.", "5377": "Bis zur Reife des Alters sind leichtere Uebungen vorzunehmen, mit Vermei­ dung aller Zwangsdiät und Zwangsarbeiten, damit daS Wachsthum nicht gehemmt werde.", "5378": "Daß es sonst diese Folge haben kann, dafür ist folgender Umstand kein geringer Beweis:", "5379": "man findet unter den olym­ pischen Siegern höchstens zwei oder drei welche als Männer und auch schon als Knaben gesiegt haben, weil sie in der Jugend gewöhnlich durch übertriebene Anstrengung bei den Leibesübungen sich die Kraft rauben.", "5380": "Wenn hierauf die reifere Jugend drei Jahre mit den übri­ gen Unterrichtsgegenständen zugebracht hat, dann ist es schicklich das nachfolgende Alter zu Anstrengungen und Zwangskost anzuhalten.", "5381": "Geist und Körper zugleich anstrengen darf man nicht, weil jede der beiderlei Anstrengungen ihrer Natur nach entgegengesetzt wirkt, indem die des Körpers den Geist, die des Geistes den Körper hindert.5.", "5382": "Ueber die Musik haben wir schon oben einige Fragen erörtert;", "5383": "nun wird es aber angemessen sein dieselben hier wieder aufzunehmen und die Sache weiter zu führen, um für die Untersuchungen die viel­ leicht ein Anderer darüber anstellen will gewissermaßen einen Leit­ faden an die Hand zu geben.", "5384": "Denn es ist nicht so leicht auS einander zu setzen, welche Bedeutung sie hat oder zu welchem Zweck man sie sich aneignen soll.", "5385": "Soll sie etwa nur zur Kurzweil und Erholung dienen, wie Schlafen und Trinken?", "5386": "Diese beiden Dinge gehören zwar nicht an sich zu den ernsthaften Beschäftigungen, sind aber angenehm und wiegen zugleich die Sorgen in Schlummer, wie Euripides sagt.", "5387": "Diese Wirkung ist auch der Grund warum man die Musik mit jenen beiden in eine Klasse setzt und alle drei zu gleichem Zweck anwendet, Schlaf, Wein und Musik;", "5388": "auch den Tanz rechnet man dazu.", "5389": "Oder darf man vielmehr der Musik auch eine sittliche Wirkung beilegen, in dem Sinne daß wie die Gymnastik dem Körper eine gewisse Haltung verleiht, so die Musik im Stande ist dem Charakter eine gewisse Richtung zu geben, indem sie an ein anständiges Vergnügen gewöhne?", "5390": "Oder end­ lich (und dieß wäre als ein dritter Zweck zu betrachten) trägt sie zu geistreicher Unterhaltung bei?Dagegen erheben sich folgende Einreden.Daß man die Jugend nicht blos zur Kurzweil unterrichten soll unterliegt keinem Zweifel;", "5391": "denn so lange sie lernen, spielen sie nicht;", "5392": "das Lernen ist vielmehr mit Unlust verbunden.", "5393": "Auch zur ernsten Unterhaltung darf man die Musik den Knaben und dem jugendlichen Alter überhaupt nicht zuweisen, denn dem Unreifen steht der Genuß der Reife nicht an.", "5394": "Aber vielleicht sagt man:", "5395": "was bei den Knaben Ernst ist soll ihnen zum Spiele dienen, wenn sie gereiste Männer ge­ worden sind.", "5396": "Wenn dem wirklich so ist, warum sollen sie es denn selbst lernen, und nicht lieber, wie die persischen und medischen Könige, durch Vermittlung Anderer ihren Antheil an dem Vergnügen und der Kunst haben?", "5397": "Nothwendiger Weise müssen ja diejenigen den Zweck besser erreichen welche die Sache zu ihrem Hauptgeschäft und zum Beruf gemacht haben, als Solche die nur so viel Zeit darauf ver­ wenden als zum bloßen Lernen erforderlich ist.", "5398": "Sollen sie aber der­ gleichen Künste selbst ausüben können, dann müßte man sie ebensowohl auch mit der Kochkunst ausrüsten.", "5399": "Das wäre doch ungereimt.Dieselbe Einwendung trifft auch die Annahme daß die Musik ge­ eignet sei die Sitten zu veredeln.", "5400": "Warum sollen die Knaben in diesem Falle die Musik selbst lernen, anstatt durch Anhörung Anderer zu lernen mit Anstand fröhlich zu sein und mit Geschmack zu urteilen, wie dieß bei den Lakedämoniern der Fall ist?", "5401": "Diese verstehen doch, wie man sagt, ohne Musik zu lernen, gute und schlechte Gesänge richtig zu beurteilen.", "5402": "Ebenso verhält sich's wohl auch mit der Voraussetzung daß die Musik zur Erheiterung und zu edler Unterhaltung dienen solle.", "5403": "Warum soll man sie selbst lernen, anstatt von Andern die sie ausüben den Ge­ nuß zu haben?", "5404": "Man kann sich dafür auf die Vorstellung berufen die wir von den Göttern haben.", "5405": "Singt und spielt ja auch Zeus nicht, selbst bei den Dichtern.", "5406": "Im Gegentheil, wir halten die Musikanten für Brodkünstler, und die Ausübung ihrer Kunst einem freien Mann nicht für anständig, es sei denn beim Wein oder zum Scherze.", "5407": "Doch auf diese Einwendungen kommen wir vielleicht später zurück.(5)", "5408": "Die erste Krage ist:", "5409": "ob die Musik in die Erziehung aufzu­ nehmen sei oder nicht, und was sie in den drei in Frage gestellten Be­ ziehungen für eine Wirkung habe, ob sie zur Bildung oder zur Kurz­ weil oder zur geistigen Unterhaltung diene.", "5410": "Folgerichtig wird sie doch wohl auf alle drei Zwecke bezogen, und offenbar hat sie auch diese dreifache Wirkung.Das Spiel ist zur Erholung da, die Erholung muß aber noth­ wendig etwas Angenehmes sein, weil sie als ein Heilmittel gegen die aus Anstrengungen hervorgehende Unlust dienen soll.", "5411": "Auf der andern Seite soll auch die Beschäftigung des Geistes zugestandenermaßen nicht nur das Schöne sondern auch das Vergnügen in sich begreifen, denn Beides zusammen erzeugt erst das Gefühl der Glückseligkeit.", "5412": "Nun ist es gerade die Musik die wir doch Alle ohne Ausnahme für etwas höchst Angenehmes erklären, sei es für sich allein oder mit Ge­ sang verbunden.", "5413": "Sagt doch schon Musäos:", "5414": "Gesang, der Sterblichen süßestes Labsal.\"", "5415": "Und darum zieht man sie auch mit Recht zu Gesellschaften und Unter­ haltungen bei, weil sie heiter zu stimmen vermag.", "5416": "Schon aus diesem Grunde dürste man also behaupten daß die Jugend darin unterrichtet werden müsse.", "5417": "Denn alles unschuldige Vergnügen paßt nicht blos zum Lebenszweck sondern auch zur Erholung.", "5418": "Und da die Menschen selten so glücklich sind das Ziel zu erreichen, sehr häufig aber der Er­ holung bedürfen und dazu sich der Spiele bedienen, nicht immer eines Vortheils sondern auch des bloßen Vergnügens wegen, so dürfte eS zuträglich sein die Erholung in musikalischen Genüssen zu suchen.", "5419": "Freilich kommt es auch vor daß die Menschen das Spiel zum Lebenszweck machen.", "5420": "In der Erreichung des Zweckes liegt nämlich allerdings auch ein Genuß, aber nicht der alltägliche.", "5421": "Indem sie nun nach dem ersteren Genuß trachten nehmen sie den letzteren für jenen, weil er mit dem Zwecke der sittlichen Handlungen einige Aehnlichkeit hat.", "5422": "Wie nämlich der Lebenszweck nicht als Mittel zu entfernteren Zwecken wünfchenswerth ist, so haben auch diese Art Vergnügungen keinen darüber hinausliegenden Zweck, sondern nur im Vergangenen, in Mühe und Unlust, ihren Grund.", "5423": "Und diesen Grund kann man mit Recht für den eigentlichen Beweggrund halten aus welchem die Leute ihre Glückseligkeit in diesen Vergnügungen suchen.", "5424": "Für die allge­ meine Theilnahme an der Musik spricht aber nicht blos dieser Grund, sondern auch der Umstand daß sie Erholung von Anstrengungen ge­ währt, wie wir gesehen.Allein wir haben noch zu untersuchen, ob dieß nicht etwa nur ein zufälliger Nutzen ist, ihr Wesen dagegen von höherem Werth als blos für den genannten Gebrauch, und ob man vielleicht etwas mehr als das alltägliche Vergnügen, das Alle dabei empfinden, von der Musik zu genießen habe (denn sie hat zunächst etwas sinnlich Ange­ nehmes , weßhalb sie jedem Alter und jeder Bildungsstufe eine freund­ liche Beschäftigung ist).", "5425": "Sehen wir also darauf ob sie in gewisser Art auch auf die Sitten und daS Gemüt Einfluß habe.", "5426": "Dieß dürfte aber erwiesen sein, wenn sich zeigt daß wir durch sie in eine gewisse Gemütsverfassung versetzt werden.", "5427": "Daß wir nun wirklich in eine solche versetzt werden zeigt sich außer vielen andern Beispielen ganz besonders an den Gesängen deS Olympos*):", "5428": "denn diese erfüllen nach allgemeinem Zugeständniß die Seelen mit Begeisterung.", "5429": "Begeisterung aber ist eine sittliche Ge­ mütsbewegung.", "5430": "Fühlt ja schon beim Anhören von Kunstdartsellungen, auch ohne Rhythmus und Gesang, jeder die gleichen Empfindungen nach *).Es hat sich ergeben daß es Eigenschaft der Musik ist zu dem An­ genehmen zu gehören.", "5431": "Wenn nun die Tugend sich darin äußert daß man in der rechten Weise sich freut, liebt und haßt, so hat man offen­ bar Nichts so eifrig zu lernen und sich zu eigen zu machen als ein rich­ tiges GeschmackSurteil und die rechte Freude an Darstellung guter Sitten und schöner Handlungen.", "5432": "Nun liegt aber in den Rhythmen und Gesängen, neben ihren natürlichen Wirkungen, die Nersinnlichung des Zorns und der Sanftmut, der Tapferkeit und Besonnenheit, und der entgegengesetzten, so wie überhaupt aller Gemütsbewegungen.", "5433": "Das beweisen die Wirkungen.", "5434": "Denn indem wir eine solche Musik anhören erfahren wir eine Umstimmung deS Gemüts.", "5435": "Die Gewöh­ nung aber an dem bildlichen Ausdruck Freude oder Unlust zu empfin­ den hängt nahe zusammen mit dem Verhalten gegenüber den Ein­ drücken der Wirklichkeit.", "5436": "Z. B. wer an dem Anschauen eines Bildes aus keinem andern Grunde als wegen der schönen Gestalt Vergnügen findet, dem muß nothwendig auch der Anblick der Person selbst deren Bild er betrachtet angenehm sein.", "5437": "Nun haben zwar die andern Sinneswahrnehmungen entweder gar keine Aehnlichkeit mit sittlichen Eindrücken, wie die des Tastsinns nnd deS Geschmacks, oder nur geringe, wie das Sichtbare.", "5438": "Dieß ist der Fall bei gewissen Körperbewegungen, doch nur in beschränktem Maße, und jedes Auge (ohne Unterweisung) ist für diese Wahrneh­ mungen empfänglich.", "5439": "Auch sind das nicht wirkliche Darstellungen sittlicher Zustände, sondern die Erscheinungen in Haltung und Farbe sind vielmehr nur Zeichen von Gemütszuständen.", "5440": "Und diese Zeichen treten am Körper auch nur in der Leidenschaft hervor.", "5441": "Sofern aber auch in der Betrachtung dieser Darstellungen wieder ein Unterschied stattfindet, soll die Jugend nicht die Werke eines Pauson i), sondern die des Polygnotos oder eines andern Malers oder Bildhauers an­ schauen der das Sittliche ausdrückt.In den musikalischen Erzeugnissen dagegen finden sich unmittel­ bar wirkliche Darstellungen sittlicher Zustände.", "5442": "Und dieß ist einleuch­ tend.", "5443": "Denn schon die Natur der Tonarten ist so verschieden daß der Hörer verschieden gestimmt wird und nicht bei jeder derselben gleich­ mäßig fühlt, sondern bei einigen trauriger und gedrückter, wie bei der mirolydischen, bei den andern weichlicher, wie bei den schmelzenden Tonarten, wieder bei einer andern vorzugsweise ruhig und ernst ge­ stimmt wird, was bekanntlich die dorische Tonart unter allen allein bewirkt, während die phrygische Begeisterung erweckt.", "5444": "So unter­ scheiden ganz richtig diejenigen die über diesen Theil der Erziehung philosophiert haben *), und sie können die Belege für ihre Bestimmun­ gen auS der Erfahrung entnehmen.", "5445": "Das gleiche Verhältniß findet auch bei den Rhythmen sdem Takt) statt:", "5446": "die einen haben mehr den Charakter der Gemessenheit, andere der Beweglichkeit, und von den letzteren die einen mehr eine ungestümme, die andern eine freiere und edlere Bewegung.", "5447": "Daraus ist klar daß die Musik die Eigenschaft besitzt die Seele in eine gewisse sittliche Stimmung zu versetzen.", "5448": "Wenn sie aber diese Wirkung haben kann, so ist unstreitig daß man sie bei der Jugend in Anwendung bringen und diese darin unter­ richten muß.Zudem paßt auch der Musikunterricht zu der Natur dieser Alters­ stufe, denn die Jugend halt wegen ihres Alters nicht gern aus bei einem Gegenstande der keinen Reiz hat, die Musik aber gehört ihrer Natur nach zu dem Reizenden.", "5449": "Auch scheint eine gewisse Verwandt­ schaft (der Seele) mit den Harmonieen und Rhythmen stattzufinden, weßhalb viele Philosophen') behaupten, die Seele sei selbst eine Harmonie, andere wenigstens, sie enthalte eine Harmonie.6.", "5450": "(6)", "5451": "Nun ist aber die oben aufgeworfene Frage zu beant­ worten , ob die Jugend selbst singen und Instrumente spielen lernen soll.", "5452": "Außer Zweifel ist daß für die Ausbildung in irgend einem Fache sehr viel darauf ankommt ob man sich selbst mit der Ausübung befaßt.", "5453": "Denn eS gehört in's Reich des Unmöglichen oder doch sehr Schwierigen über etwas zu einem richtigen Urteil zu gelangen mit dessen Ausübung man sich nicht besaßt hat.", "5454": "Neben dem müssen aber Knaben auch eine unterhaltende Be­ schäftigung haben, und selbst die Kinderklapper des Archytas *) ist für eine gute Erfindung zu achten.", "5455": "Man gibt sie den Kindern, damit sie mit dieser beschäftigt nicht etwas vom Hausgeräthe zerbrechen;", "5456": "denn das Kind kann nicht still sitzen.", "5457": "Wie nun dieses Spielzeug für die Kleinen paßt, so ist der Musikunterricht eine Klapper für die größeren Knaben ^).Offenbar muß man also den Musikunterricht so treiben daß die Schüler sich mit der Ausübung befassen.", "5458": "Was sich aber für das ein­ zelne Alter schicke oder nicht, das ist nicht schwer zu unterscheiden und damit auch dem EinWurf zu begegnen daß die Ausübung dieser Kunst etwas Handwerksmäßiges sei.", "5459": "Denn sür's Erste, da man um richtig urteilen zu können sich mit der Ausübung abgeben muß, ist es zweck­ mäßig aus diesem Grunde in der Jugend Musik zu treiben;", "5460": "in reiferem Alter dagegen mag man von der Ausübung abstehen und sich begnügen in Folge der in der Jugend erworbenen Kenntniß das Schöne an ihr richtig beurteilen und mit Geschmack genießen zu können.", "5461": "Was aber den Vorwurf betrifft den Einige der Musik machen, daß sie zum Hand­ werk erniedrige, so ist es nicht schwer ihn zu beseitigen, wenn man be­ denkt wie weit sich die zur politischen Tugend zu erziehenden Knaben mit der Ausübung befassen dürfen, mit welcherlei Melodieen und Rhythmen sie sich vertraut machen und was für Instrumente sie spielen lernen sollen;", "5462": "denn auch darin ist natürlich ein Unterschied und darauf beruht eben die Beseitigung jenes Norwurss.", "5463": "Denn es unterliegt kei­ nem Zweifel daß einige Arten von Musik die genannte Wirkung haben.Es liegt nun auf der Hand daß das Erlernen der Musik weder dem künftigen Beruf hinderlich werden noch den Körper verunstalten und für die kriegerische und politische Thätigkeit unbrauchbar machen darf, für die erstere sogleich, für die letztere späterhin.", "5464": "Das kann ge­ schehen wenn man beim Unterricht verhütet daß die Zöglinge eine Fertigkeit anstreben wie sie für den Wettstreit der Künstler erfordert wird, wenn man namentlich nicht jene übertriebenen Kunststücke die sich heutzutag in die öffentlichen Kämpfe und von den Kämpfen aus in den Unterricht eingeschlichen haben, sondern auch diese Dinge nur so weit lernen läßt als nöthig ist um sich an schönen Gesängen und Rhythmen erfreuen zu können, nicht blos an der Musik im Allge­ meinen, waS sogar einige Thiere und der große Hause der Sklaven und Kinder auch thun.Daraus erhellt auch, welcher Instrumente man sich bedienen soll.", "5465": "Man darf keine Flöte beim Unterricht anwenden, und ebensowenig ein anderes Instrument des künstlerischen Wettstreites, wie die Kithara und was sonst dahin gehört;", "5466": "sondern nur solche die das Gehör bilden, sei eS für den Musikunterricht oder für den übrigen.", "5467": "Zudem ist die Flöte gar nicht geeignet um beruhigend zu wirken, sondern eher um leidenschaftliche Aufregung hervorzurufen (sie wirkt nicht ethisch, son­ dern orgiastisch);", "5468": "daher sie nur in solchen Fällen anzuwenden ist wo die Kunstproduktion mehr auf Reinigung der Leidenschaften ') als auf Belehrung wirken soll.", "5469": "Ich möchte noch hinzusetzen daß dem Gebrauch der Flöte in der Erziehung auch das entgegensteht daß das Flötenspiel die Begleitung des Wortes nicht zuläßt.", "5470": "Darum haben auch die Vorfahren ihren Gebrauch bei freigebornen Jünglingen mit Recht verworfen, obgleich sie sich Anfangs derselben bedient hatten.", "5471": "Denn als sie in Folge vermehrten Wohlstandes mehr Muße gewannen und die Geister einen höheren Schwung zur Vervollkommnung nahmen, zumal kurz vor und nach den Perserkriegen im stolzen Gefühl ihrer Thaten, ergriffen sie Alles was zu lernen war, ohne Unterscheidung, nur immer mehr suchend.", "5472": "Dabei nahmen sie auch das Flötenspiel unter die Unterrihctsfächer auf.", "5473": "In Lakedämon begleitete selbst einmal ein Chorege den Chor mit der Flöte, und in Athen wurde sie so einheimisch daß fast der grüßte Theil der Freigebornen sich darauf verstand.", "5474": "Man sieht dieß noch an dem Gemälde daS Thrasippos aufstellte als er dem Ekphantides ') den Chor bestellt hatte.", "5475": "Später wurde sie abgeschafft, weil man in Folge der Erfahrung die man da­ mit gemacht besser unterscheiden gelernt hatte was die sittliche Bil­ dung fördere und was nicht.", "5476": "Gleicherweise (verwarf man) auch viele andere der alten Instrumente, wie die Pektiden und Barbiten und die­ jenigen welche nur die Sinnlichkeit in den Zuhörern aufregen, die Siebenecke, Triangel und Sambyken und überhaupt alle die eine be­ sondere Fingerfertigkeit erfordern *).Sehr bezeichi^nd ist daher auch der Mythos den die Alten von der Flöte erdacht haben.", "5477": "Man erzählt daß Athene die von ihr er­ fundene Flöte weggeworfen habe;", "5478": "auch lautet der Grund den man dafür angibt nicht übel, daß nämlich die Göttin aus Unwillen über die Entstellung des Gesichtes dieß gethan ;", "5479": "wahrscheinlicher ist jedoch wohl der andere Grund, daß der Unterricht im Flötenspiel zur Geistes- bildung Nichts beitrage, sofern man der Athene Kunst und Wissen­ schaft beilegt.(7)", "5480": "Wir verwerfen also den technischen Gebrauch der Instru­ mente , wie die technische Ausübung der Musik in der Erziehung.", "5481": "Technisch nennen wir aber den Gebrauch für die Wettkämpfe;", "5482": "denn wer dafür die Kunst übt betreibt sie nicht um seiner eigenen Vervoll­ kommnung willen, sondern um den Zuhören:", "5483": "ein — und zwar grob­ sinnliches — Vergnügen zu machen.", "5484": "Deßwegen erklären wir diese Beschäftigung eines Freigebornen unwürdig und vielmehr für eine Sache des Broderwerbs;", "5485": "und bei Solchen tritt dann auch der Fall ein daß sie zum Handwerker herabsinken.", "5486": "Denn das Ziel auf das sie ihre Thätigkeit richten ist ein schlechtes.", "5487": "Der grobsinnliche Zuhörer hat gewöhnlich auch auf die Musik den nachtheiligen Einfluß daß er die Künstler, die sich nach seiner Laune richten, sowohl sittlich als in Folge der Verzerrungen auch äußerlich schlechter macht.7.", "5488": "Nun ist noch zu untersuchen die Frage von den Harmonieen und Rhythmen:", "5489": "ob man nämlich zur Ergötzung alle Harmonieen und Rhythmen benutzen darf, oder ob ein Unterschied gemacht werden muß;", "5490": "sodann ob wir für die Zwecke der Erziehung denselben Unter­ schied festhalten dürfen, oder ob noch eine weitere Unterscheidung nöthig ist, sofern die Musik bekanntlich aus Melodie und Rhythmus besteht und von jedem dieser beiden Elemente genau bekannt sein muß welchen Einfluß es auf die Erziehung habe, und ob die melodische oder die rhythmische Musik den Vorzug verdiene..Da nach unserer Ansicht über diese Fragen Einige der jetzigen Musiker sowohl als Philosophen, soweit sie sich praktisch mit der musi­ kalischen Bildung befaßt haben, vieles Treffliche gesagt haben, über­ lassen wir es dem Einzelnen welcher Lust hat die genauere Erörterung der Sache'bei jenen nachzulesen und wollen hier nur in allgemeinen Umrissen die Hauptgrundsätze darüber festsetzen.", "5491": "Wenn wir also die von den Philosophen gemachte Eintheilung der Gesänge aufnehmen, wonach die einen eine sittlich veredelnde, die andern eine zur Thatkraft ermunternde, wieder andere eine begeisternde Wirkung haben und der Charakter der Harmonieen jeder einzelnen dieser Gattungen entspricht;", "5492": "wenn wir ferner behaupten daß man die Musik nicht um eines einzigen Vortheils willen anwenden müsse, sondern zu mehreren Zwecken (nämlich zur Bildung, ferner zur Läuterung — was wir unter Läuterung verstehen, können wir hier nur im Allgemeinen andeuten, werden uns aber in der Poetik genauer darüber erklären—, drittens zu edler Unterhaltung, endlich zur Ab­ spannung und Erholung nach angestrengter Arbeit):", "5493": "so ergibt sich klar daß man von allen Harmonieen Gebrauch machen muß, aber nicht von alten in derselben Beziehung, sondern zur Erziehung von den sittlichen;", "5494": "zum bloßen Anhören, wobei Andere die Kunst ausüben, von den zu Thaten ermunternden und den begeisternden.", "5495": "Denn die Gemütsbewegung, die bei einigen Seelen sich heftig äußert, kommt in allen vor;", "5496": "der Unterschied liegt nur in dem stärkeren oder schwäche­ ren Grade.", "5497": "Dieß ist besonders der Fall bei den Gefühlen des Mit­ leidens, der Furcht, und so auch der Begeisterung.", "5498": "Manche nämlich werden von dieser Bewegung besonders hingerissen;", "5499": "man sieht aber wie sie mittelst der heiligen Gesänge, wenn sie die die Seele besänftigen­ den Tonweisen anwenden, zu sich selbst gebracht werden, als wären sie durch ein Heilmittel geläutert.", "5500": "Das Gleiche müssen aber auch die­ jenigen empfinden welche von Mitleiden, Furcht oder einer sonstigen Leidenschaft bewegt sind, und die Uebrigen je nach dem Grade ihrer Empfänglichkeit;", "5501": "sie alle müssen nothwendig eine gewisse Läuterung und eine wohlthuende Erleichterung erfahren.", "5502": "Gleichfalls gewähren aber auch die läuternden Tonweisen den Menschen eine unschuldige Freude.", "5503": "Deßwegen sind die Künstler der theatralischen Musik auf den Gebrauch solcher Harmonieen und solcher Gesänge anzuweisen.", "5504": "Da es jedoch zweierlei Klassen von Zuschauern gibt, die eine der Freigebornen und Gebildeten, die andere der Grob­ sinnlichen, aus Handwerkern, Taglohnern und dergleichen Leuten be­ stehend, so muß man die Wettkämpfe und Festspiele auch zur Er­ holung für solche Leute einrichten.", "5505": "Wie die Gemüter derselben von der naturgemäßen Stimmung abweichen, so gibt es für sie auch Ab­ arten der Harmonieen und von den Gesängen, namentlich die rauschen­ den und verfärbten.')", "5506": "Jedem Menschen macht das seinem Charakter Entsprechende Vergnügen;", "5507": "deßhalb muß man den theatralischen Künstlern die Freiheit einräumen, in der Wahl der Gattung von Musik sich nach dem Geschmack der Zuschauer zu richten.Für die Erziehung aber darf man sich, wie gesagt, nur der sittlich wirkenden Gesänge und Harmonieen bedienen.", "5508": "Das ist, wie oben bemerkt worden, vorzüglich die dorische Weise;", "5509": "dabei ist jede andere zuzulassen welche etwa die philosophishcgebildeten Musikkenner empfehlen.", "5510": "Mit Unrecht aber läßt Sokrates im platonischen Staat neben der dorischen nur die phrygische gelten, und zwar nachdem er unter den Instrumenten die Flöte verworfen.", "5511": "Die phrygische Tonart hat ja doch unter den Harmonieen die gleiche Wirkung wie unter den Instrumenten die Flöte.", "5512": "Beide sind wildbegeisternd und leiden­ schaftlich aufregend.Dieß kann man auch an der Poesie bemerken.", "5513": "Denn alle bacchantische oder ähnliche Gemütsbewegung findet vorzugsweise ihren Ausdruck in der Flöte, und unter den Harmonieen am passendsten in den phrygischen Melodieen, wie ja der Dithyramb anerkannter­ maßen einen phrygischen Charakter hat.", "5514": "Außer vielen andern Be­ legen dafür wissen die Verfechter dieser Ansicht auch diesen anzu­ führen daß PhilorenoS *), als er einen Ditbyramb „die Myser\" in dorischer Weise zu setzen versuchte, damit nicht zu Stande kam, son­ dern der Natur der Sache nach unwillkürlich wieder in die phrygische als die entsprechende Harmonie verfiel.Von der dorischen Weise urtheilt man allgemein daß sie die gemessenste sei und am meisten einen männlichen Charakter habe.", "5515": "Da wir überdieß die Mitte zwischen zwei Extremen grundsätzlich für die überall einzuschlagende Richtung halten, die dorische Weise aber ge­ rade in diesem Verhältniß zu den andern Harmonieen steht, so ver­ steht es sich daß die dorischen Melodieen sich vorzugsweise für den Unterricht der Jugend eignen.Es sind aber zwei Gesichtspunkte zu beobachten:", "5516": "das Mögliche und das Schickliche.", "5517": "Jeder muß vorzugsweise das für ihn'Erreich­ bare und das Schickliche zu erreichen suchen.", "5518": "Die Grenzen sind aber durch die Altersstufen bestimmt:", "5519": "z.", "5520": "B. vom Alter entkräfteten Leuten fällt es schwer die raushcenden Melodieen zu singen:", "5521": "ihnen weist vielmehr die Natur die sanfteren Weisen zu.", "5522": "Daher tadeln auch einige Musikkenner mit Recht an Sokrates daß er die sanfteren Har­ monieen für den Musikunterricht verworfen, weil sie nach seiner An- nähme etwas vom Rausche hätten, nicht im eigentlichen Sinn deS Rausches (denn der Rausch bewirkt vielmehr stürmische Begeisterung), sondern als Abspannung.", "5523": "Demnach aber muß man sich eben mit solchen Harmonieen und Melodieen für das kommende höhere Alter bekannt machen.", "5524": "Gibt es nun noch eine Harmonie welche dem Knabenalter besonders angemessen ist, weil sie Bildung und Anstand zugleich geben kann, was bei der lydischen am ehesten zuzutreffen scheint, so ist auch diese aufzunehmen.", "5525": "Dabei ist klar daß man fol­ gende drei Hauptrücksichten bei der Erziehung im Auge haben muß:", "5526": "das Mittlere (zwischen zwei Extremen), das Erreichbare und das Schickliche.1.", "5527": "Die Haushaltungskunst und die Staatskunst unterscheiden sich nicht blos wie Haus und Staat (denn das sind ihre Objekte), sondern darin daß die Staatskunst viele Obrigkeiten voraussetzt, die Haushaltungskunst aber einfach monarchisch ist.Einige Künste theilen sich so daß man die Gerfertigung des Gegenstandes unterscheidet von dem Gebrauch des Verfertigten, wie bei der Leier, der Flöte;", "5528": "zur Staatskunst dagegen gehört Beides, einen Staat von Anfang begründen und einen bestehenden zweckmäßig verwalten zu können.", "5529": "Daraus läßt sich schließen daß auch zur Oeko­ nomik Beides gehören wird, die Gründung eines Hauswesens und seine Verwaltung.", "5530": "eEin Staat nun ist der Inbegriff von einer Anzahl Hauswesen, von Gebiet und Vermögen in einem zum glücklichen Leben ausreichen­ den Maße.", "5531": "Dieß ist einleuchtend;", "5532": "denn wo die Mittel fehlen diesen Zweck zu erreichen, da fällt die Gesellschaft auseinander.", "5533": "Um dieses Zweckes willen wird sie ja geschlossen;", "5534": "der Zweck aber zu welchem ein Werk besteht und geschaffen ist macht eben sein Wesen aus.", "5535": "Daraus ergibt sich daß die Haushaltungskunst der Staatskunst vorausgeht, denn es verhält sich auch mit den Sachen (Objekten) so:", "5536": "daS Haus­ wesen ist ein Bestandtheil des Staates.", "5537": "Wir haben

sonst für Be­ schäftigungen ähnlicher Art gibt.", "5546": "Die vorzüglichste Erwerbsart ist der Landbau, weil er auch die gerechteste ist:", "5547": "denn er nimmt Nichts von Menschen, weder mit ihrem Willen, wie der Handel und die Lohn­ arbeit, noch wider denselben, wie das Kriegshandwerk.", "5548": "Auch ist er durchaus naturgemäß:", "5549": "denn jedes Geschöpf zieht naturgemäß seine Nahrung aus der Mutter, also der Mensch aus der Erde.", "5550": "Ueberdieß trägt er viel zur Tapferkeit bei:", "5551": "denn er macht nicht, wie die Hand­ werke, den Körper schwächlich, sondern härtet ihn ab gegen die Witte­ rung und zu jeder Anstrengung, ja er befähigt ihn auch den Feinden zu trotzen, weil nur der Besitz des Landmannes außerhalb der Mauern und Wälle liegt.3.", "5552": "Was die Menschen
