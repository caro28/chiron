overthrow of Antony, and not to allow our method of eradicating the first evil to cause the production of a second and worse calamity;", "2132": "for no misfortune can now befal us, either through inadvertence, or passive permission, in which there would not be something to blame in all, and especially in you, whose authority the senate and people of Rome not only allow, but desire to be, as

have managed so as to be able to pursue the Antonies at perfect leisure,\" and praise me for having done so, I dare say that such appears to you to be the case;", "2198": "but I myself am far from approving of the dis- tinction which you draw;", "2199": "for you write, that \" civil wars are to be prevented with more resolution, than revenge is to be inflicted on the vanquished.\"", "2200": "On this point, my dear Brutus, I most completely disagree with you;", "2201": "not that I yield to you in clemency;", "2202": "but a salutary severity is far superior to an empty show of mercy.", "2203":

known to me than his disposition towards the republic?", "2218": "Yet he seems to me, though of all men the most prudent, to have done some things (what shall I say?) imprudently, or with a view to popularity, since in the cause of the republic he has not hesitated to make the most powerful Antony his enemy.", "2219": "I know not what to say to you, except this one thing, that the cupidity and boldness of the boy Caesar have been rather excited than repressed by Cicero;", "2220": "and that he gives way so much to his indulgence for him, as not to restrain himself from attacks upon others, attacks which recoil upon himself with double force;", "2221": "since he himself has put more persons than one to death,1 and since he must confess himself to be an assassin before he makes the objections to Casca's2 act which he does make, and, in his conduct to Casca, imitates BestialBecause we are not every moment boasting of the ides of March, as he is always talking of the nones4 of December, will Cicero, for that reason, condemn that most laudable act on a better pretext than that on which Bestia and Clodius have been accustomed to inveigh against his consulship ?", "2222": "Our good friend Cicero boasts to me, that he has supported the whole war against Antony in the garb of peace.", "2223": "Of what profit is that to me, if a succession to the position occu- pied by Antony is demanded as the wages for having put Antony down, and if he, who has repressed that evil, has become the author of another, which will have a more solid foundation, and a deeper root, if we will but allow it ?", "2224": "for the line of conduct which he has taken is that of one who is afraid, not of tyranny itself, but of Antony being the tyrant.", "2225": "But I do not thank the man who, provided that he is not slave to an angry master, does not object to slavery itself;", "2226": "but to whom even triumphs and rewards are decreed, and who is honoured with every sort of complimentary

rashness of a boy ?", "2240": "Or does he act thus, because he thinks that everything ought to be sur- rendered to Octavius, at once and voluntarily, because of his great dignity 1 0 the great folly of fear, so to guard against that very object which we fear, that, when we perhaps might have avoided it, we of- our own accord invite it and draw it upon ourselves!", "2241": "We are too much afraid

as that I should be diverted by it from waging war with the thing itself, that is to say, with kingly authority, with extra- ordinary commands, with absolute dominion, and with power that seeks to set itself above the laws, even though Antony be a good man, as you describe him, but as I never thought him to be.", "2259": "But our ancestors would have no master over them, even if he had been their

entreaties of your mother and sister;", "2297": "for I thought that I should easily satisfy you, which is an object of the highest importance with me.", "2298": "For in no way could the cause of Lepidus be distinguished from that of Antony;", "2299": "indeed, in everybody's judgment it was the worse of the two, because after Lepidus had been com- plimented by the senate with the highest honours, and after he had only a few days before sent an admirable letter to the senate, he suddenly not only received the relics of our defeated enemies as his friends, but is even carrying on a most vigorous war against us by land and sea, of which it is'uncer- tain what will be the result.", "2300": "When we are asked, therefore, to show pity to his children, no argument is advanced why the greatest severities are not to be endured by us, (may Jupiter avert the omen!) if the father of those children should be victorious.", "2301": "Not indeed that it escapes my recollection, how bitter a thing it is that the crimes of fathers should be atoned for by the punishment of their children;", "2302": "but this has been admirably provided by the laws, that their affection for their children may make the parents more truly attached to the republic.", "2303": "It is Lepidus, therefore, who is cruel to his chil- dren, not he who pronounces Lepidus a public enemy;", "2304": "and if he, after laying down his arms, had been condemned for violence to the state, in a trial for which he would have had nothing to say in his defence, his children would suffer the same punishment, — their property being confiscated;", "2305": "although what your mother and sister deprecate for those children, the same and many more cruel evils Lepidus, Antony, and the rest of our enemies, are denouncing against us all.", "2306": "At this time, therefore, our greatest hope is placed in you, and in your army.", "2307": "It is of the very greatest consequence, both to the general state of the commonwealth, and also to your own glory and dignity, that you, as I have written before, should come into Italy with all possible speed;", "2308": "for the republic is in the greatest need, both of your forces, and of your wisdom.", "2309": "Because of your letter, I gladly embraced Vetus, out of regard to his good-will and singular service to you;", "2310": "and I see that he really is most

wrongfully,) I beg and entreat you, my dear Cicero, invoking our intimate friendship and your good- will to me, to forget that the children of my sister are sons of Lepidus, and to think that I have succeeded to the place of father to them;", "2314": "if I obtain this of you, then there is nothing, assuredly, which you will hesitate to undertake in their behalf.", "2315": "Other people live with their relations on different terms;", "2316": "I can do nothing for the children of my sister sufficient to satisfy either my inclination or my feelings of duty.", "2317": "But what is there that good

you, having received the authority of the senate for such a step, were proceeding with your army to Italy;", "2329": "though the republic was very desirous for you to do that, and to do it with all speed.", "2330": "For our intestine evil grows worse and worse every day;", "2331": "nor do we suffer more from our foreign enemies than from our domestic foes, who existed, indeed, at the very beginning of the war, but who at that time were more easily put down.", "2332": "The senate then assumed a more erect attitude, being roused not only by my known opinions, but also by my exhortations.", "2333": "In the senate, Pansa was energetic and fierce enough, both against the rest of this faction, and especially against his father-in-law, who, as consul, wanted neither courage

victorious, the troops of Antony having been routed, and he himself expelled by Brutus.", "2339": "But so many errors were afterwards committed, that, as one may say, victory slipped through our fingers;", "2340": "our generals did not pursue the enemy, though disheartened, disarmed, disabled;", "2341": "and an opportunity was given to Lepidus, through which we might feel his inconstancy, often felt indeed before in still greater disasters.", "2342": "The armies of Brutus and Plancus are good, but untrained.", "2343": "The auxiliary forces from the Gauls are very faithful and very numerous.", "2344": "But some persons, by most scandalous letters, and by treacherous accounts and information, have excited Cæsar, who has hitherto been governed by my counsels, and who is himself of a most excellent disposition and admirable steadiness, to conceive a confident hope of obtaining the consulship.", "2345": "And as soon as I perceived that such was the case, I never ceased to warn him, as he was absent, by letter, nor to reproach his friends, who were here on the spot, and who appeared to be encouraging that desire of his:", "2346": "nor did I, in the senate, hesitate to lay open the true source of those most flagitious counsels;", "2347": "nor do I remember the senate or the magistrates to have been on any occasion better disposed.", "2348": "For it has never happened before, when there has been a question about con- ferring some honour out of the usual course of things on a powerful man—I may even say, on the most powerful man in the state (since power now depends on force and arms)— that no tribune of the people, no one invested with any other magistracy, no private individual, ever could be found to propose it.", "2349": "But still, with all this exhibition of lesolution and virtue, the city was nevertheless in an anxious state ;", "2350": "for we are mocked, my dear Brutus, both by the licentiousness of the soldiers and the insolence of the generals.",

judg- ment and opinion of the citizens, nor regard for the estima- tion of posterity, has any weight at all.", "2353": "I, foreseeing all this a long time ago, was fleeing from Italy, at the very time when the news of your edicts caused me to return.", "2354": "But you, Brutus, roused me again at Velia;", "2355": "for although I grieved that I was going to a city from which you, who had delivered it, were taking flight, (which indeed had formerly happened to me also, under a similar danger and sadder fortune,1) still I proceeded, and came to Rome, and without any support made Antony quake;", "2356": "and, in opposi- tion to his impious arms, I by my authority and counsels secured for us the protection of Caesar, which was volun- tarily offered;", "2357": "and if he remains in the same disposition and continues to be guided by me, we seem likely to have quite sufficient defence.", "2358": "But if the counsels of bad men have more weight than mine, or if the tenderness of his age prove unable to support the heavy burden of affairs, all our hope is in you.", "2359": "Fly to us, therefore, I beseech you ;", "2360": "and, in the result, complete the deliverance of that republic which you have already delivered, more through your own virtue and magnanimity than through any train of circumstances.", "2361": "A general concourse of all classes will gather round you.", "2362":

republic which de- served to be immortal:", "2371": "but for myself how short a space of life is left!", "2372": "YOUR letter was short.", "2373": "Short, do I say ?", "2374": "It was no letter at all.", "2375": "Does Brutus, at such a crisis as this, write me those lines only.", "2376": "You had better have written nothing at all;", "2377": "and yet you expect letters from me.", "2378": "Which

suppose that not even your own family letters have arrived either.", "2381": "You write me word, however, that you will send me a longer letter by my son Cicero.", "2382": "You will indeed do well;", "2383": "but still this one ought to have been longer.", "2384": "But I, as soon as you wrote to me about Cicero's departure from you,1 im- mediately packed off a courier with letters for him, bidding him, even if he had reached Italy, to return to you;", "2385": "for nothing could be more agreeable to me, or more honourable- to him, although I had several times written to him that the- comitia for the election of priests had, by my extreme exer- tions, been postponed to another year;", "2386": "a delay which I exerted myself to procure, not only for the sake of Cicero himself, but for that of Domitius, Cato, Lentulus, and the Bibuli, as I also wrote to you.", "2387": "However, when you sent off to me that dwarfish letter c f yours, this was not yet known to you.", "2388": "I do therefore, my dear Brutus, beg of you with all earnest- ness, not to let my son depart from you, but to bring him with you when you come;", "2389": "and this, if you have any just regard for the republic, for the benefit of which you were born, you ought to do instantly.", "2390": "For the war has revived, and that through the no small wickedness of Lepidus.", "2391": "And Cæsar's army, which was most excellent, is not only of no use to us, but even compels us to demand the presence of yours.", "2392": "If that once reaches Italy, then there will be no citizen, at least no one who deserves to be called a citizen, who will not betake himself to your camp, although we have Decimus Brutus admirably united with Plancus.", "2393": "But you are not ignorant how little to be trusted the dispositions of men are when infected with party spirit, and how uncertain, too, are the events of battles.", "2394": "Moreover, if we conquer, as I hope we shall, still affairs will require the powerful direction of your wisdom and influence to guide them.", "2395": "Come therefore to our assistance, I implore you, and come as soon as possible;", "2396": "and be assured that you did not do a greater service to your country on the ides of March, on which you repelled slavery from your fellow-citizens, than you will do now if you come speedily.", "2397": "July the 13th.", "2398": "You have Messala with you:",

affairs in it, since he is thoroughly acquainted with everything, and is able also to set it before you, and represent it to you in the neatest pos- sible manner?", "2400": "For do not fancy, my dear Brutus (although it is not necessary for me to write to you what is already well known to you, yet I cannot pass over in silence such excel- lence in all qualities which deserves praise);", "2401": "do not fancy, I say, that there is any man like him for honesty, consistency, anxiety, and zeal for the commonwealth;", "2402": "so that eloquence, in which he wonderfully excels, seems scarcely to find in his character any room as a subject of praise, although in this very particular his wisdom is the more conspicuous;", "2403": "with such dignified judgment and exceeding skill has he practised himself in the soundest kind of oratory.", "2404": "So great, too, is his modesty, so incessant his application to study, that it is not to his genius (eminent as it is) that his greatest obligations appear to be due.", "2405": "But I am letting myself be carried away too far by my regard for him;", "2406": "for it was not my sole object in this letter to extol Messala, especially to Brutus, to whom his merit is not less known than to myself, and to whom are still better known those studies of his which I am now praising.", "2407": "And though I was grieved at taking leave of him, I was comforted by this one consideration, that as he was going to you, whom I look upon as another self, he was both performing his duty and pursuing a path to the greatest glory.", "2408": "But enough of this.", "2409": "I come now, after a long interval certainly, to a certain letter of yours, in which, while praising me on many accounts, you found fault with me in one point as being too liberal, and as it were prodigal, in giving my voice for awarding honours.", "2410": "1", "2411": "It is for this that you blame me;", "2412": "others, perhaps, charge me with being too severe as to punishment and penalties;", "2413": "unless, perhaps, you bring both accusations against me.", "2414": "If such be the case, I desire that my opinion on both these subjects should be thoroughly under- stood by you;", "2415": "not merely that I may cite the saying of Solon, who was both the wisest of the seven wise men, and also the only legislator of the seven, and who said that com- monwealths were held together by two things, rewards and punishments;", "2416": "for I would add, that there certainly is mode- ration to be observed in both these points as in all other things, and a certain medium to be kept as to each of them.", "2417": "But it is not my purpose to discuss so important a topic in this place.", "2418": "However, I do not think it improper to explain to you what I have aimed at during this war in the several votes which I have given in the senate.", "2419": "After the death of Cæsar and your memorable ides of March, my dear Brutus, you have not forgotten what I said had been omitted 2 by you, and how great a tempest I declared to be hanging over the republic.", "2420": "A great plague had been repelled by you, a great stain on the Roman people had been effaced, and an immortal glory had been gained by yourselves.", "2421": "But the whole equipage of kingly power was only transferred to Lepidus and Antony, one of ,hom was a vacillating man, the other polluted with vice;", "2422": "both of them were afraid of peace, and enemies to tranquillity, While these men were burning with a desire of throwing the republic into confusion, we had no force that could be opposed to them;", "2423": "but the whole city had roused itself with entire unanimity to preserve its freedom.", "2424": "We were at that time too energetic;", "2425": "you perhaps acted more wisely in quitting the city which you had delivered, and declined the aid of Italy, which offered its services in your cause.", "2426": "When, therefore, I saw the whole city occupied by traitors, that neither you nor Cassius could be safe in it, and that it was overawed by the forces of Antony, I thought that I also ought to depart.", "2427": "For a city overwhelmed by wicked men, and deprived of all power of helping itself, was a wretched spectacle.", "2428": "But the same disposition which is always in me, through devotion to my country, could not bear to be absent from its dangers ;", "2429": "and accordingly, in the middle of my voyage to Achaia, when, at the times of the Etesian winds, the west wind, as if dissuading me from my resolution, had brought me back to Italy, I met you at Velia, and expressed the greatest concern on the occasion.", "2430": "For you were retreating, my dear Brutus:", "2431": "you were retreating, I say;", "2432": "since out friends the Stoics deny that it is for a wise man to flee.", "2433": "When I came to Rome, I immediately put myself forward to check the wickedness and insanity of Antony;", "2434": "and when I had exasperated him against myself, I began to adopt resolutions quite in the character of Brutus himself (for such resolutions are the peculiar inheritance of your family) to deliver the republic.", "2435": "The long recital of what followed I shall omit, for it relates to myself;", "2436": "I will only say that the character of this young man Cæsar, by whose means, if we would but confess the truth, we still exist, has sprung wholly from the source of my counsels.", "2437": "No honours have been paid him from me, my dear Brutus, that were not justly his due;", "2438": "none that were not absolutely necessary.", "2439": "For when we first began to recover our liberties, when not even the divine virtue of Decimus Brutus had exerted itself in such a manner that we could appreciate its value, and when our whole hope of defence lay in that boy who had turned Antony away from our throats, what honour was too great to be voted to him?", "2440": "Although at that moment I paid him honour only in words, and that expressed in moderate terms, I also proposed to invest him with military command;", "2441": "and though this may have appeared a compliment to one of his age, yet it was indispensable, as he had an army;", "2442": "and what is an army without such command?", "2443": "Philippus proposed to vote him a statue;", "2444": "Servius, first of all, voted him the privilege of standing for offices before the usual time;", "2445": "Servilius made that time still earlier;", "2446": "nothing at that moment appeared too great for him.", "2447": "But, I know not how, men are more commonly found to be liberal under the influence of fear than grateful in the hour of victory.", "2448": "For I myself, when Decimus Brutus had been de- livered;", "2449": "when that day, most joyful to the city, had shed its light upon it, and that very day, as it happened, was the birth- day of Brutus, proposed a vote that the name of Brutus should be attached to that day in the calendar.", "2450": "And in this proposi- tion I followed the precedent of our ancestors, who paid this compliment to Larentia,1 a woman at whose altar in the Vela- brum you pontiffs are in the habit of offering sacrifice.", "2451": "When I proposed this honour to Brutus, my object was that there should be in the calendar a memorial of his most welcome victory;", "2452": "but on that day I found that there were rather more malevolent than grateful people in the senate.", "2453": "At that very time too I lavished, if you will have it so, honours on the dead, Hirtius and Pansa, as well as Aquila ;", "2454": "and who would blame me for so doing but those who, now that they are delivered from their fear, have forgotten also their past danger 1To the grateful recollection of these services there was added another reason for my conduct, which I hoped might have a beneficial effect upon posterity;", "2455": "for I wished that there should exist undying records of the public hatred to our most cruel enemies.", "2456": "I suspect, too, that this other matter is the less approved by you, because it is not approved by your friends, who are very excellent men indeed, but of no expe- rience in public affairs;", "2457": "namely, the vote which I proposed, that Cæsar might be permitted to enter the city with an ovation.", "2458": "But I am of opinion (though I may perhaps be mistaken, nor is my temper such that my own opinions delight me in preference to those of others):", "2459": "that during the whole of this war I have not done a wiser thing.", "2460": "Why it is so I must not explain, lest I should seem to have been prudent rather than grateful;", "2461": "and even to say this is to say too much;", "2462": "let us therefore turn to something else.", "2463": "I proposed that honours should be voted to Decimus Brutus, and also to Lucius Plancus.", "2464": "Those, indeed, are noble dispositions which are attracted by glory;", "2465": "but the senate also is wise, which employs every method, provided it be honourable, by which it thinks that any one can be induced to support the republic.", "2466": "But in the case of Lepidus I am blamed;", "2467": "inasmuch as after I had proposed to erect a statue to him in the rostra, I at a subsequent time proposed to remove it.", "2468": "The truth was, that I sought by means of that honour to recall him from desperate measures;", "2469": "but the insane folly of that most vacillating of men defeated my prudence;", "2470": "nor was so much harm done in raising a statue to Lepidus, as good in over- throwing it.", "2471": "I have said enough on the subject of honours;", "2472": "I must now add a few words on the subject of punishment;", "2473": "for I have re- peatedly understood from your letters, that you were desirous of having your clemency extolled towards those whom you had defeated in war.", "2474": "I believe that nothing is done by you otherwise than wisely;", "2475": "but to omit inflicting punishment on guilt, (for that is what is called pardoning,) even though under other circumstances it may be endurable, I think ruinous in this war.", "2476": "For of all the civil wars which within ray recollection have taken place in our republic, there has not been one of such a character that, whichever side proved vic- torious, there would not still have been some form of a com- monwealth left:", "2477": "but in this war, what sort of republic we shall have, if victorious, I would not willingly say;", "2478": "if defeated, we shall certainly have none at all.", "2479": "I therefore pronounced very severe opinions against Antony;", "2480": "I pronounced severe ones against Lepidus;", "2481": "not so much for the sake of inflicting vengeance upon them, as with a view at present to deter un- principled citizens by fear from making war on their country, and, for the future, to raise a record to prevent any one from imitating such rashness, although this opinion was not more my own in particular than that of all the citizens.", "2482": "And in it there is indeed this appearance of cruelty, that the penalty reaches to their children who have deserved no punishment.", "2483": "But it is an ancient custom, and one which prevails in all states;", "2484": "since even the children of Themistocles were reduced to want.", "2485": "And if the same punishment falls on citizens judicially condemned, how could we be more merciful to enemies ?", "2486": "And what ground of complaint has any one against me, who must confess that if he had been victorious, he would himself have been more severe towards me?", "2487": "You have now the ground of the opinions which I de- livered, at least on this subject of honours and penalties.", "2488": "What opinions I entertained, and what votes I gave, on other matters, I think you have heard;", "2489": "but to mention these is not of so much necessity;", "2490": "what is absolutely necessary is, that you, my dear Brutus, should come into Italy with your army with all speed;", "2491": "there is the strongest desire for your arrival;", "2492": "if you but set foot in Italy, all will flock to you.", "2493": "For whether we are victorious (and we should indeed already have been most gloriously victorious, if Lepidus had not chosen to overturn everything, and ruin himself as well as his friends), we shall require your authority to establish some constitution in the state;", "2494": "or whether there be still struggles to come, our greatest hope is still in your authority and in the power of your army.", "2495": "But hasten to us, I conjure you by the gods ;", "2496": "for you know how much depends on opportu- nities, how much depends on promptness.", "2497": "I will take all possible care of the interests of your sister's sons, as I hope that you will learn from the letters of your mother and your sister;", "2498": "in which cause I have a greater regard for your wishes, which are most dear to me, than, as some think, for my own consistency.", "2499": "But in nothing have I a stronger wish both to be and to seem consistent, than in my affection for you.", "2500": "I HAVE read a small part of your letter, which you sent to Octavius, and which was forwarded to me by Atticus.", "2501": "Your real and anxiety for my safety have given me no new delight;", "2502": "for it is not only a common thing, but one of even daily occurrence, for me to hear something about you which you have said or done, faithfully and honourably, for the mainte- nance of my dignity.", "2503": "Yet that same part of the letter which you wrote to Octavius about me has caused me as much concern as I am capable of feeling;", "2504": "for you thank him on behalf of the republic in such language, in such a suppliant and humble tone, (what shall I say?", "2505": "I am ashamed of our condition and fortune, but still I must write it;", "2506": "you recom- mend my safety to him ;", "2507": "and what kind of death would not be preferable to safety so secured?) that you show plainly that the overbearing power has not been removed, but only the master changed.", "2508": "Recollect the words that you have used, and then deny, if you can, that they are the language of prayer addressed by a slave to his king.", "2509": "You say that there is one thing only which is demanded and expected from him;", "2510": "namely, that he should allow those citizens, of whom virtuous men and the Roman people have a favourable opinion, to live in security.", "2511": "But what if he will not allow it ?", "2512": "Are we to have no existence ?", "2513": "But it would be better to have none than to exist only through his permission.", "2514": "I, assuredly, do not believe that all the gods are so unfavourable to the safety of the Roman people that Octavius must be entreated for the safety of any citizen;", "2515": "I will not say for that of the deliverers of the whole world.", "2516": "For I am glad to take a high tone;", "2517": "and it is fit that I should do so towards those who know not what is to be feared for each individual, or what ought to be asked of any one.", "2518": "Do you then confess, Cicero, that Octavius has this power, and are you nevertheless a friend to him?", "2519": "or, if you have any regard for me, do you wish me to appear at Rome, when I must first be recommended to that boy that I may have the liberty of being there?", "2520": "And for what have you to thank him, if you think be must be entreated to consent aDd allow us to live in safety?", "2521": "Is this to be regarded as a favour, that he prefers to be the person himself from whom such things are to be petitioned, rather than Antony ?", "2522": "Does any one address entreaties to a person who is the chastiser of the domineering power of another, and not rather his successor in it, that men who have done great services to the republic may be per- mitted to live in it in safety?", "2523": "But that imbecility and despair (the fault of which is not to be imputed to you in a greater degree than to every one else) both impelled Julius Cæsar to covet kingly power, and after his death persuaded Antony to endeavour to occupy the place of him who had been slain;", "2524": "and now, too, it has elevated that boy to such a degree, that you have thought that the safety of such men as we are must be obtained of him by entreaties;", "2525": "and have considered that we shall only be safe through the mercy of one who is hardly yet a man, and by no other means.", "2526": "But if we had recollected that we were Romans, these vilest of men would not be more bold in their desires to grasp dominion, than we should be in our determination to stop their course;", "2527": "nor would Antony have been more encouraged by the height of power attained by Cæsar, than deterred by his fate.", "2528": "How can you, a man of consular rank, and the avenger of such atrocious crimes (though, while they are checked, I still fear that our ruin has only been postponed by you for a short time), how can you, I say, contemplate what you yourself have done, and at the same time approve those other things, or at least bear them with so lowly and acquiescent a spirit as to wear the appearance of one who does approve of them?", "2529": "What private ill-feeling had you towards Antony?", "2530": "None, for any other reason but that he assumed such authority, requiring that men's safety should be begged of him;", "2531": "that we, from whom he himself had received liberty, should enjoy only a precarious safety;", "2532": "and that his will as to the common- wealth should be absolute.", "2533": "You then thought it time to seek for arms, by which he might be prevented from lording it over us:", "2534": "but was it your object that, while he was pre- vented from so doing, we might address our prayers to some one else, who would permit himself to be put in his stead;", "2535": "or that the republic might have its full rights and be mistress of itself?", "2536": "unless, indeed, our objection was not to slavery itself, but to some particular kind of slavery.", "2537": "But we might not only have endured our fortune, with Antony for an easy master, but with advantages also and honours, as sharers in them with him, to whatever extent we pleased;", "2538": "for what would he have denied to those whose patience he found to be the main support of his authority?", "2539": "But none of these con- siderations were of such importance that we should sell our good faith and liberty for it.", "2540": "What would not this very boy, whom the name of Cæsar appears to excite against the de- stroyers of Cæsar, what would not he think it worth, (if there were an opportunity for such a bargain,) to have, with our support, as much power as he certainly is likely to have, since we are so eager to live, and to retain our fortunes, and to be called men of consular rank?", "2541": "But then that other Cæsar will have been slain to no purpose;", "2542": "and why did we rejoice at his death, if, after it, we were to be slaves no less than before?", "2543": "Let no anxiety be felt, then, by others.", "2544": "But, as for me, may all the gods and goddesses deprive me of everything, sooner than of the determination not to allow to the heir of the man whom I have slain what I did not allow to the man himself, and what I would not allow even to my own father, if he were to come to life again;", "2545": "namely, that he should have more power than the laws and the senate with my permission.", "2546": "Can you possibly believe that the rest of the citizens will be free under him, without whose permission there is no room for us in the city?", "2547": "How, moreover, is it possible for you to obtain what you ask?", "2548": "for you ask him to permit us to be safe.", "2549": "Do we appear to you, then, certain of receiving safety from him when we have received life?", "2550": "And how can we receive it, if we first throw away our dignity and our freedom?", "2551": "Do you think that to live at Rome is to be safe ?", "2552": "It is cir- cumstances, and not place, which must procure me safety.", "2553": "I was not safe while Cæsar was alive, unless indeed it was after I had resolved upon that deed.", "2554": "Nor can I be an exile anywhere as long as I hate to be a slave, and to endure in- sults worse than all other evils.", "2555": "Is not this to fall back into the same darkness, when we request of him who has taken to himself the name of a tyrant, (while in Grecian states even the children of tyrants, after the parents are put down, arc subjected to the same fate,) that the mortal enemies and suppressors of absolute power may be allowed to live in safety ?", "2556": "Can I wish to see this state in such a condition, or even think it a state at all, if it is not able to receive freedom when put into its hands, and even forced upon it;", "2557": "and when it is more afraid of the name of the king who has been re- moved, in the person of a boy, than confident in itself, even after it has seen that very man who had the greatest power of all cut off by the public spirit of a few individuals?", "2558": "Here- after, do not recommend me to your Cæsar;", "2559": "no, nor even yourself, if you will listen to me.", "2560": "You value the number of years, which your time of life renders it probable that you may enjoy, at a very high rate, if, for the sake of them, you will supplicate that boy.", "2561": "In the next place, with regard to the admirable line of conduct which you have adopted, and still pursue, towards Antony, take care lest, instead of being praised as the part of great magnanimity, it should be imputed to fear.", "2562": "For if you like Octavius, as one from whom we must beg our safety, you will appear not to have objected to a master, but only to have been desirous of a more friendly one.", "2563": "That you praise him for what he has hitherto done, I commend you;", "2564": "for his conduct deserves to be praised;", "2565": "provided only that he under- took that course of action in opposition to the power of an- other, and not for the sake of establishing his own.", "2566": "But when you judge that it is not only lawful for him to have such power, but also that it should be given him by you, so that he must be entreated not to prohibit us from living in safety, you then grant too high a reward to his merits ;", "2567": "for you are bestowing on him that very thing which the republic appeared to possess in consequence of his conduct.", "2568": "Nor does it occur to you, that if Octavius deserves any honours for waging war against Antony, the Roman people could then never bestow on those who eradicated that evil, and of whom these are the relics, anything with which their merit could be compensated, even if it were to heap upon them all honours and rewards at once.", "2569": "But see how much more lively men's fears are than their recollections, because Antony is alive and in arms ;", "2570": "but with respect to Cæsar, all that was possible, or ought to have been done, has been done;", "2571": "nor can it now be recalled and undone.", "2572": "But is Octavius a person of uch importance, that the Roman people ought to wait to see what decision he will form respecting us?", "2573": "And are W3 of so little consequence, that it peems proper to entreat a single individual for our safety?", "2574": "I, however, (to return to that point,) am of such a disposi- tion, that I not only would not address supplications to any one, but would repress those who require supplications to be made to them;", "2575": "or else I will withdraw from those who are slaves, and fancy that Rome is in any place wherever I am permitted to be free.", "2576": "And I will pity you, in whom neither age, nor honours, nor the example of other men's virtue, can diminish the fond desire of life.", "2577": "For my part, I shall seem to myself to be happy, if I can but perpetually and constantly cherish the persuasion that due gratitude has been shown for my affection for my country.", "2578": "For what is more desirable than for a man, enjoying the recollection of glorious actions and the possession of liberty, to look down upon human affairs?", "2579": "At all events, I will not yield to those who yield;", "2580": "nor will I be conquered by those who wish themselves to be conquered;", "2581": "and I will make every possible effort and endeavour, and never cease to attempt to free our city from slavery.", "2582": "If that fortune which ought to follow my endeavours shall attend them, we shall all rejoice;", "2583": "if not, at least I myself shall rejoice.", "2584": "For in what acts or meditations can my life be better spent, than in such as have for their object the deliver- ance of my fellow-citizens?", "2585": "You, my dear Cicero, I beg and exhort not to be weary, nor to distrust the event.", "2586": "Ever, in averting present evils, attend also to those which may come hereafter, lest they should make a way for themselves, unless you check them in time.", "2587": "Consider that the bold and free spirit, such as that with which you saved the state when consul, and uphold it now when you are of consular rank, is valueless without consistency and steadiness.", "2588": "I admit, indeed, that the condition of tried, is harder than that of untried virtue;", "2589": "for we expect services from it as debts;", "2590": "and if anything turns out unfortunately, we then reproach the possessors of it in a hostile spirit, as though we had been deceived by them.", "2591": "Although, therefore, it is conduct worthy of great praise for Cicero to resist Antony, yet, because his character as consul1 seemed necessarily to promise that he would be of similar character as a consular,2 no man wonders at it.", "2592": "But if the same Cicero should waver in that judgment with regard to others, which he has used with such firmness and magna- nimity in repelling Antony, he will not only deprive himself of all hope of future glory, but will cause even the renown of his past achievements to be forgotten.", "2593": "For nothing is great in itself, except that in which a prin- ciple of sound judgment is visible.", "2594": "And as it becomes no one more than yourself, to be attached to the republic, and to be the defender of its liberties, both from your talents and yoar actions, and in accordance with the wishes and demands of all men, Octavius must, consequently, not be solicited to allow us to live in safety.", "2595": "Rouse yourself rather, that you may feel convinced that that city, in which you have performed the greatest deeds, will ever be free and honourable, provided that the people have proper leaders to resist the counsels of the unprincipled.", "2596": "AFTER", "2597": "I had repeatedly exhorted you by letter to come as soon as possible to the succour of the republic, and to bring your army into Italy, and did not suppose that your own friends had any scruples about the propriety of the measure, I. was requested by that most prudent and anxious lady, your mother,1 whose every care is bent upon you and devoted to you, to pay her a visit on the twenty-fifth of July, which I, as I was bound to do, did without hesitation.", "2598": "When I arrived, Casca and Labeo and Scaptius were with her.", "2599": "But she immediately mentioned the business on which she sent for me, and asked me what my opinion was:", "2600": "whether we ought to send for you, and consider such a step to be for your advantage, or whether it would be better for you to delay and remain where you were.", "2601": "I gave such an answer as I tho ught most suited to your dignity and reputation;", "2602": "saying that you should, at the earliest possible moment, bring your aid to the tottering and almost falling republic.", "2603": "For what misfortune, do you think, is not to be expected in a war in which the victorious armies declined to pursue a fleeing enemy ;", "2604": "1 in which a general, in the enjoyment of complete safety, of the most ample honours and the most abundant fortune, blessed with a wife and children, near relations of your own,2 declares war against the republic ?", "2605": "and during which, (need I add?) amid the great unanimity of senate and people, there is still such a vast amount of evil remaining, within the walls ?", "2606": "But, at the time that I was writing this, I was afflicted with the utmost grief, because, when the re- public had accepted me as a surety,3 as it were, for this young man, this almost boy, I scarcely thought that I should be able to perform what I had undertaken.", "2607": "And an engagement for another person's principles and sentiments, especially in affairs of preeminent importance, is a graver obligation, and one more difficult to endure, than an engagement for money.", "2608": "For money cau be paid, and the loss of property may be borne;", "2609": "but how are you to discharge that for which you have engaged to the state, unless he on whose behalf you made the engagement is willing to allow it to be discharged ?", "2610": "Yet I shall be able, as I hope, to hold this youth to his engage- ments, in spite of many that offer resistance to me.", "2611": "For there seems to be in him a good natural disposition;", "2612": "but his age is ductile, and many are ready to lead him astray, who, by holding out to him the splendour of false honour, think that the perspicacity of his judgment may be dazzled.", "2613": "To my other troubles, therefore, is added the labour also of using every contrivance to keep the young man to his duty, that I may not incur the imputation of rashness.", "2614": "And yet what rashness is it?", "2615": "For I have bound him for whom I have become surety, rather than myself", "2616": "Nor is it possible that the republic should repent that I have become surety for him, since in his conduct he has grown more steady, not only from his natural disposition, but in conse- quence also of my promise.", "2617": "However, if I am not mistaken, the greatest difficulty in the republic is the want of pecuniary resources;", "2618": "for the re- spectable classes stop their ears more and more daily against the call for tribute;", "2619": "1 because that which was collected by the tax of one per cent.,2 where the rich were iniquitously rated, has all been spent in rewards to the legions.", "2620": "Boundless expenses also threaten us, both for those armies with which we are now defended, and also for yours;", "2621": "as to Cassius, he seems likely to come sufficiently provided.", "2622": "But I wish to

write to me.", "2625": "Doubtless the times them- selves (for this war is sure to be protracted) reserve the whole affair for you.", "2626": "3", "2627": "But, from the very first, when I could form no conjecture with respect to the duration of the war, I pleaded the cause of the boys in the senate with such earnest- ness as I suppose you have already understood from their mother's letters.",

see in slavery.", "2641": "I shall be willing even to depart from life, which, although it is full of anxiety, yet, as long as it is likely to be of service to the state, consoles me with favourable hopes of a fair reputation with posterity;", "2642": "but should those hopes be taken away, I shall die without hesitation, and I shall depart in such a manner, that good fortune shall appear to have been wanting to my judgment, rather than courage to myself.", "2643": "But this one thing, which is at once an indication of my present distress, an evidence of the past injustice with which I have been treated, and a proof of my feeling for those from whom I am separated, I will not omit to mention, in order that since I am forbidden to do so while present, I may be of service in my absence:",

propitious,) who is there so devoid of humanity, who so bitterly hostile to the name of this city, and to the homes of the citizens, as to be able either to conceal his grief, or to feel none, at such events as these ?", "2646": "Or who, if he cannot by any means remedy the public miseries, would not withdraw from his own share in the danger by death?", "2647": "For, that I may begin at the

required in the orator than Crassus supposes, and that, as universal knowledge is unattainable, it will be well for him not to attempt to acquire too much, as he will thus only distract his thoughts,

almost innumerable excellent commanders, while we can number scarcely a few eminent in speaking?", "2774": "There have been many also in our own memory, and more in that of our fathers, and even of our forefathers, who had abilities to rule and govern affairs of state by their counsel and wisdom;", "2775": "while for a long period no tolerable orators were found, or scarcely one in every age.", "2776": "But lest any one should think that the art of speaking may more justly be compared with other pursuits, which depend upon abstruse studies, and a varied field of learning, than with the merits of a general, or the wisdom of a prudent senator, let him turn his thoughts to those particular sciences themselves, and contemplate who and how many have flourished in them, as he will thus be best enabled to judge how great a scarcity of orators there is and has ever been.", "2777": "III.", "2778": "It does not escape your observation that what the Greeks call PHILOSOPHY, is esteemed by the most learned men, the originator, as it were, and parent of all the arts which merit praise;", "2779": "philosophy, I say, in which it is difficult to enumerate how many distinguished men there have been, and of how great knowledge, variety, and comprehensiveness in their studies, men who have not confined their labours to one province separately, but have embraced whatever they could master either by scientific investigations, or by pro- cesses of reasoning.", "2780": "Who is ignorant in how great obscurity of matter, in how abstruse, manifold, and subtle an art they who are called

he desired.", "2782": "Who has ever devoted himself wholly to music;", "2783": "who has ever given himself up to the learning which they profess who are called gramma- rians, without compassing, in knowledge and understanding, the whole substance and matter of those sciences, though almost boundless?", "2784": "Of all those who have engaged in the most liberal pursuits and departments of such sciences, I think I D may truly say that a smaller number of eminent poets have arisen than of men distinguished in any other branch of litera- ture;", "2785": "and in the whole multitude of the learned, among whom there rarely appears one of the highest excellence, there will be found, if you will but make a careful review of our own list and that of the Greeks, far fewer good orators than good poets.", "2786": "This ought to seem the more wonderful, as attain- ments in other sciences are drawn from recluse and hidden springs;", "2787": "but the whole art of speaking lies before us, and is concerned with common usage and the custom and language of all men;", "2788": "eo that while in other things that is most excel- lent which is most remote from the knowledge and under- standing of the illiterate, it is in speaking even the greatest of faults to vary from the ordinary kind of language, and the practice sanctioned by universal reason.", "2789": "IV.", "2790": "Yet it cannot be said with truth, either that more are devoted to the other arts, or that they are excited by greater pleasure, more abundant hope, or more ample rewards;", "2791": "for to say nothing of Greece, which was always desirous to hold the first place in eloquence, and Athens, that inventress of all literature, in which the utmost power of oratory was both discovered and brought to perfection, in this very city of ours, assuredly, no studies were ever pursued with more earnestness than those tending to the acquisition of elo- quence.", "2792": "For when our empire over all nations was esta- blished, and after a period of peace had secured tranquillity, there was scarcely a youth ambitious of praise who did not think that he must strive, with all his endeavours, to attain the art of speaking.", "2793": "For a time, indeed, as being ignorant of all method, and as thinking there was no course of ex- ercise for them, or any precepts of art, they attained what they could by the single force of genius and thought.", "2794": "But afterwards, having heard the Greek orators, and gained an acquaintance with Greek literature, and procured instruc- tors, our countrymen were inflamed with an incredible passion for eloquence.", "2795": "The magnitude, the variety, the mul- titude of all kind of causes, excited them to such a degree, that to that learning which each had acquired by his indi- vidual study, frequent practice, which was superior to the precepts of all masters, was at once added.", "2796": "There were then, as there are also now, the highest inducements offered for the cultivation of this study, in regard to public favour, wealth, and dignity.", "2797": "The abilities of our countrymen (as we may judge from many particulars,) far excelled those of the men of every other nation.", "2798": "For which reasons, who would not justly wonder that in the records of all ages, times, and states, so small a number of orators should be found ?", "2799":

For who can suppose that, amid the greatest multitude of students, the utmost abundance of masters, the most emi- nent geniuses among men, the infinite variety of causes, the most ample rewards offered to eloquence, there is any other reason to be found for the small number of orators than the incredible magnitude and difficulty of the art?", "2801": "A knowledge of a vast number of things is necessary, without which volubility of words is empty and ridiculous ;", "2802": "speech itself is to be formed, not merely by choice, but by careful construction of words ;", "2803": "and all the emotions of the mind, which nature has given to man, must be intimately known ;", "2804": "for all the force and art of speaking must be employed in allaying or exciting the feelings of those who listen.", "2805": "To this must be added a certain portion of grace and wit, learning worthy of a well-bred man, and quickness and brevity in replying as well as attacking, accompanied with a refined decorum and urbanity.", "2806": "Besides, the whole of antiquity and a multitude of examples is to be kept in the memory;", "2807": "nor is the knowledge of laws in general, or of the civil law in par- ticular, to be neglected.", "2808": "And why need I add any remarks on delivery itself, which is to be ordered by action of body, by gesture, by look, and by modulation and varia- tion of the voice, the great power of which, alone and in itself, the comparatively trivial art of actors and the stage proves, on which though all bestow their utmost labour to form their look, voice, and gesture, who knows not how fev there are, and have ever been, to whom we can attend with.", "2809": "patience ?", "2810": "What can I say of that repository for all things, the memory, which, unless it be made the keeper of the matter and words that are the fruits of thought and inven- tion, all the talents of the orator, we see, though they bo of the highest degree of excellence, will be of no avail ?", "2811": "Let as then cease to wonder what is the cause of the scarcity o good speakers, since eloquence results from all th ose quali- fications, in each of which singly it is a great merit to labour successfully;", "2812": "and let us rather exhort our children, and others whose glory and honour is dear to us, to contemplate in their minds the full magnitude of the object, and not to trust that they can reach the height at which they aim, by the aid of the precepts, masters, and exercises, that they are all now follow- ing, but to understand that they must adopt others of a different character.", "2813": "VI.", "2814": "In my opinion, indeed, no man can be an orator possessed of every praiseworthy accomplishment, unless he has attained the knowledge of everything important, and of all liberal arts, for his language must be ornate and copious from knowledge, since, unless there be beneath the surface matter understood and felt by the speaker, oratory becomes an empty and almost puerile flow of words.", "2815": "Yet I will not lay so great a burden upon orators, especially our own, amid so many occupations of public and private life, as to think it allowable for them to be ignorant of nothing;", "2816": "although the qualifications of an orator, and his very pro- fession of speaking well, seem to undertake and promise that he can discourse gracefully and copiously on whatever sub- ject is proposed to him.", "2817": "But because this, I doubt not, will appear to most people an immense and infinite undertaking, and because I see that the Greeks, men amply endowed not only with genius and learning, but also with leisure and appli- cation, have made a kind of partition of the arts, and have not singly laboured in the whole circle of oratory, but have separated from the other parts of rhetoric that department of eloquence which is used in the forum on trials or in deli- berations, and have left this species only to the orator;", "2818": "I shall not embrace in these books more than has been attri- buted to this kind of speaking!", "2819": "by the almost unanimous consent of the greatest men, after much examination and discussion of the subject;", "2820": "and I shall repeat, not a series of precepts drawn from the infancy of our old and boyish learn- ing, but matters which I have heard were formerly argued in a discussion among some of our countrymen who were of the highest eloquence, and of the first rank in every kind of dignity.", "2821": "Not that I contemn the instructions which the Greek rhetoricians and teachers have left as, but, as they are already public, and within the reach of all, and can neither be set forth more elegantly, nor explained more clearly by my interpretation, you will, I think, excuse me,.my brother, if I prefer to the Greeks the authority of those to whom the utmost merit in eloquence has been allowed by our own countrymen.", "2822": "VII.", "2823": "At the time, then, when the consul Philippus was vehe- mently inveighing against, the cause of the nobility, and the tribuneship of Drusus, undertaken to support the authority of the senate, seemed to be shaken and weakened, I was told, I remember, that Lucius Crassus, as if for the purpose of collecting his thoughts, betook himself, during the days of the Roman games, to his Tusculan country-seat, whither also Quintus Mucius, who had been his father-in-law, is said to have come at the same time, as well as Marcus Antonius, a sharer in all the political proceedings of Crassus, and united in the closest friendship with him.", "2824": "There went out with Crassus him- self two young men besides, great friends of Drusus, youths of whom our ancestors then entertained sanguine hopes that they would maintain the dignity

"Cotta re- peated to me many things then prophetically lamented and noticed by the three of consular dignity in that conversation 1 so that no misfortune afterwards happened to the state which they had not perceived to be hanging over it so long before;", "2828": "and he said that, when this conversation was finished, there was such politeness shown by Crassus, that after they had bathed and sat down to table, all the seriousness of the former discourse was banished;", "2829": "and there appeared so much plea gantry in him, and so much agreeableness in his humour that though the early part of the day might seem to have been passed by them in the senate-house, the banquet showed all the delights of the Tusculan villa.", "2830": "But on the next day, when the older part of the company had taken sufficient repose, and were come to their walk, he told me that Scævola, after taking two or three turns, said, \" Why should not we, Crassus, imitate Socrates in the Phædrus of Plato ?", "2831": "1 for this plane-tree of yours has put me in mind of it, which diffuses its spreading boughs to over- shade this place, not less widely than that did whose covert Socrates sought, and which seems to me to have grown not so much from the rivulet which is described, as from the language of Plato :", "2832": "and what Socrates, with the hardest of feet, used to do, that is, to throw himself on the grass, while he delivered those sentiments which philosophers say were uttered divinely, may surely, with more justice, be allowed to my feet.\"", "2833": "Then Crassus rejoined, \"Nay, we will

only to excel their equals in age, but to be admitted to a comparison with their seniors;", "2839": "\"", "2840": "Nor does anything seem to me,\" he added, \"more noble than to be able to fix the attention of assemblies of men by speaking, to fascinate their minds, to direct their passions to whatever object the orator pleases, and to dissuade them from whatsoever he desires.", "2841": "This particular art has constantly flourished above all others in every free state, and especially in those which have enjoyed peace and tranquillity, and has over exercised great power.", "2842": "For

granted to all ?", "2843": "Or what is so pleasant to be heard and understood as an oration adorned and polished with wise thoughts and weighty expressions ?", "2844": "Or what is so striking, so astonishing, as that the tumults of the people, the religious feelings of judges, the gravity of the senate, should be swayed by the speech of one man ?", "2845": "Or what, moreover, is so kingly, so liberal, so munificent, as to give assistance to the suppliant, to raise the afflicted, to bestow security, to deliver from dangers, to maintain men in the rights of citizenship ?", "2846": "What, also, is so necessary as to keep arms always ready, with which you may either be protected yourself, or defy the malicious, or avenge yourself when provoked?", "2847": "Or consider, (that you may not always contemplate the forum, the benches, the rostra, and the senate,) what can be more delightful in leisure, or more suited to social intercourse, than elegant conversa- tion, betraying no want of

eloquent;", "3051": "for I accounted him a good speaker, who could express his thoughts with accuracy and perspi- cuity, according to the ordinary judgment of mankind, before an audience of moderate capacity;", "3052": "but I considered him alone eloquent, who could in a more admirable and noble manner amplify and adorn whatever subjects he chose, and who em- braced in thought and memory all the principles of everything relating to oratory.", "3053": "This, though it may be difficult to us, who, before we begin to speak in public, are overwhelmed by canvassings for office and by the business of the forum, is yet within the range of possibility and the powers of nature.", "3054": "For I, as far as I can divine by conjecture, and as far as I can estimate the abilities of our countrymen, do not despair that there may arise at some time or other a person, who, when, with a keener devotion to study than we feel, or have ever felt, with more leisure, with better and more mature talent for learning, and with superior labour and industry, he shall have given himself up to hearing, reading, and writing, may become such an orator as we desire to see,-one who may justly be called not only a good speaker, but truly eloquent;", "3055": "and such a character, in my opinion, is our friend Crassus, or some one, if such ever was, of equal genius, who, having heard, read, and written more than Crassus, shall be able to make some little addition to it.\"Here Sulpicius observed:", "3056": "“ That has happened by acci- dent, Crassus, which neither Cotta nor I expected, but which we both

other matters, we might gather some- thing worthy to be remembered from your conversation;", "3058": "but that you should go into a deep and full discussion on this very study, or art, or faculty, and penetrate into the heart of it, was what we could scarcely venture to hope.", "3059": "For I, who, from my early youth, have felt a strong affection for you both, and even a love for Crassus, having never left his com- pany, could never yet elicit a word from him on the method and art of speaking, though I not only solicited him myself, but endeavoured to move him by the agency of Drusus;", "3060": "on which subject you, Antonius, (I speak but the truth,) never failed to answer my requests and interrogatories, and have very often told me what you used to notice in speaking.", "3061": "And since each of you has opened a way to these subjects of our research, and since Crassus was the first to commence this discourse, do us the favour to acquaint us fully and exactly what you think about the various kinds of eloquence.", "3062": "If we, obtain this indulgence from you, I shall feel the greatest obligation to this school of yours, Crassus, and to your Tus- culan villa, and shall prefer your suburban place of study to the famous Academy and Lyceum.", "3063": "\"XXII. \" Nay rather, Sulpicius,\" rejoined Crassus, \" let us ask Antonius, who is both capable of doing what you desire, and, as I hear you say, has been accustomed to do so.", "3064": "As to myself, I acknowledge that I have ever avoided all such kind of discourse, and have often declined to comply with your requests and solicitations, as you just now observed.", "3065": "This I did, not from pride or want of politeness, nor because I was unwilling to aid your just and commendable aspirations, especially as I knew you to be eminently and above others formed and qualified by nature to become a speaker, but, in truth, from being unaccustomed to such kind of discussions, and from being ignorant of those principles which are laid down as institutes of the art.\" \" Then,\" said Cotta, \" since we have got over what we thought the greatest difficulty, to induce you, Crassus, to speak at all upon these subjects, for the rest, it will be our own fault if we let you go before you have explained all that we have to ask.\" \" I believe I must answer,\" says Crassus, \" as is usually written in the formulæ for entering on inheritances,1 concerning such points AS I KNOW AND SHALL BE ABLE.\" \" And which of us,\" rejoined Cotta, “ can be so presuming as to desire to know or to be able to do anything that you do not know or cannot do?” \" Well, then,\" returned Crassus, \" on condition that I may say that I cannot do what I cannot do, and that I may own that I do not know what I do not know, you may put ques- tions to me at your pleasure.\" \" We shall, then, first ask of you,\" said Suipicius, \" what you think of what Antonius has advanced;", "3066": "whether you think that there is any art in speak- ing?” “ What !” exclaimed Crassus, \"do you put a trifling question to me, as to some idle and talkative, though perhaps studious and learned Greek, on which I may speak accord- ing to my humour?", "3067": "When do you imagine that I have ever regarded or thought upon such matters, or have not always rather ridiculed the impudence of those men who, seated in the schools, would demand if any one, in a numerous assembly of persons, wished to ask any question, and desire him to speak?", "3068": "This Gorgias the Leontine is said to have first done, who was thought to undertake and promise some- thing vast, in pronouncing himself prepared to speak on all subjects on which any one should be inclined to hear him.", "3069": "But afterwards those men made it a common practice, and continue it to this day;", "3070": "so that there is no topic of such importance, or so unexpected, or so new, on which they do not profess that they will say all that can be said.", "3071": "But if I had thought that you, Cotta, or you, Sulpicius, were desirous to hear such matters, I would have brought hither some Greek to amuse you with their manner of disputation;", "3072": "for there is with M. Piso,2 (a youth already addicted to this intel- lectual exercise, and one of superior talents, and of great affec- tion for me,) the peripatetic Staseas, a man with whom I am well acquainted, and who, as I perceive is agreed amongst the learned, is of the first eminence in his profession.", "3073": "\"XXIII.", "3074": "\"Why do you speak to me,” says Scævola, \"of this Staseas, this peripatetic?", "3075": "You must comply with the wishes of these young gentlemen, Crassus, who do not want the common, profitless talk of any Greek, or any empty declamation of the schools, but desire to know the opinions of a man in whose footsteps they long to tread,-one who is the wisest and most eloquent of all men, who is not dis- tinguished by petty books of precepts, but is the first, both in judgment and oratory, in causes of the greatest conse- quence, and in this seat of empire and glory.", "3076": "For my part, as I always thought you a god in eloquence, so I have never attributed to you greater praises for oratory than for polite- ness;", "3077": "which you ought to show on this occasion especially, and not to decline a discussion on which two young men of such excellent ability invite you to enter.\"", "3078": "“I am certainly,\" replied Crassus, \" desirous to oblige them, nor shall I think it any trouble to speak briefly, as is my manner, what I think upon any point of the subject.", "3079": "And to their first question, (because I do not think it right for me to neglect your admo- nition, Scævola,) I answer, that I think there is either no art of speaking at all, or but very little;", "3080": "but that all the disputation about it amongst the learned arises from a difference of opinion about the word.", "3081": "For if art is to be defined according to what Antonius just now asserted,1 as lying in things thoroughly understood and fully known, such as are abstracted from the caprice of opinion and comprehended in the limits of science, there seems to me to be no art at all in oratory;", "3082": "since all the species of our forensic diction are various, and suited to the common understanding of the people.", "3083": "Yet if those things which have been observed in the practice and method of speaking, have been noted and chronicled by ingenious and skilful men, have been set forth in words, illustrated in their several kinds, and distributed into parts, (as I think may possibly be done,) I do not understand why speaking may not be deemed an art, if not according to the exact definition of Antonius, at least according to common opinion.", "3084": "But whether it be an art, or merely the resemblance of an art, it is not, indeed, to be neglected;", "3085": "yet we must understand that there are other things of more consequence for the attainment of eloquence.", "3086": "”XXIV.", "3087": "Antonius then observed, that he was very strongly of opinion with Crassus;", "3088": "for he neither adopted such a defini- tion of art as those preferred who attributed all the powers of eloquence to art, nor did he repudiate it entirely, as most of the philosophers had done.", "3089": "\"", "3090": "But I imagine, Crassus,\" added he, \" that you will gratify these two young men, if you will specify those particulars which you think may be more con- ducive to oratory than art itself.\" \" I will indeed mention them,\" said he, \" since I have engaged to do so, but must beg you not to publish my trifling remarks;", "3091": "though I will keep myself under such restraint as not to seem to speak like a master, or artist, but like one of the number of private citizens, moderately versed in the practice of the forum, and not altogether ignorant;", "3092": "not to have offered anything from myself, but to have accidentally fallen in with the course of your conversation.", "3093": "Indeed, when I was a candidate for office, I used, at the time of canvassing, to send away Scsevola from me, telling him I wanted to be foolish, that is, to solicit with flattery, a thing that cannot be done to any purpose unless it be done foolishly;", "3094": "and that he was the only man in the world in whose presence I should least like to play the fool;", "3095": "and yet fortune has appointed him to be a witness and spectator of my folly.", "3096": "1", "3097": "For what is more foolish than to speak about speaking, when speaking itself is never otherwise than foolish, except it is absolutely necessary ?” “ Proceed, however, Cras- sus,\" said Scævola;", "3098": "\"for I will take uponmyself the blame which you fear.\"XXV.",

now alluded, it was not skill and method in speaking, but natural talent that was wanting;", "3101": "for there ought to be cer- tain lively powers in the mind 2 and understanding, which may be acute to invent, fertile to explain and adorn, and strong and retentive to remember;", "3102": "and if any one imagines that these powers may be acquired by art, (which is false, for it is very well if they can be animated and excited by art;", "3103": "but they certainly cannot by art be ingrafted or instilled, since they are all the gifts of nature,) what will he say of those qualities which are certainly born with the man him- self, volubility of tongue, tone of voice, strength of lungs, and a peculiar conformation and aspect of the whole coun- tenance and body ?", "3104": "I do not say, that art cannot improve in these particulars, (for am not ignorant that what is good may be made better by education, and what is not very good may be in some degree polished and amended;", "3105": ")

gifts of nature, that they seem not to have been born like other men, but moulded by some divinity.", "3107": "It is, indeed, a great task and enterprise for a person to undertake and profess, that

"3219": "for it conveys some hints to admonish the orator, as it were, to what he should refer each part of his speech, and to what points he may direct his view, so as not to wander from the object which he has proposed to himself.", "3220": "But I consider that with regard to all precepts the case is this, not that orators by adhering to them have obtained dis- tinction in eloquence;", "3221": "but that certain persons have noticed what men of eloquence practised of their own accord, and formed rules accordingly;", "3222": "1 so that eloquence has not sprung from art, but art from eloquence;", "3223": "not that, as I said before, I entirely reject art, for it is, though not essentially necessary to oratory, yet proper for a man of liberal education to learn.", "3224": "And by you, my young friends, some preliminary exercise must be undergone;", "3225": "though indeed you are already on the course;", "3226": "but those2 who are to enter upon a race, and those who are preparing for what is to be done in the forum, as their field of battle, may alike previously learn, and try their powers, by practising in sport.\"", "3227": "\"That sort of exercise,\" said Sulpicius, “is just what we wanted to understand;", "3228": "but we desire to hear more at large what you have briefly and cursorily delivered concerning art;", "3229": "though such matters are not strange even to us.", "3230": "Of that subject, however, we shall inquire hereafter;", "3231": "at present we wish to know your sen- timents on exercise.", "3232": "\"XXXIII.", "3233": "\"I like that method,\" replied Crassus, \"which you are accustomed to practise, namely, to lay down a case similar to those which are brought on in the forum, and to speak upon it, as nearly as possible, as if it were a real case.]", "3234": "But in such efforts the generality of students exercise only their voice (aud not even that skilfully), and try their strength of lungs, and volubility of tongue, and please them- selves with a torrent of their own words;", "3235": "in which exercise what they have heard deceives them, that men by speaking succeed in becoming speakers.", "3236": "For it is truly said also, That men by speaking badly make sure of becoming bad speakers.", "3237": "In those exercises, therefore, although it be useful even fre- quently to speak on the sudden, yet it is mere advantageous, after taking time to consider, to speak with greater prepara- tion and accuracy.", "3238": "But the chief point of all is that which (to say the truth) we hardly ever practise (for it requires great labour, which most of us avoid);", "3239": "I mean, to write as much as possible.", "3240": "Writing is said to be the best and most excellent modeller and teacher of oratory;", "3241": "and not without reason;", "3242": "for if what is meditated and considered easily surpasses sudden and extemporary speech, a constant and diligent habit of writing will surely be of more effect than meditation and consideration itself;", "3243": "since all the arguments relating to the subject on which we write, whether they are suggested by art, or by a certain power of genius and understanding, will present themselves, and occur to us, while we examine and contemplate it in the full light of our intellect;", "3244": "and all the thoughts and words, which are the most expressive of their kind, must of necessity come under and submit to the keen- ness of our judgment while writing;", "3245": "and a fair arrangement and collocation of the words is effected by writing, in a certain rhythm and measure, not poetical, but oratorical.", "3246": "Such are the qualities which bring applause and admiration to good orators;", "3247": "nor will any man ever attain them, unless after long and great practice in writing, however resolutely he may have exercised himself in extemporary speeches;", "3248": "and he who comes to speak after practice in writing brings this advantage with him, that though he speak at the call of the moment, yet what he says will bear a resemblance to something written;", "3249": "and if ever, when he comes to speak, he brings anything with him in writing, the rest of his speech, when he departs from what is written, will flow on in a similar strain.", "3250": "As, when a boat has once been impelled forward, though the rowers suspend their efforts, the vessel herself still keeps her motion and course during the intermission of the impulse and force of the oars;", "3251": "so, in a continued stream of oratory, when written matter fails, the rest of the speech maintains a similar flow, being impelled by the resemblance and force acquired from what was written.", "3252": "XXXIV. “", "3253": "But in my daily exercises I used, when a youth, to adopt chiefly that method which I knew that Caius Carbo, my adversary,1 generally practised;", "3254": "which was, that, having selected some nervous piece of poetry, or read over such a portion of a speech as I could retain in my memory, I used to declaim upon what I had been reading in other words, chosen with all the judgment that I possessed.", "3255": "But at length I perceived that in that method there was this inconvenience, that Ennius, if I exercised myself on his verses, or Gracchus, if I laid one of his orations before me, had forestalled such words as were peculiarly appropriate to the subject, and such as were the most elegant and altogether the best;", "3256": "so that, if I used the same words, it profited nothing;", "3257": "if others, it was even prejudicial to me, as I habituated myself to use such as were less eligible.", "3258": "Afterwards I thought proper, and continued the practice at a rather more advanced age,2 to translate the orations of the best Greek orators;", "3259": "3 by fixing upon which I gained this advantage, that while I rendered into Latin what I had read in Greek, I not only used the best words, and yet such as were of common occurrence, but also formed some words by imitation, which would be new to our countrymen, taking care, however, that they were unob- jectionable.", "3260": "\"As to the exertion and exercise of the voice, of the breath, of the whole body, and of the tongue itself, they do not so much require art as labour;", "3261": "but in those matters we ought to be particularly careful whom we imitate and whom we would wish to resemble.", "3262": "Not only orators are to be observed by us, but even actors, lest by vicious habits we contract any awkwardness or ungracefulness.", "3263": "The memory is also to be exercised, by learning accurately by heart as many of our own writings, and those of others, as we can.", "3264": "In exercising the memory, too, I shall not object if you accustom yourself to adopt that plan of referring to places and figures which is taught in treatises on the art.", "3265": "1", "3266": "Your language must then be brought forth from this domestic and retired exercise, into the midst of the field, into the dust and clamour, into the camp and military array of the forum;", "3267": "you must acquire practice in everything;", "3268": "you must try the strength of your understanding;", "3269": "and your retired lucubrations must be ex- posed to the light of reality.", "3270": "The poets must also be studied;", "3271": "an acquaintance must be formed with history;", "3272": "the writers and teachers in all the liberal arts and sciences must be read, and turned over, and must, for the sake of exercise, be praised, interpreted, corrected, censured, refuted;", "3273": "you must dispute on both sides of every question;", "3274": "and whatever may seem maintainable on any point, must be brought forward and illustrated.", "3275": "The civil law must be thoroughly studied;", "3276": "laws in general must be understood;", "3277": "all antiquity must be known;", "3278": "the usages of the senate, the nature of our government, the rights of our allies, our treaties and convention?, and.", "3279": "what- ever concerns the interests of the state, must be learned.", "3280": "A certain intellectual grace must also be extracted from every kind of refinement, with which, as with salt, every oration must be seasoned.", "3281": "I have poured forth to you all I had to say, and perhaps any citizen whom you had laid hold of in any company whatever, would have replied to your inquiries on these subjects equally well.", "3282": "\"XXXV.", "3283": "When Crassus had uttered these words a silence ensued.", "3284": "But though enough seemed to have been said in the opinion of the company present, in reference to what had been proposed, yet they thought that he had concluded his speech more abruptly than they could have wished.", "3285": "Scævola then said, \"What is the matter, Cotta why are you silent ?", "3286": "Does nothing more occur to you which you would wish to ask Crassus \"Nay,\" rejoined he, \"that is the very thing of which I am thinking;", "3287": "for the rapidity of his words was such, and his oration was winged with such speed, that though I perceived its force and energy I could scarcely see its track and course;", "3288": "and, as if I had come into some rich and well-furnished house, where the furniturel was not un- packed, nor the plate set out, nor the pictures and statues placed in view, but a multitude of all these magnificent things laid up and heaped together;", "3289": "so just now, in the speech of Crassus, I saw his opulence and the riches of his genius, through veils and curtains as it were;", "3290": "but when I desired to take a nearer view, there was scarcely opportunity for taking a glance at them;", "3291": "I can therefore neither say that I am wholly ignorant of what he possesses, nor that I have plainly ascertained and beheld it.\" \" Then,\" said Scævola, \" why do you not act in the same way as you would do, if you had really come into a house or villa full of rich fur- niture ?", "3292": "If everything was put by as you describe, and you had a great curiosity to see it, you would not hesitate to ask the master to order it to be brought out, especially if he was your friend;", "3293": "in like manner you will now surely ask Crassus to bring forth into the light that profusion of splendid objects which are his property, (and of which, piled together in one place, we have caught a glimpse, as it were through a lattice,5 as we passed by,) and set everything in its proper situation.\"", "3294": "\"I rather ask you, Scævola,” says Cotta, \"to do that for me;", "3295": "(for modesty forbids Sulpicius and myself to ask of one of the most eminent of mankind, who has ever held in contempt this kind of disputation, such things as he perhaps regards only as rudiments for children;", "3296": ") but do you oblige us in this, Scævola, and prevail on Crassus to unfold and enlarge upon those matters which he has crowded together, and crammed into so small a space in his speech.\" \" Indeed,\" said Scævola, \"I desired that before, more upon your account than my own;", "3297": "nor did I feel so much longing for this discussion from Crassus, as I experience pleasure from his orations in pleading But now, Crassus, I ask you also on my own account, that since we have so much more leisure than has been allowed us for long time, you would not think it troublesome to complete the edifice which you have commenced;", "3298": "for I see a finer and better plan of the whole work than I could have ima- gined, and one of which I strongly approve.\"", "3299": "XXXVI. \"", "3300": "I cannot sufficiently wonder,\" says Crassus, \"that even you, Scævola, should require of me that which I do not understand like those who teach it, and which is of such a nature, that if I understood it ever so well, it would be unworthy of your wisdom and attention.\"", "3301": "\"Say you so?\" replied Scævola.", "3302": "\"If you think it scarcely worthy 01 my age to listen to those ordinary precepts, commonly known everywhere, can we possibly neglect those other matters which you said must be known by the orator, respecting the dispo- sitions and manners of mankind, the means by which the minds of men are excited or calmed, history, antiquity, the administration of the republic, and finally of our own civil law itself?", "3303": "For I knew that all this science, this abundance of knowledge, was within the compass of your understanding, but had never seen such rich furniture among the equipments of the orator.\"\"", "3304": "Can you then,\" says Crassus, \"(to omit other things in- numerable and without limit, and come to your study, the civil law,) can you account them orators, for whom Scævola,1 though in haste to go to the Campus Martius, waited several hours, sometimes laughing and sometimes angry, while Hyp- sæus, in the loudest voice, and with a multitude of words, was trying to obtain of Marcus Crassus, the prætor, that the party whom he defended might be allowed to lose his suit;", "3305": "and Cneius Octavius, a mail of consular dignity, in a speech of equal length, refused to consent that his adversary should lose his cause, and that the party for whom he was speaking should be released from the ignominious charge of having been un- faithful in his guardianship, and from all trouble, through the folly of his antagonist?\"2 \" I should have thought such men,\" replied Scævola, “(for I remember Mucius1 told me the story,) not only unworthy of the name of orators, but un- worthy even to appear to plead in the forum.\"", "3306": "\"Yet,\" rejoined Crassus, \"those advocates neither wanted eloquence, nor method, nor abundance of words, but a knowledge of the civil law:", "3307": "for in this case one, in bringing his suit, sought to recover more damages than the law of the Twelve Tables allowed, and, if he had gained those damages, would have lost his cause:", "3308": "the other thought it unjust that he himself should be proceeded against for more than was allowed in that sort of action, and did not understand that his adversary, if he proceeded in that manner, would lose his suit.", "3309":

understand to be made for the benefit of the creditor;", "3312": "so that if the defendant1 had proved to the judge that the action was brought for the money before it became due, the plaintiff,2 on bringing a fresh action, would be pre- cluded by the exception, that the matter had before come into judgment.", "3313": "What more disgraceful therefore can possibly be said or done, than that he who has assumed the character of an advocate, ostensibly to defend the causes and interests of his friends, to assist the distressed, to relieve such as are sick at heart, and to cheer the afflicted, should so err in the slightest and most trivial matters, as to seem an object of pity to some, and of ridicule to others?", "3314": "I consider my relation, Publius Crassus, him who from his wealth had the sur- name of Dives,3 to have been, in many other respects, a man of taste and elegance, but especially worthy of praise and commendation on this account, that (as he was the brother of Publius Scævola)4 he was accustomed to observe to him, that neither could he5 have satisfied the claims of the civil law if he had not added the power of speaking (which his son here, who was my colleague in

own.", "3582": "For if you were to say, that he who is a lawyer is also an orator, and that he who is an orator is also a lawyer, you would make two excellent branches of knowledge, each equal to the other, and sharers of the same dignity;", "3583": "but now you allow that a man may be a lawyer without the eloquence which we are considering, and that there have been many such;", "3584": "and you deny that a man can be an orator who has not acquired a knowledge of law.", "3585": "Thus the lawyer is, of himself, nothing with you but a sort of wary and acute legalist, an instructor in actions,3 a repeater of forms, a catcher at sylla- bles ;", "3586": "but because the orator has frequent occasion for the aid of the law in his pleadings, you have of necessity joined legal knowledge to eloquence as a handmaid and attendant.", "3587": "LVI. \"", "3588": "But as to your wonder at the effrontery of those advocates who, though they were ignorant of small things, profess great ones, or who ventured, in the management of causes, to treat of the most important points in the civil law, though they neither understood nor had ever learned them, the defence on both charges is- easy and ready.", "3589": "For it is not at all surprising that he who is ignorant in what form of words a contract of marriage is made, should be able to defend the cause of a woman who has formed such a contract;", "3590": "nor, though the same skill in steering is requisite for a small as for a large vessel, is he therefore, who is ignorant of the form of words by which an estate is to be divided,

Curius, which was lately pleaded by you, 2 and that of Caius Hostilius Mancinus,3 and that of the boy who was born of a second wife, without any notice of divorce having been sent to the first,4 there was the greatest disagreement among the most skilful lawyers on points of law.", "3594": "I ask, then, how in these causes a knowledge of the law could have aided the orator, when that lawyer must have had the superiority, who was supported, not by his own, but a foreign art, not by know- ledge of the law, but by eloquence?", "3595": "I have often heard that, when Publius Crassus was a candidate for the ædileship, and Servius Galba, though older than he, and even of consular dignity, attended upon him to promote his interest, (having betrothed Crassus's daughter to his son Caius,) there came a countryman to Crassus to consult him on some matter of law;", "3596": "and when he had taken Crassus aside, and laid the affair before him, and received from him such an answer as was rather right than suited to his wishes, Galba, seeing him look dejected, called him by his name, and asked him on what matter he had consulted Crassus;", "3597": "when, having heard his case, and seeing the man in' great trouble, 1 I perceive,' said he, ' that Crassus gave you an answer while his mind was anxious, and pre-occupied with other affairs.'", "3598": "He then took Crassus by the hand, and said, f Hark you, how came it into your head to give this man such an answer ?'", "3599": "Crassus, who was a man of great legal knowledge, confidently repeated that the matter was exactly as he had stated in his answer, and that there could be no doubt.", "3600": "But 'Galba, referring to a variety and multiplicity of matters, adduced abundance of similar cases, and used many arguments for equity against the strict letter of law;", "3601": "while Crassus, as he could not main- tain his ground in the debate, (for, though he was numbered among the eloquent, he was.", "3602": "by no means equal to Galba,) had recourse to authorities, and showed what he had asserted in the books of his brother Publius Mucius,l and in the com- mentaries of Sextus Ælius;", "3603": "though he allowed, at the same time, that Galba's arguments had appeared to him plausible, and almost true.", "3604": "LVII. \"", "3605": "But causes which are of such a kind, that there can be no doubt of the

accordingly, may be ignorant of all this part of the law relative to controversies,1 which is without doubt the far greater part ;", "3611": "but on those points which are disputed, even among the most skilful lawyers, it will not be difficult for the orator to find some writer of authority on that side, whichsoever it be, that he is to defend, from whom, when he has received his javelins ready for throwing, he will hurl them with the arm and strength of an orator.", "3612": "Unless we are to suppose, indeed, (I would wish to make the observation with- out offending this excellent man Scævola,) that you, Crassus, defended the cause of Manius Curius out of the writings and rules of your father-in-law.", "3613": "Did you not, on the contrary, undertake the defence of equity, the support of wills, and the intention of the dead ?", "3614": "Indeed, in my opinion, (for I was frequently present and heard you,) you won the far greater number of votes by your wit, humour, and happy raillery, when you joked upon the extraordinary acuteness, and ex- pressed admiration of the genius, of Scævola, who had discovered that a man must be born before he can die;", "3615": "and when you adduced many cases, both from the laws and decrees of the senate, as well as from common life and intercourse, not only acutely, but facetiously and sarcastically, in which, if we attended to the

understood by men of the greatest genius, the keenest application, the most consummate learning, and the utmost experience;", "3780": "as you will very easily be able to judge, who have been pleased to acquire the knowledge and theory of oratory through your own exertions, and to observe the practice of it in mine.", "3781": "But that we may the sooner accom- plish the task which we have undertaken, and which is no ordinary one, let us leave our exordium, and proceed to the conversation and arguments of the characters whom I have offered to your notice.", "3782": "The next day, then, after the former conversation had taken place, about the second hour,1 while Crassus was yet in bed, and Sulpicius sitting by him, and Antonius walking with Cotta in the portico, on a sudden Quintus Catulus 2 the elder, with his brother Caius Julius,3 arrived there;", "3783": "and when Crassus heard of their coming, he arose in some haste, and they were all in a state of wonder, suspecting that the occa- sion of their arrival was of more than common importance.", "3784": "The parties having greeted each other with most friendly salutations, as their intimacy required, \"What has brought you hither at last?” said Crassus;", "3785": "\"is it anything new?” \" Nothing, indeed,\" said Catulus;", "3786": "\" for you know it is the time of the public games.", "3787": "But (you may think us, if you please,\" added he, \" either foolish or impertinent) when Caesar came yesterday in the evening to my Tusculan villa, from his own, he told me that he had met Scævola going from hence;", "3788": "from whom he said that he had heard a wonderful account, namely, that you, whom I could never entice into such con- versation, though I endeavoured to prevail on you in every way, had held long dissertations with Antonius on eloquence, and had disputed, as in the schools, almost in the manner of the Greeks;", "3789": "and my brother, therefore, entreated me, not being of myself, indeed, averse to hear you, but, at the same time, afraid we might make a troublesome visit to you, to come hither with him;", "3790": "for he said that Scævola had told him that a great part of the discourse was postponed till to-day.", "3791": "If you think we have acted too forwardly, you will lay the blame upon Cæsar, if too familiarly, upon both of us;", "3792": "for we are rejoiced to have come, if we do not give you trouble by our visit.", "3793": "” IV.", "3794": "Crassus replied, “", "3795": "Whatever object had brought you hither, I should rejoice to see at my house men for whom I ha a so much affection and friendship;", "3796": "but yet, (to say the truth,) I had rather it had been any other object than that which you mention.", "3797": "For I, (to speak as I think,) was never less satisfied with myself than yesterday;", "3798": "though this happened more through my own good nature than any other fault of mine;", "3799": "for, while I complied with the request of these youths, I forgot that I was an old man, and did that which I had never done even when young;", "3800": "I spoke on subjects that depended on a certain degree of learning.", "3801": "But it has happened very fortunately for me, that as my part is finished, you have come to hear Antonius.\" “ For my part, Crassus,\" returned Cæsar, \" I am indeed desirous to hear you in that kind of fuller and continuous discussion, yet so that, if I cannot have that happiness, I can be contented with your ordinary conversation.", "3802": "I will therefore endeavour that neither my friend Sulpicius, nor Cotta, may seem to have more influence with you than myself;", "3803": "and will certainly entreat you to show some of your good nature even to Catulus and me.", "3804": "But if you are not so inclined, I will not press you, nor cause you, while you are afraid of appearing impertinent yourself, to think me impertinent.\" \" Indeed, Cæsar,” replied Crassus, \" I have always thought of all Latin words there was the greatest significance in that which you have just used;", "3805": "for he whom we call impertinent, seems to me to bear an appellation derived from not being pertinent;", "3806": "and that appellation, according to our mode of speaking, is of very extensive meaning;", "3807": "for whoever either does not discern what occasion requires, or talks too much, or is ostentatious of himself, or is forgetful either of the dignity or convenience of those in whose presence he is, or is in any respect awkward or presuming, is called impertinent.", "3808": "With this fault that most learned nation of the Greeks abounds;", "3809": "and, conse- quently, because the Greeks do not feel the influence of this evil, they have not even found a name for the foible;", "3810": "for though you make the most diligent inquiry, you will not find out how the Greeks designate an impertinent person.", "3811": "But of all their other impertinences, which are innumerable, I do not know whether there be any greater than their custom of raising the most subtile disputations on the most difficult or unnecessary points, in whatever place, and before whatever persons they think proper.", "3812": "This we were compelled to do by these youths yesterday, though against our will, and though we at first declined.", "3813": "\"V. \" The Greeks, however, Crassus,\" rejoined Catulus, “ who were eminent and illustrious in their respective states, as you are, and as we all desire to be, in our own republic, bore no resemblance to those Greeks who force themselves on our ears;", "3814": "yet they did not in their leisure avoid this kind of dis- course and disputation.", "3815": "And if they seem' to you, as they ought to seem, impertinent, who have no regard to times, places, or persons, does this place, I pray, seem ill adapted to our purpose, in which the very portico where we are walking, and this field of exercise, and the seats in so many directions, revive in some degree the remembrance of the Greek gymuasia and disputations?", "3816": "Or is the time unsea- sonable, during so much leisure as is seldom afforded us, and is now afforded at a season when it is most desirable 1", "3817": "Or are the company unsuited to this kind of discussion, when we are all of such a character as to think that life is nothing without these studies'?\"", "3818": "\"I contemplate all these things,\" said Crassus, \" in a quite different light;", "3819": "for I think that even the Greeks themselves originally contrived their palæstræ, and seats, and porticoes, for exercise and amusement, not for dis- putation;", "3820": "since their gymnasia were invented many genera- tions before the philosophers began to prate in them;", "3821": "and at this very day, when the philosophers occupy all the gymnasia, their audience would still rather hear the discus than a phi- losopher ;", "3822": "and as soon as it begins to sound, they all desert the philosopher in the middle of his discourse, though dis- cussing matters of the utmost weight and consequence, to anoint themselves for exercise;", "3823": "thus preferring the lightest amusement to what the philosophers represent to be' of the utmost utility.", "3824": "As to the leisure which you say we have, I agree with you;", "3825": "but the enjoyment of leisure is not exertion of mind, but relaxation.", "3826": "VI.", "3827": "I have often heard from my father-in-law, in conversation, that his father-in-law Lælius was almost always accustomed to go into the country with Scipic, and that they used to grow incredibly boyish again when they had escaped out of town, as if from a prison, into the open fields.", "3828": "I scarcely dare to say it of such eminent persons, yet Scævola is in the habit of relating that they used to gather shells and pebbles at Caieta and Laurentum, and to descend to every sort of pastime and amusement.", "3829": "For such is the case, that as we see birds form and build nests for the sake of procreation and their own convenience, and, when they have completed any part, fly abroad in freedom, dis- engaged from their toils, in order to alleviate their anxiety;", "3830": "so our minds, wearied with legal business and the labours of the city, exult and long to flutter about, as it were, relieved from care and solicitude.", "3831": "In what I said to Scævola, there- fore, in pleading for Curius, I said only what I thought.", "3832": "‘ For if,' said I, ‘ Scævola, no will shall be properly made but what is of your writing, all of us citizens will come to you with our tablets, and you alone shall write all our wills ;", "3833": "but then,' continued I,' when will you attend to public business ?", "3834": "when to that of your friends ?", "3835": "when to your own ?", "3836": "when, in a word, will you do nothing ?’ adding, ‘ for he does not seem to me to be a free man, who does not sometimes do nothing;", "3837": "' of which opinion, Catulus, I still continue;", "3838": "and, when I come hither, the mere privilege of doing nothing, and of being fairly idle, delights me.", "3839": "As to the third remark which you added, that you are of such a disposition as to think life insipid without these studies, that observation not only does not encourage me to any discussion, but even deters me from it.", "3840": "For as Caius Lucilius, a man of great learning and wit, used to say, that what he wrote he would neither wish to have read by the most illiterate persons, nor by those of the greatest learning, since the one sort understood nothing, and the other perhaps more than himself;", "3841": "to which purpose he also wrote, I do not care to be read by Persius (for he was, as we know, about the most learned of all our countrymen);", "3842": "but I wish to be read by Lœlius Decimus (whom we also knew, a man of worth and of some learning, but nothing to Persius);", "3843": "so I, if I am now to discuss these studies of ours, should not wish to do so before peasants, but much less before you;", "3844": "for I had rather that my talk should not be understood than be censured.", "3845": "\"VII. \" Indeed, Catulus,\" rejoined Cæsar, \" I think I have already gained some profit1 by coming hither;", "3846": "for these reasons for declining a discussion have been to me a very agreeable discussion.", "3847": "But why do we delay Antonius, whose part is, I hear, to give a dissertation upon eloquence in general, and for whom Cotta and Sulpicius have been some time waiting?”", "3848": "\"But I,\" interposed Crassus, \"will neither allow Antonius to speak a word, nor will I utter a syllable myself, unless I first obtain one favour from you.\" \" What is it?\" said Catulus.", "3849": "\"That you spend the day here.\"", "3850": "Then, while Catulus hesitated, because he had promised to go to his brother's house, \" I,\" said Julius, \" will answer for both.", "3851": "We will do so;", "3852": "and you would detain me even in case you were not to say a single word.\"", "3853": "Here Catulus smiled, and said, \" My hesitation then is brought to an end;", "3854": "for I had left no orders at home, and he, at whose house I was to have been, has thus readily engaged us to you, without waiting for my assent.", "3855": "\"They then all turned their eyes upon Antonius, who cried out, \" Be attentive, I say, be attentive, for you shall hear a man from the schools, a man from the professor's chair, deeply versed in Greek learning ;", "3856": "2 and I shall on this account speak with the greater confidence, that Catulus is added to the audience, to whom not only we of the Latin tongue, but even the Greeks themselves, are went to allow refinement and elegance in the Greek language.", "3857": "But since the whole process of speaking, whether it be an art or a business, can be of no avail without the addition of assurance, I will teach you, my scholars, that which I have not learned myself, what I think of every kind of speaking.\"", "3858": "When they all laughed, “ It is a matter that seems to me,\" proceeded he, \" to depend very greatly on talent, but only moderately on art;", "3859": "for art lies in things which are known;", "3860": "but all the pleading of an orator depends not on knowledge, but on opinion;", "3861": "for we both address ourselves to those who are ignorant, and speak of what we do not know ourselves;", "3862": "and consequently our hearers think and judge differently at dif.", "3863": "ferent times concerning the same subjects, and we often take contrary sides, not only so that Crassus sometimes speaks against me, or I against Crassus, when one of us must of necessity advance what is false;", "3864": "but even that each of us, at different times, maintains different opinions on the same question;", "3865": "when more than one of those opinions cannot pos- sibly be right.", "3866": "I will speak, therefore, as on a subject which is of a character to defend falsehood, which rarely arrives at knowledge,1 and which is ready to take advantage of the opinions and even errors of mankind, if you think that there is still reason why you should listen to me.", "3867": "\"VIII. “", "3868": "We think, indeed, that there is very great reason,\" said Catulus, \" and the more so, as you seem resolved to use no ostentation;", "3869": "for you have commenced, not boastfully, but rather, as you think, with truth, than with any fanciful notion of the dignity of your subject.\" \" As I have acknow- ledged then,\" continued Antonius, \" that it is not one of the greatest of arts, so I allow, at the same time, that certain artful directions may be given for moving the feelings and gaining the favour of mankind.", "3870": "If any one thinks proper to say that the knowledge how to do this is a great art, I shall not contradict him;", "3871": "for as many speakers speak upon causes in the forum without due consideration or method, while others, from study, or a certain degree of practice, do their business with more address, there is no doubt, that if any one sets himself to observe what is the cause why some speak better than others, he may discover that cause;", "3872": "and, consequently, he who shall extend such observation over the whole field of eloquence, will find in it, if not an art abso- lutely, yet something resembling an art.", "3873": "And I could wish, that as I seem to see matters as they occur in the forum, and in pleadings, so I could now set them before you just as they are conducted!\"", "3874": "But I must consider my own powers.", "3875": "I now assert only that of which I am convinced, that although oratory is not an art, no excellence is superior to that of a consummate orator.", "3876": "For to say nothing of the advantages of eloquence, which has the highest influence in every well-ordered and free state, there is such delight attendant on the very power of eloquent speaking, that nothing more pleasing can be re- ceived into the ears or understanding of man.", "3877": "What music can be found more sweet than the pronunciation of a well- ordered oration ?", "3878": "What poem more agreeable than the skilful structure of prose ?", "3879": "What actor has ever given greater plea- sure in imitating, than an orator gives in supporting, truth?", "3880": "What penetrates the mind more keenly than an acute and quick succession of arguments?", "3881": "What is more admirable than thoughts illumined by brilliancy of expression?", "3882": "What nearer to perfection than a speech replete with every variety of matter?", "3883": "for there is no subject susceptible of being treated with elegance and effect, that may not fall under the province of the orator.", "3884": "IX.", "3885": "It is his, in giving counsel on important affairs, to deliver his opinion with clearness and dignity;", "3886": "it is his to rouse a people when they are languid, and to calm them when immoderately excited.", "3887": "By the same power of language, the wickedness of mankind is brought to destruction, and virtue to security.", "3888": "Who can exhort to virtue more ardently than the orator?", "3889": "Who reclaim from vice with greater energy?", "3890": "Who can reprove the bad with more aspe- rity, or praise the good with better grace?", "3891": "Who can break the force of unlawful desire by more effective reprehension?", "3892": "Who can alleviate grief with more soothing consolation?", "3893": "By what other voice, too, than that of the orator, is history, the evidence of time, the light of truth, the life of memory, the directress of life, the herald of antiquity, committed to immortality?", "3894": "For if there be any other art, which professes skill in inventing or selecting words;", "3895": "if any one, besides the.", "3896": "orator, is said to form a discourse, and to vary and adorn it with certain distinctions, as it were, of words and thoughts;", "3897": "or if any method of argument, or expression of thought, or distribution and arrangement of matter, is taught, except by this one art, let us confess that either that, of which this art makes profession, is foreign to it, or possessed in common with some other art.", "3898": "But if such method and teaching be confined to this alone, it is not, though professors of other arts may have spoken well, the less on that account the pro- perty of this art;", "3899": "but as an orator can speak best of all men on subjects that belong to other arts, if he makes himself acquainted with them, (as Crassus observed yesterday,) so the- professors of other arts speak more eloquently on their own subjects, if they have acquired any instruction from this art;", "3900": "for if any person versed in agriculture has spoken or written with eloquence on rural affairs, or a physician, as many have done, on diseases, or a painter upon painting, his eloquence is not on that account to be considered as belonging to any of.", "3901": "those arts;", "3902": "although in eloquence, indeed, such is the force of human genius, many men of every class and profession1 attain some proficiency even without instruction;", "3903": "but though you may judge what is peculiar to each art, when you have observed what they severally teach, yet nothing can be more certain than that all other arts can discharge their duties without eloquence, but that an orator cannot even acquire his name without it;", "3904": "so that other men, if they are eloquent, borrow something from him;", "3905": "while he, if he is not supplied from his own stores, cannot obtain the power of speaking from any other art.\"X. Catulus then said, \" Although, Antonius, the course of your remarks ought by no means to be retarded by inter- ruption, yet you will bear with me and grant me pardon;", "3906": "for I cannot help crying out, as he in the Trinummus2 says, so ably do you seem to me to have described the powers of the orator, and so copiously to have extolled them, as the eloquent man, indeed, must necessarily do;", "3907": "he must extol eloquence best of all men;", "3908": "for to praise it he has to employ the very eloquence which he praises.", "3909": "But proceed, for I agree with you, that to speak eloquently is all your own;", "3910": "and that, if any one does so on any other art, he employs an accomplishment borrowed from something else, not peculiar to him, or his own.\" \" The night,\" added Crassus, \" has made you polite to us, Antonius, and humanized you;", "3911": "for in yes- terday's address to us,3 you described the orator as a man that can do only one thing, like a waterman or a porter, as Cæcilius4 says;", "3912": "a fellow void of all learning and politeness.\"", "3913": "\"Why yesterday,\" rejoined Antonius, \"I had made it my object, if I refuted you, to take your scholars from you;", "3914": "5 but now, as Catulus and Cæsar make part of the audience, I think I ought not so much to argue against you, as to declare what I myself think.", "3915": "It follows then, that, as the orator of whom we speak is to be placed in the forum, and in the view of the public, we must consider what employ- ment we are to give him, and to what duties we should wish him to be appointed.", "3916": "For Crassus1 yesterday, when you, Catulus and Cæsar, were not present, made, in a few words, the same statement, in regard to the division of the art, that most of the Greeks have made;", "3917": "not expressing what he himself thought, but what was said by them;", "3918": "that there are two principal sorts of questions about which eloquence is employed;", "3919": "one indefinite, the other definite.", "3920": "He seemed to me to call that indefinite in which the subject of inquiry is general, as, Whether eloquence is desirable;", "3921": "whether honours should be sought;", "3922": "and that definite in which there is an inquiry with respect to particular persons, or any settled and defined point;", "3923": "of which sort are the questions agitated in the forum, and in the causes and disputes of private citizens.", "3924": "These appear to me to consist either in judicial pleadings, or in giving counsel;", "3925": "for that third kind, which was noticed by Crassus, and which, I hear, Aristotle2 himself, who has fully illustrated these subjects, added, is, though it be useful, less necessary.\"", "3926": "\"What kind do you mean?\" said Catulus;", "3927": "\"is it panegyric?", "3928": "for I observe that that is introduced as a third kind.\"XI.", "3929": "\"It is so,\" says Antonius;", "3930": "\"and as to this kind of oratory, I know that I myself, and all who were present, were extremely delighted when your mother Popilias was honoured with a panegyric by you;", "3931": "the first woman, I think, to whom such honour was ever paid in this city.", "3932": "But it does not seem to me that all subjects on which we speak are to be included in art, and made subject to rules;", "3933": "for from those fountains, whence all the ornaments of speech are drawn, we may also take the ornaments of panegyric, without requiring elementary instructions;", "3934": "for who is ignorant, though no one teach him, what qualities are to be com- mended in any person?", "3935": "For if we but look to those things which Crassus has mentioned, in the beginning of the speech which he delivered when censor in opposition to his col- league,4", "3936": "That in those things which are bestowed on mankind by nature or fortune, he could contentedly allow himself to be excelled;", "3937": "but that in whatever men could procure for them- selves, he could not suffer himself to be excelled, he who would pronounce the panegyric of any person, will understand that he must expatiate on the blessings of fortune;", "3938": "and these are advantages of birth, wealth, relationship, friends, resources, health, beauty, strength, talent, and such other qualities as are either personal, or dependent on circumstances;", "3939": "and, if he possessed these, he must show that he made a proper use of them;", "3940": "if.", "3941": "not, that he managed wisely without them;", "3942": "if he lost them, that he bore the loss with resignation;", "3943": "he must then state what he whom he praises did or suffered with wisdom, or with liberality, or with fortitude, or with justice, or with honour, or with piety, or with gratitude, or with humanity, or, in a word, under the influence of any virtue.", "3944": "These particulars, and whatever others are of similar kind, he will easily observe who is inclined to praise any person;", "3945": "and he who is inclined to blame him the contrary.\" “ Why then do you hesitate,\" said Catulus, \" to make' this a third kind, since it is so in the nature of things?", "3946": "for if it is more easy than others, it is not, on that account, to be excluded from the number.\" \"", "3947": "Because I am unwilling,\" replied Antonius, \" to treat of all that falls under the province of an orator, as if nothing, however small it may be, could be uttered without regard to stated rules.", "3948": "Evidence, for in- stance, is often to be given, and sometimes with great exact- ness, as I was obliged to give mine against Sextus Titius, a seditious and turbulent member of the commonwealth ;", "3949": "when, in delivering my evidence, I explained all the proceedings of my consulate, in which I, on behalf of the commonwealth, opposed him as tribune of the people, and exposed all that I thought he had done contrary to the interest of the state;", "3950": "I was detained long, I listened to much, I answered many objections;", "3951": "but would you therefore wish, when you give precepts on eloquence, to add any instructions on giving evidence as a portion of the art of oratory 1\"XII.", "3952": "\"There is, indeed,\" said Catulus, \"no necessity.\"", "3953": "\"Or if (as often happens to the greatest men) communications are to be delivered, either in the senate from a commander in chief, or to such a commander, or from the senate to any king or people, does it appear to you that because, on such subjects, we must use a more accurate sort of language than ordinary, this kind of speaking should be counted as a department of eloquence, and he furnished with peculiar precepts ?” \"", "3954": "By no means,” replied Catulus ;", "3955": "\" for an eloquent man, in speaking on subjects of that sort, will not be at a loss for that talent which he has acquired by practice on other matters and topics.\" \" Those other kinds of subjects, therefore,\" continued Antonius, \" which often require to be treated with eloquence, and which, as I said just now, (when I was praising eloquence,) belong to the orator, have neither any place in the division of the parts of oratory, nor fall under any peculiar kind of rules, and yet must be handled as eloquently as arguments in pleadings;", "3956": "such are reproof, exhortation, consolation, all which demand the finest graces of language;", "3957": "yet these matters need no rules from art.\"", "3958": "\"I am decidedly of that opinion,\" said Catulus. \"", "3959": "Well, then, to proceed,\" said Antonius, \"what sort of orator, or how great a master of language, do you think it requires to write history ?\" \"", "3960": "If to write it as the Greeks have written, a man of the highest powers,\" said Catulus;", "3961": "\" if as our own countrymen, there is no need of an orator;", "3962": "it is sufficient for the writer to tell truth.\"", "3963": "\" But,\" rejoined Antonius, \" that you may not despise those of our own country, the Greeks themselves too wrote at first just like our Cato, and Pictor, and Piso.", "3964": "For history was nothing else but a compilation of annals;", "3965": "and accordingly, for the sake of preserving the memory of public events, the pontifex maximus used to commit to writing the occurrences of every year, from the earliest period of Roman affairs to the time of the pontifex Publius Mucius, and had them engrossed on white tablets, which he set forth as a register in his own house, so that all the people had liberty to inspect it;", "3966": "and these records are yet called the Great Annals.", "3967": "This mode of writing many have adopted, and, without any ornaments of style, have left behind them simple chronicles of times, per- sons, places, and events.", "3968": "Such, therefore, as were Pherecydes, Hellanicus, Acusilas,1 and many others among the Greeks, are Cato, and Pictor, and Piso with us, who neither under- stand how composition is to be adorned (for ornaments of style have been but recently introduced among us), and, pro- vided what they related can be understood, think brevity of expression the only merit.", "3969": "Antipater,1 an excellent man, the friend of Crassus, raised himself a little, and gave history a higher tone ;", "3970": "the others were not embellishers of facts, but mere narrators.", "3971": "\"XIII.", "3972": "\"It is,\" rejoined Catulus, \"as you say;", "3973": "but Anti- pater himself neither diversified his narrative by variety of thoughts, nor polished his style by an apt arrangement of words, or a smooth and equal flow of language, but rough- hewed it as he could, being a man of no learning, and not extremely well qualified for an orator;", "3974": "yet he excelled, as you say, his predecessors.\" \"", "3975": "It is far from being wonderful,” said Antonius, \" if history has not yet made a figure in our language ;", "3976": "for none of our countrymen study eloquence, un- less that it may be displayed in causes and in the forum;", "3977": "whereas among the Greeks, the most eloquent men, wholly unconnected with public pleading, applied themselves as well to other honourable studies as to writing history;", "3978": "for of Herodotus himself, who first embellished this kind of writing, we hear that he was never engaged in pleading;", "3979": "yet his eloquence is so great as to delight me extremely, as far as I can understand Greek writing.", "3980": "After him, in my opinion,.", "3981": "Thucydides has certainly surpassed all historians in the art of composition;", "3982": "for he is so abundant in matter, that he almost equals the number of his words by the number of his thoughts;", "3983": "and he is so happy and judicious in his expressions,2 that you are at a loss to decide whether his facts are set off by his style, or his style by his thoughts;", "3984": "and of him too we do not hear, though he was engaged in public affairs, that he was of the number of those who pleaded causes, and he is said to have written his books at a time when lie was removed from all civil employments, and, as usually happened to every eminent man at Athens, was driven into banishment.", "3985": "He was followed by Philistus1 of Syracuse, who, living in great fami- liarity with the tyrant Dionysius, spent his leisure in writing history, and, as I think, principally imitated Thucydides But afterwards, two men of great genius, Theopompus and Ephorus, coming from what we may call the noblest school of rhetoric, applied themselves to history by the persuasion of their master Isocrates, and never attended to pleading at all.", "3986": "XIV.", "3987": "At last historians arose also among the philosophers;", "3988": "first Xenophon, the follower of Socrates, and afterwards Calli- sthenes, the pupil of Aristotle and companion of Alexander.", "3989": "The latter wrote in an almost rhetorical manner;", "3990": "the former used a milder strain of language, which

learned, and abounding most with richness of matter and variety of thought, and not unpolished in style, brought a large store of eloquence to this kind of writing, but no experience in plead- ing

pleadings or political debates, to which he that will may add panegyrics;", "4028": "the other, what all authors term, (though none give any explanation,) questions unlimited in their kind, with- out

a task, to refuse to speak on mathematical and musical subjects.", "4032": "In short, for him who professes it to be his business to speak not only on those questions which are confined to certain times and persons, (that is, on all judicial questions,) but also on such as are unlimited in their kinds, there can be no subject for oratory to which he can take exception.", "4033": "XVI. \"",

duty, and of other virtues and their opposite vices, as well as on state affairs, on government, on military matters, on civil polity, on morality;", "4036": "let us take upon us that sort of subjects

in general, every thing that concerns habits of life, administration of public affairs, civil society, the common sense of mankind, the law of nature, and moral duties, falls within the province of an

painting other quadrupeds;", "4044": "(for there is indeed no art whatever, in which everything capable of being effected by it is taught by the master;", "4045": "but they who have learned the

from practice only, he who has acquired such ability, that he can, at his pleasure, influence the understandings of those who listen to him with some power of deciding, on questions concerning public matters, or his own private affairs, or con- cerning those for or against whom he speaks, will, on every other kind of oratorical subject, be no more at a loss what to say than the famous Polycletus,

strangers, we cannot regard them as strangers, if we wish to be thought honest men ourselves.", "4669": "But, as I said, that this may not appear surprising in us, what can be more fictitious than poetry, than theatrical representations, than the argument of a play ?", "4670": "Yet on the stage I myself have often observed the eyes of the actor through his mask appear inflamed with fury, while he was repeating these verses,1 Have you, then, dared to separate him from you,' Or enter Salamis without your brother ?", "4671": "And dreaded not your father's countenance ?", "4672": "He never

Manius Aquilius, by my efforts, was to be main- tained in his rights as a citizen, did that which I did in the peroration of that cause, without a strong feeling.", "4681": "For when I saw him whom I remembered to have been consul, and, as a general honoured by the senate, to have marched up to the Capitol with the pomp of an ovation, afflicted, dejected, sor- rowful, reduced to the last extremity

subject through all the changes of circumstances in our commonwealth;", "4702": "and I concluded by observing, that though all seditions had ever been attended with troubles, yet that some had been supported by justice, and almost by necessity.", "4703": "I then dwelt on those topics which Crassus just now men- tioned, that neither could kings have been expelled from this city, nor tribunes of the people have been created, nor the consular power have been so often diminished by votes of the commonalty, nor the right of appeal, that patroness of the state and guardian of our liberty, have been granted to the Roman people, without disagreement with the nobility;", "4704": "and if those seditions had been of advantage to the republic, it should not immediately, if any commotion had been

provoked (and I showed that it had been often allowed), no occasion was ever more just than that of which I was speaking.", "4706": "I then gave another turn to my speech, and directed it to the condemnation of Cæpio's flight, and lamentation for the loss of the army.", "4707": "By this diversion I made the grief of those to flow afresh who were- mourning for their friends, and re-excited the

pleading for a man intimately con- nected with you, and your own quæstor, how quickly did you secure your way to a fair audience!", "4728": "But lo!", "4729": "when I thought that you had reaped no other benefit than that the hearers would think they ought to excuse you for defending a pernicious citizen, on account of the ties of union betwixt you, you began to proceed gradually and tacitly, while others had as yet no suspicion of your designs, though I myself felt some apprehension, to maintain in your defence that what had happened was not sedition in Norbanus, but resentment on the part of the Roman people, resentment not excited unjustly, but deservedly, and in conformity with their duty.", "4730": "In the next place, what argument did you omit against Cæpio ?", "4731": "How

have taught me to discern by what means the minds of men are to be moved.", "4738": "LI. \"", "4739": "The first thing I generally consider is, whether the cause requires that the minds of the audience should be excited;", "4740": "for such fiery oratory is not to be exerted on trivial subjects, nor when the minds of men are so affected that we can do nothing by eloquence to influence their opinions, lest we be thought to deserve ridicule or dislike, if we either act tragedies about trifles or endeavour to pluck up what cannot be moved.", "4741": "For as the feelings on which we have to work in the minds of the judges, or whoever they may be before whom we may plead, are love, hatred, anger, envy, pity, hope, joy, fear, anxiety, we are sensible that love may be gained if you seem to advocate what is advantageous to the persons before whom you are speaking;", "4742": "or if you appear to exert yourself in behalf of good men, or at least for such as are good and serviceable to them;", "4743": "for the latter case more en- gages favour, the former, the defence of virtue, esteem;", "4744": "and if a hope of future advantage is proposed, it has a greater effect than the mention of past benefits.", "4745": "You must endea- vour to show that in the cause which you defend, either their dignity or advantage is concerned;", "4746": "and you should signify that he for whom you solicit their love has referred nothing to his own private benefit, and done nothing at all for his own sake;", "4747": "for dislike is felt for the selfish gains of individuals, while favour is shown to their desires to serve others.", "4748": "But we must take care, while we are on this topic, not to appear to extol the merit and glory of those whom we would wish to be esteemed for their good deeds, too highly, as these qualities are usually the greatest objects of envy.", "4749": "From these considerations, too, we shall learn how to draw hatred on our adversaries, and to avert it from ourselves and our friends.", "4750": "The same means are to be used, also, either to excite or allay anger;", "4751": "for if you exaggerate every fact that is hurtful or disadvantageous to the audience, their hatred is excited;", "4752": "but if anything of the kind is thrown out against men' of worth, or against characters on whom no one ought to cast any reflection, or against the public, there is then produced, if not so violent a degree of hatred, at least an unfavourable feeling, or displeasure near akin to hatred.", "4753": "Fear is also inculcated either from people's own dangers or those of the public.", "4754": "Per- sonal fear affects men more deeply;", "4755": "but that which is common to all is to be treated by the orator as having similar influence.", "4756": "LII.",

others have outstripped them;", "4761": "but there is often a strong unfavourable feeling towards superiors, which is the stronger if they are intolerably arrogant, and transgress the fair bounds of com- mon justice through super-eminence in dignity or fortune.", "4762": "It such advantages are to be made instruments to kindle dislike,1 the chief thing to be said is,' that they are not the acquisitions of virtue, that they have even been gained perhaps by vice and crime;", "4763": "and that, however honourable or imposing they may appear, no merit was ever carried so high as the insolence of mankind and their contumelious disdain.'", "4764": "To allay envy, it may be observed, ' that such advantages have been gained by extreme toil and imminent perils;", "4765": "that they have not been applied to the individual's own private benefit, but that of others;", "4766": "that he himself, if he appear to have gained any glory, although it might not be an undue reward for danger, was not elated with it, but wholly set it aside and undervalued it;", "4767": "' and such an effect must by all means be produced (since most men are envious, and it is a most common and prevalent vice, and envy is felt towards all super-eminent and flourishing fortune), that the opinion entertained of such characters be lowered, and that their fortunes, so excellent in people's imaginations-, may appear mingled with labour and trouble.\"", "4768": "Pity is excited, if he who hears can be induced to apply to his own circumstances those unhappy particulars which are lamented

submissive strain, so this, which is adopted by the orator to effect a change in the minds of the audience, and to work upon them in every way, should be vehement and energetic.", "4772": "LIII. \"",

communicate a warmth to our gentleness of language;", "4776": "nor is there any species of eloquence better tempered than that in which the asperity of contention in the orator is mitigated by his humanity, or in which the relaxed tone of lenity is sustained by a becoming gravity and, energy.", "4777": "But in both modes of speaking, as well that in which spirit and force are required as that which is brought down to ordinary life and manners, the beginning should be slow, but the sequel full and diffuse.", "4778": "1", "4779": "For you must not spring at once into the pathetic portion of your speech, as it forms no part of the question, and men are first desirous to learn the very point that is to come under their judgment;", "4780": "nor, when you have entered upon that track, are ypu suddenly to di- verge from it;", "4781": "for you are not to suppose that as an argument is understood as soon as it is stated, and a second and a third are then desired, so you can with the same ease move com- passion, or envy, or anger, as soon as you make the attempt.", "4782": "2", "4783": "Reason itself confirms an argument which fixes itself in the mind as soon as it is delivered;",

copiousness of lan- guage, and a proportionate energy of delivery.", "4785": "Those, there- fore, who speak either with brevity, or in a low submissive strain, may indeed inform the judge, but can

observation could , make men eloquent, who would not be so?", "4893": "For who could not learn these particulars, if not with ease, at least in some way ?", "4894": "But I think that of such precepts, the use and advan- tage is, not that we may be directed by art to find out what we are to say, but that we may either feel certain as to what we attain by natural parts, by study, or by exercise, that it is right, or understand that it is wrong, having been in- structed to what rule the several particulars are to be referred.", "4895": "I, therefore, also join in the petition to you, Cæsar, that you would, if it is agreeable to you, tell us what you think on jocoseness in general, lest, by accident, any part of eloquence, since that is your object, should appear to have been passed over in so learned an assembly, and such a studied con- versation.\"", "4896": "\"Well, then, Crassus,\" replied Cæsar, \"since you require payment from a guest, I will, by refusing it, furnish you with a pretext for refusing to entertain us again;", "4897": "though I am often astonished at the impudence of those who act upon the stage while Roscius is a spectator of their attitudes;", "4898": "for who

"Whether it becomes the orator to wish to excite laughter;", "4913": "' a fourth, 'To what degree;", "4914": "' a fifth, ' What are the several kinds of the ridiculous?'", "4915": "As to the first, ' What laughter itself is,' by what means it is excited, where it lies, how it arises, and bursts forth so suddenly that we are unable, though we desire, to restrain it, and how it affects at once the sides, the face, the veins, the countenance, the eyes, let Democritus consider;", "4916": "for all this has nothing to do with my remarks, and if it had to do with them, I should not be ashamed to say that I am ignorant of that which not even they understand who profess to explain it.", "4917": "But the seat and as it were province of what is laughed at, (for that is the next point of inquiry,) lies in a certain offensiveness and deformity;", "4918": "for those sayings are laughed at solely or chiefly which point out and designate something offensive in an inoffensive manner.", "4919": "But, to come to the third point, it certainly becomes the orator to excite laughter;", "4920": "either because mirth itself attracts favour to him by whom it is raised;", "4921": "or because all admire wit, which is often comprised in a single word, especially in him who replies, and sometimes in him who attacks;", "4922": "or because it overthrows the adversary, or hampers him, or makes light of him, or discourages, or refutes him;", "4923": "or because it proves the orator himself to be a man of taste, or learning, or polish;", "4924": "but chiefly because it mitigates and relaxes gravity and severity, and often, by a joke or a laugh, breaks the force of offensive remarks, which cannot easily be overthrown by arguments.", "4925": "But to what degree the laughable should be carried by the orator requires very dill- gent consideration;", "4926": "a point which we placed as the fourth subject of inquiry;", "4927": "for neither great vice, such as is united with crime, nor great misery, is a subject for ridicule and laughter;", "4928": "since people will have those guilty of enormous crimes attacked with more forcible weapons than ridicule;", "4929": "and do not like the miserable to be derided, unless perhaps when they are insolent;", "4930": "and you must be considerate, too, of the feelings of mankind, lest you rashly speak against those who are.", "4931":

esteem, nor in calamitous circumstances, and who do not appear deserving to be dragged to punishment for their crimes;", "4936": "such topics nicely managed create laughter.", "4937": "In deformity, also, and bodily defects, is found fair enough matter for ridicule;", "4938": "but we have to ask the same question here as is asked on other points, ' How far the ridicule maybe carried?'", "4939":

become either buf- foonery or mimicry;", "4940": "qualities of which we shall better under- stand the nature when we come to consider the different species of the ridiculous.", "4941": "\"There are two sorts of jokes, one of which is excited by things, the other by words.", "4942": "By things, whenever any matter is told in the way of a story;", "4943": "as you, Crassus, formerly stated in a

imitation, that the audience may conceive more than they can see represented by him;", "4961": "he ought also to give - proof of ingenuousness and modesty, by avoiding everything offensive or unbecoming in word or act.", "4962": "LX. \"", "4963": "These, therefore, are the two kinds of the ridiculous which is drawn from things;", "4964": "and they suit well with con- tinuous pieces of humour, in which the manners of mankind are so described and expressed, that, either by means of some narrative, their character is exactly understood, or, by throw- ing in a little mimicry, they may be convicted of some- impropriety remarkable enough for ridicule.", "4965": "But in words,.", "4966": "the ridiculous is that which is excited by the point of a par- ticular expression or thought:", "4967": "but as, in the former kind, both in narration and imitation, all resemblance to the players of pantomime should be avoided, so, in this, all scurrilous buffoonery is to be studiously shunned

exciting the passions, is often advantageous.", "5378": "Since, after the statement of the case has been made, an oppor- tunity often presents itself of making a digression to rouse the feelings of

destruction, I will not undertake in this discourse more than that which is imposed upon me;", "5775": "I will only signify briefly, that neither can embellishments of language be found without

no longer supported by the talents, the wisdom, and the authority of law,—the only weapons which I have earned to wield, and to which I have long been accustomed, and which are most suitable to the character of an illustrious citizen, and of a virtuous and well-regulated state.", "6941": "But if there ever was a time when the authority and eloquence of an honest individual could have wrested their arms from the hands of his distracted fellow-citizens, it was then when the proposal of a compromise of our mutual differences was rejected, by the hasty imprudence of some and the timorous mistrust of others.", "6942": "Thus it happened, among other mis- fortunes of a more deplorable nature, that when my declining age, after a life spent in the service of the public, should have reposed in the peaceful harbour, not of an indolent and total inactivity, but of a moderate and honourable retirement, and when my eloquence was properly mellowed and had acquired its full maturity;", "6943":

relief to me, when we lately happened to mention them in the course of conversation.", "6946": "III.", "6947": "For, not long ago, when I was walking for my amuse- ment in a private avenue at home, I was agreeably interrupted by my friend Brutus and Titus Pomponius, who came, as indeed they frequently did, to visit me,—two worthy citizens, who were united to each other in the closest friendship,

Indeed,\" said I, \" your company is a present remedy for my sorrow;", "6953": "and your letters, when absent, were so encouraging, that they first revived my attention to my studies.\" \" I remember,\" replied Atticus, \" that Brutus sent you a letter from Asia, which I read with infinite pleasure;", "6954": "for he advised you in it like a man of sense, and gave you every consolation which the warmest friendship could suggest.\"", "6955": "\" True,\" said I;", "6956": "\" for it was the receipt of that letter which recovered me from a growing indisposition, to behold once more the cheerful face of day;", "6957": "and as the Roman state, after the dreadful defeat near Cannæ, first raised its drooping head by the victory of Marcellus at Nola, which was succeeded by many other victories, so, after the dismal wreck of our affairs, both public and private, nothing occurred to me, before the letter of my friend Brutus, which I thought to be worth my attention, or which contributed, in any degree, to ease the anxiety of my heart.\" \"", "6958": "That was certainly my intention,\" answered Brutus;", "6959": "\" and if I had the happiness to succeed, I was sufficiently

Atticus, \" I shall expect the fulfilment of your promise;", "6979": "but I shall not insist upon it till it suits your convenience, though, after all, I shall certainly be better pleased if you discharge the obligation.\" \"", "6980": "And I also,\" said Brutus, \" shall expect that you perform your promise to my friend Atticus;", "6981": "nay, though I am only his voluntary solicitor, I

ardent desire to hear the whole of it from your own mouth.", "6993": "Knowing you, there- fore, to be at leisure, we have taken the present opportunity to wait upon you;", "6994": "so that, if it is really convenient, you will oblige us both by resuming the subject.\" \" Well, gentlemen,\" said I, \" as you are so pressing, I will endeavour to satisfy you in the best manner I am able.\" \" You

dignity.\"", "6998": "VI.", "6999": "\"True,\" replied he;", "7000": "\" and you took occasion, from the ill-success of Brutus, to lament the loss of a fair administration of justice in the forum.\"

industry will find a theatre to display themselves.", "7002": "For after you had thoroughly improved your abilities, by pleading a variety of important causes, and when my declining vigour was just giving way and lowering the ensigns of dignity to your more active talents, the liberty of the state received a fatal overthrow, and that eloquence, of which we are now to give the history, was condemned to per- petual silence.\" \" Our other misfortuues,\" replied Brutus, \" I lament sincerely, and I think I ought to lament them;", "7003": "but as to eloquence, I am not so fond of the influence and the glory it bestows, as of the study and the practice of it, which nothing can deprive me of, while you are so well disposed to assist me;", "7004": "for no man can be an eloquent speaker who has not a clear and ready conception.", "7005": "Whoever, therefore, applies himself to the study of eloquence, is at the same time im- proving his judgment, which is a talent equally necessary in all military operations.\" \" Your remark,\" said I, \" is very just;", "7006": "and I have a higher opinion of the merit of eloquence, because, though there is scarcely any person so diffident as not to persuade himself that he either has or may acquire every other accomplishment which formerly could have given him consequence in the state, I can find no person who has been made an orator by the success of his military prowess.", "7007": "But that we may carry on the conversation with greater ease, let us seat ourselves.\"", "7008": "As my visitors had no objection to this, we accordingly took our seats in a private lawn, near a statue of Plato.", "7009": "Then resuming the conversation,—\" To recommend the study of'eloquence,\" said I, \" and describe its force, and the

excited against the Patricians by the tyrannical government of the Decemviri, reconciled the people to the senate by his prudent laws and conciliatory speeches.", "7150": "We may likewise suppose,

the Comitia contrary to law, refusing to admit any consul of plebeian rank, prevailed upon the senate to protest against the conduct of his antagonist;", "7155": "which, if we consider that the Mænian

sacrifice in the proper habit of his office, (for he was also a Flamen Carmentalis,) hearing of the mutiny and insurrection of the people against the senate, - rushed immediately into the midst of the assembly, covered as he was with his sacerdotal robes, and quelled the sedition by his authority and the force of his elocution.", "7157": "I do not pretend to have historical evidence that the

client, that the prose- cutor, while he charged him with a design against his life, and assured us that he had the most indubitable proofs of it then in his hands, related his story with as much ease, and as much calmness and indifference, as if nothing had happened.", "8589": "‘Would it have been possible,' said I, (addressing myself to Calidius,) ‘that you should speak with this air of unconcern,

pathetic language even from men of the dullest capa- cities?", "8593": "There was no visible disorder in your mind, no emotion in your looks and gesture, no smiting of the thigh or the forehead, nor even a single stamp of the foot.", "8594": "You were, therefore, so far from interesting our feelings in your favour, that we could scarcely keep our eyes open, while you were relating the dangers you

received but little instruction from the professed masters of the art, nature had furnished him with an admirable capa- city for the practice of it.", "8606": "I never, indeed, discovered in him any great degree of application;", "8607": "but he was certainly very ambitious to distinguish himself;", "8608": "and if he had continued to listen to my advice, as he had begun to do, he would have preferred the acquisition of real honour to that of untimely grandeur.\", \" What do you mean ?” said Brutus;", "8609": "\" or in what manner are these two objects to be distinguished ?” \" I dis- tinguish them thus,\" replied I;", "8610": "“as honour is the reward of virtue, conferred upon a man by the choice and affection of his fellow-citizens, he who obtains it by their free votes and suffrages is to be considered, in my opinion, as an honourable member of the community.", "8611": "But he who acquires his power and authority by taking advantage of every unhappy incident, and without the consent of his fellow-citizens, as Curio aimed to do, acquires only the name of honour, without the sub- stance.", "8612": "Whereas, if he had hearkened to me, he would have risen to the highest dignity, in an honourable manner, and with the hearty approbation of all men, by a gradual advance- ment to public offices, as his father and many other eminent citizens had done before.",

that as the truest path to honour which had been already marked out to him by the example of his ancestors.", "8615": "For he had been extremely well educated, and was perfectly versed in every branch of polite literature;", "8616": "he had likewise a penetrating genius, and an elegant variety of expression;", "8617": "and appeared grave and sententious without arrogance, and modest and diffident without dejection.", "8618": "But, like many other young men, he was carried away by the tide of ambition;", "8619": "and after serving a short time with reputation as a volunteer, nothing could satisfy him but to try his for- tune as a general, an employment which was confined by the wisdom of our ancestors to men who had arrived at a certain age, and who, even then, were obliged to submit their pre- tensions to the uncertain issue of a public decision.", "8620": "Thus, by exposing himself to a fatal catastrophe, while he was endea- vouring to rival the fame of Cyrus and Alexander, who

mentioned, an orator who had received more literary improvements than Curio, and had a more accurate and delicate manner of speak- ing, which he conducted with great taste and elegance ;", "8623":

"Überdies habe ich dir in einem früheren Briefe Punkt für Punkt und eingehend mitgeteilt, wie es mit der Ableitung des Wassers und dem Wege daselbst steht.", "1151": "Was mich aber besorgt macht und in hohem Grade beängstigt, ist das, daß seit mehr als fünfzig Tagen von dir, von Cäsar, ja überhaupt aus eurer Gegend keine Zeile, ja nicht ein­ mal das mindeste Gerücht an mich gelangt ist.", "1152": "Es flößt mir jetzt das dortige Meer und Land in gleicher Weise Besorgnis ein, und ich muß unaufhörlich, wie es geht, wenn man jemand gern hat, gerade an das denken, was mir am wenigsten erwünscht ist.", "1153": "Deshalb bitte ich dich jetzt nicht, mir zu schreiben, wie es dir geht und wie es mit euern Angelegenheiten steht — denn darüber berichtest du ja immer, wenn es dir möglich ist — sondern ich will dir bloß sagen, daß ich nicht leicht jemals auf etwas so sehnlich gewartet habe, als in dem Augen­ blick, da ich dieses schreibe, nur überhaupt auf einen Brief von dir.Laß dir nun sagen, wie es in unserem öffentlichen Leben steht.", "1154": "Die Tage, an denen Wahlversammlung stattfinden sollte, werden jedesmal wieder durch religiöse Einsprachen für unzulässig erklärt, was den Wohlgesinnten insgesamt ganz erwünscht ist, weil man die Konsuln im Verdacht hat, sie haben sich von den Bewerbern um das Konsulat Belohnungen ausbedungen, und man sie deswegen haßt.", "1155": "Der

wissenschaftlicher.", "1178": "Darum will ich zwar dem Unterrichtsgange deines Sohnes an der Hand dieses Lehrers nicht in den Weg treten, wie denn auch der Zunge selbst an dessen deklamatorischer Methode mehr Geschmack und Lust zu finden scheint;", "1179": "und weil ich ja selbst seiner Zeit diese Wege einschlug, will ich ihn dieselben gehen lassen, in der zuversichtlichen Hoffnung, daß er einmal das gleiche Ziel erreicht;", "1180": "aber doch werde ich ihn, wenn ich ihn einmal irgendwohin aufs Land mitnehme, in die mir gewohnte Art einweihen.", "1181": "Ist mir ja doch von dir ein

„Hingebung\" mir für das, was du um mich verdient hast, noch zu wenig zu besagen scheint?", "1189": "Wenn aber dein Schreiben von Dank für meine Bemühungen um dich spricht, so ist es nur ein Übermaß von Liebe, was dich dankbar sein läßt für Dinge, die ich nicht unterlassen könnte, ohne das schnödeste Unrecht zu begehen.", "1190": "Übrigens würde dir meine Gesinnung gegen dich noch weit bekannter und einleuchtender sein, wenn wir beide während der Zeit, wo wir getrennt waren, beisammen und in Rom gewesen wären.", "1191": "Denn gerade auf dem Felde, auf dem du nach deiner Aussage thätig sein willst, wie du es denn vor anderen verstehst und lch's von dir in hohem Grad erwarte, bei den Abstimmungen im Senat und über­ haupt in der politischen Thätigkeit würden wir eine glänzende Rolle gespielt haben.", "1192": "Doch wie ich hierüber denke und welche Stellung ich einnehme, will ich gleich nachher bei Beantwortung deiner Anfragen auseinandersetzen.", "1193": "So sehr es mich indes, wie billig, um deinetwillen freut, daß du Imperator bist und deine Provinz nach glücklichen Waffenthaten an der Spitze eines siegreichen Heeres behauptest, so ist doch so viel gewiß, ich würde an dir den innigst befreundeten, ein­ sichtsvollsten Führer und gleichermaßen du an mir einen vielleicht nicht ganz unerfahrenen, jedenfalls aber einen treuen und wohlmeinen­ den Ratgeber gehabt haben.", "1194": "Und ebenso gewiß hättest du bei unmittel­ barer Anwesenheit die Vorteile, die du mit Recht von mir erwartest, in reichlicherem Maße und in mehr unmittelbarer Weise genießen können.", "1195": "Namentlich wo es gälte, sich an denen zu rächen, die, wie du weißt, dir einesteils wegen deiner mutigen Verteidigung meines Wohlergehens feind sind, andernteils dich um den Glanz und Ruhm deiner damaligen Thätigkeit beneiden, hätte ich mich als ausgezeichneten Geleitsmann für dich bewiesen.", "1196": "Allerdings einer dieser Leute, jener ewige Feind seiner Freunde, dem du mit der größten Güte zu seiner hohen Stellung verholfen hast und der dann doch seine nun völlig gebrochene Macht gerade gegen dich gekehrt hat, hat uns diese Mühe erspart und selbst Rache an sich genommen, sofern er Schritte gewagt hat, deren Ent­ deckung ihn für die Zukunft nicht allein seiner politischen Bedeutung, sondern sogar aller persönlichen Freiheit verlustig gemacht hat.", "1197": "Dir hätte ich es zwar gönnen mögen, daß du, statt nun auch im eigenen Leben, nur an meinem Schicksale die Erfahrung gemacht hättest, was von der Treue der Menschen zu halten sei;", "1198": "aber doch freut es mich bei allem Verdrusse, daß du diese Erfahrung mit geringeren Opfern und nicht mit so großem Kummer, wie ich, hast erkaufen dürfen.", "1199": "Über dieses ganze Verhältnis mich auszusprechen, scheint mir jetzt eine gute Gelegenheit geboten zu sein, da ich dir deine Anfragen zu beantworten habe.Du schreibst, aus Briefen habest du erfahren, daß ich mit Cäsar und Appius in gutem Vernehmen stehe, und fügst bei, daß du es nicht tadeln könnest.", "1200": "Dagegen gibst du zu verstehen, du möchtest er­ fahren, was mich bestimmt habe, den Verteidiger und Fürsprecher des Vatinius zu machen.", "1201": "Um dir dies vollständig auseinanderzusetzen, muß ich notwendig etwas weiter ausholen und mich über die Grund­ sätze meines politischen Verfahrens überhaupt aussprechen.", "1202": "Lieber Le'ntulus, im Anfang deiner Thätigkeit für mich glaubte ich, mit meiner Zurückberufung sei ich nicht allein den Meinigen, sondern auch der Republik wiedergeschenkt, und dachte, neben der grenzenlosen Liebe und der ganz besonderen Ergebenheit, zu der ich im vollsten Umfang gegen deine Person verpflichtet war, sei ich auch der republikanischen Partei, die dich bei meiner Zurückberufung so wesentlich unterstützt hatte, verdientermaßen jedenfalls die Gesinnung schuldig, die ich gegen sie schonvorher, nicht einer besonderen persönlichen Verbindlichkeit wegen, sondern nur eben gemäß meiner allgemeinen Bürgerpflicht bethätigt hatte.", "1203": "Daß das meine Gesinnung war, hat der Senat während deiner Amtsführung als Konsul aus meinem Munde vernommen, und davon hast auch du dich aus unseren Gesprächen und 5 Unterredungen überzeugt.", "1204": "Zwar fühlte ich mich schon in jenen ersten Zeiten durch manches innerlich verletzt, als ich, während deiner Be­ mühungen für weitere Herstellung meiner Ehre, bei einigen entweder versteckten Haß oder eine Ergebenheit von sehr zurückhaltender Art wahrnehmen mußte.", "1205": "Denn als es sich darum handelte, mir die Ehren­ denkmäler zu stiften, und ebenso nachdem ich nebst meinem Bruder mit frevelhafter Gewaltthat aus meinem Hause getrieben worden war, haben dir die Leute, deren Schuldigkeit es gewesen wäre, nicht zur seite gestanden;", "1206": "ja, sie haben wahrlich selbst in Ansehung der Dinge, die — so notwendig sie auch bei der gänzlichen Zerrüttung meines Vermögens für mich waren — doch am wenigsten von mir in Anschlag gebracht wurden, ich meine bei dem durch den Senat verfügten Schadenersatz gar nicht den guten Willen gezeigt, den ich erwartet hatte.", "1207": "Dennoch, ob ich gleich solches erleben mußte — denn es war deutlich genug zu sehen —, statt bitter zu werden über das, was mir widerfuhr, blieb ich dankbar für das, was sie mir gethan hatten.", "1208": "Daher blieb ich auch Pompejus gegenüber ohne Rücksicht auf seine Absichten durchweg meinen früheren politischen Grundsätzen getreu, soviel ich ihm auch, wie du selbst es gerühmt und bezeugt hast, zu danken hatte, und trotz aller Achtung, die ich nicht bloß aus Dankbarkeit, sondern auch aus persönlicher Zuneigung und gewissermaßen aus unwandelbarer Über­ zeugung für ihn hegte.", "1209": "Ich war es, der im Beisein des Cnejus Pom- pejus — er war in die Stadt gekommen und saß als Fürsprecher des PubliusSe'stius da — auf die Äußerung des Zeugen Vatinius, das außerordentliche Glück des Gajus Cäsar mache mich nachgerade zu dessen Freunde, erklärte „ich zöge das Los des Bi'bulus, das er für unglücklich halte, den Triumphen und Siegen aller anderen vor\", und der auch dem nämlichen Zeugen bei einer andern Veranlassung sagte, ganz dieselben Leute, durch die dem Bibulus verwehrt worden sei, sein Haus zu verlassen, seien es gewesen, die mich aus der Stadt genötigt hätten;", "1210": "vollends meine ganze Fragestellung an Vatinius ent­ hielt nichts als eine Rüge des damaligen Tribunats, und man kann nicht freimütiger und mutvoller sprechen, als wie ich mich damals über Gewaltthat und Mißachtung der Auspizien, über Verschenkung ganzer Königreiche vernehmen ließ.", "1211": "Und so war meine Haltung nicht allein in diesem Falle, sondern oft auch ebenso entschieden im Senat.", "1212": "Za, unter dem Konsulate des Marcelli'nus und Phi li'ppus war es mein Antrag, auf den am 5.", "1213": "April der Senat einging, daß die Angelegenheit mit den kampanischen Ländereien in voller Senatssitzung am 15.", "1214": "Mai wieder solle in Beratung gebracht werden.", "1215": "Hätte ich einen stärkeren Angriff auf das Hauptbollwerk jener Partei machen, entschiedener das Andenken an meine Unglückszeiten verleugnen und meiner früheren Politik mich getreu zeigen können?", "1216": "Mein damaliger Antrag brachte eine gewaltige Aufregung hervor, nicht bloß bei denen, welchen er natürlicher Weise anstößig sein mußte, sondern auch bei der Partei, von der ich's niemals erwartet hätte.", "1217": "Als nämlich der Senat in der von mir vorgeschlagenen Richtung einen Beschluß gefaßt hatte, reiste Pompejus, ohne mir die geringste Empfindlichkeit zu erkennen zu geben, nach Sardinien und Afrika ab und kam unterwegs mit Cäsar in Lu'ca zusammen.", "1218": "Cäsar beschwerte sich dabei sehr über meinen Antrag, da er schon zuvor zu Ravenna auch den Crassus gesprochen hatte und von diesem gegen mich aufgereizt worden war.", "1219": "Daß Pompejus die Sache ungern sähe, war allgemein bekannt, und wurde mir, wie ich es schon von anderen gehört hatte, durch meinen Bruder bestätigt.", "1220": "Gegen diesen that nämlich Pompejus, als er wenige Tage nach seiner Abreise von Luca mit ihm in Sardinien zusammenkam, die Äußerung:", "1221": "„Dich eben wünschte ich zu sehen;", "1222": "nichts hätte mir gelegener kommen können;", "1223": "wenn du nicht deinem Bruder Marcus ernstliche Vorstellungen machst, so mußt du mir für das einstehen, was du mir in seinem Namen zu­ gesagt hast.\"", "1224": "Kurz, er erhob schwere Klagen, erwähnte seine Verdienste, rief ihm wieder ins Gedächtnis, was er zum öftesten über die Schritte Cäsars mit ihm, meinem Bruder, verhandelt und welche Versprechungen dieser in betreff meiner gegeben habe;", "1225": "Quintus müsse es selbst be­ zeugen, daß er, Pompejus, alle Schritte, die er zu meinem Besten gethan, mit Cäsars Zustimmung gethan habe;", "1226": "endlich bat er ihn, mir die Rücksicht auf Cäsars Sache und Ehre ans Herz zu legen;", "1227": "wenn ich sie nicht verteidigen wollte oder könnte, solle ich doch nicht dagegen auftreten.", "1228": "Mein Bruder teilte mir diese Äußerungen mit, und Pom­ pejus schickte noch außerdem den Vibu'llius zu mir, mit dem aus­ drücklichen Auftrag, ich solle mir in der kampanischen Angelegenheit bis zu seiner Zurückkunft freie Hand zu behalten suchen.", "1229": "Nach allem diesem ging ich ernstlich mit mir zu Rate, was zu thun sei, und trat, sozusagen, mit der Republik selbst in Unterhandlung, daß sie mir, der ich so vieles für sie gethan und gelitten habe, erlauben möchte, nun auch den Anforderungen zu genügen, welche die Pflicht der Dankbarkeit gegen meine Wohlthäter und das von meinem Bruder gegebene Wort an mich machen;", "1230": "sie möge es sich gefallen lassen, daß der Mann, an welchem sie stets einen guten Bürger gehabt habe, nun auch ein ehrlicher Mensch sein dürfe.Während ich aber mit allen diesen meinen Schritten und An­ trägen sichtlich bei Pompejus anstieß, mußte ich mir sagen lassen, daß gewisse Leute, die du dir jetzt schon mußt denken können und welche, wie sonst immer, so auch damals die von mir befolgten politischen Grundsätze teilten, dessenungeachtet sich äußerten, es freue sie, daß ich den Pompejus nicht zufriedenstelle und mich mit Cäsar aufs äußerste verfeinden werde.", "1231": "Das mußte mich schmerzen, aber noch weit mehr der Umstand, daß sie meinen Feind — doch was sage ich meinen? nein der Gesetze, der Gerichte, der Ruhe, des Vaterlands und aller Patrioten Feind — mit solcher Liebe umfingen, auf den Händen trugen und vor meinen Augen in einer Weise herzten und hätschelten, daß mir zwar nicht die Galle überlief — denn über das bin ich völlig hinaus —, wohl aber sie diesen Zweck zu erreichen meinten.", "1232": "Da faßte ich, mit möglichster Nüchternheit und Umsicht, meine ganze Lage ins Auge, zog meine Rechnung und kam mit allen meinen Überlegungen auf ein Resultat, das ich dir nun, wenn ich's im stände sein werde, in kurzem auseinandersetzen will.Würde ich den Staat in den Händen von schlechten, verkommenen Bürgern sehen, wie wir dies selbst erlebt und was laut der Geschichte auch sonst schon der Fall war, so könnte man ebensowenig die Aus­ sicht auf Vorteile, die für mich nicht den geringsten Wert haben, als selbst irgendwelche Gefahr, was doch auch auf die tapfersten Männer Eindruck macht, dazu bringen, mich an sie anzuschließen, wie groß auch immer wirklich ihre Verdienste um mich wären.", "1233": "Nun aber, da an der Spitze des Staates Pompejus steht, ein Mann, der seine gegen­ wärtige Macht und seinen Ruhm den größten Verdiensten um das Vaterland und den ausgezeichnetsten Thaten verdankt und dessen hohe Stellung ich von Jugend auf gern gesehen, als Prätor und Konsul sogar thatsächlich gefördert habe, und da er zugleich durch seinen Ein­ fluß und seine Stimme für sich allein und in Gemeinschaft mit dir durch Rat und That für mich gewirkt, auch unter der Bürgerschaft einzig meinen Feind gleichfalls zu seinem Feinde hat, so glaubte ich nicht fürchten zu müssen, für inkonsequent zu gelten, wenn ich in dem einen und andern Punkte meiner Politik mich ein wenig änderte und eine Stellung einnähme, bei der ich der Fahne des großen und um mich hochverdienten Mannes folgte.", "1234": "Damit war, wie du siehst, ge- geben, daß ich mich ebenso zu Cäsar stellen mußte, da seine Sache und Ehre und die des Pompejus eng verbunden sind.", "1235": "Ein bedeutendes Gewicht hatte dabei nicht allein die alte Freundschaft, in der, wie dir nicht unbekannt ist, ich und mein Bruder Quintus mit Cäsar standen, sondern namentlich auch dessen freundliche und edle Gesinnung, von der ich mich bald in Briefen und thatsächlichen Beweisen ganz un­ zweifelhaft überzeugen durste.", "1236": "Ein starker Bestimmungsgrund lag für mich auch in der politischen Lage, sofern die Republik selbst einen Kampf mit diesen Männern, zumal nach den neuesten Helden­ thaten Cäsars nicht zu wünschen, sondern sich gewaltig dagegen zu sträuben schien.", "1237": "Was mich aber am nachdrücklichsten zu diesem Ent­ schlüsse trieb, war das Wort, das in betreff meiner Pompejus deni Cäsar, und mein Bruder dem ersteren gegeben hatte.", "1238": "Überdies durfte nicht unbeachtet bleiben, wie es in unserer Gemeinde stand, indem sich in derselben bewahrheitete, was unser Pla'to so unübertrefflich aus­ gesprochen hat:", "1239": "„Die Bürger einer Republik seien gewöhnlich gerade so, wie die Häupter derselben.\"", "1240": "Ich hatte in guter Erinnerung, wie von mir in meinem Konsulate gleich vom l.", "1241": "Januar an ein so guter Grund zu fester Haltung des Senats gelegt wurde, daß niemand sich wundern durste, als am 15. Dezember ^691 — 63 v. Chr.) dieser Stand so großen Mut und eine so imponierende Haltung zeigte.", "1242": "Gleich­ falls hatte ich nicht vergessen, daß zu der Zeit, wo ich vom Amte abgetreten war, bis zum Konsulate des Cäsar und Bibulus, unter dem gewichtigen Einflüsse meiner Stimme im Senat alle Wohlgesinnten in der Regel ganz eines Sinnes waren.", "1243": "In der Folge, als du an der Spitze eines Heeres als Statthalter das diesseitige Spanien verwaltetest, unser Gemeinwesen aber nicht Konsuln, nein — Provinzenhändler und ge­ meine Handlanger des Aufruhrs zur obersten Behörde hatte, da warf irgend ein Zufall mein Haupt gleich einem Zankapfel mitten in den Streit und Zwiespalt der Parteien im Staate hinein.", "1244": "Noch in diesem entscheidenden Zeitpunkte zeigte sich im Senat, in ganz Italien, unter allen Wohlgesinnten eine wunderbare, unerhörte, ganz einzige Ein­ helligkeit des Entschlusses, mich zu halten.", "1245": "Aber was ist dennoch ge­ schehen?", "1246": "Ich will es nicht sagen — denn viele hatten auf mancherlei Art schuld daran —;", "1247": "ich sage nur mit zwei Worten:", "1248": "es fehlte mir nicht an einem Heer, nur an Heerführern.", "1249": "Liegt die Schuld hiervon schon an denen, die mich nicht verteidigten, so nicht minder an den­ jenigen, die mich im Stiche ließen;", "1250": "und wenn die einen, die sich ein­ schüchtern ließen.", "1251": "Vorwürfe verdienen, so noch in höherem Grade andere, die sich nur stellten, als ob sie sich fürchteten.", "1252": "Jedenfalls ist mein damaliger Entschluß einer Anerkennung würdig, sofern ich meine Mitbürger, die von mir seiner Zeit gerettet worden waren und nun.", "1253": "mich retten wollten, aber ihrer Führer sich beraubt sahen, nicht be­ waffneten Sklaven preisgeben mochte, sondern lieber an den Tag kommen ließ, was die Wohlgesinnten bei entschiedener Einstimmigkeit hätten ausrichten können, wenn sie für mich, so lange ich noch auf­ recht stand, hätten in den Kampf gehen dürfen, da sie im stände waren, mich wiederaufzurichten, nachdem ich zu Boden geworfen worden war.", "1254": "Von der Gesinnung dieser Partei hast du dich nicht allein überzeugt, als du später für meine Sache thätig warst, sondern dieselbe auch dann wesentlich befestigt.", "1255": "Bei dieser Gelegenheit hast du auch, was ich nicht nur nicht ableugne, sondern stets dankbar und bereitwillig anerkennen werde, einige der angesehensten Männer zur seite gehabt, und diese haben sich bei der Bemühung für meine Wiederherstellung entschlossener gezeigt, als seiner Zeit, wo es galt mich zu halten;", "1256": "und hätten sie bei dieser ihrer Gesinnung bleiben wollen, so würden sie nicht allein mich gerettet, sondern zugleich ihr eigenes Ansehen wieder- gewonnen haben.", "1257": "Denn es wäre keinem schlechten Bürger mehr mög­ lich gewesen, das Staatswesen zu gefährden, indem die Gutgesinnten unter deinem Konsulate wieder zu Atem gekommen waren und durch deine feste, treffliche Amtsführung sich ermutigt fühlten, und da na­ mentlich Cnejus Pompejus an ihre Sache sich angeschlossen hatte, sowie auch Cäsar, nach vollbrachten Großthaten, von seiten des Senats durch ganz besondere und neue Ehren und Beweise der Anerkennung ausgezeichnet, für das Interesse dieses Standes gewonnen war.", "1258": "Aber höre jetzt, was darauf gefolgt ist.", "1259": "Fürs erste gelang es jenem Un­ hold weiblicher Feste, der vor der Bo'na De'a keine höhere Achtung hatte als vor seinen drei Schwestern, ohne Strafe davonzukommen, dank den Stimmen der Leute, welche, als ein Volkstribun den un­ ruhigen Wühler durch wohlgesinnte Männer gerichtlich verfolgen wollte, die Republik um den herrlichsten Vorgang für künftige Bestrafung der Meuterei gebracht haben.", "1260": "Später waren sie es wiederum, welche es geschehen ließen, daß das Ehrendenkmal, — ich sage nicht das m.i- nige, indem ich ja nur durch Verakkordierung der Arbeit, nicht aber durch den Beitrag von Kriegsbeute dabei beteiligt war — nein viel­ mehr das Ehrendenkmal des Senates durch den Namen des Hoch­ verräters und mit blutiger Schrift gebrandmarkt wurde.", "1261": "Daß diese Menschen mich gerettet wissen wollten, erkenne ich mit größtem Danke;", "1262": "aber es wäre mir lieb gewesen, wenn sie nicht bloß, wie die Ärzte, mir das Leben hätten retten, sondern auch, wie die Ali'pten, mir wie­ der zu Kräften und gesunder Farbe hätten verhelfen mögen.", "1263": "Nun aber haben es gewisse Leute mit mir gehalten, wie Ape'lles mit seiner Ve'nus, sn welcher er den Kopf und die oberen Teile des Busens mit der feinsten Kunst vollendet, die übrigen Teile aber nur im Umriß gelassen hat.", "1264": "Gerade so haben die Betreffenden einzig nur auf meinen Kopf alle Sorgfalt verwendet, dagegen das weitere unvollendet und formlos gelassen.", "1265": "In diesem Falle habe ich aber die Hoffnung nicht bloß meiner Neider, sondern auch meiner Gegner getäuscht.", "1266": "Von Quintus Mete'llus, dem Sohne des Lucius, diesem so entschiedenen und tapferen Manne, dem nach meiner Ansicht an Seelengröße und Festigkeit keiner gleichkommt, ist nämlich seiner Zeit eine ganz falsche Meinung überliefert worden, wenn man von ihm immer sagt, er sei nach seiner Zurückkunft »us der Verbannung^ innerlich ganz gebrochen und gebeugt gewesen.", "1267": "Es wäre aber erst noch zu beweisen, daß der Mann, der mit der größten Bereitwilligkeit die Stadt geräumt und aus­ nehmend wohlgemut auswärts gelebt hat, ohne sich um seine Rückkehr im geringsten zu bekümmern, sich durch Verhältnisse habe niederbeugen lassen, unter denen er sich fester und würdevoller benommen hat, als irgend einer, selbst als der ganz einzige Marcus Scaurus.", "1268": "Nun also, was man über Metellus gehört hatte oder auch bloß vermutete, dachte man auch an mir zu erleben, daß ich nämlich den Mut noch mehr verlieren würde, während mir doch die Republik gerade jetzt noch größeren Mut einflößte, als ich je zuvor gehabt.", "1269": "Hatte sie ja doch erklärt, ich sei der einzige Bürger, den sie nicht entbehren könne, und hatte sie mich ja nicht bloß auf den Antrag eines einzigen Tribunen, wie dies bei Metellus der Fall war, nein in ihrer ganzen Gesamt­ heit, den Senat an der Spitze, Italien in ihrem Gefolge, auf den Vorschlag von acht Tribunen, auf Antrag des Konsuls, in einer Cen­ turienversammlung, durch die vereinte Anstrengung aller Stände, aller Menschen, kurz mit Aufgebot aller ihrer Kräfte sich wiederzuaeeianet.", "1270": "Gleichwohl habe ich mir in der Folge bis zur Stunde nichts heraus- genommen, an dem jemand, und wäre er auch noch so übelwollend, mit Grund Anstoß nehmen könnte;", "1271": "mein einziges Bestreben ist viel­ mehr, meinen Freunden und selbst Fernerstehenden mit Rat und That Dienste zu leisten.", "1272": "Diese meine Art zu leben mag vielleicht manchem anstößig sein, der bloß die glänzende Außenseite eines solchen Lebens ms Auge faßt, von der damit verbundenen Unruhe, Sorge und An­ strengung sich aber keinen Begriff machen kann.", "1273": "Namentlich beklagt man sich ganz unverhohlen darüber, daß ich in meinen Abstimmungen zu Gunsten Cäsars der alten Sache sder Optimatenparteil so zu sagen untreu werde.", "1274": "Ich lasse mich aber dabei teils durch die soeben an­ gegebenen Beweggründe leiten, teils, und das nicht zuletzt, durch den Umstand, über den ich mich bereits einigermaßen ausgesprochen habe kund den ich jetzt noch weiter darlegen will).Du wirst, mein lieber Lentulus, bei den Wohldenkenden nicht mehr den guten Geist treffen, der bei deinem Abgang unter ihnen herrschte, ich meine den Geist, dem mein Konsulat Festigkeit gegeben, der dann in der Folge zu Zeiten eine Unterbrechung erfuhr und, nach­ dem er unmittelbar vor deinem Konsulat einen Stoß erlitten hatte, von dir neu belebt worden, nun aber von denen ganz aufgegeben ist, die ihn hätten wahren sollen.", "1275": "Und diese Umstimmung gibt diese Partei der Patrioten, wie sie damals in unserer guten Zeit hieß, nicht allein in Gesicht und Mienen kund, wo es am wenigsten schwer ist, die Rolle der Verstellung zu spielen, sondern sie hat sie mehr als einmal schon durch ihre Gesinnung sowie durch ihre Abstimmungen vor Ge­ richt und m Komitien deutlichzu erkennen gegeben.", "1276": "Infolge davon müssen nun auch verständige Bürger, zu denen ich gehören und ge­ rechnet sein will, völlig andere Ansichten und Gesinnungen hegen.", "1277": "Denn so lautet gleichfalls die Weisung Plato's, den ich am liebsten als meinen Führer betrachte, wenn er sagt, in politischen Kämpfen dürfe man nur soweit gehen, als man auf seine Mitbürger durch Über­ zeugung wirken könne;", "1278": "Gewalt sei gegenüber dem Vaterland sowenig zulässig, als gegenüber von Vater und Mutter.", "1279": "Und das eben habe ihn bestimmt, sich nicht mit Politik zu besassen;", "1280": "das athenische Volk sei nämlich zu seiner Zeit beinahe schon vor Alter kindisch gewesen, und er habe ge­ sehen, daß man nur die Möglichkeit habe, es entweder mit guten Worten oder durch Zwang zu leiten;", "1281": "an einer Einwirkung durch Gründe nun aber habe er verzweifelt, Zwang anzuwenden dagegen für Sünde gehalten.", "1282": "Meine Stellung war eine andere, insofern mir die Hände gebunden waren;", "1283": "denn ich hatte es nicht mit einem kindisch gewordenen Volke zu thun, und es stand mir nicht frei erst noch zu überlegen, ob ich an der Staatsverwaltung teilnehmen wolle.", "1284": "Indes hatte ich doch die Freude, eine Sache vertreten zu dürfen,- bei der ich zugleich meinen persönlichen Vorteil und das Interesse, das jedem Wohlden­ kenden erwünscht ist, wahren konnte.", "1285": "Hierzu kam noch, daß Cäsar in einer Weise, die alle Anerkennung verdient und fast übermenschlich heißen kann, sich gegen mich und meinen Bruder edelmütig benahm.", "1286": "Wäre es jedenfalls, seine Thaten möchten sein welche sie wollten, meine Schuldigkeit gewesen seiner Sache mich anzunehmen, so würde ich jetzt, da er so vom Glücke begünstigt ist und nach so glorreichen Siegen, zu seiner Verherrlichung mitwirken zu müssen glauben, auch wenn er gegen uns nicht so sich benähme, wie er es thut.", "1287": "Denn du darfst überzeugt sein, abgesehen von euch, den Schöpfern meines Glückes, ist niemand in der Welt, von dem ich, und zwar sogar mit Freuden, bekennen möchte, in gleicher Weise mich ihm verpflichtet zu wissen^, als Cäsar).Nach den bisherigen Erörterungen ist es nun leicht, deine An­ fragen in betreff des Vatinius und Crassus zu beantworten.", "1288": "An meinem Verhalten gegen Appius und ebenso gegen Cäsar hast du ja, wie du schreibst, nichts zu tadeln, und es freut mich, daß dasselbe deinen Beifall hat.", "1289": "Was also den Vatinius betrifft, so wurde der erste Schritt zur Aussöhnung durch Pompejus vermittelt, gleich nach­ dem Vatinius Prätor geworden war, wiewohl ich seiner Bewerbung mich im Senat aufs nachdrücklichste widersetzt hatte, jedoch nicht so­ wohl um ihm zu nahe zu treten, als um mich seines Mitbewerbers) Cato's anzunehmen und diesen zu heben.", "1290": "Darauf bemühte sich Cäsar ganz außerordentlich, mich zur Verteidigung desselben zu bestimmen.", "1291": "Warum ich aber seinen Fürsprecher gemacht, das sei so gut mich weder bei diesem noch bei anderen Angeklagten zu fragen;", "1292": "ich müßte dir sonst, wenn du kommst, die Frage zurückgeben;", "1293": "ja, ich kann sie sogar an dich in deiner Abwesenheit stellen:", "1294": "erinnere dich nur, was für Leuten du von den Enden der Welt ^Spanien und Cilicien) her hast Fürsprache zukommen lassen.", "1295": "Du darfst aber keinen Vorwurf darüber befürchten;", "1296": "denn ich halte es jetzt und in Zukunft mit denselben Leuten selbst auch ebenso.", "1297": "Indes reizte mich noch ein besonderer Umstand zur Vertei­ digung des Vatinius, auf den

Provinz Asien, und man sieht aus diesem und mehreren der folgenden Briefe, wie die sogenannten Vaterlandsfreunde große Hoffnungen an den talentvollen Mann knüpften.", "2022": "Cicero, im Gefühl seines eigenen Mangels an Energie und, obwohl erst 54 Jahre alt, bereits unter dem Druck der Jahre leidend, erwartete von Curio das, was er selbst gegenüber der wachsenden Macht der Triumvirn nicht mehr

daraus nicht allein die fast väterliche Gesinnung Ciceros gegen Curio und seine damaligen noch immer genährten Hoffnungen in betreff der Rettung der republikanischen Verfassung kennen, sondern sehen

Dezember 703 an, dem Tage des Antritts des Tri­ bunats, gewinnt vollends das Wirken Curios in der Tat welthistorische Be­ deutung, indem er vornehmlich es war, der den Bruch zwischen Cäsar und

(Cicero, Von den berühmten Rednern 60), war besonders durch Ciceros Fürbitten bestimmt worden, seinen ausschweifenden und durch Bürgschaft (für sechs Millionen Sesterzen --- 1052400 Reichsmark) für An­ tonius tiefverschuldeten Sohn wieder zu Gnaden anzunehmen.", "2038": "Der beige­ fügte Wunsch in betreff des Erbes enthält eine wohlberechtigte Ahnung und Mahnung;", "2039": "denn in der

dessen ihn später gereuen könnte, nämlich den Weg persönlichen Ehrgeizes und übertriebenen Aufwandes, der zum Verrat an der Republik führen könnte, wird hier in feiner Weise und ziemlich ernstem Tone an­ gedeutet.Daß es Briefe verschiedener Art gibt, ist dir wohl bekannt.", "2055": "Die eine und gewöhnlichste Art nun, auf die das Bedürfnis des Lebens geführt hat, ist die, welche die Benachrichtigung Abwesender zum Zwecke hat, wenn ein Gegenstand vorliegt, welchen sie wissen zu lassen uns oder ihnen von Interesse ist.", "2056": "Briefe dieser Art er­ wartest du nun aber

getretenen Re­ publik die Würde und Freiheit wiederzuschenken!Noch hat man keine sichere Kunde, daß du dich Italien näherst, und bereits schicke ich den Se'xtus Vi'llius, einen Freund meines Mi'lo,

etwas Bedeutendes zu erbitten, indem es ja den Anschein haben könnte, er stelle nicht sowohl eine Bitte als eine Forderung an denselben und schlage die Gewährung seines Gesuches eher als schuldige Vergeltung denn als Wohltat an.", "2095": "Weil aber du dir die größten Verdienste um mich erworben hast, die teils allgemein bekannt, teils schon durch das Unerhörte meiner Leidens­ zeit in das hellste Licht gestellt worden sind, und da ein edles Ge­ müt, wenn es einem andern viel verdankt, gern auch das Doppelte und Dreifache zu danken haben möchte, so trage ich kein Bedenken, dich in einem Briefe um etwas zu bitten, was für mich von der allergrößten und dringendsten Wichtigkeit ist.", "2096": "Dabei habe ich ja nicht zu besorgen, daß ich unter dem Gewicht deiner—ob auch un­ zähligen—Verdienste um mich erliegen könnte, zumal da ich mir zu­ trauen darf, daß mein Herz jede, auch die erdenklich größte Ge­ fälligkeit, die mir erzeigt wird, ebensogut nach ihrer ganzen Bedeu­

"2114": "wenn ich mir diese Bitte von dir gewährt sehe, so werde ich mich dir beinahe noch mehr verpflichtet fühlen, als dem Milo selbst.", "2115": "Denn so teuer mir auch meine Existenz war, deren Rettung ich ihm vornehmlich zu danken hatte, so macht mir doch das Bewußt­ sein einer durch tatsächlichen Dank erfüllten Liebespflicht noch größere Freude.", "2116": "Und diese Freude kann mir, wie ich zuversichtlich hoffe, zuteil werden, bloß durch den Eifer, mit dem du der frag­ lichen Sache dich annimmst.Ti'tus Milo, Sohn des Ga'jus Pa'pius Ce'lsus, infolge der Adoption seines mütterlichen Großvaters A'nnius Milo genannt, ist vornehmlich be­ kannt durch seinen Kampf mit seinem früheren Kollegen im Tribunat, Pu'­ blius Clo'dius, der zu Anfang des folgenden Jahres mit der Ermordung des letzteren endigte.", "2117": "Im laufenden Jahre 701 bewarb sich Milo um das Kon­ sulat und hatte dabei nicht allein den Widerstand des Clodius, sondern auch, wegen seiner Unbeugsamkeit gegenüber den Triu'mvirn, den des Pompejus zu fürchten.", "2118": "Aber vielleicht weniger wegen der Kämpfe, die dem Milo mit Clodius drohten, als wegen der Hoffnung, die Cicero an dieses Konsulat als eine Hauptstütze teils gegen die Triumvirn, teils insbesondere gegen die An­ griffe des etwaigen Prätors Clodius auf sich selbst knüpfte, bietet dieser in auffallendem Tone gehaltene Brief alle Überredungskunst auf, den jugendlich kühnen, einflußreichen und auch durch Rednergabe ausgezeichneten Curio noch vor seiner Heimkehr aus Asien ganz für Milos Sache zu gewinnen.", "2119": "Bekanntlich wurde Milo nicht zum Konsul gewählt, sondern bei der bald danach erfolgten Anklage wegen Gewalttat, trotz der glänzenden Verteidi­ gung Ci'ceros, verurteilt und mußte nach MassNia in die Verbannung wandern.", "2120": "Er starb bei einem abenteuerlichen Kampfe, den er gegen Cäsar unternahm.", "2121": "In diesem Betracht wie auch in sonstiger Hinsicht war Milo gar nicht der Mann, die Rolle zu spielen, die ihm, nach Wielands richtiger Vermutung, Cicero in diesem Briefe zuteilen zu wollen scheint und die wohl keine andere war, als die einer die Republik rettenden Macht gegenüber der von Tag zu Tag gefährlicheren Allgewalt der Triumvirn.", "2122": "— Die jungen Leute, junge Patrizier und Ritter, hatten mehr und mehr bei Wahlen und politischen Bewegungen großen Einfluß in Rom bekommen.Rom,

Amanus Ruhe zu stiften und dieses Gebirge von diesem ewigen Feinde zu säubern, so setzte ich jetzt das letztere Vorhaben ins Werk.", "3942": "Ich stellte mich an, als ob ich das Gebirge verließe und anderen Teilen Ciliciens zuzöge, entfernte mich aber nur eine Tagereise davon und bezog ein Lager bei Epiphani'a.", "3943": "Dann am 12. Oktober ließ ich gegen Abend das Heer ohne Gepäck aufbrechen und marschierte die ganze Nacht hin­ durch, so daß ich am dreizehnten mit Tagesanbruh cdie Höhen des Amanus erreichte.", "3944": "Sobald

Legaten Marcus Anne'jus und Lucius Tu'llius befehligten, überfielen wir den größten Teil der dortigen Bevölkerung, die sich keines Angriffs versah, hieben sie zusammen oder machten sie, da ihnen die Flucht abgeschnitten war, zu Ge­ fangenen.", "3945": "E'rana aber, der Hauptort des Gebirges, der mehr einer Stadt als einem Dorfe gleich sieht, desgleichen die Flecken Se'pyra und Ko'mmoris leisteten zwar hitzigen und langen Widerstand, wurden aber von Pompti'nus, der in selbiger Gegend stand, nach einem Kampfe vom frühesten Morgen bis zur vierten Stunde des Nachmittags eingenommen, eine große Menge der Feinde nieder­ gemacht, auch mehrere feste Plätze erobert und in Brand gesteckt.", "3946": "Nach diesen Thaten bezogen wir ein Lager am Fuße des Amanus bei den „Altären Alexanders\" und brachten die vier Tage daselbst damit zu, den übrigen Teil der Gebirgsgegend, soweit sie zu meiner Provinz gehört, zu verheeren und den Räubereien völlig ein Ende zu machen.", "3947": "Als wir dort fertig waren, rückte ich mit dem Heere vor Pindenissus, eine Stadt der „freien Cilicier\".", "3948": "Dieser Ort hat eine sehr hohe Lage, ist wohl befestigt, und seine Einwohner haben sich selbst den dortigen Königen niemals unterworfen.", "3949": "Des­ halb und weil sie außerdem nicht nur unseren entlaufenen Sklaven Aufnahme gestatteten, sondern auch mit größter Ungeduld die An­ kunft der Parther erwarteten, glaubte ich, wir seien es der Ehre unseres Reiches schuldig, ihrem frechen Treiben ein Ende zu machen, weil so umso eher auch andern, die unsere Herrschaft mit scheelen Augen ansehen, die Lust benommen werden konnte, ihren Mut an uns zu kühlen.", "3950": "Zch schloß den Ort mit Wall und Graben ein, um­ zingelte ihn mit sechs Schanzen und einem ausgedehnten Lager und griff ihn mit Aufwerfung eines Dammes, mit Sturmdächern und Türmen an.", "3951": "Vermittelst vielen schweren Geschützes, einer be­ deutenden Anzahl von Bogenschützen und mit großer Anstrengung von meiner Seite, aber ohne alle Belästigung oder Unkosten für unsere Bundesgenossen, gelang es mir, nach siebenundfünfzig Tagen die Sache zu Ende zu führen.", "3952": "Da die Stadt in allen Teilen zer­ trümmert oder in Brand gesteckt war, sahen sich die Belagerten so in die Enge getrieben, daß sie sich mir ergaben.", "3953": "Nachbarn von ihnen waren die Tebara'ner, die nicht minder feindselig und frech sich benommen hatten.", "3954": "Diese mußten mir nach der Einnahme von Pindenissus Geißeln stellen, mein Heer ließ ich unter demKommando meines Bruders Ouintus die Winterquartiere beziehen in Ortschaften, die entweder erobert oder uns noch nicht ganz befreundet waren.", "3955": "Nun ist mein Wunsch, du möchtest dich versichert halten, daß, wenn über diese Angelegenheiten im Senate Bericht erstattet wird und du dann eine mir zuzuerkennende Ehre auch mit deiner Stimme unterstützen wolltest, dies in meinen Augen meinem Ruhm erst die Krone aufsetzen würde.", "3956": "Ich weiß zwar wohl, daß in Dingen dieser Art ganz gewöhnlich selbst Männer von den strengsten Grundsätzen Bitten stellen und annehmen, doch glaube ich, daß es bei dir von meiner Seite weniger einer Bitte, als einer leisen Mahnung be­ darf.", "3957": "Du bist es ja, der mich durch seine Abstimmungen so oft aus­ gezeichnet, der mich in einer Rede, mit ausdrücklicher Anerkennung, mit den höchsten Lobsprüchen im Senate wie in Volksversamm­ lungen bis in den Himmel erhoben hat, während deine Worte für mich jederzeit von solchem Gewichte waren, daß, sobald du auch nur ein anerkennendes Wort gesprochen hattest, ich geradezu alles für erreichbar hielt.", "3958": "Endlich erinnere ich mich noch, wie du einmal in einer Sitzung, in der du gegen ein Dankfest für einen hoch­ angesehenen, trefflichen Mann gestimmt hast, die Äußerung thatest, du würdest dafür stimmen, wenn der Antrag mit Rücksicht auf dessen Verdienste als Konsul in der Hauptstadt gestellt würde.", "3959": "Und zu­ gleich bist du eS gewesen, der mir, ohne daß ich ein Kriegskleid ge­ tragen, ein Dankfest zuerkannt hat, nicht wegen rühmlicher Ver­ waltung des Staates, was vielen begegnet ist, sondern, was noch keinem widerfahren war, wegen Erhaltung des Vaterlandes.", "3960": "Ich sage nichts davon, wie du die Mißgunst, die Gefahren, die Unge­ witter alle, die über mich hereinbrachen, mit mir getragen, ja, wenn ich es zugegeben hätte, in noch weit höherem Maße zu tragen bereit wärest, wie du endlich in meinem Feinde deinen eigenen erblickt, und selbst noch — was mich namentlih cüberzeugte, wie viel ich diri gelte — seinen gewaltsamen Tod durch deine im Senate gehaltene Verteidigungsrede Milo's gutgeheißen hast.", "3961": "Wenn ich nun noch beifüge, was ich dagegen für dich gethan habe, wie ich nicht etwa bloß ein stiller Bewunderer deiner ausgezeichneten Eigenschaften und Verdienste war — denn wer sollte das dir gegenüber nicht sein?", "3962": "— nein, wie ich in allen meinen Vorträgen und Abstimmungen im Senat, in meinen Gerichtsreden und in allen Schriften, den griechi­ schen wie den lateinischen, kurz bei meiner ganzen so mannigfaltigen schriftstellerischen Thätigkeit dich höher gestellt habe als alle Mit­ lebenden, ja als alle Männer der Vorzeit:", "3963": "so rechne ich mir dies nicht als ein Verdienst an, sondern sage es nur zum Beweise, wie ich der Wahrheit die Ehre gegeben, wie richtig ich geurteilt habe.Du fragst vielleicht, wie es komme, daß ich auf diese an sich so wenig besagende Dankes- und Ehrenbezeigung von seiten des Senates einen so großen Wert lege?", "3964": "Ich will dir darauf ganz offenherzig antworten, wie es sich für Freunde ziemt, die durch gemeinsame Lebensrichtung, durch gegenseitige Dienstleistungen, durch die innigste Freundschaft und ein schon von den Vätern ererbtes nahes Verhältnis verbunden sind.", "3965": "Ich war sicherlich, wie nur irgend jemand, schon meinem Naturell nach und noch mehr, wie ich mir dessen bewußt zusein glaube, aus philosophischen Grundsätzen immer weit davon entfernt, auf eitles Lob und das Gerede der großen Menge etwas zu halten.", "3966": "Dessen ist mein Konsulat Zeuge.", "3967": "Zwar habe ich während desselben, wie in meinem ganzen Leben, was ich offen gestehe, mit Eifer allem nachgestrebt, was wahren Ruhm zu schaffen vermag, aber den Ruhm an und für sich habe ich niemals für wünshcenswert gehalten.", "3968": "Darum habe ich seiner Zeit auf eine Provinz verzichtet, für die das Heer und das Geld verwilligt war, und in der ohne Zweifel ein Triumph in Aussicht stand.", "3969": "Endlich habe ich die Würde eines Augurs nicht ge­ sucht, obschon es mir, wie du wohl überzeugt bist, nicht sehr schwer gewesen wäre sie zu erlangen.", "3970": "Dagegen seit der Unbill, die mir widerfahren, die, wie du sie immer bezeichnest, für den Staat eine Niederlage, für mich nicht nur keine Niederlage, sondern eine Ehre war, habe ich's mein Bestreben sein lassen, von Senat und Volk zu Rom möglichst starke Beweise der Anerkennung zu erhalten.", "3971": "Darum war es mir in der Folge darum zu thun, Augur zu werden, und so glaube ich auch die Auszeichnung, welche der Senat für kriege­ rische Verdienste gewöhnlich erteilt, und gegen die ich früher gleich- giltig war, nunmehr gwünschen zu müssen.", "3972": "Ich bitte dich demnach.", "3973": "während ich oben gesagt habe, nicht darum bitten zu wollen, doch angelegentlich, du möchtest dich geneigt und willfährig zeigen, zur Erfüllung dieses meines Wunsches beizutragen, eines Wunsches, der sich fast zur Sehnsucht steigert, weil ich darin einen Balsam für die mir geschlagene Wunde erblicke.", "3974": "Übrigens erlaube ich mir diese Bitte nur unter der Voraussetzung, daß dir das wenige, was ich gethan, nicht unbedeutend und geringfügig ershceint, sondern immer­ hin in deinen Augen ungleich mehr Bedeutung hat, als die Ver­ dienste vieler anderen, die dafür die höchsten Ehren vom Senate erhalten haben.", "3975": "Ich glaube aber auch bemerkt zu haben — du weißt ja, wie aufmerksam ich dir zuzuhören gewohnt bin daß du, wenn es sich um Zuerkennung oder Verweigerung von Ehren handelt, gewöhnlich nicht sowohl die Größe der Thaten, als die Gesinnungs­ und Handlungsweise der in Frage stehenden Imperatoren ins Auge fassest.", "3976": "Ziehst du nun aber in meinem Falle diesen Umstand in Be­ tracht, so wirst du finden, daß ich bei der Schwäche meines Heeres der Gefahr eines so bedeutenden Krieges nicht gewahcsen gewesen wäre, wenn ich nicht an meiner gerechten und uneigennützigen Amts­ führung die kräftigste Schutzwehr gehabt hätte.", "3977": "Mit diesen Hilfs­ mitteln habe ich einen Zweck erreicht, der durch keine Legionen zu erreichen gewesen wäre, die Verwandlung der abgeneigtesten und ungetreuesten Bundesgenossen in die wärmsten, zuverlässigsten Freunde, die Erneuerung des Zutrauens zu den alten Oberherren inden Herzen einerBevölkerung, die in gespannter Erwartung eines Umsturzes des Bestehenden war.", "3978": "Doch ich mache zu viele Worte über meine eigene Person, zu- mal einem Manne gegenüber, der allein für.die Klagen aller unserer Bundesgenossen ein offenes Ohr hat.", "3979": "Du wirst es schon von denen erfahren, die durch meine Amtsführung sich ganz neu belebt fühlen.", "3980": "Wie sie überhaupt beinahe einstimmig mich bei dir rühmen werden, so sehr ich's nur immer wünschen mag, so werden insbesondere die zwei großen Schutzverwandten von dir, die Insel Cypern und das Reich von Kappadokien, meine Fürsprecher bei dir machen, ich denke auch der König Dejotarus, der mit dir in ganz besonders nahem Verhältnis steht.", "3981": "Wenn die Mitteilungen von diesen noch stärker sals was ich von mir gesagt habe) ins Gewicht fallen, und da in allen Jahrhunderten die Männer selten waren, denen es mehr um Selbstüberwindung als um Besiegung feindlicher Heershcaren zu thun ist, so darf man gewiß um so eher von dir erwarten, daß dir, wenn du zu den Heldenthaten im Kriege diese seltneren und schwereren Verdienste hinzunimmst, nun auch diese Thaten selbst bedeutender und der Anerkennung würdiger ershceinen werden.", "3982": "Schließlich möchte ich, weil ich gewissermaßen meiner eigenen Bitte nicht ganz traue, noch eine weitere Fürsprache bei dir einge­ bracht wissen durch die Philosophie, diese teuerste Gefährtin meines ganzen Lebens, diese größte aller Gottesgaben für das Menschen- geschlecht.", "3983": "Sie also, und zwar in der uns beiden gemeinsamen Ver­ bindung der Wissenschaft mit dem praktischen Leben, indem wir, wie sonst niemand außer uns, von Jugend auf mit voller Hingabe die alte echte Philosophie nicht bloß, wie mancher andere, zur Aus­ füllung müßiger Stunden getrieben, sondern sie auf das Forum, in die Staatsverwaltung, ja, möchte ich beinahe sagen, in das Feld­ lager eingeführt haben, diese Philosophie ist es, die bei dir meinem Ruhme das Wort redet, und ihr kann, ihr darf, denke ich, ein Cato nichts abschlagen.", "3984": "Möchtest du darum dich versichert halten, daß ich, wenn mir auf mein Schreiben san den Senats hin durch deine Stimme die ehrende Anerkennung zu teil würde, gar nicht anders glauben werde, als ich habe die Erfüllung meines sehnlichsten Wunsches deinem gewichtigen Einflüsse und vor allem deiner wohl­ wollenden Gesinnung gegen mich zu danken.", "3985": "Cicero bietet in diesem Briefe alles auf, dem Cato die Unterstützung seines Gesuchs um ein Siegend an ksest für seine Heldenthaten im Amanns ans Herz zu legen.", "3986": "Obgleich durch seine Ernennung zum Jmpera'tor (man vergleiche den vorigen Brief) bis auf einen gewissen Grad dazu berechtigt, fürchtete er doch in diesem strengen Manne einen Gegner der gewünschten Auszeichnung, wie denn derselbe sich auch in der Antwort (Brief 250) als solchen bekannte.", "3987": "Außerdem besorgte er wohl auch, daß ihm Cato seinen An­ schluß an die Triu'mvirn noch nicht verziehen habe.", "3988": "Obschon aber die ver­ schiedenen Motive, die auf Cato wirken sollten,

deine Sache geführt, was ich in den Bürgerversammlungen ge­ sprechen, wie meine Briefe an dich gelautet haben.", "424": "Nimm alles dies zusammen und bilde dir dann, wenn du so gut sein willst, dein eigenes Urteil, ob dein Benehmen bei deiner neulichen Anwesen­ heit in Rom meinem ganzen Verhalten in einer Weise entsprochen habe, daß man von Gegenseitigkeit reden kann.Du sprichst in deinem Schreiben von „wiederhergestelltem gutem Vernehmen\";", "425": "ich begreife aber nicht, wie du zu diesem Aus­ druck kommst in einem Falle, wo doch das Vernehmen gar keine Störung erlitten hat.",

verschone.", "430": "Da mir zu Ohren gekommen war, daß sein ganzes Dichten und Trachten dahin gehe, mit allen ihm als Tribu n* zu gebote stehenden Mitteln mich zu stürzen, wandte ich mich an deine Gemahlin Claudia und, ermutigt durch die mehrfachen Beweise von Wohlwollen, die mir eure Schwester Mu'cia infolge ihrer engen Verbindung mit Pompejus gegeben hatte, auch an diese mit dem Ersuchen, daß sie ihn durch Vorstellungen von seinem Unrecht abhalten möchten.", "431": "Nun aber hat er, was du, wie ich gewiß weiß, gehört hast, am letzten Tage des verflossenen Jahres mir eine Kränkung zugefügt, wie sie noch nie selbst dem pflichtvergessensten Bürger in dem ge­ ringsten Amte widerfahren ist, indem er mir, einem Konsul, der doch das Gemeinwesen gerettet hatte, es verwehrte, beim Abtreten vom Amte zum Volke zu reden;", "432": "wiewohl diese von ihm beabsichtigte Kränkung mir den größten Triumph bereitet hat.", "433": "Denn da er mir nichts als den ^gewöhnlichen^ Eid gestattete, habe ich mit lauter Stimme den wahrsten und schönsten Eid abgelegt, und das Volk schwur gleichfalls mit lauter Stimme, ich habe hier wahr geschworen.", "434": "Trotz dieser auffälligen Kränkung habe ich doch an selbigem Tage noch gemeinschaftliche Freunde an deinen Bruder abgeschickt, die ihn bestimmen sollten, von dieser Gesinnung abzustehen.", "435": "Seine Antwort lautete, das stehe nicht mehr bei ihm;", "436": "denn kurz zuvor hatte er in der Volksversammlung erklärt, einem Manne, der andere ungehört gestraft habe, dürfe man auch für seine Person nicht er­ lauben zu reden.", "437": "Ein Mann von Grundsätzen das und ein trefflicher Bürger!", "438": "Dieselbe Strafe, welche der Senat unter Zustimmung aller Gutgesinnten Leuten zuerkannt hatte, die die Hauptstadt in Brand stecken, Behörden

"444": "Wenn dir diese Anschläge deines Bruders in betreff meiner Person nicht bekannt geworden sind, so hast du es von der Seite anzusehen, daß dein Bruder dir Sachen von der größten Wichtig­ keit vorenthalten habe;", "445": "hat er dir aber über seinen Plan Mitteilungen gemacht, so solltest du es anerkennen, daß ich so wenig empfindlich und so rücksichtsvoll bin, dich mit Beschwerden über die fraglichen Angelegenheiten zu verschonen.", "446": "Und wenn du nun siehst, daß es nicht „ein Wort des Metellus\", wie du sagst, sondern ein ganz planmäßiges Verfahren und die feindseligste Gesinnung war, was mich aufgebracht hat, so bringe es dir nun zum Bewußtsein, wie sanftmütig ich gewesen bin, wenn anders eine fast in Schwäche aus­ artende Gelassenheit, angesichts der bittersten Kränkung, noch Sanft­ mut heißen kann.", "447": "Ich habe niemals meine Stimme gegen deinen Bruder abgegeben;", "448": "sooft ^im Senats über ihn verhandelt wurde, habe ich, ohne aufzustehen, denen beigestimmt, die mir die mildeste Ansicht zu haben schienen.", "449": "Ich habe endlich, um das auch noch zu sagen, es nicht ungern geschehen lassen — denn die Anregung dazu zu geben konnte nicht mehr meine Sache sein — ja ich habe nach Kräften dazu geholfen, daß ein Senatsbeschluß zu gunsten meines Gegners gefaßt wurde, weil er dein Bruder war.Es ist also unrichtig, daß ich deinem Bruder „zu Leibe ge- gangen\", ich habe vielmehr gegen deinen Bruder mich meiner Haut gewehrt, und bin nicht, wie du schreibst, „wankelmütig\" gegen dich gewesen, sondern bin mir so gleich geblieben, daß ich meine Gesin­ nung gegen dich auch da noch bewahrte, als du „jede Rücksicht auf mich außer Augen setztest\".", "450": "Und auch jetzt noch, wo ich von dir ein Schreiben erhalten, das beinahe einen drohenden Ton gegen mich anschlägt, gebe ich dir dagegen die Versicherung, daß ich dir deine Empfindlichkeit nicht allein zu gute halte, sondern sogar zum höchsten Lobe anrechne;", "451": "denn mein eigenes Gefühl sagt mir, welche Macht über den Menschen die Liebe zu einem Bruder hat.", "452": "Nur darum bitte ich dich, du möchtest ebenso billig dich erweisen im Urteil über meine Empfindlichkeit und dich dahin entscheiden, ich habe bei dem bitteren, dem unbarmherzigen, dem grundlosen Angriffe von seiten der Deinigen nicht nur nicht nachgeben dürfen, sondern hätte sogar Grund gehabt, deine Hilfe und die deiner „Heeresmacht\" in einem solchen Falle in Anspruch zu nehmen.", "453": "Es war immer mein Wunsch, dich zum Freunde zu haben, und ebenso war es mein Bestreben, dich zu überzeugen, daß ich dein bester Freund sei.", "454": "Diese Gesin­ nung habe ich noch jetzt und werde sie auch in Zukunft bewahren, solange du es haben willst.", "455": "Ja, eher will ich aus Liebe zu dir auf­ hören, deinen Bruder zu hassen, als aus Haß gegen ihn unserem freundlichen Verhältnis den geringsten Abbruch thun.1.", "456": "Daß eine konsularische Provinz, wie Gallien, einem Prätor abge­ treten werden konnte,

durch Erwähnung seines Kriegsheers sich eine vornehme militärische Miene gegen den friedsamen Cicero geben zu wollen schien, wie überhaupt dieses Schreiben voll feiner Ironie ist über die offenbar übertrie­ bene und polternde Sprache, die Metellus geführt hatte.", "471": "Wenn es bei dir und dem Heere gut steht, freut es mich.", "472": "Dein amtliches Schreiben hat mir so wie jedermann

bist, ist nicht abhängig von den Launen des Zufalls, sondern Einsicht und gewissenhafte Thätigkeit sind hier das Entscheidende.", "1539": "Wüßte ich dich in Führung eines wich­ tigen, gefährlichen Krieges begriffen und sähe dir für dessen Zwecke den Oberbefehl verlängert, ja dann würde ich im Geiste für dich erzittern, sofern ich in diesem Falle glauben müßte, daß zu gleicher Zeit dem Zufall seine Macht über uns verlängert sei.", "1540": "Nun aber . ist dir ein Feld politischer Thätigkeit anvertraut, auf das der Zufall gar keinen oder nur einen ganz unbedeutenden Einfluß hat, und wobei nach meiner Ansicht wohl alles auf deiner persönlichen Tüchtig­ keit und deinem guten Takte beruht.", "1541": "Wir haben uns meines Wissens weder vor feindlichen Nachstellungen zu fürchten, noch vor einer Schlacht auf offenem Felde, noch vor abtrünnigen Bundes­ genossen, auch nicht vor Mangel an Geld oder Lebensmitteln, noch vor einem meuterischen Heere;", "1542": "lauter Unfälle, die gar oft die einsichts­ vollsten Männer betroffen haben, so daß sie der Übermacht des Geschicks erlegen sind, wie ja oftmals auch der beste Steuermann einem gewaltigen Sturme nicht zu widerstehen vermag.", "1543": "Dir ist der tiefste Fri'de, völlige Ruhe vergönnt;", "1544": "auch ein solcher Zustand könnte einem Steuermann, wenn er schläft, sogar verderblich werden, während er ihm dagegen, wenn er die Augen offen hat, ganz behaglich sein kann.", "1545": "Denn die Einwohnerschaft deiner Pro­ vinz besteht fürs erste aus solchen Bundesgenossen, die der ge­ bildetsten Klasse der Menschenwelt angehören, sodann aus römischen Bürgern, die entweder, sofern sie Staatspächter sind, in nächster Berührung mit uns stehen, oder, sofern sie durch Geschäftsbetrieb einen Wohlstand sich erworben haben, den Bestand ihres Glückes meinem Konsulate zu verdanken glauben.Du sagst freilich, gerade diese Leute sind's, unter denen bedeu­ tende Streitigkeiten entstehen, viele Rechtsverletzungen vorkommen, was dann gewaltige Kämpfe, zur Folge hat.", "1546": "Aber ist denn meine Ansicht, du habest nicht ein gut Teil Arbeit auf dir?", "1547": "Ich weiß vielmehr recht wohl, daß deine Geschäfte sehr umfassend sind und mit der größten Klugheit besorgt sein wollen;", "1548": "aber laß dir nochmals meine Ansicht gesagt sein, daß dabei von der letzteren Eigenschaft weit mehr abhänge, als vom Zufall.", "1549": "Was will es denn heißen, andere in Schranken zu halten, über die man zu gebieten hat, wenn man sich selbst in Schranken hält?", "1550": "Mag dies auch für manchen andern eine große und schwere Ausgabe sein, wie es wirklich schwer ist, dir war es immer ein Leichtes und mußte es in Wahrheit auch sein;", "1551": "denn dein Wesen ist von Natur so angelegt, daß du wohl den rechten Takt hättest finden können, wenn du auch keine Studien gemacht hättest;", "1552": "nun ist aber letzteres in einer Weise geschehen, die auch die schlimmste Natur veredeln könnte.", "1553": "Bei einem Manne, der, wie du, den Reizen des Geldes, der Sinnlichkeit, überhaupt den Gelüsten jeder Art zu widerstehen weiß, ja freilich, da wird's hohe Gefahr haben, daß er nicht sollte im stände sein, einen unredlichen Spekulanten, einen allzugelüstigen Staatspächter niederzuhalten!", "1554": "Wenn du nach solchen Grundsätzen lebst, werden wenigstens die Griechen in dir einen aus ihrer alten Geschichte zu erblicken glauben, wo nicht gar einen Halbgott, den der Himmel ihrer Provinz zugesandt habe.", "1555": "Ich schreibe dies hier nicht, um dir zu sagen, du sollest so und so handeln, nein damit du dich des Bewußtseins erfreuest, du handelst so und habest bisher so gehandelt.", "1556": "Ist es ja doch eine herrliche Erscheinung, wenn ein Mann drei Jahre lang in Asien mit der höchsten Amtsgewalt bekleidet gewesen ist, ohne je durch eine der vielen Lockungen, welche die dortige Provinz bietet, sei es eine Bildsäule, ein Gemälde, ein Prachtgefäß, ein Gewand, ein Sklave oder sonst eine Schönheit oder eine Gelegenheit zur Bereicherung, von der Bahn der reinsten Unbescholtenheit und Selbst­ beherrschung sich abbringen zu lassen.", "1557": "Ich wüßte aber nichts in der Welt, das außerordentlicher oder wünschenswerter wäre, als wenn eine solche Tugend, solch' gehaltenes Wesen und eine solche Selbstbeherrschung, statt in irgend einem dunkeln Winkel versteckt zu bleiben, mit ihrem Lichte leuchtet vor ganz Asien, so daß diese aus­ gezeichnete Provinz sie mit eigenen Augen sehen, alle Völker und Nationen sie mit eigenen Ohren vernehmen können;", "1558": "wenn deine Reisen daselbst keinen Schrecken unter den Leuten verbreiten, dein Aufwand die Provinz nicht erschöpft, deine Ankunft da oder dort keine Aufregung hervorruft, wenn dir vielmehr überall, wohin du kommst, nichts als Äußerungen der Freude begegnen von seiten einzelner wie ganzer Gemeinden, indem jede Stadt, jede Wohnstätte, die dich aufnimmt, in dir einen Beschützer und Gast­ freund, nicht einen Zwingherrn oder Räuber erblickt.Zn allen diesen Beziehungen hat dich aber sicherlich bereits schon die Erfahrung belehrt, daß es keineswegs hinreichend sei, wenn nur du für deine Person diese Vorzüge besitzest, daß du viel­ mehr mit aller Sorgfalt darauf bedacht sein mußt, bei dieser deiner Obhut über die Provinz nicht für dich allein, sondern für alle dir untergeordneten Beamten verantwortlich zu erscheinen, und zwar unsern Mitbürgern und dem ganzen Staat so gut wie den betref­ fenden Bundesgenossen.", "1559": "Übrigens hast du zu Unterbefehlshabern Männer, die schon für sich selbst die Würde ihrer Stellung im Auge behalten werden.", "1560": "Tubero, der erste unter ihnen an Rang, persön­ licher Würde und Alter, wird nach meinem Dafürhalten, zumal da er Geschichtschreiber ist, nicht wenige Vorbilder in seinen eigenen Jahrbüchern finden können, welche er nachzuahmen den Willen wie die Fähigkeit besitzt.", "1561": "Allienus aber ist vermöge seiner wohlwol­ lenden Gesinnung, noch mehr aber, weil er in seinem Leben uns zum Vorbild nimmt, ganz der unsrige.", "1562": "Was soll ich erst von Gratidius sagen, einem Manne, von dem ich überzeugt bin, daß bei ihm die Sorge für seine eigene Ehre mit der für die unsrige Hand in Hand geht?", "1563": "mit so brüderlicher Liebe ist er uns ja zugethan.", "1564": "Zum Quästor hast du einen Mann, den nicht eigene Wahl, sondern das Los dir gegeben hat.", "1565": "Seine Stellung fordert, daß er nicht nur aus eigenem Antrieb Maß halten, sondern auch deinen Anord­ nungen und Weisungen sich fügen muß.", "1566": "Sollte etwa der eine oder «andere von ihnen ein schmutziger Mensch sein, so würdest du ihm freien Spielraum lassen, soweit er nur auf seine Faust eine Über­ tretung derjenigen Gesetze sich zu schulden kommen ließe, welche für ihn speziell verbindlich sind, nicht aber, wenn er die Amtsbefugnis, die du ihm zur Behauptung seines Ansehens überlässest, zu eigen­ nützigen Zwecken mißbrauchte.", "1567": "Denn meine Meinung ist ganz und gar nicht, zumal bei der großen Hinneigung des gegenwärtigen Zeitgeistes zu übermäßiger Gelindigkeit und Parteilichkeit, du sollest jedem Schmutz nachgehen und einen jeden solchen Gesellen ins Ver­ hör nehmen;", "1568": "sondern ich will, daß du jedem eben nur soviel an­ vertrauest, als er Vertrauen verdient.", "1569": "So wirst du für die Leute deiner Umgebung, welche dir von Amts wegen als Gefährten und Gehilfen deiner Geschäftsführung beigegeben sind, lediglich nur innerhalb der von mir vorhin bezeichneten Grenzen einzustehen haben.", "1570": "Eine andere Bewandtnis hat es freilich mit den Personen, die du als zu deinem häuslichen Umgang oder zu unmittelbarer Bedienung gehörig mitgenommen hast, und die man gewöhnlich als die Leibwache des Statthalters bezeichnet;", "1571": "bei diesen sind wir für alle ihre Handlungen nicht allein, sondern auch für ihre Äußerungen verantwortlich.", "1572": "Du hast indessen Leute bei dir, welche du, wenn sie das Rechte thun, wohl wirst gerne haben, ganz leicht aber wirst in Schranken halten können, wenn sie mitunter vergessen, was sie deiner Ehre schuldig sind.", "1573": "Zu Anfang deiner Amtsführung hättest du bei deiner edeln Denkungsart von solchen Leuten wohl können getäuscht werden;", "1574": "denn je besser ein Mensch ist, um so schwerer fällt es ihm, andern Schlechtes zuzutrauen.", "1575": "Jetzt aber sollte dein nun­ mehriges drittes Jahr in dir einen Mann finden, der die gleich? Unbescholtenheit zeigt, wie in früheren Jahren, aber noch vorsich­ tiger und umsichtiger zu Werke geht.", "1576": "Mögest du in Zukunft dafür gelten, daß du nur hörest, was du mit eigenen Ohren vernimmst, nicht aber, was eigennützige Gewinnsucht dir einflüstert.", "1577": "Möge dein Siegelring nicht ein Geräte sein, wie jedes andere fund ein jeder­ manns Ding^, sondern wirklich der Vertreter deiner Person, nicht ein Werkzeug fremden Willens, sondern ein Zeuge deines eigenen.", "1578": "Dem Amtsdiener werde die Stelle angewiesen, die ihm unsere Vor­ fahren gegeben haben.", "1579": "Diese haben dies Amt nicht als Sinekure dem nächsten besten, sondern als einen mit Mühe verbundenen Dienst nur eben in der Regel ihren Freigelassenen übertragen und über diese so gut als über Sklaven das Regiment zu führen gewußte", "1580": "Der Viktor repräsentiere deine Milde, nicht seine eigene, die Ruten­ bündel und Richtbeile aber, die er dir vorträgt, sollen mehr deine Würde, als die dir zustehende Amtsgewalt vorstellen.", "1581": "Der ganzen Provinz endlich komme es zum Bewußtsein, daß dir nichts mehr am Herzen liege, als die Wohlfahrt, Kinder, Ehre und Wohlstand aller deiner Untergebenen.", "1582": "Schließlich sei das die allgemeine Vor­ stellung von dir, daß nicht nur, wer sich bestechen lasse, sondern auch.", "1583": "-wer zu bestechen suche, dich zum Feind haben werde, sobald du es erfahrest.", "1584": "Die Bestechung wird aber überhaupt aufhören, wenn man gewiß weiß, daß durch die Leute, welche bei dir viel zu gelten vor­ geben, in der Regel nichts bei dir ausgerichtet werde.", "1585": "Übrigens soll mit diesen meinen Vorstellungen nicht gesagt sein, daß ich dich gegen deine Leute allzu hart und argwöhnisch haben möchte.", "1586": "Wer unter ihnen im Laufe zweier Jahre niemals bei dir in den Verdacht der Habsucht gekommen ist, wie ich dies z.", "1587": "B. nach dem, was ich von ihnen höre, und wie ich sie kenne, von Cäsius, Charippus und Labro annehme, — solchen Leuten, denke ich, und andern ihres- gleichen darfst du mit vollem Recht alles überlassen und anvertrauen.", "1588": "Wer dir aber bereits Anstoß gegeben hat, an wem du etwas bemerkt hast, dem überlasse im geringsten nichts, wobei es sich um deine Ehre handelt.", "1589": "Hast du aber in der Provinz irgend einen uns zuvor Un­ bekannten gefunden, der dir volles Vertrauen abgewonnen hat, so siehe wohl zu, inwieweit ihm zu trauen ist;", "1590": "nicht als ob es unter den Provinzialen nicht viele wackere Leute geben könnte;", "1591": "indes ist dies eine Sache, die man immerhin hoffen kann, ein bestimmtes Urteil jedoch zu fällen, ist mißlich.", "1592": "Denn es gibt gar viele Verstellungs­ mittel, mit denen der wahre Charakter eines jeden Menschen verdeckt und sozusagen verschleiert wird;", "1593": "es lügen gar oftmals die Stirn, die Augen, die Mienen des Gesichts, am häufigsten freilich die Zunge.", "1594": "Wie bist du also im stände, unter solchen Leuten welche zu finden, die aus Gewinnsucht auf alle uns unentbehrlich scheinenden Lebensgenüsse verzichten und zugleich dir, einem ihnen fremden Manne, von ganzem Herzen ergeben wären, ohne dies nicht eben nur aus Eigennutz zu heucheln?", "1595": "Mir wenigstens erscheint dies als eine sehr schwere Aufgabe, zumal wenn die nämlichen Leute, die in der Regel für keinen Nichtbeamten ein Herz haben, immer jedem Statthalter zugethan sind.", "1596": "Wenn du unter ihnen etwa einen findest, von dem du überzeugt bist, daß er dir mehr persönlich als um deines Amtes willen ergeben ist, was immerhin ja möglich wäre, den laß in alle Wege gern bei dir ankommen;", "1597": "wenn du aber dessen nicht ganz gewiß bist, so ist in betreff eines vertrauten Verhältnisses bei keiner Art von Leuten mehr Behutsamkeit nötig, weil sie teils alle Mittel und Wege kennen, wie man sich Geld macht, teils alles dem Gelde zuliebe thun und ihnen auch die Rücksicht auf die Ehre eines Mannes gleichgiltig ist, mit dem sie künftig nicht zusammen­ zuleben haben.", "1598": "So ist auch namentlich den Griechen gegenüber ein gewisser Grad von Vertraulichkeit sorgfältig zu vermeiden, ganz wenige ausgenommen, in denen etwa der Geist des alten Griechen­ lands noch lebt.", "1599": "So wie es aber jetzt steht, sind sehr viele von ihnen falsch, charakterlos und infolge der langen Knechtschaft wahre Meister in der Kunst, übermäßig zu Gefallen zu reden.", "1600": "Mein Rat ist, ihnen im allgemeinen freundlich entgegenzukommen, mit den besten darunter auch als Gastfreund in nähere Verbindung zu treten, allzu große Vertraulichkeit dagegen zu meiden;", "1601": "dazu fehlt es ihnen an der gehörigen Zuverlässigkeit;", "1602": "denn sie wagen nicht unsern Wünschen entgegenzutreten und hegen Mißgunst nicht allein gegen unsere Landsleute sondern auch gegen die ihrigen.Da ich in betreff der erwähnten Verhältnisse dir Vorsicht und Behutsamkeit ans Herz lege, so daß ich fast fürchten muß, ich möchte zu 'hart im Urteil sein, kannst du dir nun auch denken, was für eine Gesinnung rücksichtlich der Sklaven ich habe.", "1603": "Man muß sie, man mag sein, wo man will, ganz besonders ocker in den Provinzen, in Zucht halten.", "1604": "Es lasten sich hierüber eine Menge Regeln geben, die kürzeste und am ehesten ausführbare ist die, sie sollen sich auf deinen asiatischen Amtsreisen ganz so betragen, als ob du mit ihnen auf der appischen Straße eine Reise machtest, und es darf für sie kein Unterschied sein, ob sie nach Tralles oder nach Formiä kommen.", "1605": "Zeichnet sich einer deiner Sklaven, durch Treue aus, nun so beweise er's in deinen häuslichen und Privatangelegenheiten;", "1606": "aber von allem, was zu deinem Amt als Statthalter gehört, von allen Staatsangelegenheiten bleibe er fern.", "1607": "Denn vieles, was man recht gut treuen Sklaven anvertrauen könnte, darf ihnen doch nicht anvertraut werden, um das Gerede und den Tadel zu vermeiden.", "1608": "Doch ich bin unwillkürlich und unvermerkt ins Lehrmeistern hineingekommen, was doch anfangs nicht meine Absicht war.", "1609": "Denn was soll ich einem Ntanne Lehren geben, der, wie ich wohl weiß, zumal auf dem fraglichen Gebiet, an Einsicht mir nicht nachsteht, an Erfahrung aber noch überlegen ist?", "1610": "Indessen dachte ich, es würde dir selbst erfreulich sein, wenn du die Grundsätze, nach denen du handelst, auch noch durch meine Stimme bestätigt fändest.", "1611": "So seien denn die Grundpfeiler deines amtlichen Auftretens fürs erste deine persönliche Unbescholtenheit und Selbstbeherrschung, sodann von seiten deiner ganzen Umgebung ein Halten auf anständiges Benehmen;", "1612": "ferner umsichtige Behutsamkeit bei der Wahl von Ver­ trauten unter den ^römischenZ Provinzialen wie unter den Griechen, und ernste, konsequente Zucht gegenüber deinen Sklaven.", "1613": "Wenn solche Grundsätze schon hier zu Lande in unserm täglichen Leben und in Privatverhältnissen den Ehrenmann machen, so muß man mit denselben auf einem so bedeutenden Amtsposten, bei der dor­ . tigen Sittenverderbnis, in einer Provinz, die so viel Verführerisches hat, notwendig fast als ein Gott erscheinen.", "1614": "Beobachtest du für dich selbst und andere diese Haltung und Zucht, so bist du auch im stände, bei Anordnungen und Bescheiden, die du zu geben hast, die gehörige Strenge zu behaupten, wie du dies denn auch wirklich bei einzelnen Vorfällen schon bewiesen hast, die uns zu meiner großen Freude die Feindschaft von dem und jenem zugezogen haben.", "1615": "Denn du traust mir doch wohl zu, daß ich mir's nicht sehr zu Herzen gehen lasse, wenn mir ein gewisser Paeonius, ein Mensch, der nicht einmal ein Grieche, sondern ein Phrygier oder Mysier ist, etwas vorklagt, oder ein Tuseenius ein Geschrei erhebt, dieser tolle und schmutzige Mensch, dem du mit vollem Fug und Recht den Gegenstand seiner schändlichen Gelüste aus dem unsaubern Rachen gerissen hast.In diesen und sonstigen Fällen liebe sich von uns eine solche Strenge, wie du sie in. deiner Provinz bewiesen hast, nicht wohl durchführen, wenn sie nicht von der größten Unbescholtenheit begleitet wäre.", "1616": "Es mag daher immerhin in der Rechtspflege die äußerste Strenge herrschen, nur muß man sich darin gleich bleiben und sich nicht durch parteiische Rücksichten umstimmen lassen.", "1617": "Indessen hilft es noch nicht viel, wenn nur du für deine Person bei gerichtlichen Entscheidungen dir gleich bleibst und gewissenhaft bist, falls nicht dasselbe von allen geschieht, denen du irgend einen Teil von diesem deinem Amte überläßt.", "1618": "Übrigens sind, wie mir scheint, die Geschäfte bei der Verwaltung von Asien nicht eben sehr mannigfaltig, sondern gehen fast ganz in der Rechtspflege auf.", "1619": "Was man dabei zu wissen braucht, ist, zumal in der Provinz, ziemlich einfach;", "1620": "nur konsequent und fest muß man auftreten, so daß man keine Partei­ lichkeit sich erlaubt, nicht einmal einen Verdacht davon aufkommen läßt.", "1621": "Nebstdem beweise man sich gefällig im Anhören der Parteien, milde im Bescheid geben, umsichtig in Befriedigung der einzelnen Ansprüche und in der Erörterung der Streitfragen.", "1622": "Durch ein solches Benehmen hat sich unlängst C. Octavius sehr beliebt ge­ macht;", "1623": "bei ihm durfte der erste Viktor sich nicht rühren, der Amts­ diener mußte schweigen, jeder durfte reden, so oft und so lange er nur wollte.", "1624": "Dieses Verfahren hätte vielleicht können als zu große Milde erscheinen, aber eben damit deckte er sich gegen den Vorwurf allzu großer Strenge, als er dazumal die Anhänger Sullas zwang, alles wieder herauszugeben, was sie durch Gewalt und Einschüchte­ rung an sich gebracht hatten.", "1625": "Den ungerechten Verordnungen, die dieselben während ihrer Amtsführung hatten ergehen lassen, mußten sie nun in ihrem Privatstande sich fügen und dieselben für Recht gelten lassen.", "1626": "Diese seine Strenge hätte müssen als hart erscheinen, wäre sie nicht durch viele Beweise von Menschenfreundlichkeit gemil­ dert und versüßt worden.", "1627": "Wenn man nun aber eine solche Milde schon in Rom gern sieht, wo so große Anmaßung, so ungemäßigte Freiheit, so unbegrenzte Frechheit herrscht, ja wo hinwiederum so viele Behörden, so viele Wege, zu seinem Recht zu kommen, ein Volk mit solcher Machtfülle, ein mit solchem Ansehen bekleideter Senat besteht;", "1628": "wie erwünscht muß die Leutseligkeit eines Prätors erst in Asien sein, dort, wo eine so große Bevölkerung, römische Bürger und Bundesgenossen, so viele Städte, so viele Gemeinden auf den Wink eines Mannes schauen, über dem keine höhere Zn­ stanz steht, an die man apellieren, bei der man ihn verklagen könnte, wo kein Senat, keine Volksversammlung sich findet?", "1629": "Es muß daher einer ein wahrhaft großer Mann sein, nicht nur von Natur mit gutem Takte begabt, sondern auch vielseitig unterrichtet und hochgebildet, wenn er in solcher Stellung sich so zu halten weiß, daß seine Untergebenen keine weitere Macht über ihm ver­ missen.Xenophon läßt in seiner Cyropädie, in der er nicht ein histo­ risch treues Bild gibt, sondern vom philosophischen Standpunkt das Ideal eines Herrschers aufstellt, in seinem Helden die höchste Würde mit ausgezeichneter Leutseligkeit sich paaren.", "1630": "Nicht ohne Grund hat daher unser großer Africanus jene Schrift fast nie aus den Händen gelegt;", "1631": "denn es ist darin nichts übergangen, was zur Aufgabe eines umsichtigen und taktvollen Herrschers gehört.", "1632": "Hat nun aber ein Cyrus, der bestimmt war, immer im Besitz der Herrschaft zu bleiben, auf diese beiden Eigenschaften so hohen Wert gelegt, wie viel mehr müssen Männer daran festhalten, denen ein Herrscheramt verliehen ist, das sie wieder abgeben müssen, und denen es durch eine Ver­ fassung verliehen ist, unter die sie sich selbst wieder zu stellen haben?", "1633": "Überhaupt muß meiner Ansicht nach für solche, die über andere gestellt sind, das höchste Prinzip sein, so zu handeln, daß die ihnen Untergebenen sich so wohl befinden, als möglich ist.", "1634": "Daß dies auch für dich von Anfang an, seitdem du Asien betreten hast, heiliges Anliegen war und noch ist, das ist immer und überall, wo man von dir reden hörte, einstimmig von dir gerühmt worden.", "1635": "Wie sollte aber auch ein Mann, der an der Spitze unserer Verbündeten und Mitbürger steht, nicht die Pflicht haben, für deren Vorteil und - Nutzen zu sorgen, wenn dies sogar jemand thun muß, der über Sklaven, ja über vernunftloses Vieh gesetzt ist?", "1636": "Es wird auch, wie ich sehe, allgemein anerkannt, daß du in dieser Richtung die gewissenhafteste Thätigkeit entwickelst.", "1637": "Man hört, die Gemeinden machen nicht nur keine neuen Schulden, sondern sehen sich durch dich vielfach von den alten, die schwer auf ihnen lasteten, befreit;", "1638": "mehrere zerstörte und beinahe ganz verödete Städte, darunter die zwei hoch­ berühmten Hauptstädte von Zonien und Carien, Samus und Hali­ <arnassus, haben dir ihre Wiederherstellung zu danken;", "1639": "verschwunden seien in den Städten die inneren Unruhen, verschwunden die Zerwürfnisse;", "1640": "du tragest Sorge, daß die Leitung der öffentlichen Angelegenheiten in den Händen der guten Bürger sei;", "1641": "beseitigt seien die Räubereien in Mysien;", "1642": "den Mordthaten sei in vielen Gegenden Einhalt gethan;", "1643": "in der ganzen Provinz ein fester Friedensstand begründet;", "1644": "auch die Diebstähle und Räubereien seien abgestellt, nicht nur die gewöhnlichen auf den Straßen und dem platten Lande, sondern auch diejenigen, welche in noch weit größerer Anzahl und größerem Umfang in den Tempeln und Städten verübt wurden;", "1645": "die Begüterten haben für ihren Ruf, ihr Vermögen, ihre Ruhe nichts mehr zu befürchten von böswilliger Anschuldigung, diesem so verhaßten Werkzeuge der Habsucht der Statthalter;", "1646": "der Aufwand und die Abgaben der einzelnen Gemeinden seien unter alle Bezirks­ angehörigen gleichmäßig verteilt und darum nicht drückend;", "1647": "der Zutritt zu dir sei sehr erleichert;", "1648": "dein Ohr offen für jedermanns Klagen, keinem, wie hilflos und alleinstehend er auch sei, sei der Weg zu dir verschlossen, und zwar nicht bloß an öffentlichen Audienz- und Gerichtstagen, sondern auch wenn du in deiner Privat­ wohnung, auf deinem Zimmer dich befindest;", "1649": "kurz dein ganzes Regiment zeige keine Spur von Härte, von Grausamkeit, sondern sei vielmehr lauter Güte, Milde und Menschenfreundlichkeit.", "1650": "Welch große Wohlthat hast du der Provinz Asien namentlich dadurch erwiesen, daß du sie, nicht ohne bedeutende Verdrießlich­ keiten für uns, von der unbilligen und drückenden Steuer an die Aedilen befreit hast!", "1651": "Denn wenn schon einer unserer Edeln sich öffentlich beklagt, du habest ihm durch deine Verordnung, es dürfen keine Gelder zu den Spielen dekretiert werden, zweimalhundert­ tausend Sesterzien aus der Tasche genommen;", "1652": "welche Summe müßte erst bezahlt werden, wenn, wie es bereits eingeführt war, die Auf­ lage im Namen aller, die nur in Rom Spiele geben, gemacht würde?", "1653": "Indes habe ich unsern Leuten mit ihren Klagen, den Mund gestopft durch meinen Entschluß, von dem ich nicht weiß, wie er in Asien aufgenommen worden ist, der mir aber jedenfalls in Rom große Bewunderung und Lobsprüche zugezogen hat.", "1654": "Die Städte hatten ja zu einem Tempel und einem Denkmal für uns Geld bewilligt und hatten dies in dankbarer Anerkennung meiner großen Verdienste und all des Guten, das du in noch höherem Maße ihnen erwiesen hast, mit größter Bereitwilligkeit gethan;", "1655": "das Gesetz macht ausdrücklich die Ausnahme, daß für einen Tempel und ein Denkmal Geld genommen werden dürfe;", "1656": "auch wären die Gaben nicht verloren gegangen, sondern in einem schönen Tempel erhalten geblieben, so daß es nicht sowohl einer Schenkung an mich als an das römische Volk und die ewigen Götter gleichsah.", "1657": "Obgleich nun aber in diesem Falle das persönliche Verdienst, das Gesetz und der freie Wille der Geber für die Annahme sprachen, glaubte ich doch ablehnen zu müssen, unter anderm namentlich auch aus dem Beweggrund, damit Leute, die ^in der Provinz^ nichts verdient haben, und die nichts nehmen dürfen, dies um so eher verschmerzen können.", "1658": "Deshalb halte nur mit ganzer Seele und allem Eifer an dem bisher von dir befolgten System fest, daß du die Völker, welche der Senat und das Volk von Rom deiner Redlichkeit und Obhut übergeben und anvertraut haben, liebst, sie in jeglicher Weise schützest und möglichst glücklich zu machen trachtest.", "1659": "Hätte dich das Los getroffen, als Statthalter über wilde und barbarische Völker, Afrikaner, Spanier, Gallier u. dgl., gesetzt zu sein, so würde dennoch deine Menschenfreundlichkeit es dir zur Pflicht machen, ihrem Wohlstand und Interesse, ihrer Wohlfahrt überhaupt deine Dienste zu widmen.", "1660": "Nun aber da wir über ein Volk gesetzt sind, das nicht nur für sich selbst im Besitz edlerer Bildung ist, sondern auch dafür gilt, sie andern mitgeteilt zu haben, so sind wir jedenfalls schuldig, uns als Männer von Bildung zu zeigen gegenüber einem Volke, dem wir dieselbe zu verdanken haben.", "1661": "Denn je mehr ich mir sagen darf, daß auf meinem Leben und Wirken kein Verdacht der Trägheit oder des Leichtsinns laste, um so weniger schäme ich mich dermalen des Geständnisses, daß ich das, was ich bin, durch die Studien und praktischen Übungen geworden bin, die uns durch griechische Werke und Schulen vermittelt sind.", "1662": "Daher glaube ich, daß wir außer den allgemeinen Pflichten treuer Dienstleistung, zu der man gegen jeder­ mann verpflichtet ist, dieser Nation noch ganz besonders das schuldig sind, daß wir an ihr, deren Unterricht wir unsere Kenntnisse ver­ danken, das zu bethätigen suchen, was wir von ihr gelernt haben.Hat ja doch Plato, der geistvollste und gebildetste Mann, die Ansicht ausgesprochen, die Staaten würden dann erst ganz glücklich sein, wenn entweder wissenschaftlich gebildete und weise Männer das Regiment in ihnen bekämen, oder aber diejenigen, welche das Regiment haben, all ihr Streben auf eine solche Bildung und Weis­ heit gerichtet sein ließen.", "1663": "Man sieht, er dachte sich, wie diese Ver­ bindung von Macht und Weisheit eine Quelle der Wohlfahrt für die Staaten sein könnte.", "1664": "Ein solches Glück ist vielleicht einmal unserm Gesamtvaterlande widerfahren, jedenfalls aber gegenwärtig der von dir verwalteten Provinz, daß nämlich die oberste Gewalt in den Händen eines Mannes ist, der von frühester Jugend an den größten Fleiß und die meiste Zeit darauf verwendet hat, sich allseitige Bil­ dung des Geistes und Herzens anzueignen.", "1665": "Laß dir's daher angelegen sein, daß das Jahr, um welches deine mühevolle Amtsführung verlängert worden ist, zugleich als eine beabsichtigte Verlängerung der Wohlfahrt Asiens erscheint;", "1666": "und da es nun einmal diesem Lande besser geglückt, dich zu behalten, als mir, dich herzubekommen, so bringe es durch dein Wirken dahin, daß meine Sehnsucht nach dir durch die Freude der Provinz gelindert werde.", "1667": "Denn wenn du es dir mehr, als irgend jemand, angelegen sein ließest, die großen, meines Wissens beispiellosen Ehrenbezeigungen, die dir erwiesen worden sind, zu verdienen, so mußt du es dir noch weit mehr an­ gelegen sein lassen, dich fortan derselben würdig zu erhalten.", "1668": "Wie ich über derartige Ehrenbezeigungen denke, habe ich dir früher geschrieben.", "1669": "Stets war meine Ansicht, sie haben, wenn sie zu gemein gemacht würden, gar keinen Wert, seien auch von keinem Gewicht, wenn sie bloß eine der Stellung dargebrachte Huldigung sind;", "1670": "werden sie dagegen, wie es bei dir der Fall war, persönlichen Verdiensten verliehen, so muß man — das war stets meine Überzeugung — alles aufbieten, sich ihrer würdig zu erhalten.", "1671": "Weil du denn als Inhaber der höchsten Militär- und Civilgewalt dich in Städten befindest, in denen du deine Verdienste ganz vergöttert siehst, so wirst du bei allen deinen Anordnungen, allen Bescheiden, bei allem, was du thust, bedenken, was du Leuten schuldig bist, die so viel auf dich halten, dich so hoch schätzen und so glänzend ehren.", "1672": "Zu erkennen geben wirst du dies aber dadurch, daß du für alle sorgst, den Leuten hilfst, wo ihre Interessen gefährdet sind, ihr Bestes im Auge behältst, und gern ein Vater von Asien heißt und dafür giltst.Nun legen freilich deinem guten Willen und deiner gewissen­ haften Fürsorge die Staatspächter große Schwierigkeit in den Weg.", "1673": "Treten wir ihnen entgegen, so entfremden wir nicht nur uns, sondern auch dem Staate einen Stand, der sich um uns große Verdienste erworben und sich, durch mich bestimmt, ans Vaterland eng an­ geschlossen hat;", "1674": "dagegen wenn wir ihnen in allem zu Willen sind, so lassen wir Leute ganz zu Grunde gehen, deren Existenz wir nicht nur im allgemeinen zu erhalten, sondern deren Wohlstand zu fördern wir schuldig sind.", "1675": "Dies ist, die Sache genau betrachtet, die einzige Schwierigkeit in deinem ganzen Amte.", "1676": "Denn, uneigennützig sein, seine Leidenschaften beherrschen, seine Leute in Schranken halten, Gerechtigkeit unparteiisch handhaben, ein freundliches Benehmen bei Untersuchungen, wenn jemand etwas vorzubringen und uns zu sprechen wünscht, alles das ist sehr schön, eigentlich schwer aber kann man es nicht nennen.", "1677": "Denn es gehört dazu nicht irgendwelche Anstrengung, sondern nur eben ein entschiedener Willensentschluß.", "1678": "Welche Erbitterung aber das Treiben der Staatspächter bei unsern Verbündeten verursacht, davon habe ich mich unlängst überzeugt, da unsere eigenen Mitbürger, als es sich um Aufhebung der Hafenzölle handelte, nicht sowohl über den Zoll an und für sich, als über einige Rechtsverletzungen der Zolleinnehmer Klage führten.", "1679": "Darum kann ich mir wohl denken, wie es unsern Verbündeten in den entferntesten Provinzen geht, da ich in Italien die eigenen Mitbürger habe klagen hören.", "1680": "Hierbei nun dich so zu benehmen, daß du einesteils die Staatspächter, zumal bei ihrer Mißstimmung über ihren ungünstigen Pachtkontrakt, zufrieden stellst, andernteils unsere Verbündeten nicht zu Grunde gehen lässest:", "1681": "dazu gehört, wie mir dünkt, eine über­ menschliche Persönlichkeit, das heißt eine solche, wie du eine bist.", "1682": "Nun aber sollte doch fürs erste den Griechen gerade das, was das Drückendste ist, nämlich daß sie überhaupt steuerpflichtig sind, nicht so schmerzlich vorkommen, weil sie dies schon nach ihren eigenen Einrichtungen waren, ohne den Römern unterworfen zu sein.", "1683": "Der Name Staatspächter kann ihnen aber nicht zuwider sein;", "1684": "waren sie ja doch nicht im stände, ohne Mithilfe solcher Pächter die Kontri­ bution zu bezahlen, welche Sulla ihnen unter gleichmäßiger Ver­ teilung auferlegt hatte.", "1685": "Daß aber im Eintreiben von Steuern Griechen nicht milder verfahren, als unsere Staatspächter, läßt sich daraus abnehmen, daß unlängst die Bewohner von Caunus, ja alle von Sulla den Rhodiern

stets steuerpflichtig waren, über den Namen Staatspächter sich nicht entsetzen, und weder diejenigen sich daran stoßen^ welche die Steuer selbst nicht aufbringen konnten.", "1687": "noch die sich

einem mäßigen Teil seines Landertrages sich ununterbrochenen Frieden und ruhiges Dasein zu erkaufen.", "1690": "Haben sie aber einmal keinen Widerwillen mehr gegen Wesen und Namen eines Staatspächters an und für sich, so ist es deiner Einsicht und Klugheit leicht möglich, ihnen auch das weitere, was damit zusammenhängt, in einem milderen Lichte erscheinen zu lassen.", "1691": "So kannst du ihnen z. B. erlauben, bei Abschluß ihrer Verträge vom Buchstaben des von den Zensoren abgefaßten Kontrakts an­ sehen und mehr nur das ins Auge zu fassen, wie das Geschäft am bequemsten und mit der geringsten Belästigung sich abmachen lasse.", "1692": "Du kannst ferner, wie du es in trefflicher Weise schon gethan hast und noch thust, in Erinnerung bringen, welch eine würdige Stellung im Staate diese Pächter einnehmen, wie viel wir diesem Stande verdanken;", "1693": "und so kann ohne Anwendung amtlicher Vollmacht und Strafgewalt ein gutes Vernehmen zwischen Griechen und Staats­ pächtern schon durch die Rücksicht auf dich und deinen persönlichen Einfluß Zustandekommen.", "1694": "Übrigens darfst du wohl auch an Leute, um die du die größten Verdienste hast, und welche dir alles zu verdanken haben, die Forderung stellen, daß sie durch ihre eigene Willfährigkeit es uns möglich machen, die enge Verbindung, in der wir mit den Staatspächtern stehen, ungestört zu erhalten.", "1695": "Doch was

ergehen ja an mich tägliche Danksagungen von dm ehrenwertesten und größten Pachtgesellschasten, und das eben ist mir um so erfreulicher, weil die Griechen das Gleiche thun.", "1697": "Es ist freilich schwer, da, wo die Interessen, die eigenen Vorteile so weit auseinander liegen und ein fast natürlicher Gegensatz besteht, Einmütigkeit herzustellen.", "1698": "Aber alles Obige ist nicht geschrieben, um dir Lehren zu geben, — ein Mann von deiner Einsicht bedarf ja von niemand solcher Wei­ sungen — sondern weil mir's unter dem Niederschreiben eine Freude war, deiner tüchtigen Wirksamkeit zu gedenken.", "1699": "Doch bin ich bei Abfassung dieses Briefes weitläufiger geworden als ich beabsich­ tigte oder es zu werden geglaubt hätte.Es ist nur ein einziger Punkt, über den ich dir unaufhörlich gute Lehren geben muß, und in betreff dessen ich, so viel an mir ist, verhüten möchte, daß deinem Lob sich ein Aber anhängt.", "1700": "Wer nämlich aus deiner Gegend kommt, spricht von deiner Tüchtigkeit, deiner Unbescholtenheit, deiner Menschenfreundlichkeit und findet alles an dir höchlich zu loben, ausgenommen deinen Jähzorn.", "1701": "Wenn dieser Fehler schon im gemeinen, täglichen Leben für Schwäche und Mangel an Charakterfestigkeit gilt, so gibt es wirklich nichts Unschöneres, als wenn die höchste Behörde neben ihrer Amts­ gewalt noch in der eigenen Persönlichkeit etwas Herbes fühlen läßt.", "1702": "Ich will mich nun zwar nicht damit abgeben, dir auseinander zu setzen, was die gebildetsten Männer jederzeit als ihre Ansicht über den Jähzorn aussprechen, da ich nicht zu weitläufig werden möchte und du das Betreffende in vielen Schriften leicht nachlesen kannst;", "1703": "wohl aber glaube ich das nicht unterlassen zu dürfen, was die eigentliche Aufgabe eines Briefes ist, daß man nämlich die Person, an die man schreibt, in Kenntnis setzt von dem, was sie nicht weiß.", "1704": "Bei allen, die mir von dir Meldung thun, herrscht eine Stimme:", "1705": "du seiest der liebenswürdigste Mensch von der Welt, wenn du keinen Zorn habest;", "1706": "dagegen, wenn du durch irgend eine Schlechtigkeit und Verkehrtheit affiziert werdest, so werdest du so aufgeregt, daß man - in dir den sonst so humanen Mann gar nicht mehr erkenne.", "1707": "Da uns nun aber nicht sowohl etwa Begierde nach Ruhm, als vielmehr eben nur die Umstände und das Glück in eine solche Lebensstellung ge­ bracht haben, daß die Leute ewig von uns reden werden, so laß uns doch, so weit es uns immer möglich Md erreichbar ist, zu verhüten suchen, daß man uns irgend einen auffallenden Fehler nachsagen kann.", "1708": "Damit will ich nicht auf etwas dringen, was vielleicht über­ haupt der menschlichen Natur schwer fällt, ganz besonders aber, wenn man schon in einem Alter steht, wie wir, nämlich auf gänz­ liche Umänderung und plötzliche Beseitigung eines mit dem Charakter ganz verwachsenen Zuges in unserem Wesen.", "1709": "Aber daran möchte ich mahnen, falls du den Fehler nicht ganz vermeiden kannst — man wird nämlich manchmal vom Zorn überrascht, bevor die Ver­ nunft dagegen sich vorzusehen vermag —;", "1710": "du sollst dich schon vor­ her zusammennehmen und tagtäglich dir den Gedanken nahe legen, man müsse dieser Leidenschaft Widerstand leisten und müsse, wenn man davon innerlich am meisten aufgeregt ist, dann um so sorgfäl­ tiger seine Zunge im Zaume halten, was meiner Ansicht nach biswei­ len eben so viel Kraft erfordert, als die Meisterschaft über den Zorn selbst.", "1711": "Denn das letztere ist nicht bloß das Verdienst der Charakter­ stärke, sondern mitunter auch Folge geringer Reizbarkeit, dagegen in der Aufwallung des Zorns noch Herr seiner Leidenschaft und seiner Worte zu bleiben, oder sogar zu schweigen, und die innere Bewegung sowie den Verdruß in seiner Gewalt zu behalten, das zeugt, wenn auch nicht von vollkommener Weisheit, doch wenigstens von mehr als gemeiner Geisteskraft.", "1712": "Und wirklich sollst du, wie ich mir sagen lasse, in diesem Punkte um ein Gutes geschmeidiger und milder geworden sein.", "1713": "Man berichtet mir von dir keine heftigeren Aufwallungen/ keine Schmähworte, keine ehrenbeleidigenden Äuße­ rungen, was alles für einen wirklich durchgebildeten Menschen sich nicht ziemt, für einen Mann aber, der in hohem Amt und Würden steht, vollends ganz und gar nicht paßt Denn ist man bei seinen Ausbrüchen des Zorns zu keiner Versöhnlichkeit geneigt, so ist äußerste Härte die Folge davon, — läßt man sich aber erbitten, so­ erscheint man äußerst schwach;", "1714": "indessen wäre das letztere, wenn zwischen zwei Übeln zu wählen ist, doch noch vorzuziehen.Da nun leider dein erstes Amtsjahr in betreff dieses Tadels sehr viel von sich reden gemacht hat, vermutlich deshalb, weil dir die Ungerechtigkeiten, die Habsucht und Anmaßlichkeit der Leute ganz unerwartet waren und unerträglich erschienen, — dein zweites Jahr aber um vieles mehr Milde zeigte, sofern Gewohnheit und besonnene Überlegung, zum Teil auch, wie ich mir schmeichle, meine Briefe dich geduldiger und milder stimmten;", "1715": "so sollte nun dein drittes Jahr so fehlerfrei sein, daß niemand auch nur das Ge­ ringste zu tadeln vermag.", "1716": "Und so sei dir denn nicht die Ermahnung nicht die Weisung, sondern die brüderliche Bitte ans Herz gelegt.", "1717": "du mögest all dein Sinnen, Dichten und Trachten darauf richten, dir allgemeines und allseitiges Lob zu erwerben.", "1718": "Wären wir Brüder in der alltäglichen Stellung, die wenig von sich reden und rühmen macht, so erginge an dich nicht die Forderung, etwas Aus­ gezeichnetes, Außergewöhnliches zu leisten.", "1719": "Nun aber hat der Wir­ kungskreis, in den wir gestellt worden sind, unserem Namen einen solchen Glanz und eine solche Bedeutung verliehen, daß es uns wohl nicht möglich sein wird, dem schärfsten Tadel zu entgehen, wofern deine Verwaltung der Provinz uns nicht hohen Ruhm bringt.", "1720": "Wir stehen nun eben einmal in einem ganz besonderen Verhältnis sowohl zu den Gutgesinnten als auch zu den Schlechten.", "1721": "Während die ersteren insgesamt uns zugethan sind, aber in dem­ selben Maße auch von uns durchaus gewissenhaftes und tüchtiges Wirken verlangen und erwarten, darf man annehmen, daß die Schlechtgesinnten alle, weil wir ihnen ewige Fehde erklärt haben, auch die geringste Blöße, die wir ihrem Tadel darbieten, mit Freu­ den wahrnehmen.", "1722": "Weil du denn also deine Rolle auf einem Theater zu spielen hast, das die größte Menge von Zuschauern hat und an Umfang seinesgleichen sucht, in welchem der gebildetste Geschmack das Urteil spricht, und das zugleich so gelegen ist, daß man alle Worte und Zeichen des Beifalls oder Tadels bis nach Rom ver­ nimmt:", "1723": "so biete doch alle Kraft und Mühe auf, daß man sieht, du seiest nicht nur würdig, auf einer solchen Schaubühne aufzutreten, sondern du seiest mit deinen Leistungen hinter all dem, was ein solcher Platz verlange, nicht zurückgeblieben.", "1724": "Und weil denn der Zufall mir meinen öffentlichen Wirkungs­ kreis unter den Behörden in der Stadt, dir in der Provinz an­ gewiesen hat, so suche du auf deinem Posten es den andern zuvorzu­ thun, wie ich auf dem meinigen hinter keinem zurückstehe.", "1725": "Zugleich bedenke, daß wir nicht um einen Ruhm uns zu bemühen haben, den erst die Zukunft bringen soll, den wir erst zu hoffen hätten, sondern daß wir einen schon erworbenen Ruhm verfechten;", "1726": "ihn zu erstreben, mochte seiner Zeit weniger unsere Pflicht sein, als dermalen uns obliegt, ihn zu wahren.", "1727": "Wäre mein Interesse in irgend einem Stück von dem deinigen getrennt, so hätte ich in der Stellung, die ich mir errungen habe, nichts weiter zu wünschen.", "1728": "Nun aber verhält sich's so, daß ich, wenn nicht alles, was du in deiner Provinz thust und redest, meinem Wirken entspricht, es so ansehen müßte, als hätte ich mit den großen Mühen und großen Gefahren, an welchen allen du Anteil genommen hast, nichts gewonnen.", "1729": "Habe ich den großen Namen, den ich mir erworben, vor allen anderen deiner Beihülfe zu danken, nun so wirst du gewiß auch vor andern keine Mühe sparen, denselben zu erhalten.", "1730": "Es sind nicht allein die Stimmen und Urteile der Mitwelt, auf die du Rücksicht zu nehmen hast, sondern auch die der Nachwelt, und zwar wird die letztere erst noch ein richtigeres Urteil fällen, da neidische Verkleinerung und Übel­ wollen darauf keinen Einfluß mehr üben wird.", "1731": "Endlich mußt du auch das noch bedenken, daß du nicht für deine Person allein Ruhm erstrebst, wiewohl du auch in diesem Fall nicht gleichgiltig damit verfahren dürstest, zumal da du eingewilligt hast, daß man deinen Namen durch so herrliche Denkmäler verewigt hat;", "1732": "nein du hast ihn mit mir zu teilen, hast ihn als Vermächtnis unsern Kindern zu hinterlasse«.", "1733": "Zn diesem Betracht hast du darüber zu wachen, daß es nicht, im Falle du dir etwa Gleichgiltigkeit zu schulden kommen lässest, den Anschein hat, du habest nicht nur für dich selbst schlecht gesorgt, sondern auch den Deinigen nichts gegönnt.", "1734": "Was ich hier sage, hat nicht etwa den Zweck, dich mit meiner Ansprache aus dem Schlafe zu rütteln, als vielmehr dich in dei­ nem Laufe noch mehr anzuspornen.", "1735": "Denn, wie bisher, wirft du fortwährend dahin wirken, daß deine Billigkeit, Mäßigung, Strenge und Unbescholtenheit allgemeine Anerkennung finden.", "1736": "Allein mich beseelt eben infolge meiner außerordentlichen Liebe eine grenzen­ lose Begierde, dich berühmt zu sehen;", "1737": "wiewohl ich überzeugt bin, da dir Asien so bekannt sein muß, wie jeglichem sein eigenes Haus, und da nunmehr deiner großen Einsicht so reiche Erfahrung zur Seite steht, so könne es in Sachen, die Anerkennung bringen, nichts geben, das du nicht aufs beste durchschautest und dir, auch ohne daß dich jemand dazu aufmuntert, selbst Tag für Tag zu Ge­ müte führtest.", "1738": "Allein weil mir's, wenn ich deine Briefe lese, gerade so ist, als hörte ich dich, und, wenn ich an dich schreibe, als spräche ich mit dir:", "1739": "so macht mir deshalb nicht nur ein Brief von dir
