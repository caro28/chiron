B.C. 30, a period of about one hundred years, the Roman State was convulsed by revolutions which grew out of the contest between the People and the Nobility, or rather, out of the contests between the leaders of these two bodies.", "3": "This period is the subject of Appian's History of the Civil Wars of the Romans, in Five Books.", "4": "Appian begins with the Tribu­ nate and legislation of Tiberius Gracchus, from which he proceeds to the Dictatorship of Bulla, and then to the quarrels between Pompeius and Caesar, and Cæsar's Dictatorship and assassination.", "5": "He then proceeds to the history of the Triumvirate formed after Cæsar's death by ais great nephew Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus, Marcus Antonius, and Lepidus, the quarrels of the Triumviri, the downfall of Lepidus, who was reduced to the condition of a private person, and the death of Sextus Pompeius, the last support of the party in whose cause his father, Cneius Pompeius, lost his life.", "6": "The remainder of this History, which is lost, carried the narration down to the quarrels of Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, which ended in the defeat of Antonius in the battle of Actium, B.C. 31, and his death in Egypt, B.C. 30.", "7": "The victory over Antonius placed all the power in the hands of Octavianus, who, in the year B.C. 27, received from the Roman Senate the title of Augustus, or the Sacred, by which name he is commonly known as the first of the long series of Roman Emperors. \"", "8": "He made himself,\" says Appian (Civil Wars, i. 5), \"like Caius Julius Cæsar, and still more than Cæsar, governor of his country and of all the nations under it, without needing either election or the popular votes, or any show of such things.", "9": "After his government had subsisted for a long time, and been maintained with vigour, fortunate in all his measures, and feared, he left behind him descendants and succes­ sors who kept the power that he transmitted to them.", "10": "In this way, after various civil commotions, the Roman State was restored to tranquillity, and the government became a Monarchy.", "11": "And how this came about I have explained, and brought together all the events, which are well worth the study of those who wish to become acquainted with ambition of men unbounded, love of power excessive, endurance unwearied, and forms of suffering infinite.,, Thus, the historian's object was to trace the establishment of the Imperial power in Rome back to its origin, to show that the contests of the rival heads of parties involved the State in endless calamities, which resulted in a dissolution of all the bonds that hel society together, and rendered the assumption of supreme power by one man a healing and a necessary event.", "12": "As already observed, it happens that thirteen of Plutarch's extant Lives are the lives of the most distin­ guished of the Romans who lived during this eventful period;", "13": "and though Plutarch's Lives severally are not histories of the times to which they respectively refer, nor collectively form a History of any given time, yet they are valuable as portraits of illustrious men, and help us to form a better judgment of those who make so conspicuous a figure in History.", "14": "Plutarch was a native of the town of Chæroneia, in Bœotia ;", "15": "the times of his birth and death are not exactly known, but we learn from his own works that he was a young student at Delphin, in the thirteenth year of the reign ofthe Emperor Nero, A.D. 66.", "16": "—He visited both Italy and Rome, and probably resided at Rome for some time.", "17": "He wrote his Life of Demosthenes, at least after his return to Chaeroneia:", "18": "he says (Life of Demosthenes, c. 2), that he had not time to exercise himself in the Latin Language during his residence at Rome, being much occupied with public business, and giving lessons in philosophy.", "19": "Accordingly it was late before he began to read the Latin writers;", "20": "and we may infer from his own words that he never acquired a very exact know­ ledge of the language.", "21": "He observes that it happened in his case, that in his study of the Latin writers he did not so much learn and understand the facts from the words, as acquire the meaning of the words from the facts, of which he had already some knowledge.", "22": "We may perhaps conclude from this, that Plutarch wrote all his Roman lives in Chæroneia, after he had returned there from Rome.", "23": "The statement that Plutarch was the preceptor of the Emperor Trajan, and was raised to the consular rank by him, is not supported by sufficient evidence.", "24": "Plutarch addressed to Trajan his Book C Apophthegms, or Sayings of Kings and Commanders ;", "25": "but this is all that is satisfactorily ascertained as to the connection between the Emperor and Philosopher.", "26": "Trajan died A.D. 117.", "27": "\"The plan of Plutarch's Biographies is briefly ex­ plained by himself in the introduction to the Life of Alexander the Great, where he makes an apology for the brevity with which he is compelled to treat of the numerous events in the Lives of Alexander and Cæsar.", "28": "4 For,' he says, ‘ I do not write Histories, but Lives;", "29": "nor do the most conspicuous acts of necessity exhibit a man's virtue or his vice, but oftentimes some slight circum­ stance, a word, or a jest, shows a

representation of the countenance and the expression of the eyes, with­ out troubling themselves about the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to look rather into the signs of a man's character, and thus give a portrait of his life, leaving others to describe great events and battles.'", "32": "The object then of Plutarch in his Biographies was a moral end, and the exhibition of the principal events in a man's lire was subordinate to this his main design ;", "33": "and though he may not always have adhered to the principle which he laid down, it cannot be denied that his view of what biography should be, is much more exact than that of most persons who have attempted this style of composi.", "34": "tion.", "35": "The life of a statesman or of a general, when written with a view of giving a complete history of all the public events in which he was engaged, is not biography, but history.", "36": "This extract from Plutarch will also in some measure be an apology for the want of historical order observable in many of his Lives.", "37": "Though altogether deficient in that critical sagacity which dis­ corns truth from falsehood, and distinguishes the intrica­ cies of confused and conflicting statements, Plutarch h as preserved in his Lives a vast number of facts which would otheiwise have been unknown to us.", "38": "He was a great reader, and must have had access to large libraries.", "39": "It is said that he quotes two hundred and fifty writers, a great part of whose works are now entirely lost.,, (Penny Cyclopœdia, art. \" Plutarch,\" by the writer of this Preface.)", "40": "The lively portraitures of men draw in Plutarch's Lives have made them favourite reading in all ages.", "41": "Whether Plutarch has succeeded in drawing the portraits true, we cannot always determine, because the materials for such a judgment are sometimes wanting.", "42": "But when we can compare his Lives with other extant authorities, we must admit, that though he is by no means free from error as to his facts, he has generally selected those events in a man's life which most clearly show his temper, and that on the whole, if we judge of a man by Plutarch's measure, we shall form a just estimate of him.", "43": "He generally wrote without any predilections or any prejudices.", "44": "He tells us of a man's good and bad acts, of his good and bad qualities;", "45": "he makes no attempt to conceal the one or the other;", "46": "he both praises and blames as the occasion may arise;", "47": "and the reader leaves off with a mixed opinion about Plutarch's Greeks and Romans, though the favourable or the unfavourable side always predominates.", "48": "The benevolent disposition of Plutarch, and his noble and elevated character, have stamped them­ selves on all that he has written.", "49": "A man cannot read these Lives without being the better for it:", "50": "his detesta­ tion of all that is mean and disingenuous will be in­ creased ;", "51": "his admiration of whatever is truthful and generous will be strengthened and exalted.", "52": "The translation of these Lives is difficult.", "53": "Plutarch's text is occasionally corrupted;", "54": "and where it is not corrupted, his meaning is sometimes obscure.", "55": "Many of the sentences are long and ill-constructed ;", "56": "the metaphors often extravagant;", "57": "and the just connection of the parts is sometimes difficult to discover.", "58": "Many single words which are or ought to be pertinent in Plutarch, and which go towards a description of character in general or of some particular act, can hardly be rendered by any English equivalent;", "59": "and a translator often searches in vain for something which shall convey to the reader the exact notion of the original.", "60": "Yet Plutarch's narrative is lively and animated;", "61": "his anecdotes are appropriately introduced and well told;", "62": "and if his taste is sometimes not the purest, which in his age we could not expect it to be, he makes amends for this by the fulness and vigour of his expression.", "63": "He is fond of poetical words, and they are often used with striking effect.", "64": "His moral reflections, which are numerous, have the merit of not being unmeaning and tiresome, because he is always in earnest and has got something to say, and does not deal in commonplaces.", "65": "When the reflection is not very pro­ found, it is at least true;", "66": "and some of his remarks show a deep insight into men's character.", "67": "I have attempted to give Plutarch's meaning in plain language ;", "68": "to give all his meaning, and neither more nor less.", "69": "If I have failed in any case, it is because I could do no better.", "70": "But, though I have not always succeeded in expressing exactly what I conceive to be the meaning of the original, I have not intentionally added to it or detracted from it.", "71": "It may be that there are passages in which I have mistaken the original;", "72": "and those who have made the experiment of rendering from one language into another, know that this will sometimes happen even in an easy passage.", "73": "A difficult passage attracts more than usual of a translator's attention, and if he fails there, it is either because the difficulty cannot be overcome, or because he cannot overcome it.", "74": "Mere inadvertence or sleepiness may sometimes cause a translator to blunder, when he would not have blundered if any friend had been by to keep him awake.", "75": "The best thing that a man can do to avoid these and other errors is to compare his translation, when he has finished it, with some other.", "76": "The translation which I have compared with mine is the German translation of Kaltwasser, Magdeburg, 1799, which is generally correct.", "77": "Kaltwasser in his Preface speaks of the way in which he used the German translations of two of his predecessors, J.

relatives on the occasion of his return home from Alex­ andria, but we can gather nothing from the passage as to his age at that time.", "157": "One anecdote of his early life is as follows:", "158": "—“ I remember,\" he says, \" that when I was still a young man, I was sent with another person on a deputation to the Proconsul;", "159": "my colleague, as it happened, was unable to proceed, and I saw the Proconsul and performed the commission alone.", "160": "When I returned I was about to lay down my office and to give a public account of how I had discharged it, when my father rose in the public assembly and enjoined me not to say I went, but we went, nor to say that I said, but we said, throughout my story, giving my colleague his share.", "161": "\"The most important event in the whole of Plutarch's pious and peaceful life is undoubtedly his journey to Italy and to Rome;", "162": "but here again we know little more than that he knew but little Latin when he went thither, and was too busy when there to acquire much knowledge of that tongue.", "163": "His occupation at Rome, besides antiquarian researches which were afterwards worked up into his Roman Lives, was the delivery of lectures on philosophical and other subjects, a common practice among the learned Greeks of his day.", "164": "Many of these lectures, it is conjec­ tured, were afterwards recast by him into the numerous short treatises on various subjects now included under the general name of Moralia.", "165": "Plutarch's visit to Rome and business there is admirably explained in the following passage of North'a ‘ Life of Plutarch':", "166": "—“ For my part, I think Plutarch was drawn to Rome by meanes of some friends he had there, especially by Sossius Senecio, that had been a Consull, who was of great estimation at that time, and namely under the Empire of Trajan.", "167": "And that which maketh me think so, is because of Plutarch's own words, who saith in the beginning of his first book of his discourse at the table, that he gathered together all his reasons and discourses made here and there, as well in Rome with Senecio, as in Greece with Plutarch and others.", "168": "Not being likely that he would have taken the pains to have made so long a voyage, and to have come to such a city where he understood not their vulgar tongue, if he had not been drawn thither by Senecio, and such other men;", "169": "as also in acknowledgement of the good turnes and honour he had received by such men, he dedi­ cated diverse of his bookes unto them, and among others, the Lives unto Senecio, and the nine volumes of his discourse at the table, with the treaty, How a man may know that he profiteth in vertue.", "170": "Now for the time, considering what he saith in the end of his book against curiosity, I suppose that he taught in Rome in the time of Titus and of Domitian :", "171": "for touching this point, he maketh mention of a nobleman called Rusticus, who being one day at his lecture, would not open a letter which was brought him from the Emperor, nor interrupt Plutarch, but attended to the end of his declamation, and until all the hearers were gone away;", "172": "and addeth also, that Rusticus was afterwards put to death by the commandment of Domitian.", "173": "Furthermore, about the beginning of the Life of Demosthenes, Plutarch saith, that whilst he remained in Italy and at Rome, he had no leizure to study the Latine tongue;", "174": "as well for that he was busied at that time with matters he had in hand, as also to satisfie those that were his followers to learne philosophic of hinc ”*.A list of all Plutarch's writings would be a very long one.", "175": "Besides the Lives, which is the work on which his fame chiefly rests, he wrote a book of ‘ Table Talk,' which may have suggested to Athenaeus the plan of his 4 Symposium.", "176": "'The most remarkable of his minor works is that'", "177": "Or the Malignity of Herodotus.'", "178": "Grote takes this treatise as being intended seriously as an attack upon the historian, and speaks of the \" honourable frankness which Plutarch calls his malignity.\"", "179": "But it is probably merely a rhetor­ ical exercise, in which Plutarch has endeavoured to see what could be said against so favourite and well-known a writer.", "180": "He was probably known as an author before he went to Rome.", "181": "Large capitals have always had a natural attraction for literary genius, as it is in them alone that it can hope to be appreciated.", "182": "And if this be the case at the present day, how much more must it have been so before the invention of printing, at a time when it was more usual to listen to books read aloud than to read them oneself ?", "183": "Plutarch journeyed to Rome just as Hero­ dotus went to Athens, or as he is said to have gone to the Olympian festival, in search of an intelligent audience of educated men.", "184": "Whether his object was merely praise, or whether he was influenced by ideas of gain, we cannot say.", "185": "No doubt his lectures were not delivered gratis, and that they were well attended seems evident from Plutarch's own notices of them, and from the names which have been preserved of the eminent men who used to frequent them.", "186": "Moreover, strange though it may appear to us, the demand for books seems to have been very brisk even though they were entirely written by hand.", "187": "The epigrams of Martial inform us of the existence of a class of slaves whose occupation was copying books, and innumerable allusions in Horace, Martial, &c., to the Sosii and others prove that the trade of a bookseller at Rome was both extensive and profitable.", "188": "Towards tho end of the Republic it became the fashion for Roman nobles to encourage literature by forming a library, and this taste was given immense encouragement by Augustus, who established a public library in the Temple of Apollo on the Mount Palatine, in imitation of that previously founded by Asinius Pollio.", "189": "There were other libraries besides these, the most famous of which was the Ulpian library, founded by Trajan, who called it so from his own name, Ulpius.", "190": "Now Trajan was a contemporary of our author, and this act of his clearly proves that there must have been during Plutarch's lifetime a considerable reading public, and consequent demand for books at Rome.", "191": "Of Plutarch's travels in Italy we know next to nothing.", "192": "He mentions incidentally that he had seen the bust or statue of Marius at Ravenna, but never gives us another hint of how far he explored the country about which he wrote so much.", "193": "No doubt his ignorance of the Latin language must not be taken as a literal statement, and probably means that he was not skilled in it as a spoken tongue, for we can scarcely imagine that he was without some acquaintance with it when he first went to Rome, and he certainly afterwards became well read in the literature of Rome.", "194": "In some cases he has followed Livy's narrative with a closeness which proves that he must have been acquainted with that author either in the original or in a translation, and the latter alternative is, of the two, the more improbable.", "195": "It seems to be now generally thought that his stay at Rome was a short one.", "196": "Clough, in his excellent Preface, says on this subject, \" The fault which runs through all the earlier biographies, from that of Rualdus downwards, is the assumption, wholly untenable, that Plutarch passed many years, as many perhaps as forty, at Rome.", "197": "The entire character of his life is of course altered by such an impression.\"", "198": "He then goes on to say that in consequence of this mistaken idea, it is not worth while for him to quote Dryden's ‘ Life of Plutarch,' which was originally prefixed to the translations re-edited by himself.", "199": "Yet I trust I may be excused if I again quote North's 6 Life of Plutarch,' as the following passage seems to set vividly before us the quiet literary occupation of his later days.\"", "200": "For Plutarch, though he tarried a long while in Italy, and in Rome, yet that tooke not away the remembrance of the sweet aire of Greece, and of the little towne where he was borne;", "201": "but being touched from time to time with a sentence of an ancient poet, who saith that, ‘ In whatsoever countrey men are bred (I know not by what sweetnesse of it led), They nourish in their minds a glad desire, Unto their native homes for to retire,' he resolved to go back into Greece againe, there to end the rest of his dates in rest and honour among his citizens, of whom he was honourably welcomed home.", "202": "Some judge that he left Rome after the death of Trajan, being then of great yeares, to leade a more quiet life.", "203": "So being then at rest, he earnestly took in hand that which he had long thought of before, to wit, the Lives, and tooke great pains with it until he had brought his worke to perfection, as we have done at this present;", "204": "although that some Lives, as those of Scipio African, of Metellus Numidicus, and some other are not to be found.", "205": "Now himselfe confesseth in some place, that when he began this worke, at the first it was but to profit others;", "206": "but that afterwards it was to profit himselfe, looking upon those histories, as if he had looked in a glasse, and seeking to reform his life in some sort, and to forme it in the mould of the vertues of these great men;", "207": "taking this fashion of searching their manners, and writing the Lives of these noble men, to be a familiar haunting and frequenting of them.", "208": "Also he thought, [said he himselfe] that he lodged these men one after another in his house, entering into consideration of their qualities, and that which was great in either of them, choosing and principally taking that which was to be noted, and most worthy to be knowne in their sayings and deeds.\"*Of Plutarch in his domestic relations we gather much information from his own writings.", "209": "The name of his father has not been preserved, but it was probably Nikarchus, from the common habit of Greek families to repeat a name in alternate generations.", "210": "His brothers Timon and Lamprias are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, where Timon is spoken of in the most affectionate terms.", "211": "Rualdus has ingeniously recovered the name of his wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence afforded by his writings.", "212": "A touching letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not give way to excessive grief at the death of their only daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother.", "213": "The number of his sons we cannot exactly state.", "214": "Autobulus and Plutarch are especially spoken of as his sons, since the treatise on the Timaeus of Plato is dedicated to them, and the marriage of his son Autobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner-parties recorded in the ‘ Table Talk.'", "215": "Another person, one Soklarus, is spoken of in terms which seem to imply that he was Plutarch's son, but this is nowhere definitely stated.", "216": "His treatise also on Marriage Questions, addressed to Eurydike and Pollianus, seems to speak of her as having been recently an inmate of his house, but without enabling us to form an opinion whether she was his daughter or not.", "217": "A modem writer well describes his maturer years by the words :", "218": "\"",

of good conversation ;", "223": "and declares in a letter written to his wife that ‘ he finds scarcely an erasure, as in a book well written, in the happiness of his life.'", "224": "\"He was an active member of the little community of Chaeronea, being archon of that town.", "225": "Whether this dignity was annual or for life we do not know, but it was probably the former, and very likely he served it more than once.", "226": "He speaks of his devotion to the duties of his office as causing him to incur the ridicule of some of his fellow-citizens, when they saw him engaged in the humblest duties, \" But,\" he says, in Clough's version, \" the story told about Antisthenes comes to my assistance.", "227": "When some one expressed surprise at his carrying home some pickled fish from market in his own hands, It is, he answered, for myself.", "228": "Conversely, when I am reproached with standing by and watching while tiles are measured out, and stone and mortar brought up, This service, I say, is not for myself it is for my country.", "229": "\"Plutarch was for many years a priest of Apollo at Delphi.", "230": "The scene of some of his ‘ Table Talk' is laid there, when he in his priestly capacity gives a dinner party in honour of the victor in the poetic contest at the Pythian games.", "231": "Probably this office was a source of considerable income, and as the journey from Chaeronea to Delphi, across Mount Parnassus, is a very short one, it interfered but little with his literary and municipal business.", "232": "In his essay on \"", "233": "Whether an old man should continue to take part in public life,\" he says, \"You know, Euphanes, that I have for many Pythiads (that is, periods of four years elapsing between the Pythian festivals), exercised the

Athens;", "255": "and these are two of the most famous of cities.", "256": "Both carried off women by violence, and neither of them escaped domestic misfortune and retribution, but towards the end of

wisdom.", "262": "The nature of this wisdom of his seems to have been much of the same kind as that which made the reputation of Hesiod, in the collection of maxims known as the ‘ Works and Days.'",

called Theseus's fashion because of him.", "281": "The Abantes first began to cut their hair in this manner, not having, as some say, been taught to do so by the Arabians, nor yet from any wish to imitate the Mysians, but because they were a warlike race, and met their foes in close combat, and studied above all to come to a hand-to-hand fight with their enemy, as Archilochus bears witness in his verses:", "282": "“ They use no slings nor bows, Eubœa's martial lords, But hand to hand they close And conquer with their swords.”", "283": "So they cut their hair short in front, that their

about his father, and bade him take the tokens from beneath it and sail to Athens with them.", "291": "He easily lifted the stone, but determined not to go to Athens by sea, though the voyage was a safe and easy one, and though his mother and his grandfather implored him to go that way.", "292": "By land it was a difficult matter to react Athens, as the whole way was infested with robbers and bandits.", "293": "That time, it seems, produced men of great and un­ wearied strength and swiftness, who made no good use of these powers, but treated all men with overbearing inso­ lence, taking advantage of their strength to overpower and slay all who fell into their hands, and disregarding justice and right and kindly feeling, which they said were only approved of by those who dared not do injury to others, or feared to be injured themselves, while men who could get the upper hand by force might disregard them.", "294": "Of these ruffians, Herakles in his wanderings cut off a good many,

times, when he said that the trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep.", "303": "Just so did the admiration which Theseus conceived for Herakles make him dream by night of his great exploits, and

Ægeus.", "352": "Ægeus at once recognised it, overset the cup of poison, looked closely at his son and embraced him.", "353": "He then called a public meeting and made", "354": "Theseus known as his son to the citizens, with whom he was already very popular because of his bravery.", "355": "It is said that when the cup was overset the poison was spilt in the place where now there is the enclosure in the Delphinium, for there Ægeus dwelt;", "356": "and the Hermes to the east of the temple there they call the one who is “ at the door of Ægeus.", "357": "”XIII.", "358": "But the sons of Pallas, who had previously to this expected that they would inherit the kingdom on the death of Ægeus without issue, now that Theseus was declared the heir, were much enraged, first that Ægeus should be king, a man who was merely an adopted child of Pandion, and had no blood relationship to Erechtheus, and next that Theseus, a stranger and a foreigner, should inherit the kingdom.", "359": "They consequently declared war.", "360": "Dividing themselves into two bodies, the one proceeded to march openly upon the city from Sphettus, under the com­ mand of PaRas their father, while the other lay in ambush at Gargettus, in order that they might fall upon their opponents on two sides at once.", "361": "But there was a herald among them named Leos, of the township of Agnus, who betrayed the plans of the sons of Pallas to Theseus.", "362": "He suddenly.", "363": "attacked those who were in ambush, and killed them all, hearing which the other body under Pallas dispersed.", "364": "From this time forth they say that the town­ ship of Pallene has never intermarried with that of Agnus, and that it is not customary amongst them for heralds to begin a proclamation with the words \" Acouete Leo,\" (Oyez) for they hate the name of Leo* because of the treachery of that man.XIV.", "365": "Now Theseus, who wished for employment, and also to make himself popular with the people, went to attack the Lull of Marathon, who had caused no little trouble to the inhabitants of Tetrapolis.", "366": "He overcame the beast, and drove it alive through the city for all men to see, and then sacrificed it to Apollo of Delphi.", "367": "Hekale, too, and the legend of her having entertained Theseus, does not seem altogether without foundation in fact;", "368": "for the people of the neighbouring townships used to assemble and perform what was called the Hekalesian sacrifice to Zeus Hekalus, and they also used to honour Hekale, calling her by the affectionate diminutive Hekaline, because she also, when feasting Theseus, who was very young, embraced him in a motherly way, and used such like endearing diminutives.", "369": "She also made a vow on Theseus's behalf, when he was going forth to battle, that if he returned safe she would sacrifice to Zeus;", "370": "but as she died before he returned, she had the above-mentioned honours instituted by command of Theseus, as a grateful return for her hospitality.", "371": "This is the legend as told by Philochorus.XV.", "372": "Shortly after this the ship from Crete arrived for the third time to collect the customary tribute.", "373": "Most writers agree that the origin of this was, that on the death of Androgens, in Attica, which was ascribed to treachery, his father Minos went to war, and wrought much evil to the country, which at the same time was afflicted by scourges from Heaven (for the land did not bear fruit, and there was a great pestilence and the rivers sank into the earth).", "374": "So that as the oracle told the Athenians that, if they propitiated Minos and came to terms with him, the anger of Heaven would cease and they should have a respite from their sufferings, they sent an embassy to Minos and prevailed on him to make peace, on the con­ dition that every nine years they should send him a tribute of seven youths and seven maidens.", "375": "The most tragic of the legends states these poor children when they reached Crete were thrown into the Labyrinth, and there either were devoured by the Minotaur or else perished with hunger, being unable to find the way out.", "376": "The Minotaur, as Euripides tells us, was \" A form commingled, and a monstrous birth, Half man, half bull, in twofold shape combined.\"", "377": "XVI.", "378": "Philochorus says that the Cretans do not recog­ nise this story, but say that the Labyrinth was merely a prison, like any other, from which escape was impossible, and that Minos instituted gymnastic games in honour of Androgeus, in which the prizes for the victors were these children, who till then were kept in the Labyrinth.", "379": "Also they say that the victor in the first contest was a man of great power in the state, a general of the name of Taurus, who was of harsh and savage temper, and ill-treated the Athenian children.", "380": "And Aristotle himself, in his treatise on the constitution of the Bottiæans, evidently does not believe that the children were put to death by Minos, but that they lived in Crete as slaves, until extreme old age;", "381": "and that one day the Cretans, in performance of an ancient vow, sent first-fruits of their population to Delphi.", "382": "Among those who were thus sent were the descendants of the Athenians, and, as they could not maintain themselves there, they first passed over to Italy, and there settled near Iapygium, and from thence again removed to Thrace, and took the name of Bottiæans.", "383": "For this reason, the Bottiæan maidens when performing a certain sacrifice sing “ Let us go to Athens.\"", "384": "Thus it seems to be a terrible thing to incur the hatred of a city powerful in speech and song ;", "385": "for on the Attic stage Minos is always vilified and traduced, and though he was called “ Most Kingly \" by Hesiod, and “ Friend of Zeus \" by Homer, it gained him no credit, but the playwrights overwhelmed him with abuse, styling him cruel and violent.", "386": "And yet Minos is said to have been a king and a lawgiver, and Rhadamanthus to have been a judge under him, carrying out his decrees.", "387": "XVII.", "388": "So when the time of the third payment of the tribute arrived, and those fathers who had sons not yet grown up had to submit to draw lots, the unhappy people began to revile Ægeus, complaining that he, although the author of this calamity, yet took no share in their afflic­ tion, but endured to see them left childless, robbed of their own legitimate offspring, while he made a foreigner and a bastard the heir to his kingdom.", "389": "This vexed Theseus, and determining not to hold aloof, but to share the fortunes of the people, he came forward and offered himself without being drawn by lot.", "390": "The people all admired his courage and patriotism, and Ægeus finding that his prayers and entreaties had no effect on his unalterable resolution, proceeded to choose the rest by lot.", "391": "Hellanikus says that the city did not select the youths and maidens by lot, but that Minos himself came thither and chose them, and that he picked out Theseus first of all, upon the usual conditions, which were that the Athenians should furnish a ship, and that the youths should embark in it and sail with him, not carrying with them any weapon of war;", "392": "and that when the Minotaur was slain, the tribute should cease.", "393": "Formerly, nO one had any hope of safety;", "394": "so they used to send out the ship with a black sail, as if it were going to a certain doom;", "395": "but now Theseus so encouraged his father, and boasted that he would overcome the Minotaur, that he gave a second sail, a white one, to the steersman, and charged him on his return, if Theseus were safe, to hoist the white one, if not, the black one as a sign of mourning.", "396": "But Simonides says that it was not a white sail which was given by Ægeus, but \" a scarlet sail embrued in holm oak's juice,\" and that this was agreed on by him as the signal of safety.", "397": "The ship was steered by Phereklus the son of Amarsyas, according to Simonides.", "398": "But Philochorus says that Theseus had one Nausithous sent him from Skirus of Salamis, to steer the ship, and Phæax to act as look-out, as the Athenians had not yet turned their attention to the sea.", "399": "One of the youths chosen by lot was Menestheos the son of Skirus's daughter.", "400": "The truth of this account is attested by the shrines of Nausithous and Phæax, which Theseus built at Phalerum, and by the feast called the Kybernesia or pilot's festival, which is held in their honour.", "401": "XVIII.", "402": "When the lots were drawn", "403": "Theseus brought the chosen youths from the Prytaneum, and proceeding to the temple of the Delphian Apollo, offered the suppliants' bough to Apollo on their behalf.", "404": "This was a bough of the sacred olive-tree bound with fillets of white wool.", "405": "And after praying he went to sea on the sixth day of the month Munychion, on which day even now they send maidens as suppliants to the temple of the Delphian Apollo.", "406": "And there is a legend that the Delphian oracle told him that Aphrodite would be his guide and fellow­ traveller, and that when he was sacrificing a she-goat to her by the seaside, it became a he-goat;", "407": "wherefore the goddess is called Epitragia.", "408": "XIX.", "409": "When they reached Crete, according to most historians and poets, Ariadne fell in love with him, and from her he received the clue of string, and was taught how to thread the mazes of the Labyrinth.", "410": "He slew the Minotaur, and, taking with him Ariadne and the youths, sailed away.", "411": "Pherekydes also says that Theseus also knocked out the bottoms of the Cretan ships, to prevent pursuit.", "412": "But Demon says that Taurus, Minos's general, was slain in a sea-fight in the harbour, when Theseus sailed away.", "413": "But according to Philochorus, when Minos instituted his games, Taurus was expected to win every prize, and was grudged this honour;", "414": "for his great influence and his unpopular manners made him disliked, and soandal said, that he was too intimate with Pasiphae.", "415": "On this account, when Theseus offered to contend with him, Minos agreed.", "416": "And, as it was the custom in Crete for women as well as men to be spectators of the games, Ariadne was present, and was struck with the appearance of Theseus, and his strength, as he conquered all competitors.", "417": "Minos was especially pleased, in the wrestling match, at Taurus's defeat and shame, and, restoring the children to Theseus, remitted the tribute for the future.", "418": "Kleidemus tells the story in his own fashion and at unnecessary length, be­ ginning much farther back.", "419": "There was, he says, a decree passed by all the Greeks, that no ship should sail from any post with more than five hands on board, but Jason alone, the master of the great ship Argo, should cruise about, and keep the sea free of pirates.", "420": "Now when Daedalus fled to Athens, Minos, contrary to the decree, pursued him in long war galleys, and being driven to Sicily by a storm, died there.", "421": "When his son Deukalion sent a warlike message to the Athenians, bidding them give up Daedalus to him, or else threatening that he would put to death the children whom Minos had taken as hostages, Theseus returned him a gentle answer, beg­ ging for the life of Dædalus, who was his own cousin and blood relation, being the son of Merope, the daughter of Erechtheus.", "422": "But he busied himself with building a fleet, some of it in Attica, in the country of the Thymai­ tadae, far from any place of resort of strangers, and some in Trœzen, under the management of Pittheus, as he did not wish his preparations to be known.", "423": "But when the ships were ready to set sail, having with him as pilots, Dædalus himself and some Cretan exiles, as no one knew that he was coming, and the Cretans thought that it was a friendly fleet that was advancing, he seized the harbour, and marched at once to Knossus before his arrival was known.", "424": "Then he fought a battle at the gates of the Labyrinth, and slew Deukalion and his body-guard.", "425": "As Ariadne now succeeded to the throne, he made peace with her, took back the youths, and formed an alliance between the Cretans and the Athenians, in which each nation swore that it would not begin a war against the other.", "426": "XX.", "427": "There are many more stories about these events, and about Ariadne, none of which agree in any particulars.", "428": "Some say that she hanged herself when deserted by Theseus, and some, that she was taken to Naxos by his sailors, and there dwelt with Œnarus, the priest of Dionysus, having been deserted by Theseus, who was in love with another.", "429": "“ For Ægle's love disturbed his breast.\"", "430": "This line, we are told by Hereas of Megara, was struck out of Hesiod's poems by Peisistratus ;", "431": "and again he says that he inserted into Homer's description of the Shades, a Peirithous and Theseus, born of gods,\" to please the Athenians.", "432": "Some writers say that Theseus had by Ariadne two sons, Staphylus and Œnopion, whom Ion of Chios follows when he speaks of his own native city as that \"", "433": "Which erst (Enopion stablished, Theseus' son.\"", "434": "The pleasantest of these legends are in nearly every one's mouth.", "435": "But Pæon of Amathus gives an account peculiar to himself, that Theseus was driven by a storm to Cyprus, and that Ariadne, who was pregnant, suffered much from the motion of the ship, and became so ill, that she was set on shore, but Theseus had to return to take charge of the ship, and was blown off to sea.", "436": "The women of the country took care of Ariadne, and comforted her in her bereave­ ment, even bringing forged letters to her as if from Theseus, and rendering her assistance during her confine­ ment ;", "437": "and when she died in childbirth, they buried her.", "438": "Theseus, on his return, grieved much, and left money to the people of the country, bidding them sacrifice to Ariadne;", "439": "he also set up two little statues, one of silver, and the other of brass.", "440": "And at this sacrifice, which takes place on the second day of the month Gorpiæus, one of the young men lies down on the ground, and imitates the cries of a woman in travail;", "441": "and the people of Amathus call that the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite, in which they show her tomb.", "442": "But some writers of Naxos tell a different story, peculiar to themselves, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, of whom one, they say, was married to Dionysus in Naxos, and was the mother of Staphylus and his brother, while the younger was carried off by Theseus, and came to Naxos after he deserted her;", "443": "and a nurse called Korkyne came with her, whose tomb they point out.", "444": "Then Naxians also says that this Ariadne died there, and is honoured, but not so much as the elder;", "445": "for at the feast in honour of the elder, there are merriment and revelry, but at that of the younger gloomy rites are mingled with mirth.", "446": "XXI.", "447": "Theseus, when he sailed away from Croto, touched at Delos ;", "448": "here he sacrificed to the god and offered up the statue of Aphrodite, which Ariadne had given him;", "449": "and besides this, he and the youths with him danced a measure which they say is still practised by the people of Delos to this day, being an imitation of the turnings and windings of the Labyrinth expressed by complicated evolutions per­ formed in regular order.", "450": "This kind of dance is called by the Delians “ the crane dance,\" according to Diksearchus.", "451": "It was danced round the altar of the Horns, which is all formed of horns from the left side.", "452": "They also say that he instituted games at Delos, and that then for the first time a palm was given by him to the victor.", "453": "XXII.", "454": "As he approached Attica, both he and his steers­ man in their delight forgot to hoist the sail which was to be a signal of their safety to Ægeus ;", "455": "and he in his despair flung himself down the cliffs and perished.", "456": "Theseus, as soon as he reached the harbour, performed at Phalerum the sacrifices which he had vowed to the gods if he re­ turned safe, and sent off a herald to the city with the news of his safe return.", "457": "This man met with many who were lamenting the death of the king, and, as was natural, with others who were delighted at the news of their safety, and who congratulated him and wished to crown him with garlands.", "458": "These he received, but placed them on his herald's staff, and when he came back to the seashore, finding that Theseus had not completed his libation, he waited outside the temple, not wishing to disturb the sacrifice.", "459": "When the libation was finished he announced the death of Ægeus, and then they all hurried up to the city with loud lamentations:", "460": "wherefore to this day, at the Oschophoria, they say that it is not the herald that is crowned, but his staff, and that at the libations the by­ standers cry out, “Eleleu, Iou, Iou;", "461": "\" of which cries the first is used by men in haste, or raising the paean for battle, while the second is used by persons in surprise and trouble.", "462": "Theseus, after burying his father, paid his vow to Apollo, on the seventh day of the month Pyanepsion;", "463": "for on this day it was that the rescued youths went up into the city.", "464": "The boiling of pulse, which is customary on this anniversary, is said to be done because the rescued youths put what remained of their pulse together into one pot, boiled it all, and merrily feasted on it together.", "465": "And on this day also, the Athenians carry about the Eiresione, a bough of the olive tree garlanded with wool, just as Theseus had before carried the suppliants' bough, and covered with first-fruits of all sorts of produce, because the barrenness of the land ceased on that day;", "466": "and they sing, “ Eiresione, bring us figs And wheaten loaves, and oil, And wine to quaff, that we may all Rest merrily from

it.", "469": "XXIII.", "470": "Now the thirty-oared ship, in which Theseus sailed with the youths, and came back safe, was kept by the Athenians up to the time of Demetrius Phalereus.", "471": "They constantly removed the decayed part of her timbers.", "472": "and renewed them with sound wood, so that the ship became an illustration to philosophers of the doctrine of growth and change, as some argued that it remained the same, and others, that it did not remain the same.", "473": "The feast of the Oschophoria, or of carrying boughs, which to this day the Athenians celebrate, was instituted by Theseus.", "474": "For he did not take with him all the maidens who were drawn by lot, but he chose two youths, his intimate friends, who were feminine and fair to look upon, but of manly spirit;", "475": "those by warm baths and avoiding the heat of the sun and careful tending of their hair and skin he completely metamorphosed, teaching them to imitate the voice and carriage and walk of maidens.", "476": "These two were then substituted in the place of two of the girls, and deceived every one;", "477": "and when they re­ turned, he and these two youths walked in procession, dressed as now those who carry boughs at the Oschophoria are dressed.", "478": "They carry them in honour of Dionysus and Ariadne, because of the legend, or rather because they returned home when the harvest was being gathered in.", "479": "And the women called supper-carriers join in carrying them and partake of the sacrifice, in imitation of the mothers of those who were drawn by lot;", "480": "for they used continually to bring their children food.", "481": "Also, old tales are told, because these women used to tell their children such ones, to encourage and amuse them.", "482": "These things are related by the historian Demus.", "483": "Moreover, a sacred enclosure was dedicated to Theseus, and those families out of whom the tribute of the children had been gathered were bidden to contribute to sacrifices to him.", "484": "These sacrifices were presided over by the Phytalidæ, which post Theseus bestowed upon them as a recompense for their hospitality towards him.", "485": "XXIV.", "486": "After the death of Ægeus, Theseus conceived a great and important design.", "487": "He gathered together all the inhabitants of Attica and made them citizens of one city, whereas before they had lived dispersed, so as to be hard to assemble together for the common weal, and at times even fighting with one another.", "488": "He visited all the villages and tribes, and won their consent;", "489": "the poor and lower classes gladly accepting his proposals, while he gained over the more powerful by promising that the new constitution should not include a king, but that it should be a pure commonwealth, with himself merely acting as general of its army and guardian of its laws, while in other respects it would allow perfect freedom and equality to every one.", "490": "By these arguments he convinced some of them, and the rest knowing his power and courage chose rather to be persuaded than forced into compliance.", "491": "He therefore destroyed the pry­ taneia, the senate house, and the magistracy of each individual township, built one common prytaneum and senate house for them all on the site of the present acropolis, called the city Athens, and instituted the Panathenaic festival common to all of them.", "492": "He also instituted a festival for the resident aliens, on the six­ teenth of the month, Hekatombeion, which is still kept up.", "493": "And having, according to his promise, laid down his sovereign power, he arranged the new constitution under the auspices of the gods ;", "494": "for he made inquiry at Delphi as to how he should deal with the city, and

Come hither all ye peoples,\" was the proclamation then used by Theseus, establishing as it were a commonwealth of all natiors.", "502": "But he did not permit his state to fall into the disorder which this influx of all kinds of people would probably have produced, but divided the people into three classes, of Eupatridæ or nobles, Geomori or farmers, Demiurgi or artisans.", "503": "To the Eupatridæ he assigned the care of religious rites, the supply of magistrates for the city, and the interpretation of the laws and customs sacred or profane, yet he placed them on an equality with the other citizens, thinking that the nobles would always excel in dignity, the farmers in usefulness, and the artisans in numbers.", "504": "Aristotle tells us that he was the first who inclined to democracy, and gave up the title of king ;", "505": "and Homer seems to confirm this view by speaking of the people of the Athenians alone of all the states men­ tioned in his catalogue of ships.",

appointment they should celebrate the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon.", "511": "The festival which was previously established there in honour of Melikerta used to be celebrated by night, and to be more like a religious mystery than a great spectacle and gathering.", "512": "Some writers assert that the Isthmian games were established in honour of Skeiron, and that Theseus wished to make them an atonement for the murder of his kinsman;", "513": "for Skeiron was the son of Kanethus and of Henioche the daughter of Pittheus.", "514": "Others say that this festival was established in honour of Sinis, not of Skeiron.", "515": "Be this as it may, Theseus established it, and stipulated with the Corinthians that visitors from Athens who came to the games should have a seat of honour in as large a space as could be covered by a sail of the public ship which carried them, when stretched out on the ground.", "516": "This we are told by Hellanikus and Andron of Halikarnassus.XXVI.", "517": "Besides this, according to Philochorus and other writers, he sailed with Herakles to the Euxine, took part in the campaign against the Amazons, and received Antiope as the reward for his valour;", "518": "but most historians, among whom are Pherekydes, Hellanikus, and Herodorus, say that Theseus made an expedition of his own later than that of Herakles, and that he took the Amazon captive, which is a more reasonable story.", "519": "For no one of his companions is said to have captured an Amazon;", "520": "while Bion relates that he caught this one by treachery and carried her off;", "521": "for the Amazons, he says, were not averse to men, and did not avoid Theseus when he touched at their coast, but even offered him presents.", "522": "He invited the bearer of these on board his ship ;", "523": "and when she had embarked he set sail.", "524": "But one, Menekrates, who has written a history of the town of Nikæa in Bithynia, states that Theseus spent a long time in that country with Antiope, and that there were three young Athenians, brothers, who were his companions in arms, by name Euneon, Thoas, and Soloeis.", "525": "Soloeis fell in love with Antiope, and, without telling his brothers, confided his passion to one of his comrades.", "526": "This man laid the mat­ ter before Antiope, who firmly rejected his pretensions, but treated him quietly and discreetly, telling Theseus nothing about it.", "527": "Soloeis, in despair at his rejection, leaped into a river and perished;", "528": "and Theseus then at length learned the cause of the young man's death.", "529": "In his sorrow he remembered and applied to himself an oracle he had received from Delphi.", "530": "It had been enjoined upon him by the Pythia that whenever he should be struck down with special sorrow in a foreign land, he should found a city in that place and leave some of his companions there as its chiefs.", "531": "In consequence of this the city which he founded was called Pythopolis, in honour of the Pythian Apollo, and the neighbouring river was called Soloeis, after the youth who died in it.", "532": "He left there the brothers of Soloeis as the chiefs and law­ givers of the new city, and together, with them one Hermus, an Athenian Eupatrid.", "533": "In consequence of this, the people of Pythopolis call a certain place in thoir city the house of Hermes, by a mistaken accentuation transfer­ ring the honour due to their founder, to their god Hermes.", "534": "XXVII.", "535": "This was the origin of the war with the Amazons;", "536": "and it seems to have been carried on in no feeble or womanish spirit, for they never could have encamped in the city nor have fought a battle close to the Pnyx and the Museum unless they had conquered the rest of the country, so as to be able to approach the city safely.", "537": "It is hard to believe, as Hellanikus relates, that they crossed the Cimmerian Bosphorus on the ice;", "538": "but that they encamped almost in the city is borne witness to by the local names, and by the tombs of the fallen.", "539": "For a long time both parties held aloof, unwilling to engage;", "540": "but at last Theseus, after sacrificing to Phobos (Fear), attacked them.", "541": "The battle took place in the month Boedromion, on the day on which the Athenians celebrate the feast Boedromia.", "542": "Kleidemus gives us accurate details, stating that the left wing of the Amazons stood at the place now called the Amazoneum, while the right reached up to the Pnyx, at the place where the gilded figure of Victory now stands.", "543": "The Athenians attacked them on this side, issuing from the Museum, and the tombs of the fallen are to be seen along the street which leads to the gate near the shrine of the hero Chalkodus, which is called the Peiræic gate.", "544": "On this side the women forced them back as far as the temple of the Eumenides, but on the other side those who assailed them from the temple of Pallas, Ardettus, and the Lyceum, drove their right wing in confusion back to their camp with great slaughter.", "545": "In the fourth month of the war a peace was brought about by Hippolyte;", "546":

which stands beside the temple of Olympian Earth is sacred to her memory.", "548": "It is not to be wondered at that history should be at fault when dealing with such ancient events as these, for there is another story at variance with this, to the effect that Antiope caused the wounded Amazons to be secretly transported to Chalkis, where they were taken care of, and some of them were buried there, at what is now called the Amazoneum.", "549": "However, it is a proof of the war having ended in a treaty of peace, that the place near the temple of Theseus where they swore to observe it, is

goes from the market-place to what they call Rhus, where the lozenge­ shaped building stands.", "551": "It is said that some others died at Chaeronea, and were buried bv the little stream which it seems was anciently called Thermodon, but now is called Hæmon, about which we have treated in the life of Demosthenes.", "552": "It would appear that the Amazons did not even get across Thessaly without trouble, for graves of them are shown to this day at Skotussa and Kynoskephalæ.", "553": "XXVIII.", "554": "The above is all that is worthy of mention about the Amazons ;", "555": "for, as to the story which the author of the ‘ Theseid' relates about this attack of the Amazons being brought about by Antiope to revenge herself upon Theseus for his marriage with Phædra, and how she and her Amazons fought, and how Herakles slew them, all this is clearly fabulous.", "556": "After the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phædra, having a son by Antiope named Hip­ polytus, or Demophoon, according to Pindar.", "557": "As for his misfortunes with this wife and son, as the account given by historians does not differ from that which appears in the plays of the tragic poets, we must believe them to have happened as all these writers say.", "558": "XXIX.", "559": "However, there are certain other legends about Theseus' marriage which have never appeared on the stage, which have neither a creditable beginning nor a prosperous termination:", "560": "for it is said that he carried off one Anaxo, a Trcezenian girl, and after slaying Sinis and Kerkyon he forced their daughters, and that he married Periboea the mother of Ajax and also Pherebcea and lope the daughter of Iphikles :", "561": "and, as has been told already, it was on account of his love for Ægle the daughter of Panopeus that he deserted Ariadne, which was a shameful and discreditable action.", "562": "And in addition to all this he is charged with carrying off Helen, which brought war upon Attica, and exile and destruction on himself;", "563": "about which we shall speak presently.", "564": "But, though many adventures were undertaken by the heroes of those times, Herodorus is of opinion that Theseus took no part in any of them, except with the Lapithae in their fight with the Centaurs;", "565": "though other writers say that he went to Kolchis with Jason and took part with Meleager in the hunt of the Kalydonian boar.", "566": "From these legends arises the proverb, “ Not with­ out Theseus;", "567": "” also he by himself without any comrades performed many glorious deeds, from which the saying came into vogue, \" This is another Herakles.", "568": "\"Theseus, together with Adrastus, effected the recovery of the bodies of those who fell under the walls of the Cadmea at Thebes, not after conquering the Thebans, as Euripides puts it in his play, but by a truce and conven­ tion, according to most writers.", "569": "Philochorus even states that this was the first occasion on which a truce was made for the recovery of those slain in battle.", "570": "But we have shown in our ‘ Life of Herakles' that he was the first to restore the corpses of the slain to the enemy.", "571": "The tombs of the rank and file are to be seen at Eleutheræ, but those of the chiefs at Eleusis, by favour of Theseus to Adrastus.", "572": "Euripides's play of the ‘ Suppliants' is contradicted by that of AEschylus, the ‘ Eleusinians,' in which Theseus is introduced giving orders for this to be done.", "573": "XXX.", "574": "His friendship for Peirithous is said to have arisen in the following manner :", "575": "He had a great reputa­ tion for strength and courage;", "576": "Peirithous, wishing to make trial of these, drove his cattle away from the plain of Marathon, and when he learned that Theseus was pursu­ ing them, armed, he did not retire, but turned and faced him.", "577": "Each man then admiring the beauty and courage of his opponent, refrained from battle, and first Peirithous holding out his hand bade", "578": "Theseus himself assess the damages of his raid upon the cattle, saying that he himself would willingly submit to whatever penalty the other might inflict.", "579": "Theseus thought no more of their quarrel, and invited him to become his friend and comrade;", "580": "and they ratified their compact of friendship by an oath.", "581": "Hereupon, Peirithous, who was about to marry Deidameia, begged Theseus to come and visit his country and meet the Lapithæ.", "582": "He also had invited the Centaurs to the banquet;", "583": "and as they in their drunken insolence laid hands upon the women, the Lapithæ attacked them.", "584": "Some of them they slew, and the rest they overcame, and afterwards, with the assistance of Theseus, banished from their country.", "585": "Herodorus, however, says that this is not how these events took place, but that the war was going on, and that Theseus went to help the Lapithæ and while on his way thither first beheld Herakles, whom he made a point of visiting at Trachis, where he was resting aftei his labours and wanderings;", "586": "and that they met with many compliments and much good feeling on both sides.", "587": "But one would more incline to those writers who tell us that they often met, and that Herakles was initiated by Theseus's desire, and was also purified before initiation at his instance, which ceremony was necessary because of some reckless action.", "588": "XXXI.", "589": "Theseus was fifty years old, according to Hellanikus, when he carried off Helen, who was a mere child.", "590": "For this reason some who wish to clear him of this, the heaviest of all the charges against him, say that it was not he who carried off Helen, but that Idas and Lynkeus carried her off and deposited her in his keeping.", "591": "Afterwards the Twin Brethren came and demanded her back, but he would not give her up;", "592": "or even it is said that Tyndareus himself handed her over to him, because he feared that Enarsphorus the son of Hippocoon would take her by force, she being only a child at the time.", "593": "But the most probable story and that which most writers agree in is the following:", "594": "The two friends, Theseus and Peirithous, came to Sparta, seized the maiden, who was dancing in the temple of Artemis Orthia, and carried her off.", "595": "As the pursuers followed no farther than Tegea, they felt no alarm, but leisurely travelled through Peloponnesus, and made a compact that whichever of them should win Helen by lot was to have her to wife, but must help the other to a marriage.", "596": "They cast lots on this understanding, and Theseus won.", "597": "As the maiden was not yet ripe for marriage he took her with him to Aphidnæ, and there placing his mother with her gave her into the charge of his friend Aphidnus, bidding him watch over her and keep her presence secret.", "598": "He himself in order to repay his obligation to Peirithous went on a journey with him to Epirus to obtain the daughter of Aidoneus the king of the Molossians, who called his wife Persephone, his daughter Kore, and his clog Cerberus.", "599": "All the suitors of his daughter were bidden by him to fight this dog, and the victor was to receive her hand.", "600": "However, as he learned that Peirithous and his friend were come, not as wooers, but as ravishers, he cast them into prison.", "601": "He put an end to Peirithous at once, by means of his dog, but only guarded Theseus strictly.", "602": "XXXII.", "603": "Now at this period Mnestheus, the son of Peteus, who was the son of Omeus, who was the son of Erechtheus, first of all mankind they say took to the arts of a demagogue, and to currying favour with the people.", "604": "This man formed a league of the nobles, who had long borne", "605": "Theseus a grudge for having destroyed the local jurisdiction and privileges of each of the Eupatrids by collecting them all together into the capital, where they were no more than his subjects and slaves;", "606": "and he also excited the common people by telling them that although they were enjoying a fancied freedom they really had been deprived of their ancestral privileges and sacred rites, and made to endure the rule of one foreign despot, instead of that of many good kings of their own blood.", "607": "While he was thus busily employed, the invasion of Attica by the sons of Tyndareus greatly assisted his revolutionary scheme;", "608": "so that some say that it was he who invited them to come.", "609": "At first they abstained from violence, and confined themselves to asking that their sister Helen should be given up to them ;", "610": "but when they were told by the citizens that she was not in their hands, and that they knew not where she was, they proceeded to warlike measures.", "611": "Akademus, who had by some means discovered that she was concealed at Aphidnae, now told them where she was;", "612": "for which cause he was honoured

sake.", "613": "Dikæarchus says that Echemus and Marathus, two Arcadians, took part in that war with the sons of Tyndareus;", "614": "and that from the first the place now called Akademeia was then named Echedemia, and that from the second the township of Marathon takes its names, because he in accordance with some oracle voluntarily offered himself as a sacrifice there in the sight of the whole army.", "615": "However, the sons of Tyndareus came to Aphidnæ, and took the place after a battle, in which it is said that Alykus fell, the son of Skeiron, who then was fighting on the side of the Dioskuri.", "616": "In memory of this man it is said that the place in the territory of Megara where his remains lie is called Alykus.", "617": "But Hereas writes that Alykus was slain by Theseus at Aphidnæ, and as evidence he quotes this verse about Alykus, “ Him whom Theseus slew in the spacious streets of Aphidnæ, Fighting for fair-haired Helen.\"", "618": "But it is not likely that if Theseus had been there, his mother and the town of Aphidnæ would have been taken.", "619": "XXXIII.", "620": "After the fall of Aphidnæ, the people of Athens became terrified, and were persuaded by Mnestheus to admit the sons of Tyndareus to the city, and to treat them as friends, because, he said, they were only at war with Theseus, who had been the first to use violence, and were the saviours and benefactors of the rest of mankind.", "621": "These words of his were confirmed by their behaviour, for, victorious as they were, they yet demanded nothing except initiation into the mysteries, as they were, no less than Herakles, connected with the city.", "622": "This was permitted them, and they were adopted by Aphidnus, as Herakles had been by Pylius.", "623": "They received divine honours, being addressed as \" Anakes,\" either because of the cessation of the war, or from the care they took, when they had such a large army within the walls of Athens, that no one should be wronged ;",

this verse, and the legend about Mounychus, who is said to have been the bastard son of Laodike, by Demophoon, and to have been brought up in Troy by Aithra.", "629": "But Istrus, in his thirteenth book of his ‘ History of Attica,' tells quite a different and peculiar story about Aithra, that he had heard that Paris was conquered by Achilles and Patroklus near the river Spercheius, in Thessaly,

Peirithous, but he begged for the life of Theseus, and pointed out that the release of his friend was a favour which he deserved.", "635": "Aidoneus agreed, and Theseus, when set free, returned to Athens, where he found that his party was not yet overpowered.", "636": "Whatever consecrated grounds had been set apart for him by the city, he dedicated to Herakles, and called Heraklea instead of Thesea, except four, according to Philochorus.", "637": "But, as he at once wished to preside and manage the state as before, he was met by factious opposition, for he found that those who had been his enemies before, had now learned not to fear him, while the common people had become corrupted, and now required to be specially flattered instead of doing their duty in silence.", "638": "He endeavoured to establish his government by force, but was overpowered by faction;", "639": "and at last, despairing of success, he secretly sent his children to Eubœa, to Elephenor, the son of Chalkodous;", "640": "and he himself, after solemnly uttering curses on the Athenians at Gargettus,' where now is the place called Araterion, or the place of curses, set sail for Skyros, where he was, he imagined, on friendly terms with the inhabitants, and possessed a paternal estate in the island.", "641": "At that time Lykomedes was king of Skyros;", "642": "so he proceeded to demand from him his lands, in order to live there, though some say that he asked him to assist him against the Athenians.", "643": "Lyko­ medes, either in fear of the great reputation of Theseus, or else to gain the favour of Mnestheus, led him up to the highest mountain top in the country, on the pretext of showing him his estate from thence, and pushed him over a precipice.", "644": "Some say that he stumbled and fell of himself, as he was walking after supper, according to his custom.", "645": "As soon as he was dead, no one thought any more of him, but Mnestheus reigned over the Athenians, while Theseus's children were brought up as private citizens by Elephenor, and followed him to Ilium.", "646": "When Mnestheus died at Ilium, they returned home and resumed their rightful sovereignty.", "647": "In sub­ sequent times, among many other things which led the Athenians to honour Theseus as a hero or demi-god, most remarkable was his appearance at the battle of Marathon, where his spirit was seen by many, clad in armour, lead­ ing the charge against the barbarians.", "648": "XXXVI.", "649": "After the Persian war, in the archonship of Phædo, the Athenians were told by the Delphian Oracle to take home the bones of Theseus and keep them with the greatest care and honour.", "650": "There was great difficulty in obtaining them and in discovering his tomb, on account of the wild and savage habits of the natives of the island.", "651": "However, Kimon took the island, as is written in my history of his Life, and making it a point of honour to dis­ cover his tomb, he chanced to behold an eagle pecking with its beak and scratching with its talons at a small rising ground.", "652": "Here he dug, imagining that the spot had been pointed out by a miracle.", "653": "There was found the coffin of a man of great stature, and lying beside it a brazen lance-head and a sword.", "654": "These relics were brought to Athens by Kimon, on board of his trireme, and the de­ lighted Athenians received them with splendid processions and sacrifices, just as if the hero himself were come to the city.", "655": "He is buried in the midst of the city, near where the Gymnasium now stands, and his tomb is a place of sanctuary for slaves, and all that are poor and oppressed, because Theseus, during his life, was the champion and avenger of the poor, and always kindly hearkened to their prayers.", "656": "Their greatest sacrifice in his honour takes place on the eighth of the month of Pyanepsion, upon which day he and the youths came back from Crete.", "657": "But besides this they hold a service in his honour on the eighth of all the other months, either because it was on the eighth day of Hekatombeion that he first arrived in Athens from Troezen, as is related by Diodorus the topographer, or else thinking that number to be especially his own, because he is said to have been the son of Poseidon, and Poseidon is honoured on the eighth day of every month.", "658": "For the number eight is the first cube of an even number, and is double the first square, and therefore peculiarly represents the immovable abiding power of that god whom we address as \" the steadfast,\"

that the Pelasgi, after wander­ ing over the greater part of the world, and conquering most nations, settled there, and gave the city its name from their own strength in battle.-", "662": "Others tell us that after the capture of Troy some fugitives obtained ships, were carried by the winds to the Tyrrhenian or Tuscan coast, and cast anchor in the Tiber.", "663": "There the women, who had suffered much from the sea voyage, were advised by one who was accounted chief among them for wisdom and noble birth, Roma by name, to burn the ships.", "664": "At first the men were angry at this, but afterwards, being compelled to settle round about the Palatine Hill, they fared better than they expected, as they found the country fertile and the neighbours hospitable;", "665": "so they paid great honour to Roma, and called the city after her name.", "666": "From this circumstance, they say, arose the present habit of women kissing their male relatives and connections;", "667": "because those women, after they had burned the ships, thus embraced and caressed the men, trying to pacify their rage.", "668": "II.", "669": "Some say that Roma, who gave the name to the city, was the daughter of Italus and Leucaria, or of Telephus the son of Hercules, and the wife of iEneas, while others say that she was the daughter of Ascanius the son of Æneas.", "670": "Others relate that Romanus, the son of Odysseus and Circe, founded the city, or that it was Romus, the son of Hemathion, who was sent from Troy by Diomedes;", "671": "or Romis the despot of the Latins, who drove out of his kingdom the Tyrrhenians, who, starting from Thessaly, had made their way to Lydia, and thence to Italy.", "672": "And even those who follow the most reasonable of these legends, and admit that it was Romulus who founded the city after his own name, do not agree about his birth;", "673": "for some say that he was the son of Æneas and Dexithea the daughter of Phorbas, and with his brother Romus was brought to Italy when a child, and that as the river was in flood, all the other boats were swamped, but that in which the children were was carried to a soft bank and miraculously preserved, from which the name of Rome was given to the place.", "674": "Others say that Roma, the daughter of that Trojan lady, married Latinus the son of Telemachus and bore a son, Romulus;", "675": "while others say that his mother was Æmilia the daughter of Æneas and Lavinia, by an intrigue with Mars;", "676": "while others give a completely legendary account of his birth, as follows :", "677": "In the house of Tarchetius, the king of the Albani, a cruel and lawless man, a miracle took place.", "678": "A male figure arose from the hearth, and remained there for many days.", "679": "Now there was in Etruria an oracle of Tethys, which told Tarchetius that a virgin must be offered to the figure ;", "680": "for there should be born of her a son surpassing all mankind in strength, valour, and good fortune.", "681": "Tarchetius hereupon explained the oracle to one of his daughters, and ordered her to.", "682": "give herself up to the figure ;", "683": "but she, not liking to do so, sent her servant-maid instead.", "684": "Tarchetius, when he learned this, was greatly incensed, and cast them both into prison, meaning to put them to death.", "685": "However, in a dream, Vesta appeared to him, forbidding him to slay them.", "686": "In consequence of this he locked them up with a loom, telling them that when they had woven the piece of work upon it they should be married.", "687": "So they wove all day, and during the night other maidens sent by Tarchetius undid their work again.", "688": "Now when the servant-maid was delivered of twins, Tarchetius gave them to one Teratius, and bade him destroy them.", "689": "He laid them down near the river;", "690": "and there they were suckled by a she-wolf, while all sorts of birds brought them morsels of food, until one day a cowherd saw them.", "691": "Filled with wonder he ventured to come up to the children and bear them off.", "692": "Saved from death in this manner they grew up, and then attacked and slew Tarchetius.", "693": "This is the legend given by one Promathion, the compiler of a history of Italy.", "694": "III.", "695": "But the most credible story, and that has most vouchers for its truth, is that which was first published in Greece by Dickies of Peparethos, a writer whom Fabius Pictor has followed in most points.", "696": "There are variations in this legend also;", "697": "but, generally speaking, it runs as follows:", "698": "The dynasty established by Æneas at Alba Longa, came down to two brothers, Numitor and Amulius.", "699": "Amulius offered his brother the choice between the sovereign power and the royal treasure, including the gold brought from Troy.", "700": "Numitor chose the sovereign power.", "701": "But Amulius, possessing all the treasure, and thereby having more power than his brother, easily dethroned him, and, as he feared his brother's daughter might have children who would avenge him, he made her a priestess of Vesta, sworn to celibacy for ever.", "702": "This lady is named by

alarmed at this, bade an attendant take them and expose them.", "706": "Some say that this man's name was Faustulus, while others say that this was not his name, but that of their rescuer.", "707": "However, he placed the infants in a cradle, and went down to the river with the intention of throwing them into it, but seeing it running strong and turbulently, he feared to approach it, laid down the cradle near the bank and went away.", "708": "The river, which was in flood, rose, and gently floated off the cradle, and carried it down to a soft place which is now called Cermalus, but

persons imagine, or because cattle came to ruminate in its shade, or, more probably, because of the suckling of the children there, for the ancients called the nipple rouma.", "711": "Moreover, they call the goddess who appears to have watched over the children Roumilia, and to her they sacrifice offerings without wine, and pour milk as a libation upon her altar.", "712": "It is said that while

say that the twofold meaning of the name of their nurse gave rise to this legend, for the Latins use the word lupa for she-wolves, and also for unchaste women, as was the wife of Faustulus, who brought up the children, Acca Laurentia by name.", "717": "To her also the Romans offer sacrifice, and in the month of April the priest of Mars brings libations to her, and the feast is called

god might possess her.", "723": "And, indeed, the god is said to have appeared to the lady, and to have bidden her go early in the morning into the market-place, and to embrace the first man she met,

of Alba sympathised with Remus, and feared that he would be unjustly put to death, or worse, Amulius, alarmed at them, handed over Remus to his brother Numitor, to deal with as he pleased.", "751":

undismayed by his present circumstances, and having heard that his deeds corresponded to his appearance, and above all, as seems probable, some god being with him and watching over the first beginnings of great events, he was struck by the idea of asking him to tell the truth as to who he was, and how he was born, giving him confidence and encouragement by his kindly voice and looks.",

woodpecker as we lay in our cradle beside the great river.", "758": "Our cradle still exists, carefully preserved, bound with brazen bands, on which is an indistinct inscription, which hereafter will serve as a means by which we may be recognised by our parents, but to no purpose if we are dead.\"", "759": "Numitor, considering the young man's story, and reckoning up the time from his apparent age, willingly embraced the hope which was dawning on his mind, and considered how he might obtain a secret interview with his daughter and tell her of all this;", "760": "for she was still kept a close prisoner.", "761": "VIII.", "762": "Faustulus, when he heard of Remus being captured and delivered up to Numitor, called upon Romulus to help him, and told him plainly all about his birth;", "763": "although previously he had hinted so much, that any one who paid attention to his words might have known nearly all about it;", "764": "and he himself with the cradle ran to Numitor full of hopes and fears, now that matters had come to a critical point.", "765": "He was viewed with suspicion by the guards at the king's gate, and while they were treating him con­ temptuously, and confusing him by questions, they espied the cradle under his cloak.", "766": "Now it chanced that one of them had been one of those who had taken the children to cast them away, and had been present when they were abandoned.", "767": "This man, seeing the cradle and recognising it by its make and the inscription on it, suspected the truth, and at once told the king and brought the man in to be examined.", "768": "Faustulus, in these dire straits, did not altogether remain unshaken, and yet did not quite allow his secret to be wrung from him.", "769": "He admitted that the boys were alive, but said that they were living far away from Alba, and that he himself was bringing the cradle to Ilia, who had often longed to see and touch it to confirm her belief in the life of her children.", "770": "Now Amulius did what men generally do when excited by fear or rage.", "771": "He sent in a great hurry one who was a good man and a friend of Numitor, bidding him ask Numitor whether he had heard anything about the survival of the children.", "772": "This man on arrival, finding Numitor all but embracing Remus, confirmed his belief that he was his grandson, and bade him take his measures quickly, remaining by him himself to offer assistance.", "773": "Even had they wished it, there was no time for delay;", "774": "for Romulus was already near, and no small number of the citizens, through hatred and fear of Amulius, were going out to join him.", "775": "He himself brought no small force, arrayed in companies of a hundred each.", "776": "Each of these was led by a man who carried a bundle of sticks and straw upon a pole.", "777": "The Latins called these manipla;", "778": "and from this these com­ panies are even at the present day called maniples in the Roman army.", "779": "Now as Remus raised a revolt within, while Romulus assailed the palace without, the despot was captured and put to death without having been able to do anything, or take any measures for his own safety.", "780": "The greater part of the above story is told by Fabius Pictor and Dickies of Peparethos, who seem to have been the first historians of the foundation of Rome.", "781": "The story is doubted by many on account of its theatrical and arti­ ficial form, yet we ought not to disbelieve it when we consider what wondrous works are wrought by chance, and when, too, we reflect on the Roman Empire, which, had it not had a divine origin, never could have arrived at its present extent.", "782": "IX.", "783": "After the death of Amulius, and the reorganisation of the kingdom, the twins, who would not live in Alba as subjects, and did not wish to reign there during the life of their grandfather, gave up the sovereign power to him, and, having made a suitable provision for their mother, determined to dwell by themselves, and to found a city in the parts in which they themselves had been reared;", "784": "at least, this is the most probable of the various reasons which are given.", "785": "It may also have been necessary, as many slaves and fugitives had gathered round them, either that they should disperse these men and so lose their entire power, or else go and dwell alone amongst them.", "786": "It is clear, from the rape of the Sabine women, that the citizens of Alba would not admit these outcasts into their own body, since that deed was caused, not by wanton insolence, but by necessity, as they could not obtain wives by fair means;", "787": "for after carrying the women off they treated them with the greatest respect.", "788": "After­ wards, when the city was once founded, they made it a sanctuary for people in distress to take refuge in, saying that it belonged to the god Asylus;", "789": "and they received in it all sorts of persons, not giving up slaves to their masters, debtors to their creditors, or murderers to their judges, but saying that, in accordance with a Pythian oracle, the sanctuary was free to all;", "790": "so that the city soon became full of men, for they say that at first it contained no less than a thousand hearths.", "791": "Of this more hereafter.", "792": "When they were proceeding to found the city, they at once quarrelled about its site.", "793": "Romulus fixed upon what is now called Roma Quadrata, a square piece of ground, and wished the city to be built in that place ;", "794": "but Remus pre­ ferred a strong position on Mount Aventine, which, in memory of him, was called the Remonium, and now is called Rignarium.", "795": "They agreed to decide their dispute by watching the flight of birds, and having taken their seats apart, it is said that six vultures appeared to Remus, and afterwards twice as many to Romulus.", "796": "Some say that Remus really saw his vultures, but that Romulus only pretended to have seen them, and when Remus came to him, then the twelve appeared to Romulus;", "797": "for which reason the Romans at the present day draw their auguries especially from vultures.", "798": "Herodorus of Pontus says that Hercules de­ lighted in the sight of a vulture, when about to do any great action.", "799": "It is the most harmless of all creatures, for it injures neither crops, fruit, nor cattle, and lives entirely upon dead corpses.", "800": "It does not kill or injure anything that has life, and even abstains from dead birds from its relationship to them.", "801": "Now eagles, and owls, and falcons, peck and kill other birds, in spite of Æschylus's line, \" Bird-eating bird polluted e'er must be.\"", "802": "Moreover, the other birds are, so to speak, ever before our eyes, and continually remind us of their presence;", "803": "but the vulture is seldom seen, and it is difficult to meet with its young, which has suggested to some persons the strange idea that vultures come from some other world to pay us their rare visits.", "804": "which are like those occurrences whicli.", "805": "according to the soothsayers, do not happen naturally or spontaneously, but by the interposition of Heaven.X.", "806": "When Remus discovered the deceit he was very angry, and, while Romulus was digging a trench round where the city wall was to be built, he jeered at the works, and hindered them.", "807": "At last, as he jumped over it, he was struck dead either by Romulus himself, or by Celer, one of his companions.", "808": "In this fight, Faustulus was slain, and also Pleistinus, who is said to have been Faustulus's brother and to have helped him in rearing Romulus and his brother.", "809": "Celer retired into Tyrrhenia, and from him the Romans call quick sharp men Celeres;", "810": "Quintus Metellus, who, when his father died, in a very few days exhibited a show of gladiators, was surnamed Celer by the Romans in their wonder at the short time he had spent in his preparations.", "811": "XI.", "812": "Romulus, after burying Remus and his foster-parents in the Remurium, consecrated his city, having fetched men from Etruria, who taught him how to perform it according to sacred rites and ceremonies, as though they were celebrating holy mysteries.", "813": "A trench was dug in a circle round what is now the Comitium, and into it were flung first-fruits of all those things which are honourable and necessary for men.", "814": "Finally each man brought a little of the earth of the country from which he came, and flung it into one heap and mixed it all together.", "815": "They call this pit by the same name as the heavens, Mundus.", "816": "Next, they drew the outline of the city in the form of a circle, with this place as its centre..", "817": "And then the founder, having fitted a plough with a brazen ploughshare, and yoked to it a bull and a cow, himself ploughs a deep furrow round the boundaries.", "818": "It is the duty of his attendants to throw the clods inwards, which the plough turns up, and to let none of them fall outwards.", "819": "By this line they define the ex­ tent of the fortifications, and it is called by contraction, Pomœrium, which means behind the walls or beyond the walls (post mœnia).", "820": "Wherever they intend to place a gate they take off the ploughshare, and carry the plough over, leaving a space.", "821": "After this ceremony they con.", "822": "sider the entire wall sacred, except the gates;", "823": "but if they were sacred also, they oould not without scruple bring in and out necessaries and unclean things through them.", "824": "XII.", "825": "It is agreed that the foundation of the city took place on the eleventh day before the Kalends of May (the 21st of April).", "826": "And on this day the Romans keep a festival which they call the birthday of the city.", "827": "At this feast, originally, we are told, they sacrificed nothing that has life, but thought it right to keep the anniversary of the birth of the city pure and unpolluted by blood.", "828": "How.", "829": "ever, before the foundation of the city, they used to keep a pastoral feast called Palilia.", "830": "The Roman months at the present day do not in any way correspond to those of Greece ;", "831": "yet they (the Greeks) distinctly affirm that the day upon which Romulus founded the city was the 30th of the month.", "832": "The Greeks likewise tell us that on that day an eclipse of the sun took place, which they think was that observed by Antimachus of Teos, the epic poet, which occurred in the third year of the sixth Olympiad.", "833": "In the time of Varro the philosopher, who of all the Romans was.", "834": "most deeply versed in Roman history, there was one Taroutius, a companion of his, a philosopher and mathe­ matician, who had especially devoted himself to the art of casting nativities, and was thought to have attained great skill therein.", "835": "To this man Varro proposed the task of finding the day and hour of Romulus's birth, basing his calculations on the influence which the stars were said to have had upon his life, just as geometricians solve their problems by the analytic method ;", "836": "for it belongs, he argued, to the same science to predict the life of a man from the time of his birth, and to find the date of a man's birth if the incidents of his life are given.", "837": "Taroutius performed his task, and after considering the things done and suffered by Romulus, the length of his life, the manner of his death, and all such like matters, he confidently and boldly asserted that Romulus was conceived by his mother in the first year of the second Olympiad, at the third hour of the twenty-third day of the month which is called in the Egyptian calendar Choiac, at which time there was a total eclipse of the sun.", "838": "He stated that he was born on the twenty-first day of the month Thouth, about sunrise.", "839": "Rome was founded by him on the ninth day of the muuth Pharmouthi, between the second and third hour;", "840": "for it is supposed that the fortunes of cities, as well as those of men, have their certain periods which can be discovered by the position of the stars at their nativities.", "841": "The quaint subtlety of these speculations may perhaps amuse the reader more than their legendary character will weary him.", "842": "XIII.", "843": "When the city was founded, Romulus first divided all the able-bodied males into regiments, each consisting of three thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry.", "844": "These were named legions, because they consisted of men of military age selected from the population.", "845": "The rest of the people were now organised.", "846": "They were called Populus, and a hundred of the noblest were chosen from among them and formed into a council.", "847": "These he called Patricians, and their assembly the Senate.", "848": "This word Senate clearly means assembly of old men;", "849": "and the members of it were named Patricians, according to some, because they were the fathers of legitimate offspring;", "850": "according to others, because they were able to give an account of who their own fathers were, which few of the first colonists were able to do.", "851": "Others say that it was from their Patrocinium, as they then called, and do at the present day call, their patronage of their clients.", "852": "There is a legend that this word arose from one Patron, a com­ panion of Evander, who was kind and helpful to his inferiors.", "853": "But it is most reasonable to suppose that Romulus called them by this name because he intended the most powerful men to show kindness to their inferiors, and to show the poorer classes that they ought not to fear the great nor grudge them their honours, but be on friendly terms with them, thinking of them and addressing them as fathers (Patres).", "854": "For, up to the present day, foreigners address the senators as Lords, but the Romans call them Conscript Fathers, using the most honourable and least offensive of their titles.", "855": "Originally they were merely called the Fathers, but afterwards, as more were enrolled, they were called Conscript Fathers.", "856": "By this more dignified title Romulus distinguished the Senate from the People ;", "857": "and he introduced another distinction between the powerful and the common people by naming the former patrons, which means defenders, and the latter clients, which means dependants.", "858": "By this means he im­ planted in thorn a mutual good feeling which was the source of great benefits, for the patrons acted as advocates for their clients in law suits, and in all cases became their advisers and friends, while the clients not only respected their patrons but even assisted them, when they were poor, to portion their daughters or pay their creditors.", "859": "No law or magistrate could compel a patron to bear witness against his client, nor a client against his patron.", "860": "More­ over, in later times, although all their other rights remained unimpaired, it was thought disgraceful for a patron to receive money from a client.", "861": "So much for these matters.", "862": "XIV.", "863": "In the fourth month after the city was founded, we are told by Fabius, the reckless deed of carrying off the women took place.", "864": "Some say that Romulus himself naturally loved war, and, being persuaded by some pro­ phecies that Rome was fated to grow by wars and so reach the greatest prosperity, attacked the Sabines with­ out provocation ;", "865": "for he did not carry off many maidens, but only thirty, as though it was war that he desired more than wives for his followers.", "866": "This is not probable:", "867": "Romulus saw that his city was newly-filled with colonists, few of whom had wives, while most of them were a mixed multitude of poor or unknown origin, who were despised by the neighouring states, and expected by them shortly to fall to pieces.", "868": "He intended his violence to lead to an alliance with the Sabines, as soon as the damsels became reconciled to their lot, and set about it as follows :", "869": "First he circulated a rumour that the altar of some god had been discovered, hidden in the earth.", "870": "This god was called.", "871": "Census, either because he was the god of counsel (for the Romans to this day call their assembly Concilium, and their chief magistrates consuls, as it were those who take counsel on behalf of the people), or else it was the equestrian Neptune.", "872": "The altar stands in the greater hippodrome, apd is kept concealed except during the horse-races, when it is uncovered.", "873": "Some say that, as the whole plot was dark and mysterious, it was natural that the god's altar should be underground.", "874": "When it was brought out, he proclaimed a splendid sacrifice in its honour, and games and shows open to all men.", "875": "Many people assembled to see them, and Romulus sat among his nobles, dressed in a purple robe.", "876": "The signal for the assault was that he should rise, unfold his cloak, and then again wrap it around him.", "877": "Many men armed with swords stood round him, and at the signal they drew their swords, rushed forward with a shout, and snatched up the daughters of the Sabines, but allowed the others to escape unharmed.", "878": "Some say that only thirty were carried off, from whom the thirty tribes were named, but Valerius of Antium says five hundred and twenty-seven, and Juba six hundred and eighty-three, all maidens.", "879": "This is the best apology for Romulus ;", "880": "for they only carried off one married woman, Hersilia, which proved that it was not through insolence or wickedness that they carried them off, but with the intention of forcibly effect­ ing a union between the two races.", "881": "Some say that Hersilia married Hostilius, one of the noblest Romans, others that she married Romulus himself, and that he had children by her;", "882": "one daughter, called Prima from her being the first-born, and one son, whom his father originally named Aollius, because of the assembling of the citizens, but whom they afterwards named Avillius.", "883": "This is the story as told by Zenodotus of Trœzen, but many contra­ dict it.", "884": "XV.", "885": "Among the ravishers they say there were some men of low condition who had seized a remarkably tall and beautiful maiden.", "886": "When any of the nobles met them and endeavoured to take her away from them, they cried out that they were taking her to Talasius, a young man of good family and reputation.", "887": "Hearing this, all agreed and applauded, and some even turned and accompanied them, crying out the name of Talasius through their friendship for him.", "888": "From this circumstance the Romans up to the present day call upon Talasius in their marriage- songs, as the Greeks do upon Hymen;", "889": "for Talasius is said to have been fortunate in his wife.", "890": "Sextius Sulla of Carthage, a man neither deficient in learning or taste, told me that this word was given by Romulus as the signal for the rape, and so that all those who carried off maidens cried \" Talasio.\"", "891": "But most authors, among whom is Juba, think that it is used to encourage brides to industry and spinning wool (talasia), as at that time Greek words had not been overpowered by Latin ones.", "892": "But if this be true, and the Romans at that time really used this word “ talasia\" for wool-spinning, as we do, we might make another more plausible conjecture about it.", "893": "When the treaty of peace was arranged between the Romans and the Sabines, a special provision was made about the women, that they were to do no work for the men except wool-spinning.", "894": "And thus the custom remained for the friends of those who were married afterwards to call upon Talasius in jest, meaning to testify that the bride was to do no other work than spinning.", "895": "To the present day the custom remains in force that the bride must not step over the threshold into her house, but be lifted over it and carried in, because the Sabine maidens were carried in forcibly, and did not walk in.", "896": "Some add that the parting of the bride's hair with the point of a spear is done in memory of the first Roman marriage having been effected by war and battle;", "897": "on which subject we have enlarged further in our treatise on Causes.", "898": "The rape of the Sabines took place upon the eighteenth day of the month Sextilis, which is now called August, on which day the feast of the Consualia is kept.", "899": "XVI.", "900": "The Sabines were a numerous and warlike tribe, dwelling in unwalled villages, as though it was their birthright as a Lacedaemonian colony to be brave and fearless.", "901": "Yet when they found themselves bound by such hostages to keep the peace, and in fear for their daughters, they sent an embassy to propose equitable and moderate terms, that Romulus should give back their daughters to them, and disavow the violence which had been used, and that afterwards the two nations should live together in amity and concord.", "902": "But when Romulus refused to deliver up the maidens, but invited the Sabines to accept his alliance, while the other tribes were hesitating and considering what was to be done, Acron, the king of the Ceninetes, a man of spirit and renown in the wars, who had viewed Romulus first proceeding in founding a city with suspicion, now, after what he had done in carrying oil the women, declared that he was becoming dangerous., and would not be endurable unless he were chastised.", "903": "He at once began the war, and marched with a great force;", "904": "and Romulus marched to meet him.", "905": "When they came in sight of each other they each challenged the other to fight, the soldiers on both sides looking on.", "906": "Romulus made a vow that if he should overcome and kill his enemy he would himself carry his spoils to the temple of Jupiter and offer them to him.", "907": "He overcame his adversary, and slew him, routed his army and captured his city.", "908": "He did not harm the inhabitants, except that he ordered them to demolish their houses and follow him to Rome, to become citizens on equal terms with the rest.", "909": "This is the policy by which Rome grew so great, namely that of absorbing conquered nations into herself on terms of equality.", "910": "Romulus, in order to make the fulfilment of his vow as pleasing to Jupiter, and as fine a spectacle for the citizens as he could, cut down a tall oak-tree at his camp, and fashioned it into a trophy,.", "911": "upon which he hung or fastened all the arms of Acron, each in its proper place.", "912": "Then he girded on his own clothes, placed a crown of laurel upon his long hair, and, placing the trophy upright on his right shoulder, marched along in his armour, singing a paean of victory, with all the army following him.", "913": "At Rome the citizens received him with admiration and delight;", "914": "and this procession was the origin of all the subsequent triumphs and the model which they imitated.", "915": "The trophy itself was called an offering to Jupiter Feretrius ;", "916": "for the Romans call to strike, ferire, and Romulus prayed that he might strike down his enemy.", "917": "The spoils were called spolia opima, according to Varro, because opim means excellence.", "918": "A more plausible interpretation would be from the deed itself, for work is called in Latin opus.", "919": "This dedication of spolia opima is reserved as a privilege for a general who has slain the opposing general with hit own hand.", "920": "It has only been enjoyed by three Roman generals, first by Romulus, who slew Acron, king of the Ceninetes, second by Cornelius Cossus, who slew the Tyrrhenian Tolumnius, and, above all, by Claudius Marcellus, who killed Britomart, the king of the Gauls.", "921": "Now Cossus and Marcellus drove into the city in chariots and four, carrying the trophies in their own hands;", "922": "but Dionysius is in error when he says that Romulus used a chariot and four, for the historians tell us that Tarquinius, the son of Demaratus, was the first of the kings who introduced this pomp into his triumphs.", "923": "Others say that Poplicola was the first to triumph in a chariot.", "924": "However, the statues of Romulus bearing the trophy, which are to be seen in Rome, are all on foot.", "925": "XVII.", "926": "After the capture of the Ceninete tribe, while the rest of the Sabines were still engaged in preparation for war, the inhabitants of Fidenee and Crustumerium and Antemna attacked the Romans.", "927": "A battle took place in which they were all alike worsted, after which they permitted Romulus to take their cities, divide their lands, and incorporate them as citizens.", "928": "Romulus divided all the lands among the citizens, except that which was held by the fathers of any of the maidens who had been carried off, which he allowed them to retain.", "929": "The remainder of the Sabines, angry at these successes, chose Tatius as their general and marched against Rome.", "930": "The city was hard to attack, as the Capitol stood as an advanced fort to defend it.", "931": "Here was placed a garrison, and Tarpeius was its commander, not the maiden Tarpeia, as some write, who make out Romulus a fool;", "932": "but it was this Tarpeia, the daughter of the captain of the garrison, who betrayed the capital to the Sabines, for the sake of the golden bracelets which she saw them wearing.", "933": "She asked as the price of her treachery that they should give her what they wore on their left arms.", "934": "After making an agreement with Tatius, she opened a gate at night and let in the Sabines.", "935": "Now it appears that Antigonus was not singular when he said that he loved men when they were betraying, but hated them after they had betrayed;", "936": "as also Cæsar said, in the case of Rhymitalkes the Thracian, that he loved the treachery but hated the traitor;", "937": "but this seems a common reflection about bad men by those who have need of them, just as we need the poison of certain venomous beasts;", "938": "for they appreciate their value while they are making use of them, and loathe their wickedness when they have done with them.", "939": "And that was how Tarpeia was treated by Tatius.", "940": "He ordered the Sabines to re­ member their agreement, and not to grudge her what was on their left arms.", "941": "He himself first of all took off his gold armlet, and with it flung his great oblong shield.", "942": "As all the rest did the like, she perished, being pelted with the gold bracelets and crushed by the number and weight of the shields.", "943": "Tarpeius also was convicted of treachery by Romulus, according to Juba's version of the history of Sulpicius Galba.", "944": "The other legends about Tarpeia are improbable;", "945": "amongst them that which is told by Anti­ gonus, that she was the daughter of Tatius the Sabine leader, abducted by Romulus, and treated by her father as is related above.", "946": "Simylus the poet talks utter nonsense when he says that it was not the Sabines but the Gauls to whom Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol, because she was in love with their king.", "947": "His verses run as follows :", "948": "“", "949": "And near Tarpeia, by the Capitol That dwelt, betrayer of the walls of Rome.", "950": "She loved the chieftain of the Gauls too well, To guard from treachery her father's home.", "951": "\"And a little afterwards he speaks of her death. “", "952": "Her did the Boians and the Celtic tribes Bury, but not beside the stream of Po;", "953": "From off their warlike arms their shields they flung, And what the damsel longed for laid her low.\"", "954": "XVIII.", "955": "However, as Tarpeia was buried there, the hill was called the Tarpeian hill until King Tarquinius, when he dedicated the place to Jupiter, removed her remains and abolished the name of Tarpeia.", "956": "But even to this day they call the rock in the Capitol the Tarpeian Rock, down which malefactors used to be flung.", "957": "When the Sabines held the citadel, Romulus in fury challenged them to come down and fight.", "958": "Tatius accepted his challenge with confidence, as he saw that if overpowered his men would have a strong place of refuge to retreat to.", "959": "All the inter­ mediate space, in which they were about to engage, was surrounded by hills, and so seemed to make a desperate battle necessary, as there were but narrow outlets for flight or pursuit.", "960": "It chanced, also, that the river had been in flood a few days before, and had left a deep muddy pool of water upon the level ground where the Forum now stands;", "961": "so that men's footing was not certain, but difficult and treacherous.", "962": "Here a piece of good fortune betel the Sabines as they heedlessly pressed forward.", "963": "Curtius, one of their chiefs, a man with a reputation for dashing courage, rode on horseback far before the rest.", "964": "His horse plunged into this morass, and he, after trying to extricate him, at last finding it impossible, left him there and saved himself.", "965": "This place, in memory of him, is still called the Gulf of Curtius.", "966": "Warned of their danger, the Sabines fought a stout and indecisive battle, in which many fell, amongst them Hostilius.", "967": "He is said to have been the husband of Hersilia and the grandfather of Hostilius, who became king after the reign of Numa.", "968": "Many combats took place in that narrow space, as we may suppose;", "969": "and especial mention is made of one, which proved the last, in which Romulus was struck on the head by a stone and like to fall, and unable to fight longer.", "970": "The Romans now gave way to the Sabines, and fled to the Palatine hill, abandoning the level ground.", "971": "Romulus, now recovered from the blow, endeavoured to stay the fugitives, and with loud shouts called upon them to stand firm and fight.", "972": "But as the stream of fugitives poured on, and no one had the courage to face round, he lifted his hands to heaven and prayed to Jupiter to stay the army and not to allow the tottering state of Rome to fall, but to help it.", "973": "After his prayer many were held back from flight by reverence for the king, and the fugitives suddenly resumed their confidence.", "974": "They made their first stand where now is the temple of Jupiter Stator, which one may translate “", "975": "He who makes to stand firm and then forming their ranks once more they drove back the Sabines a8 far as what is now called the Palace, and the Temple of Vesta.", "976":

daughters of the Sabines who had been carried off were seen rushing from all quarters, with loud shrieks and wailings, through the ranks and among the dead bodies, as though possessed by some god.", "979": "Some of them carried infant children in their arms, and others wore their hair loose and dishevelled.", "980": "All of them kept addressing the Romans and the Sabines alternately by the most

strong feeling of pity was excited by the sight of the women, and by their words, which began with arguments and upbraidings, but ended in entreaties and tears.", "983": "“", "984": "What wrong have we done to you,\" said they, “ that we should have suffered and should even now suffer such cruel treatment at your hands?", "985": "We were violently and wrongfully torn away from our friends, and

wrongers when they fight, and weep when they fall.", "986": "Ye would not come and tear us from our ravishers while we were yet maidens, but now ye would separate wives from their husbands, and

fathers-in-law, and grandfathers, and relatives one of another.", "988": "But if the war is about us, then carry us off with your sons-in-law and our children, and give us our fathers and relatives,

own houses, and that their husbands attended to their wishes and treated them with every respect.", "993": "In the conference it was accordingly determined that such women as chose to do so should continue to live with their husbands, free, as we have already related, from all work and duties except that of spinning wool (talasia);", "994": "that the Romans and the Sabines should dwell together

citizens.", "1000": "They call a grove lucus.", "1001": "The very name of tribe and tribune show that there were three tribes.", "1002": "Each tribe was divided into ten centuries, which some say were named after the women who were carried off;", "1003": "but this seems to be untrue, as many of them are named after places.", "1004": "However, many privileges were conferred upon the women, amongst which were that men should make way for them when they walked out, to say nothing disgraceful in their presence, or appear naked before them, on pain of being tried before the criminal court;",

sacred cornel-tree grew, the legend being that Romulus, to try his strength, threw a spear, with cornel­ wood shaft, from Mount Aventine, and when the spear-head sunk into the ground, though many tried, no one was able to pull it out.", "1009": "The soil, which was fertile, suited the wood, and it budded, and became the stem of a good­ sized cornel-tree.", "1010": "After the death of Romulus this was preserved and reverenced as one of the holiest objects in the city.", "1011": "A wall was built round it, and whenever any one thought that it looked inclined to droop and wither he at once

translate by Purification;", "1026": "and that particular day was originally called Febrate.", "1027": "The name of this feast in Greek signifies that of wolves, and it is thought, on this account, to be very ancient, and derived from the Arcadians who came to Italy with Evander.", "1028": "Still this is an open question, for the name may have arisen from the she-wolf, as we see that the Luperci

middle, striking with the thongs all whom they meet.", "1034": "Women in the prime of life do not avoid being struck, as they believe that it assists them in childbirth and promotes fertility.",

party had killed Amulius, they ran back in their joy to the place where the she-wolf suckled them when little, and that the feast is typical of this, and that the young nobles run, “ As, smiting all they met, that day From Alba Romulus and Remus ran.\"", "1037": "The bloody sword is placed upon their foreheads in token of the danger and slaughter of that day, and the wiping with the milk is in remembrance of their nurse.", "1038": "Caius Acilius tells us that, before the foundation of Rome, the cattle of Romulus and Remus were missing, and they, after invoking Faunus, ran out to search for them, naked, that they might not be inconvenienced by sweat;", "1039": "and that this is the reason that the Luperci ran about naked.", "1040": "As for the dog, one would say that if the sacrifice is purificatory, it is sacrificed on behalf of those who use it.", "1041": "The Greeks, in their purificatory rites, sacrifice dogs, and often make use of what is called Periskylakismos.", "1042": "But if this feast be in honour of the she-wolf, in gratitude for her suckling and preserving of Romulus, then it is very natural to sacrifice a clog, for it is an enemy of wolves;", "1043": "unless, indeed, the beast is put to death to punish it for hindering the Luperci when they ran their course.", "1044": "XXII.", "1045": "It is said also that Romulus instituted the service of the sacred fire of Vestæ, and the holy virgins who keep it up, called Vestals.", "1046": "Others attribute this to Numa, though they say that Romulus was a very religious prince, and learned in divination, for which

Ceres.", "1051": "A man who divorced his wife was to make an offering to the Chthonian gods.-", "1052": "A peculiarity of his legislation is that, while he laid down no course of procedure in case of parricide, he speaks of all murder by the name of parricide, as though the one were an abominable, but the other an impossible crime.", "1053": "And for many years it appeared that he had rightly judged, for no one attempted anything of the kind at Rome for nearly six hundred years ;", "1054": "but it is said that the first parricide was that of Lucius Hostilius, which he committed after the

Laurentum, on their way to Rome, and endeavoured to rob them.", "1058": "As the ambassadors would not submit to this, but defended them­ selves, they slew them.", "1059": "Romulus at once gave it as his opinion that the authors of this great and audacious crime ought to be punished, but Tatius hushed the matter up, and enabled them to escape.", "1060": "This is said to have been the only occasion upon which they were openly at variance, for in all other matters they acted with the greatest possible unanimity.", "1061": "The relatives, however, of the mur­ dered men, as they were hindered by Tatius from receiving any satisfaction, fell upon him when he and Romulus were offering sacrifice at Lavinium, and slew him, but respected Romulus, and praised him as a just man.", "1062": "He brought home the body of Tatius, and buried it honourably.", "1063": "It lies near what is called the Armilustrium, on Mount Aventine.", "1064": "But Romulus neglected altogether to exact any satis­ faction for the murder.", "1065": "Some writers say that the city of Lavinium, in its terror, delivered up the murderers of Tatius, but that Romulus allowed them to depart, saying that blood had been atoned for by blood.", "1066": "This speech of his gave rise to some suspicion that he was not displeased at being rid of his colleague.", "1067": "However, it caused no dis­ turbance in the state, and did not move the Sabines to revolt, but partly out of regard for Homulus, and fear of his power, and belief in his divine mission, they continued to live under his rule with cheerfulness and respect.",

because of the un­ avenged murders of Tatius and of the ambassadors.", "1077": "The guilty parties were delivered up on both sides, and duly punished, after which the plague was sensibly mitigated.", "1078": "Romulus also purified the city with lustrations, which, they say, are even now practised at the Ferentine gate.", "1079": "But before the plague ceased, the people of Camerium attacked the Romans, supposing that they would be unable to defend themselves on account of their misfortune, and overran their country.", "1080": "Nevertheless, Romulus instantly marched against them, slew six hundred of them in battle, and took their city.", "1081": "Half the survivors he transplanted to Rome, and settled twice as many Romans as the remainder at Camerium, on the Kalends of Sextilis.",

remain quiet, but ought to check the growth of Rome.", "1087": "First the Etruscans of Veil, a people possessed of wide lands and a large city, began the war by demanding the surrender to them of Fidenæ, which they claimed as belonging to them.", "1088": "This demand was not only unjust, but absurd, seeing that they had not assisted the people of Fidenæ when they were fighting and in danger, but permitted them to be destroyed, and then de­ manded their houses and lands, when they were in the possession of others.", "1089": "Receiving a haughty answer from Romulus, they divided themselves into two bodies, with one of which they attacked Fidenæ, and with the other went to meet Romulus.", "1090": "At Fidenæ they conquered the Romans, and slew two thousand;", "1091": "but they were defeated by Romulus, with a loss of eight thousand men.", "1092": "A second battle now took place at Fidenæ, in which all agree that Romulus took the most important part, showing the greatest skill and courage, and a strength and swiftness more than mortal.", "1093": "But some accounts are altogether fabulous, such as that fourteen hundred were slain, more than half of whom Romulus slew with his own hand.", "1094": "The Messenians appear to use equally inflated language about Aristomenes, when they tell us that he thrice offered sacrifice for having slain a hundred Lacedæmonians.", "1095": "After the victory, Romulus did not pursue the beaten army, but marched straight to the city of Veil.", "1096": "The citizens, after so great a disaster, made no resistance, but at their own request

fifty of their leading men as hostages.", "1097": "For his success at Veii, Romulus enjoyed another triumph, on the Ides of October, when he led in his train many captives, amongst whom was the Veientine general, an old man, who was thought to have mismanaged matters foolishly and like a boy.", "1098": "On this account to this day, when a sacrifice is made for victory, they lead an old man

but had merely their name and dignity, and were called into the Senate House more for form's sake than to express their opinions.", "1116": "When there, they listened in silence to Romulus's orders, and the only advantage which they possessed over the commons was that they knew the king's mind sooner than they.", "1117": "Worst of all was, that he of his own authority divided the land which was obtained in war amongst the soldiers, and restored the hostages to the Veientines, against the will of the Senate and without consulting it, by which he seemed purposely to insult it.", "1118": "On this account the Senate was suspected, when shortly after this he miraculously disappeared.", "1119": "His disappearance took place on the Nones of the month now called July, but then Quintilis, leaving nothing certain or agreed on about his end except the date.", "1120": "Even now things happen in the same fashion as then ;", "1121": "and we need not wonder at the uncertainty about the death of Romulus, when that of Scipio Africanus, in his own house after supper, proved so inexplicable, some saying that it arose from an evil habit of body, some that he had poisoned himself, some that his enemies had suffocated him during the night.", "1122": "And yet the corpse of Scipio lay openly exposed for all to see, and gave all who saw it some ground for their conjectures;", "1123": "whereas Romulus suddenly disappeared, and no morsel of his body or shred of his garments were ever seen again.", "1124": "Some supposed that the Senators fell upon him in the Temple of Vulcan, and, after killing, him cut his body in pieces and each of them carried off one in the folds of his robe.", "1125": "Others think that his disappearance took place neither in the Temple of Vulcan, nor yet in the presence of the Senators alone, but say that Romulus was holding an assembly without the city, near a place called the Goat's Marsh, when suddenly strange and wonderful things took place in the heavens, and marvel­ lous changes;", "1126": "for the sun's light was extinguished, and night fell, not calm and quiet, but with terrible thunder­ ings, gusts of wind, and driving spray from all quarters.", "1127": "Hereupon the people took to flight in confusion, but the nobles collected together by themselves.", "1128": "When the storm was over, and the light returned, the people returned to the place again, and searched in vain for Romulus, but were told by the nobles not to trouble themselves to look for him, but to pray to Romulus and reverence him, for he had been caught up into heaven, and now would be a propitious god for them instead of a good king.", "1129": "The people believed this story, and went their way re­ joicing, and praying to him with good hope;", "1130": "but

the king.", "1131": "XXVIII.", "1132": "Now Julius Proculus, one of the noblest patricians, and of good reputation, being one of the original colonists from Alba, and a friend and companion of Romulus, came into the Forum, and there upon his oath, and touching the most sacred things, stated before all men that as he was walking along the road Romulus appeared, meeting him, more beautiful and taller than he had ever appeared before, with bright and glittering arms.", "1133": "Astonished at the vision he had spoken thus :", "1134": "\" 0 king, for what reason or with what object have

foolish to mix earthly with heavenly things.", "1152": "We must admit, speaking with due caution, that, as Pindar has it, the bodies of all men follow over­ powering Death, but there remains a living spirit, the image of eternity, for it alone comes from heaven.", "1153": "Thence it comes, and thither it returns again, not accom­ panied by the body, but only when it is most thoroughly separated

rise up into heaven, which is contrary to nature;", "1156": "but we must believe that men's virtues and their spirits most certainly, naturally and rightly proceed from mankind to the heroes, and from them to the genii, and from thence, if they be raised above and purified from all mortal and earthly taint, even as is done in the holy mysteries, then, not by any empty vote of the senate, but in very truth and likelihood they are received among the gods, and meet with the most blessed and glorious end.", "1157": "XXIX.", "1158": "Some say that the name Quirinus, which Romulus received, means Mars;", "1159": "others that it was because his people were called Quirites.", "1160": "Others, again, say that the spear-head or spear was called by the ancients Quirts, and that the statue of Juno leaning on a spear is called Juno Quirites, and that the dart which is placed in the Regia is addressed as Mars, and that it is customary to present with a spear those who have distinguished themselves in war, and therefore that it was as a warrior, or god of war, that Romulus was called Quirinus.", "1161": "A temple dedicated to him is built on the Quirinal Hill which bears his name, and the day of his translation is called the People's Flight, and the Nonæ Caprotinæ, because they go out of the city to the Goat's Marsh on that day to sacrifice, for in Latin a goat is called Capra.", "1162": "And as they go to the sacrifice they call out many of the names of the country, as Marcus, Lucius, Caius, with loud shouts, in imitation of their panic on that occasion, and their calling to

hanging over him if unsuccessful, and so, as Plato says, he was made brave by sheer terror, and through fear of suffering death and torture was forced.", "1185": "into doing great exploits.", "1186": "Moreover, Romulus's greatest achievement was the slaying of one man, the despot of Alba, whereas Skeiron, Sinis, Prokrustes, and Korynetes were merely the accompaniments and prelude to the greater actions of Theseus, and by slaying them he freed Greece from terrible scourges, before those whom he saved even knew who he was.", "1187": "He also might have sailed peace­ fully over the sea to Athens, and had no trouble with those brigands, whereas Romulus could not be free from trouble while Amulius lived.", "1188": "And it is a great argument in favour of Theseus that he attacked those wicked men for the sake of others, having himself suffered no wrong at their hands;", "1189": "whereas the twins were unconcerned at Amulius's tyranny so long as it did not affect themselves.", "1190": "And although it may have been a great exploit to receive a wound in fighting the Sabines, and to slay Acron, and to kill many enemies in battle, yet we may compare with these, on Theseus's behalf, his battle with the Centaurs and his campaign against the Amazons.", "1191": "As for the courage which Theseus showed in the matter of the Cretan tribute, when he voluntarily sailed to Crete with the youths and maidens, whether the penalty was to be given to th?", "1192": "Minotaur to eat, or be sacrificed at the tomb of Androgens, or even to be cast into dishonoured slavery under an insolent enemy, which is the least miserable fate mentioned by any writer, what a strength of mind, what public spirit and love of fame it shows I", "1193": "In this instance it seems to me that philosophers have truly defined love as a “ service designed by the gods for the care and preservation of the young.\"", "1194": "For the love of Ariadne seems to have been specially intended by Heaven to save Theseus;", "1195": "nor need we blame her for her passion, but rather wonder that all men and women did not share it.", "1196": "If she alone felt it, then I say she deserved the love of a god, because of her zeal for all that is best and noblest.", "1197": "II.", "1198": "Both were born statesmen, yet neither behaved himself as a king should do, but, from similar motives, the one erred on the side of democracy, the other on that of despotism.", "1199": "The first duty of a king is to preserve his crown;", "1200": "and this can be effected as well by refraining from improperly extending his rights as by too great eagerness to keep them.", "1201": "For he who either gives up or overstrains his prerogative ceases to be a king or constitutional ruler, but becomes either a despot or dema­ gogue ;", "1202": "and in the one case is feared, in the other despised by his subjects.", "1203": "Still the one is the result of kindli­ ness of disposition, and the other that of selfishness and ferocity.", "1204": "III.", "1205": "If we are not to attribute their misfortunes to chance, but to peculiarities of disposition, then we cannot acquit Romulus of blame in his treatment of his brother, nor Theseus in that of his son;", "1206": "but the greatest excuse must be made for the one who acted under the greatest provocation.", "1207": "One would not have thought that Romulus would have flown into such a passion during a grave deliberation on matters of state;", "1208": "while Theseus was misled, in his treatment of his son, by love and jealousy and a woman's slander, influences which few men are able to withstand.", "1209": "And what is more, Romulus's fury resulted in actual deeds of unfortunate result;", "1210": "whereas the anger of Theseus spent itself in words and an old man's curses, and the youth seems to have owed the rest of his suffering to chance;", "1211": "so here, at any rate, one would give one'a vote for Theseus.", "1212": "IV.", "1213": "Romulus, however, has the credit of having started with the most slender resources, and yet of having suc­ ceeded.", "1214": "The twins were called slaves and the sons of a swineherd before they achieved their liberty;", "1215": "yet they freed nearly all the Latin race, and at one and the same time gained those titles which are the most glorious among men, of slayers of their enemies, preservers of their own house, kings of their own nation, and founders of a new city, not by transferring the population of old ones, as Theseus did, when he brought together many towns into one, and destroyed many cities that bore the names of kings and heroes of old.", "1216": "Romulus did this afterwards, when he compelled his conquered enemies to cast down and obliterate their own dwellings, and become fellow- citizens with their conquerors;", "1217": "yet at first he did not change the site of his city nor increase it, but starting with nothing to help him, he obtained for himself terri­ tory, patrimony, sovereignty, family, marriage, and rela­ tives, and he killed no one, but conferred great benefits on those who, instead of homeless vagrants, wished to become a people and inhabitants of a city.", "1218": "He slew no brigands or robbers, but he conquered kingdoms, took cities, and triumphed over kings and princes.", "1219": "V.", "1220": "As for the misfortune of Remus, it seems doubtful whether Romulus slew him with his own hand, as most writers attribute the act to others.", "1221": "He certainly rescued his mother from death, and gloriously replaced his grand­ father, whom he found in an ignoble and servile position, on the throne of Æneas.", "1222": "He did him many kindnesses, and never harmed him even against his will.", "1223": "But I can scarcely imagine that Theseus's forgetfulness and careless­ ness in hoisting the black sail can, by any excuses or before the mildest judges, come much short of parricide :", "1224": "indeed, an Athenian, seeing how hard it is even for his admirers to exculpate him, has made up a story that Ægeus, when the ship was approaching, hurriedly ran up to the acropolis to view it, and fell down, as though he were unattended, or would hurry along the road to the shore without servants.", "1225": "VI.", "1226": "The crimes of Theseus in carrying off women are without any decent excuse;", "1227": "first, because he did it so often, for he carried off Ariadne and Antiope and Anaxo of Trœzen, and above ail when he was an old man he carried off Helen, when she was not yet grown up, and a mere child, though he was past the age for even legitimate marriage.", "1228": "Besides, there was no reason for it, for these Troezenian, Laconian, and Amazonian maidens, besides their not being betrothed to him, were no worthier mothers for his children than the Athenian daughters of Erechtheus and Kekrops would have been, so we must suspect that these acts were done out of mere riotous wantonness.", "1229": "Now Romulus, though he carried off nearly eight hundred women, yet kept only one, Hersilia, for himself, and distributed the others among the unmarried citizens ;", "1230": "and afterwards, by the respect, love, and justice with which he treated them, proved that his wrongful violence was the most admirable and politic contrivance for effecting the union of the two nations.", "1231": "By means of it he welded them into one, and made it the starting-point of harmony at home and strength abroad.", "1232": "The dignity, love, and permanence with which he invested the in­ stitution of marriage is proved by the fact that during two hundred and thirty years no man separated from his wife or woman from her husband;", "1233": "but, just as in Greece, very exact persons can mention the first instance of parricide or matricide, so all the Romans know that Spurius Carvilius was the first who put away his wife, upon a charge of barrenness.", "1234": "Events also testify to the superior wisdom of Romulus, for, in consequence of that intermarriage, the two kings and the two races shared the empire, whereas, from the marriage of Theseus, the Athen­ ians obtained no alliance or intercourse with any nation, but only hatreds and wars and deaths of citizens and at last the destruction of Aphidnae, and they themselves escaped from the fate which Paris brought upon Troy, only by the mercy of their enemies and their own entreaties and supplications.", "1235": "The mother of Theseus, not nearly but quite, suffered the fate of Hekuba, who was abandoned and given up by her son, unless the story of her captivity is false, as I hope it is, together with much of the rest.", "1236": "Also the religious part of their histories makes a great distinction between them.", "1237": "For Romulus's success was due to the great favour of Heaven, whereas the oracle given to Ægeus, to refrain from all women in foreign parts, seems to argue that the birth of Theseus took place contrary to the will of the gods.", "1238": "I. WITH regard to Lykurgus the lawgiver there is nothing whatever that is undisputed ;", "1239": "as his birth, his travels, his death, and, besides all this, his legislation, have all been related in various ways;", "1240": "ant also the dates of his birth do not in any way accord.", "1241": "Some say that he was contemporary with Iphitus, and with him settled the conditions of the Olympic truce;", "1242": "and among these is Aristotle the philoso­ pher, who adduces as a proof of it the quoit which is at Olympia, on which the name of Lykurgus is still preserved.", "1243": "Others, among them Eratosthenes and Apollodorus, by computing the reigns of the kings of Sparta,* prove that he must have lived many years before the first Olympiad.", "1244": "Timseus conjectures that there were two men of the name of Lykurgus in Sparta at different times, and that the deeds of both are attributed to one of them, on account of his celebrity.", "1245": "The elder, he thinks, must have lived not far off the time of Homer;", "1246": "indeed some say that he came intc the presence of Homer.", "1247": "Xenophon gives an idea of his antiquity when he speaks of him as living in the time of the Herakleidæ.", "1248": "By descent of course the last kings of Sparta are Herakleidæ, but he appears to mean by Herakleidæ the earliest of all, who were next to Herakles himself.", "1249": "However, in spite of these discrepancies, we will endeavour, by following the least inconsistent accounts and the best known authorities, to write the history of his life.", "1250": "Simonides the poet tells us that the father of Lykurgus was not Eunomus, but Prytanis.", "1251": "But most writers do not deduce his genealogy thus, but say that Soüs was the son of Prokles, and grandson of Aristodemus, and that Soüs begat Euripus;", "1252": "Euripus, Prytanis, and Prytanis, Eunomus.", "1253": "Eunomus had two sons, Polydektes by his first wife, and Lykurgus by his second wife Dionassa, which makes him, according to Dieutychides, sixth in descent from Prokles, and eleventh from Herakles.", "1254": "II.", "1255": "The most remarkable of his ancestors was Soüs, in whose reign the Spartans enslaved the Helots, and annexed a large portion of Arcadia.", "1256": "It is said that Soils once was besieged by the Kleitorians, in a fort where there was no water, and was compelled to conclude a treaty to restore the territory in dispute, if he and his men were permitted to drink at the nearest spring.", "1257": "After this had been agreed upon, he called his men together, and offered his kingdom to any one who could refrain from drinking.", "1258": "But as no one could do this, but all drank, last of all he himself came down to the spring, and in the presence of the enemy merely sprinkled his face with the water, and marched off, refusing to restore the disputed territory, on the ground that all did not drink.", "1259": "But though he gained great fame by this, yet it was not he but his son Eurypon who gave the name of Eurypontidæ to the family, because Eurypon was the first to relax the despotic traditions of his family and render his government more popular with the people.", "1260": "But as a consequence of this the people were encouraged to demand more freedom, and great confusion and lawlessness prevailed in Sparta for a long time, because some of the kings opposed the people and so became odious, while others were found to yield to them, either to preserve their popularity, or from sheer weakness of character.", "1261": "It was during this period of disorder that the father of Lykurgus lost his life.", "1262": "He was endeavouring to part two men who were quarrelling, and was killed by a blow from a cook's chopper, leaving the kingdom to his elder son Polydektes.", "1263": "III.", "1264": "He also died after a short time, and, as all thought, Lykurgus ought to have been the next king.", "1265": "And he did indeed reign until his brother's wife was found to be pregnant;", "1266": "but as soon as he heard this, he surrendered the crown to the child, if it should be a boy, and merely administered the kingdom as guardian for the child.", "1267": "The Lacedæmonian name for the guardian of a royal orphan is prodiMus.", "1268": "Now the queen made a secret proposal to him, that she should destroy her infant and that they should live together as king and queen.", "1269": "Though disgusted at her wickedness, he did not reject the proposal, but pretended to approve of it.", "1270": "He said that she must not risk her life and injure her health by procuring abortion, but that he would undertake to do away with the child.", "1271": "Thus he deluded her until her confinement, at which time he sent officials and guards into her chamber with orders to hand the child over to the women if it was a girl, and to bring it to him, whatever he might be doing, if it was a boy.", "1272": "He happened to be dining with the archons when a male child was born, and the servants brought it to him.", "1273": "He is said to have taken the child and said to those present, “A king is born to you, 0 Spartans,\" and to have laid him down in the royal seat and named him Charilaus, because all men were full of joy admiring his spirit and justice.", "1274": "He was king for eight months in all;", "1275": "and was much looked up to by the citizens, who rendered a willing obedience to him, rather because of his eminent virtues than because he was regent with royal powers.", "1276": "There was, nevertheless, a faction which grudged him his elevation, and tried to oppose him, as he was a young man.", "1277": "They consisted chiefly of the relatives and friends of the queen-mother, who considered that she had been insult­ ingly treated, and her brother Leonidas once went so far in his abusive language as to hint to Lykurgus that he knew that he meant to bo king, throwing the suspicion upon Lykurgus, if anything should happen to the child, that he would be supposed to have managed it.", "1278": "This sort of language was used by the queen-mother also, and he, grieved and alarmed, decided to avoid all suspicion by leaving the country and travelling until his nephew should be grown up and have an heir born to succeed him.", "1279": "IV.", "1280": "With this intention he set sail, and first came to Crete, where he studied the constitution and mixed with the leading statesmen.", "1281": "Some part of their laws he approved and made himself master of, with the intention of adopting them on his return home, while with others he was dissatisfied.", "1282": "One of the men who had a reputation there for learning and state-craft he made his friend, and induced him to go to Sparta.", "1283": "This was Thales, who was thought to be merely a lyric poet, and who used this art to conceal his graver acquirements, being in reality deeply versed in legislation.", "1284": "His poems were exhortations to unity and concord in verse, breathing a spirit of calm and order, which insensibly civilised their hearers and by urging them to the pursuit of honourable objects led them to lay aside the feelings of party strife so prevalent in Sparta;", "1285": "so that he may be said in some degree to have educated the people and prepared them to receive the reforms of Lykurgus.", "1286": "From Crete Lykurgus sailed to Asia Minor, wishing, it is said, to contrast the thrifty and austere mode of life of the Cretans with the extravagance and luxury of the lanians, as a physician compares healthy and diseased bodies, and to note the points of difference in the two states.", "1287": "There, it seems, he first met with the poems of Homer, which were preserved by the descendants of Kreophylus, and observing that they were no less useful for politics and education than for relaxation and pleasure, he eagerly copied and compiled them, with the intention of bringing them home with him.", "1288": "There was already some dim idea of the existence of these poems among the Greeks, but few possessed any portions of them, as they were scattered in fragments, but Lykurgus first made them known.", "1289": "The Egyptians suppose that Lykurgus visited them also, and that he especially admired their institution of a separate caste of warriors.", "1290": "This he transferred to Sparta, and, by excluding working men and the lower classes from the government, made the city a city indeed, pure from all admixture.", "1291": "Some Greek writers corroborate the Egyptians in this, but as to Lykurgus having visited Libya and Iberia, or his journey to India and meeting with the Gymnosophists, or naked philoso­ phers, there, no one that we know of tells this except the Sp irtan Aristokrates, the son of Hipparchus.V.", "1292": "During Lykurgus's absence the Lacedaemonians re­ gretted him and sent many embassies to ask him to return, telling him that their kings had indeed the royal name and state, but nothing else to distinguish them from the common people, and that he alone had the spirit of a ruler and the power to influence men's minds.", "1293": "Even the kings desired his presence, as they hoped that he would assist in establishing their authority and would render the masses less insolent.", "1294": "Returning to a people in this condition, he at once began alterations and reforms on a sweeping scale, considering that it was useless and unprofitable to do such work by halves, but that, as in the case of a diseased body, the original cause of the disorder must be burned out or purged away, and the patient begin an entirely new life.", "1295": "After reflecting on this, he made a journey to Delphi.", "1296": "Here he sacrificed to the god, and, on consulting the oracle, received that celebrated answer in which the Pythia speaks of him as beloved by the gods, and a god rather than a man, and when he asked for a good system of laws.", "1297": "answered that the god gives him what will prove by far the best of all constitutions.", "1298": "Elated by this he collected the leading men and begged them to help him, first by talking privately to his own friends, and thus little by little obtaining a hold over more men and banding them together for the work.", "1299": "When the time was ripe for the attempt, he bade thirty of the nobles go into the market-place early in the morning completely armed, in order to overawe the opposition.", "1300": "The names of twenty of the most distinguished of these men have been preserved by Hermippus, but the man who took the greatest part in all Lykurgus's works, and who helped him in establishing his laws, was Arthmia­ des.", "1301": "At first King Charilaus was terrified at the confusion, imagining that a revolt had broken out against himself, and fled for refuge to the temple of Minerva of the Brazen House;", "1302": "but, afterward reassured and having received solemn pledges for his safety, returned and took part in their proceedings.", "1303": "He was of a gentle nature, as is proved by the words of his colleague, King Archelaus, who, when some were praising the youth, said, \" How can Charilaus be a good man, if he is not harsh even to wicked men ?", "1304": "\"Of Lykurgus's many reforms, the first and most impor­ tant was the establishment of the Council of Elders, which Plato says by its admixture cooled the high fever of royalty, and, having an equal vote with the kings on vital points, gave caution and sobriety to their deliberations.", "1305": "For the state, which had hitherto been wildly oscillating between despotism on the one hand and democracy on the other, now, by the establishment of the Council of the Elders, found a firm footing between these extremes, and was able to preserve a most equable balance, as the eight-and-twenty elders would lend the kings their support in the suppres­ sion of democracy, but would use the people to suppress any tendency to despotism.", "1306": "Twenty-eight is the number of Elders mentioned by Aristotle, because of the thirty leading men who took the part of Lykurgus two deserted their post through fear.", "1307": "But Sphairus says that those who shared his opinions were twenty-eight originally.", "1308": "A reason may be found in twenty-eight being a mystic number, formed by seven multiplied by four, and being the first perfect number after six, for like that, it is equal to all its parts..", "1309": "But I think that he probably made this number of elders, in order that with the two kings the council might consist of thirty members in all.", "1310": "VI.", "1311": "Lykurgus was so much interested in this council as to obtain from Delphi an oracle about it, called the rheira, which runs as follows:", "1312": "\" After you have built a temple to Zeus of Greece and Athene of Greece, and have divided the people into tribes and obes, you shall found a council of thirty, including the chiefs, and shall from season to season apellazein the people between Babyka and Knakion, and there propound measures and divide upon them, and the people shall have the casting vote and final decision.", "1313": "In these words tribes and obes are divisions into which the people were to be divided;", "1314": "the chiefs mean the kings;", "1315": "apellazein means to call an assembly, in allusion to Apollo, to whom the whole scheme of the con­ stitution is referred.", "1316": "Babyka and Knakion they now call Oinous;", "1317": "but Aristotle says that Knakion is a river and Babyka a bridge.", "1318": "Between these they held their assemblies, without any roof or building of any kind;", "1319": "for Lykurgus did not consider that deliberations were assisted by archi­ tecture, but rather hindered, as men's heads were thereby filled with vain unprofitable fancies, when they assemble for debate in places where they can see statues and paint­ ings, or the proscenium of a theatre, or the richly orna­ mented roof of a council chamber.", "1320": "When the people were assembled, he permitted no one to express an opinion;", "1321": "but the people was empowered to decide upon motions brought forward by the kings and elders.", "1322": "But in later times, as the people made additions and omissions, and so altered the sense of the motions before them, the kings, Polydorus and Theopompus, added these words to the rhetra, “ and if the people shall decide crookedly, the chiefs and elders shall set it right.\"", "1323": "That is, they made the people no longer supreme, but practically excluded them from any voice in public affairs, on the ground that they judged wrongly.", "1324": "However these kings persuaded the city that this also was ordained by the god.", "1325": "This is mentioned by Tyrtæus in the following verses:", "1326": "“ They heard the god, and brought from Delphi home, Apollo's oracle, which thus did say :", "1327": "That over all within fair Sparta's realm", "1328": "The royal chiefs in council should bear sway, The elders next to them, the people last;", "1329": "If they the holy rhetra would obey.\"", "1330": "VII.", "1331": "Though Lykurgus had thus mixed the several powers of the state, yet his successors, seeing that the powers of the oligarchy were unimpaired, and that it was, as Plato calls it, full of life and vigour, placed as a curb to it the power of the Ephors.", "1332": "The first Ephors, of whom Elatus was one, were elected about a hundred and thirty years after Lykurgus, in the reign of Theopompus.", "1333": "This king is said to have been blamed by his wife because he would transmit to his children a less valuable crown than he had received, to which he answered:", "1334": "\" Nay, more valuable, because more lasting.\"", "1335": "In truth, by losing the odium of absolute power, the King of Sparta escaped all danger of being dethroned, as those of Argos and Messene were by their subjects, because they would abate nothing of their despotic power.", "1336": "The wisdom of Lykurgus became clearly manifest to those who witnessed the revolutions and miseries of the Argives and Messenians, who were neighbouring states and of the same race as the Spartans, who, originally starting on equal terms with them, and indeed seeming in the allotment of their territories to have some advantage, yet did not long live happily, but the insolent pride of the kings and the unruly temper of the people together resulted in a revolution, which clearly proved that the checked and balanced constitution estab­ lished among the Spartans was a divine blessing for them.", "1337": "But of this more hereafter.", "1338": "VIII.", "1339": "The second and the boldest of Lykurgus's reforms was the redistribution of the land.", "1340": "Great inequalities existed, many poor and needy people had become a burden to the state, while wealth had got into a very few hands.", "1341": "Lykurgus abolished all the mass of pride, envy, crime, and luxury which flowed from those old and more terrible evils of riches and poverty, by inducing all land-owners to offer their estates for redistribution, and prevailing upon them to live on equal terms one with another, and with equal incomes, striving only to surpass each other in courage and virtue, there being henceforth no social inequalities among them except such as praise or blame can create.", "1342": "Putting his proposals immediately into practice, he divided the outlying lands of the state among the Perioeki, in thirty thousand lots, and that immediately adjoining the metropolis among the native Spartans, in nine thousand lots, for to that number they then amounted.", "1343": "Some say that Lykurgus made six thousand lots, and that Polydorus added three thousand afterwards;", "1344": "others that he added half the nine thousand, and that only half was allotted by Lykurgus.", "1345": "Each man'a lot was of such a size as to supply a man with seventy medimni of barley, and his wife with twelve, and oil and wine in proportion ;", "1346": "for thus much he thought ought to suffice them, as the food was enough to maintain them in health, and they wanted nothing more.", "1347": "It is said that, some years afterwards, as he was returning from a journey through the country at harvest-time, when he saw the sheaves of corn lying in equal parallel rows, he smiled, and said to his companions that all Laconic seemed as if it had just been divided among so many brothers.", "1348": "IX.", "1349": "He desired to distribute furniture also, in order completely to do away with inequality;", "1350": "but, seeing that actually to take away these things would be a most un­ popular measure, he managed by a different method to put an end to all ostentation in these matters.", "1351": "First of all he abolished the use of gold and silver money, and made iron money alone legal;", "1352": "and this he made of great size and weight, and small value, so that the equivalent for ten minæ required a great room for its stowage, and a yoke of oxen to draw it.", "1353": "As soon as this was established, many sorts of crime became unknown in Lacedæmon.", "1354": "For who would steal or take as a bribe or deny that he possessed or take by force a mass of iron which he could not conceal, which no one envied him for possessing, which he could not even break up and so make use of;", "1355": "for the iron when hot was, it is said, quenched in vinegar, so as to make it useless, by rendering it brittle and hard to work ?", "1356": "After this, he ordered a general expulsion of the workers in useless trades.", "1357": "Indeed, without this, most of them must have left the country when the ordinary currency came to an end, as they would not be able to sell their wares:", "1358": "for the iron money was not current among other Greeks, and had no value, being regarded as ridiculous;", "1359": "so that it could not be used for the purchase of foreign trumpery, and no cargo was shipped for a Laconian port, and there came into the country no sophists, no vagabond soothsayers, no panders, no goldsmiths or workers in silver plate, because there was no money to pay them with.", "1360": "Luxury, thus cut off from all encouragement, gradually became extinct;", "1361": "and the rich were on the same footing with other people, as they could find no means of display, but were forced to keep their money idle at home.", "1362": "For this reason such things as are useful and necessary, like couches and tables and chairs, were made there better than any­ where else, and the Laconian cup, we are told by Kritias, was especially valued for its use in the field.", "1363": "Its colour prevented the drinker being disgusted by the look of the dirty water which it is sometimes necessary to drink, and it was contrived that the dirt was deposited inside the cup and stuck to the bottom, so as to make the drink cleaner than it would otherwise have been.", "1364": "These things were due to the lawgiver;", "1365": "for the workmen, who were not allowed to make useless things, devoted their best workmanship to useful ones.X.", "1366": "Wishing still further to put down luxury and take away the desire for riches, he introduced the third and the most admirable of his reforms, that of the common dining-table.", "1367": "At this the people were to meet and dine together upon a fixed allowance of food, and not to live in their own homes, lolling on expensive couches at rich tables, fattened like beasts in private by the hands of servants and cooks, and undermining their health by in­ dulgence to excess in every bodily desire, long sleep, warm baths, and much repose, so that they required a sort of daily nursing like sick people.", "1368": "This was a great advantage, but it was a greater to render wealth valueless, and, as Theophrastus says, to neutralise it by their common dining- table and the simplicity of their habits.", "1369": "Wealth could not be used, nor enjoyed, nor indeed displayed at all in costly apparatus, when the poor man dined at the same table with the rich;", "1370": "so that the well-known saying, that “ wealth is blind and lies like a senseless log,\" was seen to be true in Sparta alone of all cities under heaven.", "1371": "Men were not even allowed to dine previously at home, and then come to the public table, but the others, watching him who did not eat or drink with them, would reproach him as a sensual person, too effeminate to eat the rough common fare.", "1372": "For these reasons it is said that the rich were bitterly opposed to Lykurgus on this question, and that they caused a tumult and attacked him with shouts of rage.", "1373": "Pelted with stones from many hands, he was forced to run out of the market-place, and take sanctuary in a

Alkander home with him.", "1379": "He did him no harm and used no reproachful words, but sent away all his servants and bade him serve him.", "1380": "Alkander, being of a generous nature, did as he was ordered, and, dwelling as he did with Lykurgus, watching his kind unruffled temper, his severe simplicity of life, and his unwearied labours, he became enthusiastic in his admiration of him, and used to tell his friends and acquaintances that Lykurgus, far from being harsh or overbearing, was the kindest and gentlest of men.", "1381": "Thus was Alkander tamed and subdued, so that he who had been a wicked and insolent youth was made into a modest and prudent man.", "1382": "As a memorial of his misfortune, Lykurgus built the temple of Athene, whom he called Optilitis, for the Dorians in

looked up to them more than was fitting, calling them Mistresses;", "1432": "but he made what regulations were necessary for them also.", "1433": "He strengthened the bodies of the girls by exercise in running, wrestling, and hurling quoits or javelins, in order that their children might spring from a healthy source and so grow up strong, and that they themselves might have strength, so as easily

full vigour and their passions unblunted by unchecked intercourse with each other, so that their passion and love for each other'is society remained unextinguished.", "1460": "Having thus honoured and dignified the married state, he destroyed the vain womanish passion of jealousy, for, while carefully avoiding any disorder or licentiousness, he nevertheless permitted men to associate worthy persona with them in the task of begetting children, and taught them to ridicule those who insisted on the exclusive possession of their wives, and who were ready to fight and kill people to maintain their right.", "1461": "It was permitted to an elderly husband, with a young wife, to associate with himself any well-born youth whom he might fancy, and to adopt the offspring as his own.", "1462": "And

take it, and with great trouble threw his adversary in the wrestling-match.", "1594": "Some one then asked him, \" Laconian, what have you gained.", "1595": "by your victory?\"", "1596": "The man, smiling with delight,, answered, \" I shall fight in front of the king in the wars.\"", "1597": "After they had routed their enemy and gained the victory, they were wont to pursue so far as to render their success secure, and then to draw off, as they did not think:", "1598": "it manly or befitting a Greek to cut down and butcher those who could fight no longer.", "1599": "This was not merely magnanimous, but very useful to them, for their enemies, knowing that they slew those who resisted, but spared those who gave way, often judged it better for themselves to flee than to stand their ground.", "1600": "XXII.", "1601": "The sophist Hippias states that Lykurgus himself was a great warrior and took part in many cam­ paigns;", "1602": "and Philostephanus even attributed to Lykur­ gus the division of the cavalry into the troops called oulamo8.", "1603": "This, according to him, consisted of a troop of fifty horsemen drawn up in a square.", "1604": "Demetrius Phale­ reus, on the other hand, says that he had no experience in war, and arranged the whole constitution in time of peace.", "1605": "Moreover the institution of the Olympic truce seems to be the idea of a man of gentle and peaceful temperament, some however say, according to Hermippus, that Lykurgus had at first no communication with Iphitus, but happened to be present in the crowd;", "1606": "that he then heard a voice as it were of a man behind him blaming him and wondering why he did not encourage his fellow-citizens to take part in the festival.", "1607": "As, when he turned round, there was no one who could have said so, he concluded that it was a divine warning, and, at once joining Iphitus and assisting him in regulating the festival, he rendered it both more splendid and more lasting.", "1608": "XXIII.", "1609": "The training of the Spartan youth continued till their manhood.", "1610": "No one was permitted to live according to his own pleasure, but they lived in the city as if in a camp, with a fixed diet and fixed public duties, thinking themselves to belong, not to themselves, but to their country.", "1611": "Those who had nothing else to do, either looked after the young, and taught them what was useful, or themselves learned such things from the old.", "1612": "For ample leisure was one of the blessings with which Lykurgus provided his countrymen, seeing that they were utterly forbidden to practise any mechanical art, while money-making and business were unnecessary, because wealth was disregarded and despised.", "1613": "The Helots tilled the ground, and produced the regular crops for them.", "1614": "Indeed, a Spartan who was at Athens while the courts were sitting, and who learned that some man had been fined for idleness, and was leaving the court in sorrow accompanied by his grieving friends, asked to be shown the man who had been punished for gentlemanly behaviour.", "1615": "So slavish did they deem it to labour at trade and business.", "1616": "In Sparta, as was natural, lawsuits became extinct, together with money, as the people had neither excess nor deficiency, but all were equally well off, and enjoyed abundant leisure by reason of their simple habits.", "1617": "All their time was spent in dances, feasting, hunting or gymnastic exercises and conversation, when they were not engaged in war.", "1618": "XXIV.", "1619": "Those who were less than thirty years old never came into the market-place at all, but made their necessary purchases through their friends and relations.", "1620": "And it was thought discreditable to the older men to be seen there much, and not to spend the greater part of the day in the gymnasium and the leaches or places for conversation.", "1621": "Inthese they used to collect together and pass their leisure time, making no allusions to business or the affairs of commerce, but their chief study being to praise what was honourable, and contemn what was base in a light satiric vein of talk which was instructive and edifying to the hearers.", "1622": "Nor was Lykurgus himself a man of unmixed austerity :", "1623": "indeed, he is said by Sosibius to have set up the little statue of the god of laughter, and intro­ duced merriment at proper times to enliven their wine­ parties and other gatherings.", "1624": "In a word, he trained his countrymen neither to wish nor to understand how to live as private men, but, like bees, to be parts of the common­ wealth, and gather round their chief, forgetting themselves in their enthusiastic patriotism, and utterly devoted to their country.", "1625": "This temper of theirs we can discern in many of their sayings.", "1626": "Paidaretus, when not elected into the three hundred, went away rejoicing that the city possessed three hundred better men than himself.", "1627": "Polykratidas, when he went with some others on a mission to the generals of the great king, was asked by them, if he and his party came as private persons or as ambassadors

Brasidas, Argileonis, she asked them whether Brasidas died bravely and worthily of Sparta.", "1631": "When they praised him to excess, and said that he had not left his like behind, she said, \" Say not so, strangers ;", "1632": "Brasidas was a noble and a gallant man, but Sparta has many better than he.", "1633": "\"XXV.", "1634": "Lykurgus himself composed his senate, as we have seen, of the persons who took part in his plot;", "1635": "and in future be ordained that vacancies should be filled up by those men, upwards of sixty years of age, who were adjudged to be the most worthy.", "1636": "This seemed the greatest prize in the world, and also the most difficult to obtain ;", "1637": "for it was not merely that a man should be adjudged swiftest of the swift, or strongest of the strong, but he had to be chosen as the best and wisest of all good and wise men, and, as a prize, was to obtain power to regulate the morals of the state, as he was intrusted with powers of life and death, and disfranchise­ ment, and with all the highest penalties.", "1638": "The elections took place as follows:", "1639": "The citizens were all assembled, and certain men were placed in a building close by, where they could neither see nor be seen but merely hear the shouts of the general assembly.", "1640": "They decided these, as indeed they did other contests, by shouts of approval, not of all at once, but lots were cast, and each candidate in the order denoted by his lot came forward and silently walked through the assembly.", "1641": "The men locked up in the building had writing materials, and noted down who was cheered most loudly, not knowing who each man was, beyond that he was first, second, third, and so on, of the candidates.", "1642": "They then told the number of the man for whom there had been most voices, and he crowned himself with a garland and offered sacrifice to the gods, followed by many of the young men, who congratulated him, and by many women, who sang songs praising his virtues and his felicity.", "1643": "As he went from one temple to another, each of his relatives used to offer him food, saying, \"The state honours you with this banquet.\"", "1644": "But he would pass by them all, and go to his usual mess-table.", "1645": "Here nothing uncommon took place, except that he was given a second ration, which he took away with him;", "1646": "and after dinner, the women of his own family being at the doors of the mess-room, he would call for the one whom he wished to honour, and give her his portion, saying that he had received it as a prize, and gave it to her as such.", "1647": "This caused her to be greatly envied by the other women.", "1648": "XXVI.", "1649": "—Moreover, he made excellent regulations about funerals.", "1650": "In the first place, he abolished all silly superstition, and raised no objections to burial in the city, and to placing tombs near the temples, in order to accustom the young to such sights from their infancy, so that they might not feel any horror of death, or have any notion about being defiled by touching a dead body, or walking among tombs.", "1651": "Next, he permitted nothing to be buried with the dead, but they placed the body in the grave, wrapped in a purple cloth and covered with olive- leaves.", "1652": "It was not permitted to inscribe the name of the deceased upon his tomb, except in the case of men who had fallen in war, or of women who had been priestesses.", "1653": "A short time was fixed for mourning, eleven days ;", "1654": "on the twelfth they were to sacrifice to Demeter (Ceres) and cease from their grief.", "1655": "For, in Sparta, nothing was left without regulation, but, with all the necessary acts of life, Lykurgus mingled some ceremony which might enkindle virtue or discourage vice;", "1656": "indeed he filled his city with examples of this kind, by which the citizens were in­ sensibly moulded and impelled towards honourable pur­ suits.", "1657": "For this reason he would not allow citizens to leave the country at pleasure, and to wandor in foreign lands, where they would contract outlandish habits, and learn to imitate the untrained lives and in-regulated institutions to be found abroad.", "1658": "Also, he banished from Lacedæmon all strangers who were there for no useful purpose;", "1659": "not, as Thucydides says, because he feared they might imitate his constitution, and learn something serviceable for the improvement of their own countries, but rather for fear that they might teach the people some mischief.", "1660": "Strangers introduce strange ideas;", "1661": "and these lead to discussions of an unsuitable character, and political views which would jar with the established constitution, like a discord in music.", "1662": "Wherefore he thought that it was more important to keep out evil habits than even to keep the plague from coming into the city.", "1663": "XXVII.", "1664": "In all these acts of Lykurgus, we cannot find any traces of the injustice and unfairness which some complain of in his laws, which they say are excellent to produce courage, but less so for justice.", "1665": "And the in­ stitution called Krypteia, if indeed it is one of the laws of Lykurgus, as Aristotle tells us, would agree with the idea which Plato conceived about him and his system.", "1666": "The Krypteia was this:", "1667": "the leaders of the young men used at intervals to send the most discreet of them into different parts of the country, equipped with daggers and necessary food;", "1668": "in the daytime these men used to conceal themselves in unfrequented spots, and take their rest, but at night they would come down into the roads and murder any Helots they found.", "1669": "And often they would range about the fields and make away with the strongest and bravest Helots they could find.", "1670": "Also, as Thucydides mentions in his History of the Peloponnesian War, those Helots who were especially honoured by the Spartans for their valour were crowned as free men, and taken to the temples with rejoicings ;", "1671": "but in a short time they all disappeared, to the number of more than two thousand, and in such a way that no man, either then or afterwards, could tell how they perished.", "1672": "Aristotle says that the Ephors, when they first take office, declare war against the Helots, in order that it may be lawful to destroy them.", "1673": "And much other harsh treatment used to be inflicted upon them;", "1674": "and they were compelled to drink much unmixed wine, and then were brought into the public dining-halls, to show the young what drunkenness is.", "1675": "They were also forced to sing low songs, and to dance low dances, and not to meddle with those of a higher character.", "1676": "It is said that when the Thebans made their celebrated campaign in Lacedaemon, they ordered the Helots whom they captured to sing them the songs of Terpander, and Alkman, and Spend on the Laconian;", "1677": "but they begged to be excused, for, they said, “ the masters do not like it.\"", "1678": "So it seems to have been well said that in Lacedæmon, the free man was more free, and the slave more a slave than anywhere else.", "1679": "This harsh treatment, I imagine, began in later times, especially after the great earthquake, when they relate that the Helots joined the Messenians, ravaged the country, and almost conquered it.", "1680": "I cannot impute this wicked act of the Krypteia to Lykurgus, when I consider the gentleness and justice of his general behaviour, which also we know was inspired by Heaven.", "1681": "XXVIII.", "1682": "When the leading men of the city were thoroughly imbued with the spirit of his institutions, and the newly constituted state was able to walk by itself without leading-strings, and bear its own weight alone, then, as Plato says of God, that he was pleased with the world that he had created, when it first began to live and move, so was it with Lykurgus.", "1683": "He admired the spectacle of his laWS in operation, and, as far as was possible by human prudence, he desired to leave it eternal and unchangeable.", "1684": "He assembled all the citizens, and told them that the city was now fairly well provided with materials for happiness and virtue, but that he would not bestow upon them the most valuable gift of all, until he had taken counsel with Heaven.", "1685": "It was therefore their duty to abide by the already established laws, and to change and alter nothing till he returned from Delphi;", "1686": "on his return, he would do whatever the god commanded.", "1687": "They all assented, and bade him depart, and he, after making first the kings and elders, and then the rest of the citizens, swear that they would keep their existing constitution till Lykurgus came back, set out for Delphi.", "1688": "Upon reaching the temple he sacrificed to the god, and inquired whether his laws were good, and sufficient for the prosperity and happiness of his country.", "1689": "Receiving answer from the oracle that his laws were indeed good, and that the city would become famous if it kept the constitution of Lykurgus, he wrote down this prophecy and sent it to Sparta.", "1690": "But he himself, after offering a second sacrifice to the god, and having embraced his friends and his son, determined not to release his countrymen from their oath, but to put an end to his own life, being at an age when, though life was still pleasant, it seemed time to go to his rest, after having excellently arranged all his people's affairs.", "1691": "He departed by starvation, as he thought that a true statesman ought to make even his death of service to the state, and not like that of a private person, the useless end of an idle life.", "1692": "His death came in the fulness of time, after he had done an excellent work, and it was left as the guardian of all the good that he had done, because the citizens had sworn that they would abide by his constitution until he returned to them.", "1693": "Nor was he deceived in his expect­ ations;", "1694": "for the state was by far the most celebrated in Greece, for good government at home and renown abroad, during a period of five hundred years, under his con­ stitution, which was kept unaltered by fourteen kings, counting from himself down to Agis the son of Archidamus.", "1695": "For the institution of Ephors was not a relaxation, but a strengthening of the original scheme, and while it seemed popular it really confirmed the power of the oligarchy.", "1696": "XXIX.", "1697": "But in the reign of Agis money found its way into Sparta, and, after money, selfishness and greed for gain came in, on account of Lysander, who, though him­ self incorruptible, yet filled his country with luxury and love of gold, as he brought back gold and silver from the wars, and disregarded the laws of Lykurgus.", "1698": "Before this, when those laws were in force, Sparta was like a wise and practised warrior more than a city, or rather, she with her simple staff and cloak, like Herakles with his lion-skin and club, ruled over a willing Greece, deposed bad kings or factions, decided wars, and crushed revolutions;", "1699": "and that, too, often without moving a single soldier, but merely by Bending a commissioner, who was at once obeyed, even as bees collect and rank themselves in order when their queen appears.", "1700": "Sparta then had so much order and justice as to be able to supply her neighbours;", "1701": "and J cannot understand those who say that the Lacedæmonians “ knew how to obey, but not how to rule;", "1702": "\" nor that story of some one who said to king Theopompus that the safety of Sparta lay in her kings knowing how to rule.", "1703": "“ Rather,\" he answered, “ in her citizens knowing how to obey.", "1704": "\"They would not brook an incapable commander:", "1705": "their very obedience is a lesson in the art of command;", "1706": "for a good leader makes good followers, and just as it is the object of the horse-breaker to turn out a gentle and tract­ able horse, so it is the object of rulers to implant in men the spirit of obedience.", "1707": "But the Lacedaemonians produced a desire in other states to be ruled by them and to obey them;", "1708": "for they used to send embassies and ask not for ships or money or troops, but for one Spartan for a leader ;", "1709": "and when they obtained him, they respected him and feared him, as, for instance, the Sicilians had Gylippus as a general, the people of Chalkidike had Brasidas, while Lysander and Kallikratidas and Agesilaus were made use of by all the Greeks in Asia Minor.", "1710": "These men were called Regulators and Pacificators in each several state, and the whole city of Sparta was regarded as a school and example of orderly public life and of settled political insti­ tutions.", "1711": "This was alluded to by Stratonikus when he said in jest that the Athenians ought to conduct mysteries and shows, the Eleans to be stewards at the games, and the Lacedaemonians to be beaten if the others did not do right.", "1712": "This was not spoken seriously;", "1713": "but Antisthenes, the Sokratic philosopher, was serious when he said of the Thebans, who were in high spirits after their victory at Leuktra, that they were as pleased as schoolboys who had beaten their master.", "1714": "XXXI.", "1715": "Not that this was Lykurgus's main object, that his country should dominate over as many other states as pos­ sible ;", "1716": "but seeing that, in states as in individuals, happiness is derived from virtue and single-mindedness, he directed all his efforts to implant in his countrymen feelings of honour, self-reliance, and self-control.", "1717": "These were also taken as the basis of their constitution by Plato, Diogenes, Zeno, and all who have written with any success upon this subject.", "1718": "But they have left mere dissertations;", "1719": "Lykurgus produced an inimitable constitution, confuted those who complained of the unreality of the ‘ Essay on the True Philosopher,' by showing them the spectacle of an entire city acting like philosophers, and thereby obtained for him­ self a greater reputation than that of any other Greek legis­ lator at any period.", "1720": "For this reason Aristotle says that he has less honour in Lacedæmon than he deserves, although his memory is greatly respected ;", "1721": "for he has a temple, and they sacrifice to him every year as if he was a god.", "1722": "It is also said that after his remains were carried home, his tomb was struck by lightning.", "1723": "This distinction befell scarcely any other man of note except Euripides, who died long after him, and was buried at Arethusa in Macedonia.", "1724": "It was considered a great proof and token of his fame by the admirers of Euripides, that this should happen to him after his death which happened before to the especial favourite of Heaven.", "1725": "Some say that Lykurgus died at Kirrha, but Apollothemis says that he was taken to Elis and died there, and Timæus and Aristoxenus say that he ended his days in Crete.", "1726": "Aristoxenus even says that the Cretans show his tomb in what is called the Strangers' Road in Pergamia.", "1727": "He is said to have left one son, Antiorus, who died childless, and so ended the family.", "1728": "His companions and relatives and their descendants kept up the practice of meeting together for a long period;", "1729": "and the days when they met were called Lykurgids.", "1730": "Aristo­ krates the son of Hipparchus says that when Lykurgus died in Crete, his friends burned his body and threw the ashes into the sea, at his own request, as he feared that if any remains of him should be brought back to Lacedæmon, they would think themselves absolved from their oath, and change the constitution.", "1731": "This is the story of Lykurgus.", "1732": "L THERE is a considerable conflict of opinion about the time of King Numa's reign, although several pedigrees seem to be accurately traced to him.", "1733": "One Clodius, in a book on the verification of dates, insists that all these old records were destroyed during the Gaulish troubles, and that those which are now extant were composed by interested persons, by whose means men who had no right to such honours claimed descent from the noblest families.", "1734": "Though Numa is said to have been a friend of Pythagoras, yet some deny that he had any tincture of Greek learning, arguing that either he was born with a natural capacity for sound learn­ ing, or that he was taught by some barbarian.*", "1735": "Others say that Pythagoras was born much later, some five generations after the times of Numa, but that Pythagoras the Spartan, who won the Stadium race at Olympia on the thirteenth Olympiad, wandered into Italy, and there meet­ ing Numa, assisted him in the establishment of his consti­ tution ;", "1736": "and that from this cause, the Roman constitution in many points resembles the Laconian.", "1737": "The Olympic games were instituted in the third year of Numa's reign.", "1738": "Another story is that Numa was a Sabine by birth, and the Sabines consider themselves to be of Lacedæmonian origin.", "1739": "It is hard to reconcile the dates, especially those which refer to Olympiads, the table of which is said to have been made out by Hippias of Elis, on no trustworthy basis.", "1740": "However, what things I have heard about Numa that are worthy of mention I shall proceed to relate, beginning from a starting-point of my own.", "1741": "II.", "1742": "Rome had been founded, and Romulus had reigned, for thirty-seven years, when upon the fifth day of the month of July, which day is now called nonce caprotince, he was performing a public sacrifice outside the gates, at a place called the Goat's Marsh, in the presence of the Senate and most of the people.", "1743": "Suddenly a great commotion began in the air, thick clouds covered the earth, with violent gusts and showers.", "1744": "The people fled in terror, and Romulus disappeared.", "1745": "His body could never be found, but suspicion fell upon the patricians, and a report was current among the populace that they had long been jealous of his power as king, and had determined to get it into their own hands.", "1746": "Indeed, he had dealt with them very harshly and tyrannically.", "1747": "Fearing this suspicion, they gave out that he was not dead, but had been caught up into heaven;", "1748": "and Proclus, a man of mark, swore that he saw Romulus ascend into heaven in his armour as he was, and that he heard a voice ordering that he should be called Quirinus.", "1749": "Another disturbance took place in Rome about the election of the next king, because the new citizens were not yet thoroughly amalgamated with the old ones, the people were unquiet, and the patricians suspicious of one another.", "1750": "Nevertheless they all determined that they would have a king, but they disagreed not merely about who, but of what race he should be.", "1751": "Romulus's original colonists thought it a monstrous thing that the Sabines, because they had been admitted to a share of the city and the country, should propose to rule over it;", "1752": "while the Sabines not unreasonably urged that because, after the death of Tatius, they had acquiesced in Romulus reigning alone, now in their turn they ought to furnish a king of their own nation.", "1753": "They had not, they said, been adopted by a more powerful race than them­ selves, but had, by their combination with the Romans, greatly raised the power and renown of their city.", "1754": "The two races were at issue on these points.", "1755": "The patricians, fearing that confusion might arise if the state were left without a head, made one of their own number every day assume the insignia of royalty, perform the usual sacrifices to the gods, and transact business for six hours by day, and six by night.", "1756": "This equal division of their periods of rule was not only just for those in office, but prevented any jealousy of them being felt by the populace, each day and night, because they saw one who had been a king become a private person.", "1757": "This form of government the Romans call an interregnum.", "1758": "III.", "1759": "But, although they appeared to manage things so smoothly, suspicions and threatenings of disturbance arose, for men said that they meditated altering the form of government to an oligarchy, in order to keep all political power in their own hands, and would not therefore elect a king.", "1760": "Hereupon the two factions agreed that one should select a king from the ranks of the other.", "1761": "This, they thought, would both put an end to their quarrels for the present, and also ensure the candidate who should be chosen being impartial, because he would be friendly to the one party because it had chosen him, and to the other because he belonged to it by birth.", "1762": "The Sabines gave the Romans their choice which they would do;", "1763": "and they decided that it would be better to choose a Sabine king themselves, than to be ruled by a Roman chosen by the Sabines.", "1764": "After deliberation amongst themselves, they chose Numa Pompilius, a man who was not one of those Sabines who had settled in Rome, but whose excellence was so well-known to all, that the Sabines, as soon as they heard his name, were even more eager for him than the Romans who had chosen him.", "1765": "When they had informed the people of their decision, they sent an embassy to Numa, composed of the leading men of both parties, to beg of him to come to Rome and assume the crown.", "1766": "Numa belonged to a celebrated Sabine city, Cures, from which the united Romans and Sabines called themselves Quirites.", "1767": "He was the son of Pomponius, an honourable citizen, and was the youngest of four brothers.", "1768": "By a miraculous coincidence he was born on the very day on which Romulus founded Rome;", "1769": "that is, the tenth day before the Calends of May.", "1770": "His naturally good disposition had been so educated by sorrow and philosophic pursuits, that he rose superior not merely to commonplace vices, but even to the worship of brute force, so common among barbarians, and considered true courage to consist in the conquest of his own passions.", "1771": "Accordingly he banished all luxury and extravagance from his house, and was known as a trusty friend and counsellor, both by his countrymen and by strangers.", "1772": "When at leisure, he disregarded sensual enjoyments and money-getting, but devoted himself to the service of the gods and to speculations about their nature and power, so that he obtained great celebrity.", "1773": "Indeed Tatius, when he was acting as joint-king with Romulus, chose him for the husband of his only daughter Tatia.", "1774": "But Numa was not elated by his marriage, and did not remove to the town where his father-in-law was king, but stayed where he was in Cures, among the Sabines, tending his aged father;", "1775": "while Tatia also preferred the quiet of a private citizen's life to the pomp which she might have enjoyed in Rome.", "1776": "She is said to have died in the thirteenth year after her marriage.", "1777": "IV.", "1778": "Now Numa was in the habit of leaving the city and passing much of his time in the country, wandering alone in the sacred groves and dwelling in desert places.", "1779": "Hence the story first arose that it was not from any derangement of intellect that he shunned human society, but because he held converse with higher beings, and had been admitted to marriage with the gods, and that, by passing his time in converse with the nymph Egeria, who loved him, he became blessed, and learned heavenly wisdom.", "1780": "It is evi­ dent that this is the same as many ancient myths;", "1781": "such as that told by the Phrygians about Attis, that of the Bithy­ nians about Herodotus, that of the Arcadians about Endymion, and many others.", "1782": "Yet it seems probable that a god, who loves man better than bird or beast, should take pleasure in conversing with those men who are remarkable for goodness, and not despise nor disdain to hold com­ munion with the wise and righteous.", "1783": "But it is hard to believe that a god or deity could feel the passion of love for a human form ;", "1784": "although the Egyptians not unreason­ ably say, that a woman may be impregnated by the spirit of a god, but that a man can have no material union with a god.", "1785": "However it is very right to believe that a god can feel friendship for a man, and from this may spring a love which watches over him and guides him in the path of virtue.", "1786": "There is truth in the myths of Phorbas, of Hyacinthus, and of Admetus, who were all loved by Apollo, as was also Hippolytus of Sicyon.", "1787": "It is said that whenever he set sail from Sikyon to Kirrha on the opposite coast, the Pythia would recite the verse, “ Now goes oar dear Hippolytus to sea,” as if the god knew that he was coming and rejoiced at it.", "1788": "There is a also a legend that Pan loved Pindar and his verses;", "1789": "and for the Muse's sake, Hesiod and Archilochus were honoured after their deaths ;", "1790": "while Sophokles during his life is said, by a legend which remains current at the present day, to have become the friend of Æsculapius, and on his death to have had the rites of burial supplied by the care of another god.", "1791": "If, then, we believe the legends which are told about these persons, why should we doubt that Zaleukus, Minos, Zoroaster, Numa, and Lykurgus were inspired by Heaven, when they governed their kingdoms and gave them laws ?", "1792": "We may suppose that the gods, when in an earnest mood, would hold converse with such men as these, the best of their kind, to talk with and encourage them, just as they visit the poets, if they do at all, when inclined for pleasure.", "1793": "However, if any one thinks differently, as Bacchylides says, “ The way is broad.", "1794": "\"The other view, which some take about Lykurgus and Numa and such men, seems very plausible, that they, having to deal with an obstinate and unmanageable people when introducing great political changes, invented the idea of their own divine mission as a means of safety for themselves.", "1795": "V.", "1796": "It was in Numa's fortieth year that the envoys came from Rome to ask him to be king.", "1797": "Their spokes­ men were Proculus and Velesius, one of whom had very nearly been elected king, for the Romulus people inclined much to Proculus, and those of Tatius were equally in favour of Velesius.", "1798": "These men made a short speech, imagining that Numa would be delighted with his for­ tune ;", "1799": "but it appears that it took much hard pleading to induce a man who had lived all his life in peace to take the command of a city which owed its origin and its increase alike to war.", "1800": "He said, in the presence of his father and of Marcius, one of his relations, \" Every change in a man's life is dangerous;", "1801": "and when a man is not in want of anything needful, and has no cause for being dissatisfied with his lot, it is sheer madness for him to change his habits and way of life;", "1802": "for these, at any rate have the advantage of security, while in the new state all is uncertain.", "1803": "Not even uncertain are the perils of royalty, judging from Romulus himself, who was sus­ pected of having plotted against his partner Tatius, and whose peers were suspected of having assassinated him.", "1804": "Yet these men call Romulus the child of the gods, and tell how he had a divinely sent nurse, and was preserved by a miracle while yet a child;", "1805": "while I was born of mortal parents, and brought up by people whom you all know:", "1806": "even the points which you praise in my character are far from those which make a good king, being love of leisure and of unprofitable speculation, and also a great fondness for peace and unwarlike matters, and for men who meet together for the glory of the gods or for cheerful converse with one another, and who at other times plough their fields and feed their cattle at home.", "1807": "But you Romans have very likely many wars left upon your hands by Romulus, for the conduct of which the state requires a vigorous warrior in the prime of life.", "1808": "The people too, from their successes, are accustomed to and eager for war, and are known to be longing for fresh conquests and possessions;", "1809": "so that they would ridicule me when I told them to honour the gods and act justly, and if I tried to instil a hatred of wars and of brute force into a city which wants a general more than a king.\"", "1810": "VI.", "1811": "As he refused the offered crown in such terms, the Romans used every kind of entreaty to induce him to accept it, begging him not to plunge the state again into civil war, because there was no other man whom the two parties would agree to receive as their king.", "1812": "In their absence, his father and Marcius begged him not to refuse so great and marvellous an offer.", "1813": "“ If,\" they said, \" you do not desire wealth, because of your simple life, and do not care for the glory of royalty, because you derive more glory from your own virtue, yet think that to be king is to serve God, who gives you this office and will not allow your righteousness to lie idle, useful only to your­ self.", "1814": "Do not therefore shrink from assuming this office, which gives you an opportunity to conduct the solemn ceremonials of religion with due pomp, and to civilise the.", "1815": "people and turn their hearts, which can be effected more easily by a king than by any one else.", "1816": "This people loved Tatius, though he was a foreigner, and they respect the memory of Romulus as if he was a god.", "1817": "And who knows, if the people, although victorious, may not have had enough of wars, and, sated with triumphs and spoils, may not be desirous of a gentle and just ruler under whom they may enjoy rest and peace.", "1818": "If, however, they are madly bent upon war, is it not better that you should hold the reins, and direct their fury elsewhere, becoming yourself a bond of union and friendship between the Sabine nation and this powerful and flourishing city?\"", "1819": "Besides these arguments, it is said that the omens were favourable, and that the people of the city, as soon as they heard of the embassy, came and besought him to go and become king, and thus unite and combine the two races.", "1820": "VII.", "1821": "When he had made up his mind, he sacrificed to the gods, and started for Rome.", "1822": "The Senate and people met him and showed great affection for him ;", "1823": "the matrons also greeted him, and there were sacrifices in the temples, and every one was as joyous as if he had received a king­ dom instead of a king.", "1824": "When they came into the Forum, the interrex or temporary king, Spurius Vettius, put it to the vote, and all the people voted for Numa.", "1825": "When they offered him the insignia of royalty, he bade them stop, saying that he wished to have his crown confirmed to him by God as well as by man.", "1826": "Taking the prophets and priests he ascended the Capitol, which the Romans at that time called the Tarpeian Hill.", "1827": "There the chief of the prophets made him turn towards the south, covered his bead, and then standing behind him with his hand laid upon his head, he prayed, and looked for a sign or omen sent from the gods in every quarter of the heavens.", "1828": "A strange silence prevailed among the people in the Forum, as they watched him eagerly, until a prosperous omen was observed.", "1829": "Then Numa received the royal robes and came down from the hill among the people.", "1830": "They re­ ceived him with cheers and congratulations, as the most pious of men, and as beloved of Heaven.", "1831": "When he be­ came king, his first act was to disband the body-guard of three hundred men, whom Romulus always had kept about his person, who were called Celeres, that is, swift;", "1832": "for Numa would not distrust a loyal people nor reign over a disloyal one.", "1833": "Next he instituted a third high priest, in addition to the existing priests of Jupiter and Mars, whom, in honour of Romulus, he called the Flamen Quirinalis.", "1834": "The elder priests are called Flamens from the skull-caps which they wear, and the word is derived from the Greek word for felt;", "1835": "for at that time Greek words were mingled with Latin ones more than now.", "1836": "For instance, the lœna worn by the priests is said by Juba to be the Greek chlaina, and the boy, whose parents must be both alive, who is servant to the priest of Jupiter, is called Camillus, just as the Greeks sometimes call Hermes (Mercury) Cadmilus, from his being the servant of the gods.", "1837": "VIII.", "1838": "Numa, after confirming his popularity by these measures, proceeded at once to attempt to convert the city from the practice of war and the strong hand, to that of right and justice, just as a man tries to soften and mould a mass of iron.", "1839": "The city at that time was indeed what Plato calls inflamed and angry,\" for it owed its very existence to the reckless daring by which it had thrust aside the most warlike races of the country, and had recruited its strength by many campaigns and ceaseless war, and, as carpentry becomes more fixed in its place by blows, so the city seemed to gain fresh power from its dangers.", "1840": "Thinking that it would be a very difficult task to change the habits of this excited and savage people, and to teach them the arts of peace, he looked to the gods for help, and by sacrifices, processions, and choral dances, which he himself organised and arranged, he awed, in­ terested, and softened the manners of the Romans, artfully beguiling them out of their warlike ferocity.", "1841": "Sometimes he spoke of supernatural terrors, evil omens, and unpro­ pitious voices, so as to influence them by means of super­ stition.", "1842": "These measures proved his wisdom, and showed him a true disciple of Pythagoras, for the worship of the gods was an important part of his state policy, as it is of Pythagoras's system of philosophy.", "1843": "His love of outward show and stratagem was also said to be derived from Pythagoras, for as the latter tamed an eagle and made it alight upon him, and when walking through the crowd at Olympia showed his golden thigh, and did all the other surprising devices which made Timon of Phlius write the epigram­ \"", "1844": "Pythagoras by magic arts, And mystic talk deludes men's hearts,” so did Numa invent the story of his amour with a wood­ nymph and his secret converse with her, and of his en­ joying the society of the Muses.", "1845": "He referred most of his prophetic utterances to the Muses, and taught the Romans to worship one of them especially, whom he called Tacita, which means silent or dumb.", "1846": "This seems to have been done in imitation of Pythagoras, who especially revered silence.", "1847": "His legislation about images was also connected with the Pythagorean doctrine, which says that first principles cannot be touched or seen, but are invisible spiritual essences;", "1848": "for Numa forbade the Romans to wor­ ship any likenesses of men or of beasts.", "1849": "Among them there was no image of a god, either carved or moulded, in the early times.", "1850": "For a hundred and seventy years they built temples, and placed shrines in them, but made no image of any living thing, considering that it was wrong to make the worse like the better, and that God cannot be comprehended otherwise than by thought.", "1851": "Their sacrifices also were connected with the Pythagorean doctrine;", "1852": "they were for the most part bloodless, and performed with flour, libations of wine, and all the com­ monest things.", "1853": "But besides these, there are other distinct proofs of the connection of these two men with one another.", "1854": "One of these is that the Romans enrolled Pythagoras as a citizen, as we are told by Epicharmus the comic poet, in a letter which he wrote to Antenor.", "1855": "He was a man who lived in old times and underwent the Pythagorean training.", "1856": "Another proof is that of his four sons, King Numa named one Mamercus after the son of Pythagoras;", "1857": "from whom sprung the ancient patrician house of the Æmilii.", "1858": "This name was originally given him in sport by the king, who used to call him aimulos or wily.", "1859": "I myself have heard many Romans narrate that an oracle once bade the Romans establish the wisest and the bravest of the Greeks in their own city, and that in consequence of it they set up two brazen statues in the Forum, one of Alkibiades and one of Pythagoras.", "1860": "But all this can be so easily disputed that it is not worth while to pursue it farther or to put any trust in it.", "1861": "IX.", "1862": "To Numa also is referred the institution of the Pontifices, or high priests;", "1863": "and he himself is said to have been one of the first.", "1864": "The Pontifices are so called, ac­ cording to some authorities, because they worship the gods, who are powerful and almighty;", "1865": "for powerful in Latin is potens.", "1866": "Others say that it refers to an exception made in favour of possibilities, meaning that the legislator ordered the priests to perform what services lay in their power, and did not deny that there are some which they cannot.", "1867": "But the most usually received and most absurd derivation is that the word means nothing more than bridge builders, and that they were so named from the sacrifices which are offered upon the sacred bridge, which are of great sanctity and antiquity.", "1868": "The Latins call a bridge pontem.", "1869": "This bridge is intrusted to the care of the priests, like any other immovable holy relic;", "1870": "for the Romans think that the removal of the wooden bridge would call down the wrath of Heaven.", "1871": "It is said to be entirely composed of wood, in accordance with some oracle, without any iron whatever.", "1872": "The stone bridge was built many years afterwards, when AEmilius was Quaestor.", "1873": "However, it is said that the wooden bridge itself does not date from the time of Numa, but that it was finished by Marcius, the grandson of Numa, when he was king.", "1874": "The chief priest, or Pontifex Maximus, is an interpreter and prophet or rather expounder of the will of Heaven.", "1875": "He not only sees that the public sacrifices are properly conducted, but even watches those who offer private sacrifices, opposes all departure from established custom, and points out to each man how to honour the gods and how to pray to them.", "1876": "He also presides over the holy maidens called vestals.", "1877": "The consecration of the vestal virgins, and the worship and watching of the eternal flame by them, are entirely attributed to Numa, and explained either by the pure and uncorruptible essence of fire being intrusted to the keeping of those who are stainless and undefiled, or by that which is barren and without fruit being associated with maidens.", "1878": "Indeed, in Greece, wherever an eternal fire is kept up, as at Delphi and Athens, it is not maidens, but widows, past the age to wed, that tend it.", "1879": "When any of these fires chance to go out, as, for instance, the sacred lamp went out at Athens when Aristion was despot, and the fire went out at Delphi when the temple was burned by the Persians, and at Rome in the revolutions during the time of the wars with King Mithridates the fire, and even the altar upon which it burned, was swept away;", "1880": "then they say that it must not be lighted from another fire, but that an entirely new fire must be made, lighted by a pure and undefiled ray from the sun.", "1881": "They usually light it with mirrors made by hollowing the surface of an isosceles right­ angled triangle, which conducts all the rays of light into one point.", "1882": "Now when it is placed opposite to the sun, so that all the rays coming from all quarters are collected together into that point, the ray thus formed passes through the thin air, and at once lights the dryest and lightest of the objects againt which it strikes, for that ray has the strength and force of fire itself.", "1883": "Some say that the only duty of the vestal virgins is to watch that eternal fire, but others say they perform certain secret rites, about which we have written as much as it is lawful to divulge, in the Life of Camillus.X.", "1884": "The first maidens who were consecrated by Numa were named Gegania and Yerenia;", "1885": "and afterwards Canuleia and Tarpeia were added.", "1886": "Servius subsequently added two more to their number, which has remained six ever since his reign.", "1887": "Numa ordained that the maidens should observe celibacy for thirty years, during the first ten years of which they were to learn their duties, during the next perform them, and during the last to teach others.", "1888": "After this period any of them who wished might marry and cease to be priestesses;", "1889": "but it is said that very few availed themselves of this privilege, and that those few were not happy, but, by their regrets and sorrow for the life they had left, made the others scruple to leave it, and prefer so remain virgins till their death.", "1890": "They had great privileges, such as that of disposing of their property by will when their fathers were still alive, like women who have borne three children.", "1891": "When they walk abroad they are escorted by lictors with the fasces;", "1892": "and if they happen to meet any criminal who is being taken to execution, he is not put to death;", "1893": "but the vestal must swear that she met him accidentally, and not on purpose.", "1894": "When they use a litter, no one may pass under it on pain of death.", "1895": "The vestals are corrected by stripes for any faults which they commit, sometimes by the Pontifex Maximus, who flogs the culprit without her clothes, but with a curtain drawn before her.", "1896": "She that breaks her vow of celibacy is buried alive at the Colline Gate, at which there is a mound of earth which stretches some way inside the city wall.", "1897": "In it they construct an underground chamber, of small size, which is entered from above.", "1898": "In it is a bed with bedding, and a lamp burning;", "1899": "and also some small means of sup­ porting life, such as bread, a little water in a vessel, milk, and oil, as though they wished to avoid the pollu­ tion of one who had been consecrated with such holy ceremonies dying of hunger.", "1900": "The guilty one is placed in a litter, covered in, and gagged with thongs so that she cannot utter a sound.", "1901": "Then they carry her through the Forum.", "1902": "All make way in silence, and accompany her passage with downcast looks, without speaking.", "1903": "There is no more fearful sight than this, nor any day when the city is plunged into deeper mourning.", "1904": "When the litter reaches the appointed spot, the servants loose her bonds, and the chief priest, after private prayer and lifting his hands to Heaven before his dreadful duty, leads her out, closely veiled, places her upon a ladder which leads down into the subterranean chamber.", "1905": "After this he turns away with the other priests;", "1906": "the ladder is drawn up after she has descended, and the site of the chamber is obliterated by masses of earth which are piled upon it, so that the place looks like any other part of the mound.", "1907": "Thus are the vestals punished who lose their chastity.", "1908": "XI.", "1909": "Numa is said to have built the Temple of Veda, which was to contain the sacred fire, in a circular form, imitating thereby not the shape of the earth, but that of the entire universe, in the midst of which the Pythagoreans place the element of fire, which they call Vesta and the Unit.", "1910": "The earth they say is not motionless, and not in the centre of its orbit, but revolves round the central fire, occupying by no means the first or the most honourable place in the system of the universe.", "1911": "These ideas are said to have been entertained by Plato also in his old age;", "1912": "for he too thought that the earth was in a subordinate position, and that the centre of the universe was occupied by some nobler body.", "1913": "XII.", "1914": "The Pontifices also explain, to those who inquire of them, the proper ceremonies at funerals.", "1915": "For Numa taught them not to think that there was any pollution in death, but that we must pay due honours to the gods below, because they will receive all that is noblest on earth.", "1916": "Especially he taught them to honour the goddess Libitina, the goddess who presides over funeral rites, whether she be Proserpine, or rather Venus, as the most learned Romans imagine, not unnaturally referring our birth and our death to the same divinity.", "1917": "He also defined the periods of mourning, according to the age of the deceased.", "1918": "He allowed none for a child under three years of age, and for one older the mourning was only to last as many months as he lived years, pro­ vided those were not more than ten.", "1919": "The longest mourn­ ing was not to continue above ten months, after which space widows were permitted to marry again;", "1920": "but she that took another husband before that term was out was obliged by his decree to sacrifice a cow with calf.", "1921": "Of Numa's many other institutions I shall only mention two, that of the Salii and of the Feciales, which especially show his love of justice.", "1922": "The Feciales are, as it were, guardians of peace, and in my opinion obtain their name from their office;", "1923": "for they were to act as mediators, and not to permit an appeal to arms before all hope of obtain­ ing justice by fair means had been lost.", "1924": "The Greeks call it peace when two states settle their differences by negotia­ tion and not by arms ;", "1925": "and the Roman Feciales frequently went to states that had done wrong and begged them to think better of what they had done.", "1926": "If they rejected their offers, then the Feciales called the gods to witness, invoked dreadful curses upon themselves and their country, if they were about to fight in an unjust cause, and so declared war.", "1927": "Against the will of the Feciales, or without their approval, no Roman, whether king or common soldier, was allowed to take up arms, but the general was obliged first to have it certified to him by the Feciales that the right was on his side, and then to take his measures for a campaign.", "1928": "It is said that the great disaster with the Gauls befell the city in consequence of this ceremony having been neglected.", "1929": "The barbarians were besieging Clusium ;", "1930": "Fabius Ambustus was sent as an ambassador to their camp to make terms on behalf of the besieged.", "1931": "His proposals met with a harsh reply, and he, thinking that his mission- was at an end, had the audacity to appear before the ranks of the men of Clusium in arms, and to challenge the bravest of the barbarians to single combat.", "1932": "He won the fight, slew his opponent and stripped his body;", "1933": "but the Gauls recognised him, and sent a herald to Rome, complaining that Fabius had broken faith and not kept his word, and had waged war against them without its being previously declared.", "1934": "Hereupon the Feciales urged the Senate to deliver the man up to the Gauls, but he appealed to the people, and by their favour escaped his just doom.", "1935": "Soon after the Gauls came and sacked Rome, except the Capitol.", "1936": "But this is treated of more at length in the ‘ Life of Camillus.", "1937": "'XIII.", "1938": "The priests called Salii are said to owe their origin to the following circumstances:", "1939": "In the eighth year of Numa's reign an epidemic raged throughout Italy, and afflicted the city of Rome.", "1940": "Now amidst the general distress it is related that a brazen shield fell from heaven into the hands of Numa.", "1941": "Upon this the king made an inspired speech, which he had learned from Egeria and the Muses.", "1942": "The shield, he said, came for the salvation of the city, and they must guard it, and make eleven more like it, so that no thief could steal the one that fell from heaven, because he could not tell which it was.", "1943": "Moreover the place and the meadows round about it, where he was wont to con­ verse with the Muses, must be consecrated to them, and the well by which it was watered must be pointed out as holy water to the vestal virgins, that they might daily take some thence to purify and sprinkle their temple.", "1944": "The truth of this is said to have been proved by the im­ mediate cessation of the plague.", "1945": "He bade workmen compete in imitating the shield, and, when all others refused to attempt it, Veturius Mamurius, one of the best workmen of the time, produced so admirable an imitation, and made all the shields so exactly alike, that even Numa himself could not tell which was the original.", "1946": "He next appointed the Salii to guard and keep them.", "1947": "These priests were called Salii, not, as some say, after a man of Samothrace or of Mantinea named Salius, who first taught the art of dancing under arms, but rather from the springing dance itself, which they dance through the city when they carry out the shields in the month of March, dressed in scarlet tunics, girt with brazen girdles, with brazen helmets on their heads and little daggers with which they strike the shields.", "1948": "The rest of their dance is done with their feet;", "1949": "they move gracefully, whirling round, swiftly and airily counter-changing their positions with light and vigorous motions according to rhythm and measure.", "1950": "The shields are called ancilia, because of their shape;", "1951": "for they are not round, nor with a perfect circumference, but are cut out of a wavy line, and curl in at the thickest part towards each other;", "1952": "or they may be called ancilia after the name of the elbow, anlcon, on which they are carried;", "1953": "at least so Juba conjectures in his endeavours to find a Greek deriva tion for the word.", "1954": "The name may be connected with the fall of the shield from above (anekathen), or with the heal­ ing (akesis) of the plague, and the cessation of that terrible calamity, if we must refer the word to a Greek root.", "1955": "It is related that, to reward Mamurius for his workman­ ship, his name is mentioned in the song which the Salii sing while they dance their Pyrrhic dance;", "1956": "others, how­ ever, say that it is not Veturium Mamurium that they say, but Veterem Memoriam, which means ancient memory.", "1957": "XIV.", "1958": "After he had arranged all religious ceremonies, he built, near the temple of Vesta, the Regia, as a kind of royal palace;", "1959": "and there he spent most of his time, engaged in religious duties, instructing the priests, or awaiting some divine colloquy.", "1960": "He had also another house on the hill of Quirinus, the site of which is even now pointed out.", "1961": "In all religious processions through the city the heralds went first to bid the people cease their work, and attend to the ceremony ;", "1962": "for just as the Pythagoreans are said to forbid the worship of the gods in a cursory manner, and to insist that men shall set out from their homes with this purpose and none other in their minds, so Numa thought it wrong that the citizens should see or hear any religious ceremony in a careless, half-hearted manner, and made them cease from all worldly cares and attend with all their hearts to the most important of all duties, religion ;", "1963": "so he cleared the streets of all the hammering, and cries, and noises which attend the practice of ordinary trades and handicrafts, before any holy ceremony.", "1964": "Some trace of this custom still survives in the practice of crying out Hoc age when the consul is taking the auspices or making a sacrifice.", "1965": "These words mean \"", "1966": "Do this thing,\" and are used to make the bystanders orderly and attentive.", "1967": "Many of his other precepts are like those of the Pythagoreans;", "1968": "for just as they forbid men to sit upon a quart measure, or to stir the fire with a sword, or to turn back when they set out upon a journey, and bid them sacrifice an odd number to the gods above, and an even one to those below, all of which things had a mystical meaning, which was hidden from the common mass of mankind, so also some of Numa's rites can only be explained by reference to some secret legend, such as his forbidding men to make a libation to the gods with wine made from an unpruned vine, and his ordering that no sacrifice should be made without flour, and that men should turn round while worshipping and sit after they had worshipped.", "1969": "The first two of these seem to point to cultivation of the fruits of the earth, as a part of righteousness;", "1970": "the turning round of the worship­ pers is said to be in imitation of the revolution of the globe, but it seems more probable that, as all temples look towards the east, the worshipper who enters with his back to the sun turns round towards this god also, and begs of them both, as he makes his circuit, to fulfil his prayer.", "1971": "Unless indeed there is an allusion to the symbolical wheel of the Egyptians, and the change of posture means that nothing human is constant, and that, however God may turn about our lives, it is our duty to be content.", "1972": "The act of sitting after prayer was said to portend that such as were good would obtain a solid and lasting fulfilment of their prayers.", "1973": "Or again, this attitude of rest marks the division between different periods of prayer;", "1974": "so that after the end of one prayer they seat themselves in the presence of the gods, in order that under their auspices they may begin the next.", "1975": "This fully agrees with what has been said above, and shows that the lawgiver intended to ac­ custom his countrymen not to offer their prayers in a hurry, or in the intervals of doing something else, but when they were at leisure and not pressed for time.", "1976": "XV.", "1977": "By this religious training the city became so easily managed by Numa, and so impressed by his power, as to believe stories of the wildest character about him, and to think nothing incredible or impossible if he wished to do it.", "1978": "For instance, it is related that once he invited many of the citizens to dine with him, and placed before them common vessels and poor fare;", "1979": "but, as they were about to begin dinner, he suddenly said that his familiar goddess was about to visit him, and at once displayed abundance of golden cups and tables covered with costly delicacies.", "1980": "The strangest story of all is that of his conversation with Jupiter.", "1981": "The legend runs that Mount Aventine was not at this time enclosed within the city, but was full of fountains and shady glens, and haunted by two divinities, Picus and Faunus, who may be compared to Satyrs or to Pan, and who, in knowledge of herbs and magic, seem equal to what the Greeks call the Daktyli of Mount Ida.", "1982": "These creatures roamed about Italy playing their tricks, but Numa caught them by filling the spring at which they drank with wine and honey.", "1983": "They turned into all kinds of shapes, and assumed strange and terrible forms, but when they found that they were unable to escape, they told Numa much of the future, and showed him how to make a charm against thunder-bolts, which is used to this day, and is made of onions and hair and sprats.", "1984": "Some say that it was not these deities who told him the charm, but that they by magic arts brought down Jupiter from heaven, and he, in a rage, ordered Numa to make the charm of “ Heads ” ;", "1985": "and when Numa added, “ Of onions,\" he said “ Of men’s”—“ Hair,\" said Numa, again taking away the terrible part of thee imprecation.", "1986": "When then Jupiter said \" With living \"—\" Sprats,\" said Numa, answering as Egeria had taught him.", "1987": "The god went away appeased, and the place was in consequence called Ilicius.", "1988": "This was how the charm was discovered.", "1989": "These ridiculous legends show the way in which the people had become accustomed to regard the gods.", "1990": "Indeed Numa is said to have placed all his hopes in religion, to such an extent that even when a message was brought him, saying, “ The enemy are approaching,\" he smiled and said, \" And I am sacrificing.\"XVI.", "1991": "The first temples that he founded are said to have been those of Fides or Faith, and Terminus.", "1992": "Fides is said to have revealed to the Romans the greatest of all oaths, which they even now make use of;", "1993": "while Terminus is the god of boundaries, to whom they sacrifice publicly, and also privately at the divisions of men's estates;", "1994": "at the present time with living victims, but in old days this was a bloodless sacrifice, for Numa argued that the god of boundaries must be a lover of peace, and a witness of righteousness, and therefore averse to bloodshed.", "1995": "Indeed Numa was the first king who defined the boundaries of the country, since Romulus was unwilling, by measuring what was really his own, to show how much he had taken from other states :", "1996": "for boundaries, if preserved, are barriers against violence ;", "1997": "if disregarded, they become standing proofs of lawless injustice.", "1998": "The city had origi­ nally but a small territory of its own, and Romulus gained the greater part of its possessions by the sword.", "1999": "All this Numa distributed among the needy citizens, thereby re­ moving the want which urged them to deeds of violence, and, by turning the people's thoughts to husbandry, he made them grow more civilised as their land grew more cultivated.", "2000": "No profession makes men such passionate lovers of peace as that of a man who farms his own land;", "2001": "for he retains enough of the warlike spirit to fight fiercely in defence of his own property, but has lost all desire to despoil and wrong his neighbours.", "2002": "It was for this reason that Numa encouraged agriculture among the Romans, as a spell to charm away war, and loved the art more because of its influence on men's minds than because of the wealth which it produced.", "2003": "He divided the whole country into districts, which he called pagi, and appointed a head man for each, and a patrol to guard it.", "2004": "And sometimes he himself would inspect them, and, forming an opinion of each man's character from the condition of his farm, would raise some to honours and offices of trust, and blaming others for their remissness, would lead them to do better in future.", "2005": "XVII.", "2006": "Of his other political measures, that which is most admired is his division of the populace according to their trades.", "2007": "For whereas the city, as has been said, originally consisted of two races, which stood aloof one from the other and would not combine into one, which led to end­ less quarrels and rivalries, Numa, reflecting that substances which are hard and difficult to combine together, can nevertheless be mixed and formed into one mass if they are broken up into small pieces, because then they more easily fit into each other, determined to divide the whole mass of the people of Rome into many classes, and thus, by creating numerous petty rivalries, to obliterate their original and greatest cause of variance.", "2008": "His division was according to their trades, and consisted of the musicians, the goldsmiths, the builders, the dyers, the shoemakers, the carriers, the coppersmiths, and the potters.", "2009": "All the other trades he united into one guild.", "2010": "He assigned to each trade its special privileges, common to all the members, and arranged that each should have its own times of meeting, and worship its own special patron god, and by this means he did away with that habit, which hitherto had prevailed among the citizens, of some calling themselves Sabines, and some Romans;", "2011": "one boast­ ing that they were Tatius's men, and other Romulus's.", "2012": "So this division produced a complete fusion and unity.", "2013": "Moreover he has been much praised for another of his measures, that, namely, of correcting the old law which allows fathers to sell their sons for slaves.", "2014": "He abolished this power in the case of married men, who had married with their father's consent;", "2015": "for he thought it a monstrous injustice that a woman, who had married a free man, should be compelled to be the wife of a slave.", "2016": "XVIII.", "2017": "He also dealt with astronomical matters, not with perfect accuracy, and yet not altogether without knowledge.", "2018": "During the reign of Romulus the months had been in a state of great disorder, some not containing twenty days, some five-and-thirty, and some even more, because the Romans could not reconcile the discrepancies which arise from reckoning by the sun and the moon, and only insisted upon one thing, that the year should consist of three hundred and sixty days.", "2019": "Numa reckoned the variation to consist of eleven days, as the lunar year contains three hundred and fifty-four days, and the solar year three hundred and sixty-five.", "2020": "He doubled these eleven days and introduced them every other year, after February, as an intercalary month, twenty­ two days in duration, which was called by the Romans Mercedinus.", "2021": "This was a remedy for the irregularities of the calendar which itself required more extensive remedies.", "2022": "He also altered the order of the months, putting March, which used to be the first month, third, and making January the first, which in the time of Romulus had been the eleventh, and February the second, which then had been the twelfth.", "2023": "There are many writers who say that these months, January and February, were added to the calendar by Numa, and that originally there had only been ten months in the year, just as some barbarians have three, and in Greece the Arcadians have four, and the Acarnanians six.", "2024": "The Egyptians originally had but one month in their year, and afterwards are said to have divided it into four months ;", "2025": "wherefore, though they live in the newest of all countries, they appear to be the most ancient of all nations, and in their genealogies reckon an incredible number of years, because they count their months as years.", "2026": "XIX.", "2027": "One proof that the Romans used to reckon ten months and not twelve in the year is the name of the last month;", "2028": "for up to the present day it is called December, the tenth, and the order of the months shows that March was the first, for the fifth month from it they called Quintilis, the fifth;", "2029": "and the sixth month Sextilis, and so on for the others, although, by their putting January and February before March, it resulted that the month which they number fifth is really seventh in order.", "2030": "Moreover, there is a legend that the month of March, being the first.", "2031": "was dedicated by Romulus to Mars, and the second, April, to Aphrodite (Venus);", "2032": "in which month they sacrifice to this goddess, and the women bathe on the first day of it crowned with myrtle.", "2033": "Some, however, say that April is not named after Aphrodite, because the word April does not contain the letter A, and that it comes from the Latin word aperio, and means the month in which the spring­ time opens the buds of plants;", "2034": "for that is what the word signifies.", "2035": "Of the following months, May is named after Maia, the mother of Hermes or Mercury, for it is dedicated to her, and Juno from Juno.", "2036": "Some say that these names signify old age and youth, for old men are called by the Latins majores, and young men juniores.", "2037": "The remaining months they named, from the order in which they came, the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth:", "2038": "Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December.", "2039": "Then Quintilis was called Julius after Julius Cæsar, who con­ quered Pompeius ;", "2040": "and Sextilis was called Augustus, after the second of the Roman Emperors.", "2041": "The next two months Domitian altered to his own titles, but not for any long time, as after his death they resumed their old names of September and October.", "2042": "The last two alone have pre­ served their original names without change.", "2043": "Of the months, added or altered by Numa, Februarius means the month of purification, for that is as nearly as possible the meaning of the word, and during it they sacrifice to the dead, and hold the festival of the Lupercalia, which resembles a ceremony of purification.", "2044": "The first month, Januarius, is named after Janus.", "2045": "My opinion is, that Numa moved the month named after Mars from its prece­ dence, wishing the art of good government to be honoured before that of war.", "2046": "For Janus in very ancient times was either a deity or a king, who established a social polity, and made men cease from a savage life like that of wild beasts.", "2047": "And for this reason his statues are made with a double face, because he turned men'a way of life from one form to another.", "2048": "XX.", "2049": "There is a temple to him in Rome, which has two doors, and which they call the gate of war.", "2050": "It is the custom to open the temple in time of war, and to close it during peace.", "2051": "This scarcely ever took place, as the empire was almost always at war with some state, being by its very greatness continually brought into collision with the neighbouring tribes.", "2052": "Only in the time of Cæsar Augustus, after he had conquered Antonius, it was closed;", "2053": "and before that, during the consulship of Marcus Atilius and Titus Manlius, for a short time, and then was almost immediately reopened, as a new war broke out.", "2054": "But during Numa's reign no one raw it open for a single day, and it remained closed for forty-three years continuously, so utterly had he made wars to cease on all sides.", "2055": "Not only was the spirit of the Romans subdued and pacified by the gentle and just character of their king, but even the neighbouring cities, as if some soothing healthful air was breathed over them from Rome, altered their habits and longed to live quiet and well-governed, cultivating the earth, bringing up their families in peace, and wor­ shipping the gods.", "2056": "And gay festivals and entertainments, during which the people of the various states fearlessly mixed with one another, prevailed throughout Italy, for Numa's knowledge of all that was good and noble was shed abroad like water from a fountain, and the atmo­ sphere of holy calm by which he was surrounded spread over all men.", "2057": "The very poets when they wrote of that peaceful time were unable to find adequate expressions for it, as one writes­ “", "2058": "Across the shields are cobwebs laid, Rust eats the lance and keen edged blade;", "2059": "No more we hear the trumpets bray, And from our eyes no more is slumber chased away.\"", "2060": "No war, revolution, or political disturbance of any kind is recorded during Numa's reign, neither was there any envy or hatred of him or any attempt by others to obtain the crown;", "2061": "but either fear of the gods who visibly pro­ tected hint, or reverence for his virtues, or the special grace of Heaven, made men's lives innocent and untainted with evil, and formed a striking proof of the truth of what Plato said many years afterwards, that the only escape from misery for men is when by Divine Providence philosophy is combined with royal power, and used to exalt virtue over vice.", "2062": "Blessed indeed is the truly wise man, and blessed are they who hear the words of his mouth.", "2063": "Indeed his people require no restraints or punish­ ments, but seeing a plain example of virtue in the life of their chief, they themselves of their own accord reform their lives, and model them upon that gentle and blessed rule of love and just dealing one with another which it is the noblest work of politicians to establish.", "2064": "He is most truly a king who can teach such lessons as these to his subjects, and Numa beyond all others seems to have clearly discerned this truth.", "2065": "XXI.", "2066": "Historians differ in their accounts of his wives and children.", "2067": "Some say that he married Tatia alone, and was the father of one daughter only, named Pompilia;", "2068": "but others, besides her, assign to him four sons, named Pompo, Pinus, Calpus, and Mamercus, from whom de­ scended the four noble families of the Pomponii, Pinarii, Calphurnii, and Mamerci, which for this reason took the title of Rex, that is, king.", "2069": "Others again say that these pedigrees were invented to flatter these families, and state that the Pompilian family descends not from Tatia, but from Lucretia, whom he married after he became king.", "2070": "All, however, agree that Pompilia married Marcius, the son of that Marcius who encouraged Numa to accept the crown.", "2071": "This man accompanied Numa to Rome, was made a member of the Senate, and after Numa's death laid claim to the crown, but was worsted by Tullus Hostilius and made away with himself.", "2072": "His son Marcius, who married Pompilia, remained in Rome, and became the father of Ancus Marcius, who was king after Tullus Hostilius, and who was only five years old when Numa died.", "2073": "We are told by Piso that Numa died, not by a sudden death, but by slow decay from sheer old age, having lived a little more than eighty years.", "2074": "XXII.", "2075": "He was enviable even in death, for all the friendly and allied nations assembled at his funeral with national offerings.", "2076": "The senators bore his bier, which was attended by the chief priests, while the crowd of men, women and children who were present, followed with such weeping and wailing, that one would have thought that, instead of an aged king, each man was about to bury his own dearest friend, who had died in the prime of life.", "2077": "At his own wish, it is said, the body was not burned, but placed in two stone coning and buried on the Janiculum Hill.", "2078": "One of these contained his body, and the other the sacred books which he himself had written, as Greek legislators write their laws upon tablets.", "2079": "During his life he had taught the priests the contents of these books, and their meaning and spirit, and ordered them to be buried with his corpse, because it was right that holy mysteries should be contained, not in soulless writings, but in the minds of living men.", "2080": "For the same reason they say that the Pythagoreans never reduced their maxims to writing, but implanted them in the memories of worthy men;", "2081": "and when some of their difficult processes in geo­ metry were divulged to some unworthy men, they said that Heaven would mark its sense of the wickedness which had been committed by some great public calamity;", "2082": "so that, as Numa's system so greatly resembled that of Pythagoras, we can easily pardon those who endeavour to establish a connection between them.", "2083": "Valerius of Antium says that twelve sacred books and twelve books of Greek philosophy were placed in the coffin.", "2084": "Four hundred years afterwards, when Publius Cornelius and Marcus Bæbius were consuls, a great fall of rain took place, and the torrent washed away the earth and exposed the coffins.", "2085": "When the lids were removed, one of the coffins was seen by all men to be empty, and without any trace of a corpse in it;", "2086": "the other contained the books, which were read by Petilius the prætor, who reported to the Senate that in his opinion it was not right that their contents should be made known to the people, and they were therefore carried to the Comitium and burned there.", "2087": "All good and just men receive most praise after their death, because their unpopularity dies with them or even before them ;", "2088": "but Numa's glory was enhanced by the unhappy reigns of his successors.", "2089": "Of five kings who succeeded him, the last was expelled and died an exile, and of the other four, not one died a natural death, but three were murdered by conspirators, and Tullus Hostilius, who was king next after Numa, and who derided and insulted his wise ordinances, especially those connected with religion, as lazy and effeminate, and who urged the people to take up arms, was cut down in the midst of his boastings by a terrible disease, and became subject to superstitious fears in no way resembling Numa's piety.", "2090": "His subjects were led to share these terrors, more especially by the manner of his death, which is said to have been by the stroke of a thunderbolt.", "2091": "I.", "2092": "Now that we have gone through the lives of Numa and Lykurgus, we must attempt, without being daunted by difficulties, to reconcile the points in which they appear to differ from each other.", "2093": "Much they appear to have had in common, as, for example, their self-control, their piety, and their political and educational ability;", "2094": "and while the peculiar glory of Numa is his acceptance of the throne, that of Lykurgus is his abdication.", "2095": "Numa re­ ceived it without having asked for it;", "2096": "Lykurgus when, in full possession gave it up.", "2097": "Numa, though a private man and not even a Roman, was chosen by the Romans as their king;", "2098": "but Lykurgus from being a king reduced himself to a private station.", "2099": "It is honourable to obtain a crown by righteousness, but it is also honourable to prefer right­ eousness to a crown.", "2100": "Numa's virtue made him so cele­ brated that he was judged worthy to be king, Lykurgus' made him so great that he did not care to be king.", "2101": "Again, like those who tune the strings of a lyre, Lykurgus drew tighter the relaxed and licentious Sparta, while Numa merely slackened the highly strung and war­ like Rome, so that here Lykurgus had the more difficult task.", "2102": "He had to persuade his countrymen, not to take off their armour and lay aside their swords, but to leave off using gold and silver, and to lay aside costly hangings and furniture;", "2103": "he had not to make them exchange wars for sacrifices and gay festivals, but to cease from feasts and drinking-parties, and work hard both in the field and in the palæstra to train themselves for war.", "2104": "For this reason, Numa was able to effect his purpose without difficulty, and without any loss of popularity and respect;", "2105": "while Lykurgus was struck and pelted, and in danger of his life, and even so could scarcely carry out his reforms.", "2106": "Yet the genius of Numa was kindly and gentle, and so softened and changed the reckless fiery Romans that they became peaceful, law-abiding citizens;", "2107": "and if we must reckon Lykurgus' treatment of the Helots as part of his system, it cannot be denied that Numa was a far more civilised lawgiver, seeing that he allowed even to actual slaves some taste of liberty, by his institution of feasting them together with their masters at the festival of Saturn.", "2108": "For this custom of allowing the labourers to share in the harvest-feast is traced to Numa.", "2109": "Some say that this is in remembrance of the equality which existed in the time of Saturn, when there was neither master nor slave, but all were kinsmen and had equal rights.", "2110": "II.", "2111": "Both evidently encouraged the spirit of inde­ pendence and self-control among their people, while of other virtues, Lykurgus loved bravery, and Numa loved justice best;", "2112": "unless indeed we should say that, from the very different temper and habits of the two states, they required to be treated in a different manner.", "2113": "It was not from cowardice, but because he scorned to do an injustice, that Numa did not make war;", "2114": "while Lykurgus made his countrymen warlike, not in order that they might do wrong, but that they might not be wronged.", "2115": "Each found that the existing system required very important altera­ tions to check its excesses and supply its defects.", "2116": "Numa's reforms were all in favour of the people, whom he classified into a mixed and motley multitude of goldsmiths and musicians and cobblers;", "2117": "while the constitution introduced by Lykurgus was severely aristocratic, driving all handi­ crafts into the hands of slaves and foreigners, and con­ fining the citizens to the use of the spear and shield, as men whose trade was war alone, and who knew nothing but how to obey their leaders and to conquer their enemies.", "2118": "In Sparta a free man was not permitted to make money in business, in order that he might be truly free.", "2119": "Each thing connected with the business of making money, like that of preparing food for dinner, was left in the hands of slaves and helots.", "2120": "Numa made no regulations of this kind, but, while he put an end to military plun­ dering, raised no objection to other methods of making money, nor did he try to reduce inequalities of fortune.", "2121": "but allowed wealth to increase unchecked, and disregarded the influx of poor men into the city and the increase of poverty there, whereas he ought at the very outset, like Lykurgus, while men's fortunes were still tolerably equal, to have raised some barrier against the encroachments of wealth, and to have restrained the terrible evils which take their rise and origin in it.", "2122": "As for the division of the land among the citizens, in my opinion, Lykurgus cannot be blamed for doing it, nor yet can Numa for not doing it.", "2123": "The equality thus produced was the very foundation and corner-stone of the Lacedaemonian constitution, while Numa had no motive for disturbing the Roman lands, which had only been recently distributed among the citizens, or to alter the arrangements made by Romulus, which we may suppose were still in force throughout the country.", "2124": "III.", "2125": "With regard to a community of wives and children, each took a wise and statesman-like course to prevent jealousy, although the means employed by each wore different.", "2126": "A Roman who possessed a sufficient family of his own might be prevailed upon by a friend who had no children to transfer his wife to him, being fully empowered to give her away, by divorce, for this purpose;", "2127": "but a Lacedaemonian was accustomed to lend his wife for inter­ course with a friend, while she remained living in his house, and without the marriage being thereby dissolved.", "2128": "Many, we are told, even invited those who, they thought, would beget fine and noble children, to converse with the ir wives.", "2129": "The distinction between the two customs seems to be this :", "2130": "the Spartans affected an unconcern and insensi­ bility about a matter which excites most men to violent rage and jealousy;", "2131": "the Romans modestly veiled it by a legal contract which seems to admit how hard it is for a man to give up his wife to another.", "2132": "Moreover Numa's regulations about young girls were of a much more feminine and orderly nature, while those of Lykurgus were so highflown and unbecoming to women, as to have been the subject of notice by the poets, who call them Phainomerides, that is with bare thighs, as Ibykus says ;", "2133": "and they accuse them of lust, as Euripides says— “", "2134": "They stay not, as befits a maid, at home, But with young men in shameless dresses room.”", "2135": "For in truth the sides of the maiden's tunic were not fastened together at the skirt, and so flew open and exposed the thigh as they walked, which is most clearly alluded to in the lines of Sophokles— “", "2136": "She that wanders nigh, With scanty skirt that shows the thigh, A Spartan maiden fair and free, Hermione.\"", "2137": "On this account they are said to have become bolder than they should be, and to have first shown this spirit towards their husbands, ruling uncontrolled over their households, and afterwards in public matters, where they freely ex­ pressed their opinions upon the most important subjects.", "2138": "On the other hand, Numa preserved that respect and honour due from men to matrons which they had met with under Romulus, who paid them these honours to atone for having carried them off by force, but he im­ planted in them habits of modesty, sobriety, and silence, forbidding them even to touch wine, or to speak even when necessary except in their husbands' presence.", "2139": "It is stated that once, because a woman pleaded her own cause in the Forum, the Senate sent to ask the oracle what this strange event might portend for the state.", "2140": "A great proof of the obedience and modesty of the most part of them is the way in which the names of those who did any wrong is remembered.", "2141": "For, just as in Greece, historians record the names of those who first made war against their own kindred or murdered their parents, so the Romans tell us that the first man who put away his wife was Spurius Carvilius, nothing of the kind having happened in Rome for two hundred and thirty years from its foundation;", "2142": "and that the wife of Pinarius, Thaisea by name, was the first to quarrel with her mother-in-law Gegania in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus—so well and orderly were marriages arranged by this lawgiver.", "2143": "IV.", "2144": "The rest of their laws for the training and marriage of maidens agree with one another, although Lykurgus put off the time of marriage till they were full-grown, in order that their intercourse, demanded as it was by nature, mig1t produce love and friendship in the married pair rather than the dislike often experienced by aL immature child towards her husband, and also that their bodies might be better able to support the trials of child-bearing, which he regarded as the sole object of marriage ;", "2145": "whereas the Romans gave their daughters in marriage at the age of twelve years or even younger, thinking thus to hand over a girl to her husband pure and uncorrupt both in body and mind.", "2146": "It is clear that the former system is best for the mere production of children, and the latter for moulding consorts for life.", "2147": "But by his superintendence of the young, his collecting them into companies, his training and drill, with the table and exercises common to all, Lykurgus showed that he was immensely superior to Numa, who, like any commonplace lawgiver, left the whole training of the young in the hands of their fathers, regulated only by their caprice or needs ;", "2148": "so that whoever chose might bring up his son as a shipwright, a copper­ smith, or a musician, as though the citizens ought not from the very outset to direct their attention to one object, but were like people who have embarked in the same ship for various causes, who only in time of danger act together for the common advantage of all, and at other times pursue each his own private ends.", "2149": "Allowance must be made for ordinary lawgivers, who fail through want of power or of knowledge in establishing such a system;", "2150": "but no such excuse can be made for Numa, who was a wise man, and who was made king of a newly-created state which would not have opposed any of his designs.", "2151": "What could be of greater importance than to regulate the education of the young and so to train them that they might all become alike in their lives and all bear the same impress of virtue ?", "2152": "It was to this that Lykurgus owed the permanence of his laws;", "2153": "for he could not have trusted to the oaths which he made them take, if he had not by education and training so steeped the minds of the young in the spirit of his laws, and by his method of bringing them up implanted in them such a love for the state, that the most important of his enactments remained in force for more than five hundred years;", "2154": "for the lives of all Spartans seem to have been coloured by these laws.", "2155": "That which was the aim and end of Numa's policy, that Rome should be at peace and friendly with her neighbours, ceased immediately upon his death;", "2156": "at once the double­ gated temple, which he kept closed as if he really kept war locked up in it, had both its gates thrown open and filled Italy with slaughter.", "2157": "His excellent and righteous policy did not last for a moment, for the people were not educated to support it, and therefore it could not be lasting.", "2158": "But, it may be asked, did not Rome flourish by her wars?", "2159": "It is hard to answer such a question, in an age which values wealth, luxury, and dominion more than a gentle peaceful life that wrongs no one and suffices for itself.", "2160": "Yet this fact seems to tell for Lykurgus, that the Romans gained such an enormous increase of power by departing from Numa's policy, while the Lacedæmonians, as soon as they fell away from the discipline of Lykurgus, having been the haughtiest became the most contemptible of Greeks, and not only lost their supremacy, but had even to struggle for their bare existence.", "2161": "On the other hand, it was truly glorious for Numa that he was a stranger and sent for by the Romans to be their king;", "2162": "that he effected all his reforms without violence, and ruled a city composed of discordant elements without any armed force such as Lykurgus had to assist him, winning over all men and reducing them to order by his wisdom and justice.", "2163": "I.", "2164": "DIDYMUS the grammarian, in the book about Solon'a laws which he wrote in answer to Asklepiades, quotes a saying of one Philokles, that Solon was the son of Euphorion, which is quite at variance with the testimony of all other writers who have mentioned Solon:", "2165": "for they all say that he was the son of Exekestides, a man whose fortune and power were only moderate, but whose family was of the noblest in Athens ;", "2166": "for he was descended from Kodrus the last Athenian king.", "2167": "Herakleides of Pontus relates that the mother of Solon was first cousin to the mother of Peisistratus.", "2168": "The two boys, we are told, were friends when young, and when in after years they differed in politics they still never entertained harsh or angry feelings towards one another, but kept alive the sacred flame of their former intimate friendship.", "2169": "Peisistratus is even said to have dedicated the statue of Love in the Academy where those who are going to run in the sacred torch-race light their torches.", "2170": "II.", "2171": "According to Hermippus, Solon, finding that his father had by his generosity diminished his fortune, and feeling ashamed to be dependent upon others, when he himself was come of a house more accustomed to give than to receive, embarked in trade, although his friends were eager to supply him with all that he could wish for.", "2172": "Some, however, say that Solon travelled more with a view to gaining experience and learning than to making money.", "2173": "lie was indeed eager to learn, as he wrote when an old man, \" Old to grow, but ever learning,\" but disregarded wealth, for he wrote that he regarded as equally rich the man who owned “", "2174": "Gold and broad acres, corn and wine ;", "2175": "And he that hath but clothes and food, A wife, and youthful strength divine.\"", "2176": "Yet elsewhere he has written, but “ I long for wealth, not by fraud obtained, For curses wait on riches basely gained.”", "2177": "There is no reason for an upright statesman either to be over anxious for luxuries or to despise necessaries.", "2178": "At that period, as Hesiod tells us, “ Work was no disgrace,\" nor did trade carry any reproach, while the profession of travelling merchant was even honourable, as it civilised barbarous tribes, and gained the friendship of kings, and learned much in many lands.", "2179": "Some merchants founded great cities, as, for example, Protis, who was beloved by the Gauls living near the Rhone, founded Marseilles.", "2180": "It is also said that Thales the sage, and Hippocrates the mathe­ matician, travelled as merchants, and that Plato defrayed the expenses of his journey to

afterwards made the joke that Drakon's laws were not written with ink, but with blood.", "2400": "It is said that Drakon himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones.", "2401": "X VIII.", "2402": "In the next place, Solon, who wished to leave all magistracies as he found them, in the hands of the wealthy classes, but to give the people a share in the rest of the constitution, from which they were then excluded, took a census of the wealth of the citizens, and made a first class of those who had an annual income of not less than five hundred medimni of dry or liquid produce ;", "2403": "these he called Pentakosiomedimni.", "2404": "The next class were the Hippeis, or knights, consisting of those who were able to keep a horse, or who had an income of three hundred medimni.", "2405": "The third class were the Zeugitæ, whose property quali­ fication was two hundred medimni of dry or liquid produce ;", "2406": "and the last class were the Thetes, whom Solon did not permit to be magistrates, but whose only political privilege was the right of attending the public assemblies and sitting as jurymen in the law courts.", "2407": "This privilege was at first insignificant, but afterwards became of infinite im­ portance, because most disputes were settled before a jury.", "2408": "Even in those cases which he allowed the magistrates to settle, he provided a final appeal to the people.", "2409": "Solon moreover is said to have purposely worded his laws vaguely and with several interpretations, in order to increase the powers of these juries, because persons who could not settle their disputes by the letter of the law were obliged to have recourse to juries of the people, and to refer all disputes to them, as being to a certain extent above the laws.", "2410": "He himself notices this in the following verses:", "2411": "“ I gave the people all the strength they needed, Yet kept the power of the nobles strong;", "2412": "Thus each from other's violence I shielded, Not letting either do the other wrong.\"", "2413": "Thinking that the weakness of the populace required still further protection, he permitted any man to prosecute on behalf of any other who might be ill-treated.", "2414": "Thus if a man were struck or injured, any one else who was able and willing might prosecute on his behalf, and the law­ giver by this means endeavoured to make the whole body of citizens act together and feel as one.", "2415": "A saying of his is recorded which quite agrees with the spirit of this law.", "2416": "Being asked, what he thought was the best managed city ? “", "2417": "That,\" he answered, in which those who are not wronged espouse the cause of those who are, and punish their oppressors.", "2418": "\"XIX.", "2419": "He established the senate of the Areopagus of those who had held the yearly office of archon, and himself became a member of it because he had been archon.", "2420": "But in addition to this, observing that the people were becoming turbulent and unruly, in consequence of their relief from debt, he formed a second senate, consisting of a hundred men selected from each of the four tribes, to deliberate on measures in the first instance, and he per­ mitted no measures to be proposed before the general assembly, which had not been previously discussed in this senate.", "2421": "The upper senate he intended to exercise a general supervision, and to maintain the laws, and he thought that with these two senates as her anchors, the ship of the state would ride more securely, and that the people would be less inclined to disorder.", "2422": "Most writers say that Solon constituted the senate of the Areopagus, as is related above;", "2423": "and this view is supported by the fact that Dragon nowhere mentions or names the Areopagites, but in all cases of murder refers to the Ephetai.", "2424": "However, the eighth law on the thirteenth table of the laws of Solon runs thus :", "2425": "­\"", "2426": "All citizens who were disfranchised before the magis­ tracy of Solon shall resume their rights, except those who have been condemned by the Areopagus, or by the Ephetai, or by the king—archons, in the prytaneum, for murder or manslaughter, or attempts to overthrow the government and who were in exile when this law was made.", "2427": "\"This again proves that the senate of the Areopagus existed before the time of Solon;", "2428": "for who could those persons be who were condemned by the court of the Areo­ pagus, if Solon was the first who gave the senate of the Areopagus a criminal jurisdiction ;", "2429": "though perhaps some words have been left out, or indistinctly written, and the law means \" all those who had been condemned on the charges which now are judged by the court of the Areo­ pagus, the Ephetai, or the Prytanies, when this law was made, must remain disfranchised, though the others become enfranchised ? \"", "2430": "Of these explanations the reader himself must consider which he prefers.", "2431": "XX.", "2432": "The strangest of his remaining laws is that which declared disfranchised a citizen who in a party conflict took neither side ;", "2433": "apparently his object was to prevent any one regarding home politics in a listless, uninterested fashion, securing his own personal property, and priding himself upon exemption from the misfortunes of his country, and to encourage men boldly to attach themselves to the right party and to share all its dangers, rather than in safety to watch and see which side would be successful.", "2434": "That also is a strange and even ludicrous provision in one of his laws, which permits an heiress, whose husband proves impotent, to avail herself of the services of the next of kin to obtain an heir to her estate.", "2435": "Some, however, say that this law rightly serves men who know themselves to be unfit for marriage, and who nevertheless marry heiresses for their money, and try to make the laws override nature ;", "2436": "for, when they see their wife having intercourse with whom she pleases, they will either break off the marriage, or live in constant shame, and so pay the penalty of their avarice and wrong-doing.", "2437": "It is a good provision also, that the heiress may not converse with any one, but only with him whom she may choose from among her husband's relations, so that her offspring may be all in the family.", "2438": "This is pointed at by his ordinance that the bride and bridegroom should be shut in the same room and eat a quince together, and that the husband of an heiress should approach her at least thrice in each month.", "2439": "For even if no children are born, still this is a mark of respect to a good wife, and puts an end to many misunderstandings, preventing their leading to an actual quarrel.", "2440": "In other marriages he suppressed dowries, and ordered the bride to bring to her husband three dresses and a few articles of furniture of no great value;", "2441": "for he did not wish marriages to be treated as money bargains or means of gain, but that men and women should enter into marriage for love and happiness and procreation of children.", "2442": "Diony.", "2443": "sius, the despot of Syracuse, when his mother wished to be married to a young citizen, told her that he had indeed broken the laws of the state when he seized the throne, but that he could not disregard the laws of nature so far as to countenance such a monstrous union.", "2444": "These dispropor­ tioned matches ought not to be permitted in any state, nor should men be allowed to form unequal loveless alliances, which are in no sense true marriages.", "2445": "A magistrate or lawgiver might well address an old man who marries a young girl in the words of Sophokles:", "2446": "“ Poor wretch, a hopeful bridegroom you will be;", "2447": "\" and if he found a young man fattening like a partridge in the house of a rich old woman, he ought to transfer him to some young maiden who is without a husband.", "2448": "So much for this subject.", "2449": "XXI.", "2450": "Besides these, Solon's law which forbids men to speak evil of the dead is much praised.", "2451": "It is good to think of the departed as sacred, and it is only just to refrain from attacking the absent, while it is politic, also, to prevent hatred from being eternal.", "2452": "He also forbade people to speak evil of the living in temples, courts of justice, public buildings, or during the national games;", "2453": "and imposed a fine of three drachmas to the person offended, and two to the state.", "2454": "His reason for this was that it shows a violent and uncultivated nature not to be able to restrain one's passion in certain places and at certain times, although it is hard to do so always, and to some persons impossible;", "2455": "and a legislator should frame his laws with a view to what he can reasonably hope to effect, and rather correct a few persons usefully than punish a number to no purpose.", "2456": "He gained credit also by his law about wills.", "2457": "Before his time these were not permitted at Athens, but the money and lands of a deceased person were inherited by his family in all cases.", "2458": "Solon, however, permitted any one who had no children to leave his property to whom he would, honouring friendship more than nearness of kin, and giving a man absolute power to dispose of his inheri­ tance.", "2459": "Yet, on the other hand, he did not permit legacies to be given without any restrictions, but disallowed all that were obtained by the effects of disease or by adminis­ tration of drugs to the testator, or by imprisonment and violence, or by the solicitations of his wife, as he rightly considered that to be persuaded by one's wife against one's better judgment is the same as to submit to force.", "2460": "For Solon held that a man's reason was perverted by deceit as much as by violence, and by pleasure no less than by pain.", "2461": "He regulated, moreover, the journeys of the women, and their mournings and festivals.", "2462": "A woman was not allowed to travel with more than three dresses, nor with more than an obolus' worth of food or drink, nor a basket more than a cubit in length ;", "2463": "nor was she to travel at night, except in a waggon with a light carried in front of it.", "2464": "He abolished the habits of tearing themselves at funerals, and of reciting set forms of dirges, and of hiring mourners.", "2465": "He also for­ bade them to sacrifice an ox for the funeral feast, and to bury more than three garments with the body, and to visit other persons' graves.", "2466": "Most of these things are forbidden by our own laws also;", "2467": "with the addition, that by our laws those who offend thus are fined by the gynæconomi, or regulators of the women, for giving way to unmanly and womanish sorrow.", "2468": "XXII.", "2469": "Observing that the city was filled with men who came from all countries to take refuge in Attica, that the country was for the most part poor and unproductive, and that merchants also are unwilling to despatch cargoes to a country which has nothing to export, he encouraged his countrymen to embark in trade, and made a law that a son was not obliged to support his father, if his father had not taught him a trade.", "2470": "As for Lykurgus, whose city was clear of strangers, and whose land was \" unstinted, and with room for twice the number,\" as Euripides says, and who above all had all the Helots, throughout Lacedaemon, who were best kept employed, in order to break their spirit by labour and hardship, it was very well that his citizens should disdain laborious handicrafts and devote their whole attention to the art of war.", "2471": "But Solon had not the power to change the whole life of his countrymen by his laws, but rather was forced to suit his laws to existing circumstances, and, as he saw that the soil was so poor that it could only suffice for the farmers, and was unable to feed a mass of idle people as well, he gave great honour to trade, and gave powers to the senate of the Areopagus to inquire what each man's source of income might be, and to punish the idle.", "2472": "A harsher measure was that of which we are told by Herakleides of Pontus, his making it unnecessary for illegitimate chil­ dren to maintain their father.", "2473": "Yet if a man abstains from an honourable marriage, and lives with a woman more for his own pleasure in her society than with a view to producing a family, he is rightly served, and cannot upbraid his children with neglecting him, because he has made their birth their reproach.", "2474": "XXIII.", "2475": "Altogether Solon's laws concerning women are very strange.", "2476": "He permitted a husband to kill an adulterer taken in the act;", "2477": "but if any one carried off a free woman and forced her, he assessed the penalty at one hundred drachmas.", "2478": "If he obtained her favours by persuasion, he was to pay twenty drachmas, except in the case of those who openly ply for hire, alluding to harlots;", "2479": "for they come to those who offer them money without any conceal­ ment.", "2480": "Moreover, he forbade men to sell their sisters and daughters, except in the case of unchastity.", "2481": "Now to punish the same offence at one time with unrelenting severity, and at another in a light and trifling manner, by imposing so slight a fine, is unreasonable, unless the scarcity of specie in the city at that period made fines which were paid in money more valuable than they would now be;", "2482": "indeed, in the valuation of things for sacrifice, a sheep and a drachma were reckoned as each equal to a medimnus of corn.", "2483": "To the victor at the Isthmian games he appointed a reward of a hundred drachmas, and to the victor in the Olympian, five hundred.", "2484": "He gave five drachmas for every wolf that was killed, and one drachma for every wolf's whelp;", "2485": "and we are told by Demetrius of Phalerum that the first of these sums was the price of an ox, and the second that of a sheep.", "2486": "The prices of choice victims, which he settled in his sixteenth tablet of laws, would naturally be higher than those of ordinary beasts, but even thus they are cheap compared with prices at the present day.", "2487": "It was an ancient practice among the Athenians to destroy the wolves, because their country was bettor fitted for pasture than for growing crops.", "2488": "Some say that the Athenian tribes derive their names, not from the sons of Ion, but from the different professions in which men were then divided:", "2489": "thus the fighting men were named Hoplites, and the tradesmen Ergadeis;", "2490": "the two remaining ones being the Geleontes, or farmers, and the Aigikoreis, or goat-herds and graziers.", "2491": "With regard to water, as the country is not supplied with either rivers or lakes, but the people depend chiefly upon artificial wells, he made a law, that wherever there was a public well within four furlongs, people should use it, but if it were farther off, then they must dig a private well for themselves;", "2492": "but if a man dug a depth of sixty feet on his own estate without finding water, then he was to have the right of filling a six-gallon pitcher twice a day at his neighbour's well;", "2493": "for Solon thought it right to help the distressed, and yet not to encourage laziness.", "2494": "He also made very judicious regu­ lations about planting trees, ordering that they should not be planted within five feet of a neighbour's property, except in the case of olives and fig-trees, which were not to be planted within nine feet;", "2495": "for these trees spread out their roots farther than others, and spoil the growth of any others by taking away their nourishment and by giving off hurtful juices.", "2496": "Trenches and pits he ordered to be dug as far away from another man's property as they were deep;", "2497": "and no hive of bees was to be placed within three hundred feet of those already established by another man.", "2498": "XXIV.", "2499": "Oil was the only product of the country which he allowed to be exported, everything else being forbidden;", "2500": "and he ordered that if any one broke this law the archon was to solemnly curse him, unless he paid a hundred drachmas into the public treasury.", "2501": "This law is written on the first of his tablets.", "2502": "From this we see that the old story is not altogether incredible, that the export of figs was forbidden, and that the men who informed against those who had done so were therefore called sycophants.", "2503": "He also made laws about damage received from animals, one of which was that a dog who had bitten a man should be delivered up to him tied to a stick three cubits long, an ingenious device for safety.", "2504": "One is astounded at his law of adopting foreigners into the state, which permits no one to become a full citizen in Athens unless he be either exiled for life from his native city, or transfers himself with his whole family to Athens to practise his trade there.", "2505": "It is said that his object in this was not so much to exclude other classes of people from the city, as to assure these of a safe refuge there;", "2506": "and these he thought would be good and faithful citizens, because the former had been banished from their own country, and the latter had abandoned it of their own freewill.", "2507": "Another peculiarity of Solon's laws was the public dining-table in the prytaneum.", "2508": "Here he did not allow the same person to dine often, while he punished the man who was invited and would not come, because the one seemed gluttonous, and the other contemptuous.", "2509": "XXV.", "2510": "He ordered that all his laws should remain in force for a hundred years, and he wrote them upon triangular wooden tablets, which revolved upon an axis in oblong recesses, some small remains of which have been preserved in the prytaneum down to the present day.", "2511": "These, we are told by Aristotle, were called Kurbeis.", "2512": "The comic poet Kratinus also says, “ By Solon and by Draco, mighty legislators once, Whose tablets light the fire now to warm a dish of pulse.\"", "2513": "Some say that the term Kurbeis is only applied to those on which are written the laws which regulate religious matters.", "2514": "The senate swore by a collective oath that it would enforce Solon's laws;", "2515": "and each of the Thesmothetæ took an oath to the same effect at the altar in the market-place, protesting that, if he transgressed any of the laws, he would offer a golden statue as big as himself to the temple at Delphi.", "2516": "Observing the irregularity of the months, and that the motions of the moon did not accord either with the rising or setting of the sun, but that frequently she in the same day overtakes and passes by him, he ordered that day to be called \" the old and the new,\"

of Homer— \"", "2517": "The old month ended and the new began.\"", "2518": "He called the next day that of the new moon.", "2519": "After the twentieth, he no longer reckoned forwards, but backwards, as the moon decreased, until the thirtieth of the month.", "2520": "When Solon had passed all his laws, as people came to him every day to praise or blame, or advise him to add or take away from what he had written, while innumerable people wanted to ask questions, and discuss points, and kept bidding him explain what was the object of this or that regulation, he, feeling that he could not do all this, and that, if he did not, his motives would be misunderstood;", "2521": "wishing, moreover, to escape from troubles and the criticism and fault-finding of his countrymen [for, as he himself writes, it is “ Hard in great measures every one to please \"], made his private commercial business an excuse for leaving the country, and set sail after having obtained from the Athenians leave of absence for ten years.", "2522": "In this time he thought they would become used to his laws.", "2523": "XXVI.", "2524": "He first went to Egypt, where he spent some time, as he himself says, \" At Nilus' outlets, by Canopus' strand.\"", "2525": "And he also discussed points of philosophy with Psenophis of Heliopolis, and with Sonchis of Sais, the most dis­ tinguished of the Egyptian priests.", "2526": "From them he heard the tale of the island Atlantis, as we are told by Plato, and endeavoured to translate it into a poetical form for the enjoyment of his countrymen.", "2527": "He next sailed to Cyprus, where he was warmly received by Philocyprus, one of the local sovereigns, who ruled over a small city founded by Demophon, the son of Theseus, near the river Klarius, in a position which was easily defended, but inconvenient.", "2528": "As a fair plain lay below, Solon persuaded him to remove the city to a pleasanter and less contracted site, and himself personally superintended the building of the new city, which he arranged so well both for convenience and safety, that many new settlers joined Philocyprus, and he was envied by the neighbouring kings.", "2529": "For this reason, in honour of Solon, he named the new city Soloi, the name of the old one having been Aipeia.", "2530": "Solon himself mentions this event, in one of his elegiac poems, in which he addresses Philocyprus, saying­ “ Long may'st thou reign, Ruling thy race from Soloi's throne with glory, But me may Venus of the violet crown Send safe away from Cyprus famed in story.", "2531": "May Heaven to

invention.", "2534": "But I cannot think that so famous a story, which is confirmed by so many writers, and, moreover, which so truly exhibits Solon's greatness of mind and wisdom, ought to be given up because of the so-called rules of chronology, which have been discussed by innumerable persons, up to the present day, without their being ever able to make their dates agree.", "2535": "The story goes that Solon at Crœsus's desire came to Sardis, and there felt much like a continental when he goes down to the seaside for the first time;", "2536": "for he thinks each river he comes to must be the sea, and so Solon, as he walked through the court and saw many of the courtiers richly attired and each of them swaggering about with a train of attendants and body-guards, thought that each one must be the king, until he was brought before the king himself, who, as far as precious stones, richly dyed clothes, and cunningly worked gold could adorn him, was splendid and admirable, indeed a grand and gorgeous spectacle to behold.", "2537": "When Solon was brought into his presence, he showed none of the feelings and made none of the remarks about the sight, which Crœsus expected, but evidently despised such vulgar ostentation.", "2538": "Crœsus then ordered his treasures to be exhibited to him, and all the rest of his possessions and valuables ;", "2539": "not that Solon needed this, for the sight of Crœsus himself was enough to show him what sort of man he was.", "2540": "When, after having seen all this, he was again brought before the king, Crœsus asked him whether he knew any man more happy than himself.", "2541": "Solon at once answered that one Tellus, a fellow-country­ man of his own, was more happy.", "2542": "He explained that Tellus was a good man, and left a family of good sons;", "2543": "that he passed his life beyond the reach of want, and died gloriously in battle for his country.", "2544": "At this, Crœsus began to think that Solon must be a cross-grained churlish fellow, if he did not measure happiness by silver and gold, but preferred the life and death of some private man of low degree to such power and empire as his.", "2545": "However, he asked him a second time, whether he knew any one more happy than himself, next to Tellus.", "2546": "Solon answered that he knew two men, Kleobis and Biton, remarkable for their love for each other and for their mother, who, as the oxen that drew their mother travelled slowly, put themselves under the yoke and drew the carriage with her in it to the temple of Here.", "2547": "She was congratulated by all the citizens, and was very proud of them;", "2548": "and they offered sacrifice, drank some wine, and then passed away by a painless death after so much glory.\"", "2549":

rich held back from cowardice, he went away, after saying that he was wiser than the one class, and braver than the other;", "2594": "wiser, namely, than those who did not understand what was going on, and braver than those who did understand, but did not dare to oppose the despotism with which they were threatened.", "2595": "The people carried the proposal, and would not be so mean as to make any stipulation with Peisistratus about the number of his body-guard, but permitted him to keep as many as he pleased until he seized the Acropolis.", "2596": "When this took place, the city was convulsed;", "2597": "Megakles and the other descendants of Alkmæon fled, but Solon, although he was now very old and had no one to stand by him, never­ theless came into the market-place and addressed the citi­ zens, reproaching them for their folly and remissness, and urging them to make a final effort to retain their freedom.", "2598": "It was then that he made the memorable remark that, in former days it would have been easier for them to have prevented despotism from appearing amongst them, but that now it would be more glorious to cut it down, when it had arrived at its full growth.", "2599": "However, as no one listened to him, because of the general terror, he went home, armed himself, and took his post in the street out­ side his door, saying, “ I have done all I could for my country and her laws.\"", "2600": "After this he remained quiet, though his friends urged him to leave Athens.", "2601": "He, how­ ever, wrote poems reproaching the Athenians— “", "2602": "Through your own cowardice you suffered wrong, Blame then yourselves and not the gods for this;", "2603": "'Twas you yourselves that made the tyrant strong, And rightly do you now your freedom miss.", "2604": "\"XXXI.", "2605": "At this many of his friends told him that the despot would surely put him to death, and when they asked him what he trusted to, that he performed such mad freaks, he answered, \" To my age.\"", "2606": "But Peisistratus, after he became established as sovereign, showed such marked favour to Solon that he even was advised by him, and received his approval in several cases.", "2607": "For he enforced most of Solon's laws, both observing them himself and obliging his friends to do so.", "2608": "Indeed, when accused of murder before the court of the Areopagus, he appeared in due form to stand his trial, but his accuser let the case fall through.", "2609": "He also made other laws himself, one of which is that those who are maimed in war shall be kept at the public expense.", "2610": "Herakleides says that this was done in imitation of Solon, who had already proposed it in the case of Thersippus.", "2611": "But Theophrastus tells us that it was not Solon, but Peisistratus, who made the law about idleness, by means of which he rendered the city more quiet, and the country better cultivated.", "2612": "Solon also attempted to write a great poem about the fable of ‘ Atlantis,’ which he had learned from the chroniclers of Sais particularly concerned the Athenians, but he did not finish it, not, as Plato says, for want of leisure, but rather because of his advanced age, which made him fear that the task was too great for him.", "2613": "His own words tell us that he had abundance of leisure — “", "2614": "Old I grow, but ever learning,\" and, “ Venus and Bacchus are all my care, And the Muses, that charm the hearts of men.\"", "2615": "Plato eagerly took in hand the scheme of the Atlantis,’ as though it were a fine site for a palace, which had come to be his by inheritance, still unbuilt on.", "2616": "He placed in the beginning of it such splendid entrance-halls and vestibules as we find in no other tale or legend or poem, but, as he began the work too late, he died before he was able to finish it;", "2617": "so that the more we enjoy what he has written, the more we grieve over what is lost.", "2618": "As the temple of Olympic Zeus among the temples of Athens, so the ‘ Atlantis' is the only one among Plato's many noble writings that is unfinished.", "2619": "Solon lived on into the reign of Peisistratus for a long time, according to Herakleides of Pontus, but less than two years, according to Phanias of Eresus.", "2620": "For Peisistratus became despot in the archonship of Komius, and Phanias tells us that Solon died during the archonship of Hegesistratus, Komias' successor.", "2621": "The story that his ashes were scattered round the island of Salamis is legendary and improbable, yet it is confirmed by many trustworthy writers, amongst whom is the philosophei Aristotle.", "2622": "I.", "2623": "As a parallel to Solon we shall take Poplicola, who was honoured with this name by the Romans, his original name having been Publius Valerius, a supposed descendant of that Valerius who in ancient times was especially instrumental in making the Romans and Sabines cease to be enemies and become one people;", "2624": "for it was he who persuaded the two kings to meet and make terms of peace.", "2625": "Valerius, a descendant of this hero, was a man of eminence in Rome, which was then ruled by the kings, because of his eloquence and wealth.", "2626": "He always spoke boldly on the side of justice, and assisted the poor and needy with such kindness that it was clear that, in case of a revolution, he would become the first man in the state.", "2627": "Tarquinius Superbus, the king, had not come to his throne justly, but by wicked and lawless violence, and as he reigned tyrannically and insolently, the people hated him, and seized the opportunity of the death of Lucretia, after her dishonour, to drive him out.", "2628": "Lucius Brutus, who was determined to change the form of government, applied to Valerius first of all, and with his vigorous assistance drove out the king.", "2629": "After these events Valerius kept quiet, as long as it seemed likely that the people would choose a single general to replace their king, because he thought that it was Brutus's right to be elected, as he had been the leader of the revolution.", "2630": "How­ ever the people, disgusted with the idea of monarchy, and thinking that they could more easily endure to be ruled by two men, proposed that two consuls should be chosen.", "2631": "Valerius now became a candidate, hoping that he and Brutus would be elected ;", "2632": "but he was not chosen.", "2633": "Brutus, instead of Valerius, whom he would have preferred, had as a colleague Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, who was not a better man than Valerius, but was elected because the men in power at Rome, seeing what intrigues the exiled king was setting on foot to secure his return, wished to have for their general a man who was his sworn personal enemy.", "2634": "II.", "2635": "Valerius, disgusted at the idea that he was not trusted to fight for his country because he had not suffered any personal wrong at the hands of the king, left the senate, refused to attend public meetings, and ceased to take any part whatever in public affairs, so that people began to fear that in his rage he might go over to the king's party and destroy the tottering edifice of Roman liberty.", "2636": "Brutus suspected some others besides him, and proposed on a certain day to hold a solemn sacrifice and bind the senate by an oath.", "2637": "Valerius, however, camo cheerfully into the Forum, and was the first to swear that he would never yield anything to the Tarquins, but would fight for liberty to the death, by which he greatly delighted the senate and encouraged the leading men of the state.", "2638": "His acts too, immediately confirmed his words, for ambassadors came from Tarquin with specious and seductive proposals, such as he thought would win over the people, coming from a king who seemed to have laid aside his insolence and only to wish for his just rights.", "2639": "The consuls thought it right that these proposals should be laid before the people, but Valerius would not permit it, not wishing that the poorer citizens, to whom the war was a greater burden than the monarchy had been, should have any excuse for revolt.", "2640": "III.", "2641": "After this came other ambassadors, announcing that Tarquin would give up his throne, put an end to the war, and only ask for his own property and that of his relatives and friends, upon which to live in exile.", "2642": "Many were inclined to agree to this, and amongst them Col­ latinus, when Brutus, an inflexible and harsh-tempered man, rushed into the Forum, calling out that his colleague was a traitor, who wished to furnish the tyrant with the means of continuing the war and recovering his throne, when he ought rather to grudge him food to keep him from starving.", "2643": "The citizens assembled, and Caius Minucius, a private citizen, was the first man who ad­ dressed them, encouraging Brutus, and pointing out to the Romans how much better it was that the money should be used to help them than to help their enemies.", "2644": "In spite of this, however, the Romans decided that, as they now possessed the liberty for which they had fought, they would not lose the additional blessing of peace for the sake of this property, but would cast it from them after the tyrant to which it belonged.", "2645": "Tarquin really cared little for the property, and the demand was merely made in order to sound the people and arrange a plot for the betrayal of the state, which was managed by the ambassadors whom he had nominally sent to look after his property.", "2646": "These men were selling some part of it, keeping some safe, and sending some of it away, and meanwhile intrigued so successfully that they won over two of the best families in Rome, that of the Aquillii, in which were three senators, and that of the Vitellii, among whom were two.", "2647": "All these men were, on the mother's side, nephews of the consul Collatinus, and the Vitellii were also related to Brutus, for he had married their sister, and by her had a large family.", "2648": "The Vitellii, being relatives and intimate friends of the two elder sons of Brutus, induced them to take part in the conspiracy, holding out to them the hope that they might ally them­ selves to the great house of Tarquin, soon to be restored to the throne, and would rid themselves of their father's stupidity and harshness.", "2649": "By harshness, they alluded to his inexorable punishment of bad men, and the stupidity was that which he himself affected for a long time, in order to conceal his real character from the tyrant, which was made matter of reproach to him afterwards.", "2650": "IV.", "2651": "So, after they had persuaded these young men, they conferred again with the Aquillii, and determined that all the conspirators should swear a great and terrible oath, in which a man is killed, and each person then pours a libation of his blood, and touches his entrails.", "2652": "The room in which they meant to do this was, as may be supposed, a dark and half-ruined one.", "2653": "Now a servant of the name of Vindicius happened to conceal himself in it;", "2654": "not that he had any designs or any knowledge of what was going on, but chancing to be in the room when the conspirators solemnly entered, he was afraid of being detected there, and so hid himself behind a chest, where he could see what was done and hear what was said by them.", "2655": "They agreed to assassinate both consuls, and wrote a letter to Tarquin acquainting him with their determination, which they gave to the ambassadors, who were lodging in the house of the Aquillii as their guests, and were present at this scene.", "2656": "After this they dispersed, and Vindicius came out from his hiding-place.", "2657": "He was at a loss what use to make of the discovery which Fortune had thrown in his way, for he thought it a shocking thing, as indeed it was, for him to make such a fearful revelation to Brutus about his sons, or to Collatinus about his nephews, and he would not trust any private citizen with a secret of such impor­ tance.", "2658": "Tormented by his secret, and unable to remain quiet, he addressed himself to Valerius, chiefly moved to do so by his affable kindly temper;", "2659": "for his house was open all day to those who wished to speak with him, and he never refused an interview or rejected a poor man's petition.", "2660": "V.", "2661": "When, then, Vindicius came before him and told him all that he knew in the presence only of his wife and his brother Marcus, Valerius was astounded and horrified.", "2662": "He would not let the man go, but locked him up, set his wife to guard the door, and bade his brother to surround the king's quarters, to seize the letter, if possible, keeping a strict watch over all the servants there.", "2663": "He himself, with a large train of clients friends and servants, went to the house of the Aquillii, who were not within.", "2664": "As no one expected him, he pushed into the house and found the letter lying in the ambassadors' apartments.", "2665": "While he was thus employed, the Aquillii returned in haste, and assembling a force at the door endeavoured to take away the letter from him.", "2666": "His own party came to his assistance, and with their gowns twisted round their necks with much buffeting made their way to the Forum.", "2667": "The same thing happened at the king's quarters, where Marcus laid hold of another letter which was being taken thither concealed among some baggage, and brought as many of the king's party as he could into the Forum.", "2668": "VI.", "2669": "When the consuls had put a stop to the confusion, Vindicius, at Valerius's command, was brought out of his prison, and a court was held.", "2670": "The letters were recognised, and the culprits had nothing to say for themselves.", "2671": "All were silent and downcast, and a few, thinking to please Brutus, hinted at banishment as the penalty of their crime.", "2672": "Collatinus by his tears, and Valerius by his silence gave them hopes of mercy.", "2673": "But Brutus, addressing each of his sons by name, said, “ Come, Titus, come Tiberius, why do you make no answer to the charges against you?\"", "2674": "As, after being asked thrice, they made no answer, he, turning his face to the lictors, said, \" I have done my work, do yours.\"", "2675": "They immediately seized upon the young men, tore off their clothes, tied their hands behind their backs, and scourged them.", "2676": "Although the people had not the heart to look at so dreadful a sight, yet it is said that Brutus never turned away his head, and showed no pity on his stern countenance, but sat savagely looking on at the execution of his sons until at last they were laid on the ground and their heads severed with an axe.", "2677": "Then he handed over the rest of the culprits to be dealt with by his colleague, rose, and left the Forum.", "2678": "His conduct cannot be praised, and yet it is above censure.", "2679": "Either virtue in his mind overpowered every other feeling, or his sorrow was so great as to produce insensibility.", "2680": "In neither case was there anything unworthy, or even human in his conduct, but it was either that of a god or a brute beast.", "2681": "It is better, however, that we should speak in praise of so great a man rather than allow our weakness to distrust his virtue.", "2682": "Indeed the Romans think that even the foundation of the city by Romulus was not so great an event as the confirmation of its constitution by Brutus.", "2683": "VII.", "2684": "When he left the Forum all men were silent for a long while, shuddering at what had been done.", "2685": "The Aquillii took heart at the mildness of Collatinus, and asked for time to prepare their defence.", "2686": "They also begged that Vindicius might be given up to them, because he was their servant, and ought not to be on the side of their accusers.", "2687": "Collatinus was willing to allow this, but Valerius said that he was not able to give the man up, because he was sur­ rounded by so large a crowd, and called upon the people not to disperse without punishing the traitors.", "2688": "At last he laid his hands upon the two corpses, called for Brutus, and reproached Collatinus for making his colleague act against nature by condemning his own sons to death, and then thinking to please the wives of these traitors and public enemies by saving tkeir lives.", "2689": "The consul, vexed at this, ordered the lictors to seize Vindicius.", "2690": "They forced their way through the crowd, tried to lay hold of him, and struck those who defended him, but the friends of Valerius stood in front of him and beat them off, and the people raised a shout for Brutus.", "2691": "He returned, and when silence was restored said that he had, as a father, full power to condemn his sons to death, but that as for the other culprits, their fate should be decided by the free vote of the citizens, and that any one might come forward and address the people.", "2692": "The people, however, would listen to no speeches, but voted unanimously for their death, and they were all beheaded.", "2693": "Collatinus, it seems, had been viewed with suspicion before because of his connection with the royal family, and his second name, Tarquinius, was odious to the people.", "2694": "After these events, having utterly failed as consul, he voluntarily laid down that office, and left the city.", "2695": "So now there was another election, and Valerius received the due reward of his patriotism and was gloriously made consul.", "2696": "Thinking that Vindicius ought to receive something for his services, he made him a freedman, the first ever made in Rome, and allowed him to vote in whatever tribe he chose to be enrolled.", "2697": "The other freedmen were not allowed the suffrage till, long after, it was given them by Appius to obtain popularity among them.", "2698": "The whole ceremony is up to the present day called vindicta, after Vindicius, we are told.'TII.", "2699": "After this they allowed the king's property to be plundered, and destroyed the palace.", "2700": "Tarquinius had obtained the pleasantest part of the Field of Mars, and had consecrated it to that god.", "2701": "This field had just been cut, and the corn lay on the ground, for the people thought that they must not thresh it or make any use of it, because of the ground being consecrated, so they took the sheaves and threw them into the river.", "2702": "In the same way they cut down the trees and threw them in, leaving the whole place for the god, but uncultivated and unfruitful.", "2703": "As there were many things of different sorts all floating together in the river, the current did not carry them far, but when the first masses settled on a shallow place, the rest which were carried down upon them could not get past, but became heaped up there, and the stream compacted them securely by the mud which it deposited upon them, not only increas­ ing the size of the whole mass, but firmly cementing it together.", "2704": "The waves did not shake it, but gently beat it into a solid consistency.", "2705": "Now, from its size, it began to receive additions, as most of what the river brought down settled upon it.", "2706": "It is now a sacred island close by the city, with temples and walks, and in the Latin tongue it has a name which means \" between two bridges.\"", "2707": "Some state that this did not happen when Tarquinia's field was consecrated, but in later times when Tarquinia gave up another field next to that one, for the public use.", "2708": "This Tarquinia was a priestess, one of the Vestal virgins, and she was greatly honoured for having done so, and was allowed to appear as a witness in court, which no other woman could do;", "2709": "she also was permitted to marry, by a decree of the senate, but did not avail herself of it.", "2710": "These are the legends which they tell about this island.", "2711": "IX.", "2712": "Tarquin now gave up all hopes of recovering his throne by intrigue, and appealed to the Etruscans, who willingly espoused his cause and endeavoured to restore him with a great army.", "2713": "The consuls led out the Romans to fight against them, posting them in holy places one of which is called the Arsian grove, and another the iEsuvian meadow.", "2714": "When they were about to join battle, Aruns, the son of Tarquin, and Brutus, the Roman consul, attacked one another, not by chance, but with fell hatred and rage, the one urging his horse against the tyrant and enemy of his country, the other against the man who drove him into exile.", "2715": "Falling upon one another with more fury than judgment, they made no attempt to defend themselves, but only to strike, and both perished.", "2716": "The struggle, so terribly begun, was continued with equal ferocity on both sides, until the armies, after great losses, were separated by a tempest.", "2717": "Valerius, was in great straits, not know­ ing how the battle had gone, and observing that his soldiers were despondent when they looked at the corpses of their comrades, and elated when they saw those of the enemy, so equal and undecided had been the slaughter.", "2718": "Yet each side, when it viewed its own dead close by, was more inclined to own itself defeated, than to claim the victory because of the supposed losses of the enemy.", "2719": "Night came on, and it was spent as may be imagined by men who had fought so hard.", "2720": "When all was quiet in both camps, we are told that the grove was shaken, and that from it proceeded a loud voice which declared that the Etruscans had lost one man more than the Romans.", "2721": "Apparently it was the voice of a god;", "2722": "for immediately the Romans raised a bold and joyous shout, and the Etruscans, panic-stricken, ran out of their camp and dis­ persed.", "2723": "The Romans attacked the camp, took prisoners all that were left in it, something less than five thousand, and plundered it.", "2724": "The dead, when counted, proved to be eleven thousand three hundred of the enemy, and of the Romans the same number save one.", "2725": "This battle is said to have been fought on the Calends of March.", "2726": "Valerius triumphed after it in a four-horse chariot, being the first consul that ever did so.", "2727": "And it was a magnificent sight, and did not, as some say, ofiend the spectators;", "2728": "for, if so, the habit of doing it would not have been so carefully kept up for so many years.", "2729": "The people were also pleased with the honours which Valerius paid to his colleague in arranging a splended funeral for him;", "2730": "he also pronounced a funeral oration over him, which was so much approved of by the Romans that from that day forth it became the custom for all good and great men at their deaths to have an oration made over them by the leading men of the time.", "2731": "This is said to have been older even than the Greek funeral orations, unless, as Anaximenes tells us, Solon introduced this custom.X.", "2732": "But the people were vexed and angry, because though Brutus, whom they thought the author of their liberty, would not be consul alone, but had one colleague ufter another, yet \" Valerius,\" they said, “ has got all power into his own hands, and is not so much the heir of the consulship of Brutus as of the tyranny of Tarquin.", "2733": "And what use is it for him to praise Brutus while he imitates Tarquin in his deeds, swaggering down into the Forum with all the rods and axes before him, from a house larger than the king's palace used to be.\"", "2734": "Indeed, Valerius lived in rather too splendid a house on the Velian Hill, looking down into the Forum, and difficult to climb up to, so that when he walked down from it he did indeed look like a tragedy king leaving his palace.", "2735": "But now he proved how valuable a thing it is for a statesman engaged in important matters to keep his ears open to the truth, and shut against flattery.", "2736": "Hearing from his friends what the people thought of him, he did not argue or grieve at it, but suddenly assembled a number of workmen and during the night destroyed his entire house down to the very foundations, so that on the next day the Romans collected in crowds to see it, admiring the magnanimity of the man, but sorrowing at the destruction of so great and noble a house, which, like many a man, had been put to death undeservedly, and expressing their concern for their consul, who had no house to live in.", "2737": "Valerius, indeed, had to be entertained by his friends, until the people gave him a site and built him a house upon it, of more moderate proportions than the other, in the place where at the present day stands the temple of Vica Pota.", "2738": "Wish­ ing to make not only himself but his office cease to be an object of terror to his countrymen, he removed the axes from the bundles of rods carried by the lictors, and when he entered the assembly of the people he ordered his fasces to be bowed and lowered before them, to show respect to the majesty of the people.", "2739": "This custom the consuls observe to this day.", "2740": "By these acts he did not really humble himself as he appeared to the Romans to be doing, but he so completely destroyed any illwill which had been felt against him that by giving up the semblance of power he really gained the reality, as the people were eager to serve him and obey him.", "2741": "For this reason they sur­ named him Poplicola, which means \" lover of the people,\" and this name so took the place of his former one that we shall use it during the remainder of this account of his life.", "2742": "XI.", "2743": "He permitted any one to become a candidate for the consulship;", "2744": "and while he was sole consul he used his power to effect the greatest of his reforms, because he did not know who his new colleague might be, and whether he would not thwart him through ignorance or illwill.", "2745": "First of all he brought up the senate to its proper number, for many senators had perished, some at Tarquin's hands in former years, and some in the late battle.", "2746": "It is said that he elected no less than a hundred and sixty-four new senators.", "2747": "After this, he enacted laws which greatly added to the power of the people, the first one of which gave accused persons a power of appeal from the decision of the consuls to the people.", "2748": "The second appointed the penalty of death to those who entered upon any public office without the consent of the people.", "2749": "The third was to assist the poor, as it relieved them from taxes and enabled them all to apply themselves with greater assiduity to trade.", "2750": "The law, too, which he en­ acted about disobedience to the consuls is no less popular in its spirit, and favours the people more than the great nobles.", "2751": "He assessed the fine for disobedience at the price of five oxen and two sheep.", "2752": "Now the value of a sheep was ten obols, and that of an ox a hundred, for at this period the Romans did not make much use of coined money, but possessed abundance of cattle.", "2753": "For this reason at this day they call property peculia, from pecus, a sheep, and on their oldest coins they marked the figure of an ox, a sheep, or a pig.", "2754": "Their children, too, were distinguished by the names of Suillii, Bubulci, Caprarii and Porcii, for capra means a goat, and porcus a pig.XII.", "2755": "Though Poplicola favoured the people so much in these laws, and showed such great moderation, yet in one instance he appointed a terrible penalty.", "2756": "One of his laws enacted that any citizen was at liberty to put to death anyone who tried to mal-e himself king, without any form of trial.", "2757": "No penalty was to be enforced, if the mail could bring forward proofs of the other's intention.", "2758": "His reason for this was that it was impossible for any one to attempt to make himself king, unperceived by some of his country­ men, but quite possible for him, although detected, to become too powerful to be brought to trial.", "2759": "So, before he made his attempt on the crown, any one was at liberty to exact from him that penalty, which he would be unable to do after his success.", "2760": "His law about the treasury was also much approved.", "2761": "It being necessary that the citizens should contribute taxes to carry on the war, as he did not wish to touch the revenue himself or to allow his friends to do so, and was even unwilling that the public money should be brought into a private man's house, he appointed the Temple of Saturn to be used as a treasury, which it is to this day, and he appointed also two of the younger citizens as quæstors, to manage the accounts.", "2762": "The first quæstors were Publius Venturius and Marcus Minucius, and a large sum of money was collected, for a hundred and thirty thousand persons were taxed, although orphans and widows were exempted.", "2763": "When he had settled all these matters, he nominated Lucretius, the father of Lucretia, as his colleague, and gave up the fasces to him as a mark of respect, because he was the elder man.", "2764": "This custom, that the elder of the two consuls has the fasces carried before him, remains to this day.", "2765": "As Lucretius died shortly afterwards, a new election took place, and Marcus Horatius was elected, and acted as Poplicola's colleague for the remainder of his year of office.", "2766": "XIII.", "2767": "As Tarquin was stirring up the Etruscans to a second war with Rome, a great portent is said to have taken place.", "2768": "While he was yet king, and had all but finished the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, he, either in accordance with some prophecy or otherwise, ordered certain Etruscan workmen at Veil to make an earthen­ ware four-horse chariot to be placed on the top of the temple.", "2769": "Shortly afterwards he was driven from the throne, and the chariot, which had been modelled in clay, was placed in the furnace.", "2770": "Here it did not, as clay generally does, shrink and become smaller in the fire, as the wet dries out of it, but swelled to so great a size, and became so hard and strong that it could only be got out of the furnace by taking off the roof and sides.", "2771": "As this was decided by the prophets to be a sign from Heaven that those who possessed the chariot would be prosperous and fortunate, the Veientines determined not to give it up to the Romans, arguing that it belonged to Tarquin, not to those who had cast him out.", "2772": "A few days afterwards there were horse-races there;", "2773": "everything proceeded as usual, but as the driver of the winning chariot, after receiving his crown as victor, was driving slowly out of the circus, the horses suddenly became excited for no apparent cause, and, either guided by Heaven or by chance, rushed towards Rome, their driver with them, for he finding it impossible to stop them was forced to let them whirl him along until they reached the Capitol, where they threw him down near what is called the Ratumenan Gate.", "2774": "The Veientines, struck with fear and wonder at this event, permitted the workmen to deliver up the earthenware chariot to the Romans.XIV.", "2775": "Tarquinius the son of Demaratus, when at war with the Sabines, vowed that he would build the temple of Jupiter Olympius, but it was built by Tarquinius Superbus, the son or grandson of him who made the vow.", "2776": "He had not time to dedicate it, but was dethroned just before its completion.", "2777": "Now when it was finished and thoroughly decorated, Poplicola was eager to have the glory of dedicating it.", "2778": "Many of the nobles, however, grudged him this, and were more incensed at this than at all the glory which he had won as a general and as a legislator ;", "2779": "for that, they said, was his vocation, but this was not.", "2780": "They stirred up Horatius to oppose him and urged him to claim the right to dedicate the temple.", "2781": "So when Poplicola was of necessity absent on military service, the senate decreed that Horatius should dedicate it, and brought him up into the Capitol to do so, a thing which they never could have done had Poplicola been present.", "2782": "Some say that the two consuls casts lots, and that the one, sorely against his will, drew the lot to command the army in the field, and the other that to dedicate the temple.", "2783": "But we may conjecture how this was, from the events which took place at the dedication.", "2784": "On the Ides of September, which corresponds with the full moon in our month Metageitnion, all the people assembled in the Capitol, and Horatius, after silence had been enjoined upon all, performed the ceremony of dedication.", "2785": "When, as is customary, he was about to take hold of the doors of the temple and say the prayer of dedication, Marcus, Poplicola's brother, who had long been standing near the doors watching his opportunity, said to him, \" Consul, your son has just died of sickness in the camp.\"", "2786": "All who heard this were grieved, but Horatius, undisturbed, merely said, \" Fling his corpse where you please, for I cannot grieve for him,\" and completed the dedication service.", "2787": "The story was false, invented by Marcus to confuse Horatius.", "2788": "His conduct is a remarkable instance of presence of mind, whether it be that he at once saw through the trick, or believed the story and was not disturbed by it.", "2789": "XV.", "2790": "The same fortune seems to have attended the second temple also.", "2791": "The first, as we have related, was built by Tarquin, and dedicated by Horatius.", "2792": "This was destroyed by fire in the civil wars.", "2793": "The second was built by Sulla, but the name of Catulus appears as its dedicator, for Sulla died before it was completed.", "2794": "This again was burned during the civil tumults in the time of Vitellius, and Vespasian built a third, which had nearly the same fortune as the others, except that he saw it completed, and did not see it shortly afterwards destroyed, being thus more fortunate than Tarquin in seeing the completion, and than Sulla in seeing the dedication of his work.", "2795": "When Vespasian died the Capitol was burned.", "2796": "The fourth and present temple was built and dedicated by Domitian.", "2797": "It is said that Tarquin spent forty thou­ sand pounds of silver in building the foundations;", "2798": "but there is no private citizen in Rome at the present day who could bear the expense of gilding the existing temple, which cost more than twelve thousand talents.", "2799": "Its columns are of Pentelic marble, exquisitely proportioned, which I myself saw at Athens;", "2800": "but at Rome they were again cut and polished, by which process they did not gain so much in gloss as they lost in symmetry, for they now appear too slender.", "2801": "However, if any one who wonders at the expense of the temple in the Capitol were to see the splendour of any one portico, hall, or chamber in the house of Domitian, he would certainly be led to parody that line of Epicharmus upon an extravagant fellow, \"Not good-natured, but possessed with the disease of giving,\" and would say that Domitian was not pious or admirable, but possessed with the disease of building, and turned everything into bricks and mortar, just as it is said Midas turned things into gold.", "2802": "So much for this.", "2803": "XVI.", "2804": "Tarquin, after the great battle in which his son was slain by Brutus, took refuge at Clusium and begged Lars Porsena, the most powerful king in Italy, to assist him.", "2805": "He was thought to be an honourable and ambitious man, and promised his aid.", "2806": "First he sent an embassy to Rome, ordering them to receive Tarquin;", "2807": "and when the Romans refused to obey, he declared war against them, and telling them at what place and time he would attack them, marched against them with a great army.", "2808": "At Rome, Poplicola, though absent, was chosen consul for the second time, and with him, Titus Lucretius.", "2809": "He returned to Rome, and by way of putting a slight upon Porsena, went and founded the city of Sigliuria, while his army was close at hand.", "2810": "He built the walls of this place at a vast expense, and sent away seven hundred colonists to it, as if the war with which he was menaced was a very unim­ portant matter.", "2811": "But, nevertheless, Porsena made a sharp assault upon the walls of Rome, drove away the garrison, and very nearly entered the town.", "2812": "Poplicola forestalled him by sallying from one of the gates, and fought by the banks of the Tiber against overwhelming numbers until he was severely wounded and had to be carried out of the battle.", "2813": "As the same fate befell his colleague Lucretius, the Romans lost heart and endeavoured to save themselves by flight into the town.", "2814": "As the enemy also began to push across the wooden bridge, Rome was in danger of being taken.", "2815": "But Horatius, surnamed Codes, and with him two of the noblest citizens, named Herminius and Lartius, held the wooden bridge against them.", "2816": "This Horatius was surnamed Codes because he had lost an eye in the wars, or as some say because of the flatness of his nose, which made his eyes and eyebrows seem to meet, having nothing to separate them, and therefore the people meaning to call him Cyclops, by a mistake of pronuncia­ tion, named him Codes.", "2817": "This man stood at the end of the bridge and kept off the enemy until his friends behind had cut down the bridge.", "2818": "Then he plunged into the river in his armour and swam to the other bank, though wounded by an Etruscan spear in the thigh.", "2819": "Poplicola, in admiration of his valour, at once proposed and passed a decree that every Roman should give him the price of one day's provisions.", "2820": "Moreover, he gave him as much land as he could plough in one day.", "2821": "And a brazen statue of him was placed in the temple of Vulcan, by which honourable allusion was made to the lameness caused by his wound.", "2822": "XVII.", "2823": "As Porsena pressed the siege, the Romans suffered from famine, and another separate army of Etruscans invaded their territory.", "2824": "But Poplicola, who was now consul for the third time, though he thought it his chief duty to remain stedfast and hold out the city against Porsena, did nevertheless sally out and attack these men, routing them with a loss of five thousand.", "2825": "Now as to the legend of Mucius, it is told in many different ways, but I will relate it as it seems most probable that it happened.", "2826": "He was a man of great courage, and very daring in war, who, meaning to assassi­ nate Porsena, stole into the camp in an Etruscan dress and speaking the Etruscan language.", "2827": "When he arrived at the raised platform on which the king was sitting, he did not exactly know which was he, and being afraid to ask, he drew his sword and killed the man who of all the party looked most as if he were the king.", "2828": "Hereupon, he was seized and questioned.", "2829": "A fire was burning close by in a brazier which had been brought for Porsena to offer sacrifice.", "2830": "Mucius held his right hand over this, and while the flesh was being consumed looked at Porsena cheerfully and calmly, until he in astonishment acquitted him and restored him his sword, which Mucius took with his left hand.", "2831": "On account of this he is said to have been named Scœvola, which means left-handed.", "2832": "He then said that though he did not fear Porsena, he was conquered by his generosity, and out of kindness would tell him what torture would have failed to extort:", "2833": "“ Three hundred young Romans like-minded with myself are at present concealed in your camp.", "2834": "I was chosen by lot to make the first attempt, and am not grieved that I failed to kill a man of honour, who ought to be a friend rather than an enemy to the Romans.”", "2835": "Porsena, hearing this, believed it to be true, and became much more inclined to make peace, not, I imagine, so much for fear of the three hundred, as out of admiration for the spirit and valour of the Romans.", "2836": "This Mucius is called Scaevola by all writers, but Athenodorus, the son of Sandon, in his book which is dedicated to Octavia, the sister of Cæsar Augustus, says that he was also named Posthumus.", "2837": "XVIII.", "2838": "Poplicola, who did not think Porsena so terrible as an enemy as he would be valuable as a friend and ally, was willing that he should decide the quarrel between the Romans and Tarquin, and often proposed that he should do so, feeling sure that he would discover him to be a wretch who had been most deservedly dethroned.", "2839": "But Tarquin roughly answered that he would submit his claims to no judge, and least of all to Porsena, who had been his ally and now seemed inclined to desert him.", "2840": "Porsena was angered at this, and, as his son Aruns also pleaded hard for the Romans, put an end to the war upon condition that they should give up the portion of Etruscan territory which they had seized, restore their prisoners, and receive back their deserters.", "2841": "Upon this, ten youths of the noblest families were given as hostages, and as many maidens, among whom was Valeria, the daughter of Poplicola.", "2842": "XIX.", "2843": "\\\\ hile these negotiations were going on, and Porsena, through his confidence in the good faith of the Romans, had relaxed the discipline of his camp, these Roman maidens came down to bathe in the river at a place where a bank, in the form of a crescent, makes the water smooth and undisturbed.", "2844": "As they saw no guards, nor any one passing except in boats, they determined to swim across, although the stream was strong and deep.", "2845": "Some say that one of them, by name Clcelia, rode on a horse across the river, encouraging the others as they swam.", "2846": "When they had got safe across they went to Poplicola, but he was displeased with them because it made him seem more faithless than Porsena, and he feared lest this daring feat of the maidens might be suspected of being a preconcerted plot of the Romans.", "2847": "For these reasons he sent them back to Porsena.", "2848": "Now Tarquin and his party, foreseeing that this would be done, laid an ambush on the further bank and attacked those who were escorting the girls with superior numbers.", "2849": "Still they made a stout defence, and meanwhile Valeria, the daugh­ ter of Poplicola, made her way through the combat­ ants and escaped, and three slaves who also got away took care of her.", "2850": "The others were mixed up with the fight, and were in considerable danger, when Aruns, Porsena's son, came to the rescue, put the enemy to the rout, and saved the Romans.", "2851": "When the girls were brought before Porsena, he asked which it was that had conceived the attempt to escape and encouraged the others.", "2852": "Being told that it was Clœlia, he smiled kindly upon her, and presented her with one of his own horses, splendidly caparisoned.", "2853": "This is relied upon by those who say that it was Clœlia alone who rode on horseback over the river, as proving their case.", "2854": "Others say that it was not because she used a horse, but to honour her manly spirit that the Etruscan king made her this present.", "2855": "A statue of her, on horseback, stands in the Sacred Way as you go up to the Palatine Hill, which by some is said not to be a statue of Clœlia, but of Valeria.", "2856": "Porsena, after making peace with the Romans, among many other instances of generosity, ordered his army to carry back nothing but their arms when they retired, leaving the entrenched camp full of food and property of every kind for the Romans.", "2857": "For this reason, at the pre­ sent day, whenever there is a sale of any public property, especially that which is taken in war, proclamation is always made, \" Porsena's goods for sale,\" so that the Romans have never forgotten the kindness which they received from him.", "2858": "A brazen statue of him used to stand near the senate house, of plain and oldfashioned work­ manship.", "2859": "XX.", "2860": "After this the Sabines invaded the country.", "2861": "Marcus Valerius, Poplicola's brother, and Posthumius Tubertus were then consuls, and Marcus, acting by the advice of Poplicola, who was present, won two great battles, in the second of which he slew thirteen thousand of the enemy without the Romans losing a man.", "2862": "He was rewarded for this, in addition to his triumph, by having a house built for him upon the Palatine Hill at the public expense.", "2863": "And whereas all other street doors open inwards, the doors of that house were made to open outwards, as a perpetual memorial of the honour paid him by the people, who thus made way for him.", "2864": "It is said that all the doors in Greece used once to open this way, arguing from the comedies, in which those who are coming out of a house always knock at the door, to warn those who are passing or standing near not to be struck by the leaves of the door as they open.", "2865": "XXI.", "2866": "Next year Poplicola was consul for the fourth time.", "2867": "There was an expectation of a war against the Latins and Sabines combined.", "2868": "Moreover the city seemed to have displeased the gods;", "2869": "for all the pregnant women were delivered prematurely, and of imperfectly formed children.", "2870": "Poplicola, after appeasing the gods below according to the injunctions of the Sibylline books, re-established certain games in accordance with an oracle, brought the city into a more hopeful state of mind, and began to consider what he had to fear from earthly foes, for the enemy's army was large and formidable.", "2871": "There was one Appius Clausus, a Sabine, of great wealth and remarkable personal strength, and a virtuous and eloquent man, who, like all great men, was the object of envy and ill-will to many.", "2872": "He was accused by his enemies of having put an end to the war, because he wished to increase the power of Rome, in order to enable him the more easily to triumph over the liberties of his own country, and make himself king of it.", "2873": "Perceiving that the populace eagerly listened to these tales, and that he was an object of dislike to the war party and the army, he began to fear impeachment:", "2874": "so, having numerous followers, besides his personal friends and relatives, he was able to divide the state into two parties.", "2875": "This caused great delay in the Sabines' preparations for attacking the Romans, and Poplicola, feeling it to be his duty not merely to watch but to assist Clausus, sent envoys, who spoke to him as follows:", "2876": "\" Poplicola feels that you are a man of honour, who would be unwilling to take vengeance upon your countrymen, although you have been shamefully treated by them.", "2877": "But if you choose to put yourself in safety by leaving your country and a people that hates you, he will receive you, both in his public and his private capacity, in a manner worthy of your own high character and of the dignity of Rome.\"", "2878": "After much deliberation, Clausus decided that he could not do better than accept this offer, and assembled all his friends.", "2879": "They in their turn influenced many others, so that he was able to transplant to Rome five thousand of the most peaceful and respectable families of the Sabine nation.", "2880": "Poplicola, who had notice of their arrival, welcomed them kindly and graciously.", "2881": "He made them all citizens of Rome, and gave each of them two acres of land along the river Anio.", "2882": "He gave Clausus twenty-five acres, and enrolled him among the Senators.", "2883": "Clausus afterwards became one of the first men in Rome for wisdom and power, and his descendants, the Claudian family, was one of the most illustrious in history.", "2884": "XXII.", "2885": "Though the disputes of the Sabines were settled by this migration, yet their popular orators would not let them rest, but vehemently urged that they ought not to let Appius, a deserter and an enemy, prevail upon them to let the Romans go unpunished-a thing which he could not persuade them to do when he was present among them.", "2886": "They proceeded to Fidenæ with a great army and en­ camped there, and laid two thousand men in ambush before Rome, in wooded and broken ground, meaning in the morning to send out a few horsemen to plunder ostentatiously.", "2887": "These men were ordered to ride up close to Rome, and then to retire till their pursuers were drawn into the snare.", "2888": "Poplicola heard of this plan the same day from deserters, and quickly made all necessary arrange­ ments.", "2889": "At evening he sent Postumius Balbus, his son-in law, with three thousand men to occupy the tops of the hills under which the Sabine ambush was placed.", "2890": "His colleague, Lucretius, was ordered to take the swiftest­ footed and noblest youth of the city, and pursue the plundering horsemen, while he himself with the rest of the forces made a circuitous march and outflanked the enemy.", "2891": "It chanced that a thick mist came on about dawn, in the midst of which Postumius charged down from the hills upon the men in ambush with a loud shout, while Lucretius sent his men to attack the cavalry, and Poplicola fell upon the enemy's camp.", "2892": "The Sabines were routed in every quarter, and even when fighting no longer were cut down by the Romans, their rash confidence proving ruinous to them.", "2893": "Each party thought that the others must be safe, and did not care to stay and fight where they were, but those who were in the camp ran to those in the ambush, and those in the ambush towards the camp, each of them meeting those with whom they hoped to take refuge, and finding that those who they had hoped would help them needed help themselves.", "2894": "The Sabines would have been all put to the sword, had not the neighbouring city of Fidenæ afforded them a refuge, especially for the men from the camp.", "2895": "Such as could not reach Fidenæ were either put to death or taken prisoners.", "2896": "XXIII.", "2897": "The Romans, accustomed as they are to refer all great success to the intervention of Heaven, thought that the whole glory of this achievement was due to the general.", "2898": "The first thing heard was the victorious soldiers declaring that Poplicola had delivered up the enemy to them blind and lame, and all but in chains, for them to slaughter at their ease.", "2899": "The people were enriched by the plunder and the sale of the prisoners for slaves.", "2900": "Poplicola enjoyed a triumph, and previously delivering over the administration of the city to the two succeeding consuls, died shortly afterwards, having attained to the highest pitch of glory that man can reach.", "2901": "The people, as if they had done nothing during his life to honour him as he deserved, and were now for the first time to show their gratitude, decreed him a public funeral, and moreover that every person should contribute the coin called quadrans, to show him respect.", "2902": "The women also made a common agreement to wear mourning for him for a whole year.", "2903": "He was buried by a decree of the people within the city near the place called Velia, and all his family were given the privilege of burial there.", "2904": "At the present day not one of the family is actually buried there, but the corpse is carried thither, and laid down, while some one places a lighted torch under it for a moment, after which it is carried away.", "2905": "By this ceremony they claim the right, although they forego it, ald bury the corpse outside the city.", "2906": "I. IT is a print peculiar to this comparison, and which doeR not occur in any of the other Lives which I have written, that in turn one imitates and the other bears witness to his fellow's deeds.", "2907": "Observe, for instance, Solon's definition of happiness before Crœsus, how much better it suits Poplicola than Tellus.", "2908": "He says that Tellus was fortunate because of his good luck, his virtue, and his noble children;", "2909": "but yet he makes no mention of him or of his children in his poetry, and he never was a man of any renown, or held any high office.", "2910": "Now Poplicola's virtues made him the most powerful and glorious of the Romans during his life, and six hundred years after his death the very noblest families of Rome, those named Publicola and Messala and Valerius, are proud to trace their descent from him, even at the present day.", "2911": "Tellus, it is true, died like a brave man fighting in the ranks, but Poplicola slew his enemies, which is much better than being killed oneself, and made his country victorious by skill as a general and a statesman, and, after triumphing and enjoying honours of every kind, died the death which Solon thought so enviable.", "2912": "Besides, Solon, in his answer to Mimnermus about the time of life, has written the verses:", "2913": "u To me may favouring Heaven send, That all my friends may mourn my end, It in which he bears witness to the good fortune of Poplicola ;", "2914": "for he, when he died, was mourned not only by all his friends and relations but by the whole city, in which thousands wept for him, while all the women wore mourn­ ing for him as if he were a son or father of them all that they had lost.", "2915": "Solon says in his poems, “ I long for wealth, but not procured By means unholy.\"", "2916": "Now Poplicola not only possessed wealth honourably acquired, but also was able to spend it, much to his credit.", "2917": "On relieving the needy.", "2918": "Thus if Solon was the wisest, Poplicola was certainly the most fortunate of men;", "2919": "for what Solon prayed for as the greatest blessing, Poplicola possessed and enjoyed to the end of his days.", "2920": "II.", "2921": "Thus has Solon done honour to Poplicola;", "2922": "and he again honoured Solon by regarding him as the best model a man could follow in establishing a free constitution :", "2923": "for he took away the excessive power and dignity of the consuls and made them inoffensive to the people, and indeed made use of many of Solon's own laws ;", "2924": "as he em­ powered the people to elect their own consuls, and gave defendants a right of appeal to the people from other courts, just as Solon had done.", "2925": "He did not, like Solon, make two senates, but he increased the existing one to nearly double its number.", "2926": "His grounds for the appoint­ ment of quæstors was to give the consul leisure for more important matters, if he was an honest man;", "2927": "and if he was a bad man, to remove the opportunity of fraud which he would have had if he were supreme over the state and the treasury at once.", "2928": "In hatred of tyrants Poplicola exceeded Solon, for he fixed the penalty for a man who might be proved to be attempting to make himself king, whereas the Roman allowed any one to kill him without trial.", "2929": "And while Solon justly prided himself upon his having been offered the opportunity to make himself despot, with the full consent of his fellow-countrymen, and yet having refused it, Poplicola deserves even greater credit for having been placed in an office of almost despotic power, and having made it more popular, not using the privileges with which he was entrusted.", "2930": "Indeed Solon seems to have been the first to perceive that a people “", "2931": "Obeys its rulers best, When not too free, yet not too much opprest.''III.", "2932": "The relief of debtors was a device peculiar to Solon, which more than anything else confirmed the liberty of the citizens.", "2933": "For laws to establish equality are of no use if poor men are prevented from enjoying it because of their debts;", "2934": "and in the states which appear to be the most free, lien become mere slaves to the rich, and conduct the whole business of the state at their dictation.", "2935": "It should be especially noted that although an abolition of debt would naturally produce a civil war, yet this measure of Solon's, like an unusual but powerful dose of medicine, actually put an end to the existing condition of internal strife;", "2936": "for the well-known probity of Solon's character outweighed the discredit of the means to which he resorted.", "2937": "In fact Solon began his public life with greater glory than Poplicola, for he was the leading spirit, and followed no man, but entirely single-handed effected the most important reforms;", "2938": "while Poplicola was more enviable and fortunate at the close of his career.", "2939": "Solon himself saw his own constitution overthrown, while that of Poplicola preserved order in the city down to the time of the civil wars;", "2940": "and the reason was that Solon, as soon as he had enacted his laws, went on his travels, leaving them written on wooden tablets, defence­ less against all assailants;", "2941": "whereas Poplicola remained at home, acted as consul, and by his statesmanship ensured the success and permanence of the new constitution.", "2942": "Moreover, Solon could not stop Peisistratus, although he perceived his designs, but was forced to see a despotism established;", "2943": "while Poplicola destroyed a monarchy which had existed for many years, showing equal virtue with Solon, but greater good fortune and power to enable him to carry out his intentions.", "2944": "IV.", "2945": "With regard to warlike achievements, Daimachus of Platæa will not even admit that Solon made the cam­ paign against the Megarians, which we have related;", "2946": "but Poplicola both by strategy and personal valour won many great battles.", "2947": "As a statesman, Solon seems to have acted somewhat childishly in pretending that he was mad, in order to make his speech about Salamis, while Poplicola ran the very greatest risks in driving out the tyrant and crushing the conspiracy.", "2948": "He was especially responsible for the chief criminals being put to death, and thus not only drove the Tarquins out of the city, but cut off and destroyed their hopes of return.", "2949": "And while he showed such vigour in enterprises that required spirit and courage, he was equally admirable in peaceful negotiations and the arts of persuasion;", "2950": "for he skilfully won over the formidable Porsena to be the friend instead of the enemy of Rome.", "2951": "Still we may be reminded that Solon stirred up the Athenians to capture Salamis, which they had given up to the Megarians, while Poplicola withdrew the Romans from a country which they had conquered.", "2952": "We must, however, consider the circumstances under which these events took place.", "2953": "A subtle politician deals with every thing so as to turn it to the greatest advantage, and will often lose a part in order to save the whole, and by sacrificing some small advantage gain another more important one, as did Poplicola on that occasion;", "2954": "for he, by withdrawing from a foreign country, preserved his own, gained the enemy's camp for the Romans, who before were only too glad to save their city from ruin, and at last, by converting his enemy into an arbitrator and winning his cause, obtained all the fruits of victory:", "2955": "for Porsena put an end to the war, and left behind him all his war material to show his respect for the noble character of the consul.", "2956": "I. THEMISTOKLES came of a family too obscure to entitle him to distinction.", "2957": "His father, Neokles, was a middle-class Athenian citizen, of the township of Phrearri and the tribe Leontis.", "2958": "He was base born on his mother's side, as the epigram tells us :", "2959": "“My name's Abrotonon from Thrace, I boast not old Athenian race;", "2960": "Yet, humble though my lineage be, Themistokles was born of me.", "2961": "\"Phanias, however, says that the mother of Themistokles was a Carian, not a Thracian, and that her name was not Abrotonon but Euterpe.", "2962": "Manthes even tells us that she came from the city of Halikarnassus in Caria.", "2963": "All base­ born Athenians were made to assemble at Kynosarges, a gymnasium outside the walls sacred to Herakles, who was regarded as base born among the gods because his mother was a mortal;", "2964": "and Themistokles induced several youths of noble birth to come to Kynosarges with him and join in the wrestling there, an ingenious device for destroying the exclusive privileges of birth.", "2965": "But, for all that, he evidently was of the blood of Lykomedes;", "2966": "for when the barbarians burned down the temple of the Initiation at Phlya, which belonged to the whole race of the descendants of Lykomedes, it was restored by The­ mistokles, as we are told by Slmonides.", "2967": "II.", "2968": "He is agreed by all to have been a child of vigorous impulses, naturally clever, and inclined to take an interest in important affairs and questions of statesmanship.", "2969": "During his holidays and times of leisure he did not play and trifle as other children do, but was always found arranging some speech by himself and thinking it over.", "2970": "The speech was always an attack on, or a defence of, some one of his playfellows.", "2971": "His schoolmaster was wont to say, “ You will be nothing petty, my boy;", "2972": "you will be either a very good or a very bad man.", "2973": "'In his learning, he cared nothing for the exercises intended to form the character, and mere showy accom­ plishments and graces, but eagerly applied himself to all real knowledge, trusting to his natural gifts to enable him to master what was thought to be too abstruse for his time of life.", "2974": "In consequence of this, when in society he was ridiculed by those who thought themselves well mannered and well educated, he was obliged to make the somewhat vulgar retort that he could not tune a lute or play upon the harp, but he could make a small and obscure state great and glorious.", "2975": "In spite of all this, Stesimbrotus says that Themistokles was a pupil of Anaxagoras, and attended the lectures of Melissus the physicist;", "2976": "but here he is wrong as to dates.", "2977": "Melissus was the general who was opposed to Perikles, a much younger man than Themistokles, when he was besieging Samos, and Anaxagoras was one of Perikles's friends.", "2978": "One is more inclined to believe those who tell us that Themistokles was a follower and admirer of Mnesi­ philus of Phrearri, who was neither an orator nor a natural philosopher, but a man who had deeply studied what went by the name of wisdom, but was really political sharp practice and expedients of statesmanship, which he had, as it were, inherited as a legacy from Solon.", "2979": "Those who in later times mixed up this science with forensic devices, and used it, not to deal with the facts of politics, but the abstract ideas of speculative philosophy, were named Sophists.", "2980": "Themistokles used to converse with this man when he had already begun his political career.", "2981": "In his childhood he was capricious and unsteady, his genius, as yet untempered by reason and experience, showing great capacities both for good and evil, and after breaking out into vice, as he himself used afterwards to admit, saying that the colts which are the hardest to break in usually make the most valuable horses when properly taught.", "2982": "But as for the stories which some have fabricated out of this, about his being disinherited by his father, and about his mother committing suicide through grief at her son's disgrace, they seem to be untrue.", "2983": "On the other hand, some writers tell us that his father, wishing to dissuade him from taking part in politics, pointed out to him the old triremes lying abandoned on the beach, and told him that politicians, when the people had no farther use for them, were cast aside in like manner,111.", "2984": "Very early in life Themistokles took a vigorous part in public affairs, possessed by vehement ambition.", "2985": "Determined from the very outset that he would become the leading man in the state, he eagerly entered into all the schemes for displacing those who where then at the head of affairs, especially attacking Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, whose policy he opposed on every occasion.", "2986": "Yet his enmity with this man seems to have had a very boyish commencement;", "2987": "for they both entertained a passion for the beautiful Stesilaus, who, we are told by Ariston the philosopher, was descended from a family residing in the island of Keos.", "2988": "After this difference they espoused different parties in the state, and their different temper and habits widened the breach between them.", "2989": "Aristeides was of a mild and honourable nature, and as a statesman cared nothing for popularity or personal glory, but did what he thought right with great caution and strict rectitude.", "2990": "He was thus often brought into collision with Themistokles, who was trying to engage the people in many new schemes, and to introduce startling reforms, by which he would himself have gained credit, and which Aristeides steadily opposed.", "2991": "He is said to have been so recklessly ambitious and so frenziedly eager to take part in great events, that though he was very young at the time of the battle of Marathon, when the country rang with the praises of the general­ ship of Miltiades, he was often to be seen buried in thought, passing sleepless nights and refusing invitations to wine­ parties, and that he answered those who asked him the cause of his change of habits, that the trophies of Miltiades would not let J him sleep.", "2992": "Other men thought that the victory of Marathon had put an end to the war, but Themistokles saw that it was but the prelude to a greater contest, in which he prepared himself to stand forth as the champion of Greece, and, foreseeing long before what was to come, endeavoured to make the city of Athens ready to meet it.", "2993": "IV.", "2994": "First of all, he had the courage to propose that the Athenians, instead of dividing amongst themselves the revenues derived from the silver mines at Laurium, should construct ships out of this fund for the war with iEgina.", "2995": "This was then at its height, and the Æginetans, who had a large navy, were masters of the sea.", "2996": "By this means Themistokles was more easily enabled to carry his point, not trying to terrify the people by alluding to Darius and the Persians, who lived a long way off, and whom few feared would ever come to attack them, but by cleverly appealing to their feelings of patriotism against the Æginetans, to make them consent to the outlay.", "2997": "With that money a hundred triremes were built, which were subsequently used to fight against Xerxes.", "2998": "After this he kept gradually turning the thoughts of the Athenians in the direction of the sea, because their land force was unable even to hold its own against the neigh­ bouring states, while with a powerful fleet they could both beat off the barbarians and make themselves masters of the whole of Greece.", "2999": "Thus, as Plato says, instead of station­ ary soldiers as they were, he made them roving sailors, and gave rise to the contemptuous remark that Themisto­ kles took away from the citizens of Athens the shield and the spear, and reduced them to the oar and the rower's bench.", "3000": "This, we are told by Stesimbrotus, he effected after quelling the opposition of Miltiades, who spoke on the other side.", "3001": "Whether his proceedings at this time were strictly constitutional or no I shall leave to others to determine;", "3002": "but that the only safety of Greece lay in its fleet, and that those triremes were the salvation of the Athenians after their city was taken, can be proved by the testimony, among others, of Xerxes himself;", "3003": "for although his land force was unbroken, he fled after his naval defeat, as though no longer able to contend with the Greeks, and he left Mardonius behind more to prevent pursuit, in ray opinion, than with any hopes of conquest.", "3004": "V.", "3005": "Some writers tell us that he was a keen man of business, and explain that his grand style of living made this necessary ;", "3006": "for he made costly sacrifices, and entertained foreigners in a splendid manner, all of which required a large expenditure ;", "3007": "but some accuse him of meanness and avarice, and even say that he sold presents which were sent for his table.", "3008": "When Philides the horse-dealer refused to sell him a colt, he threatened that he would soon make a wooden horse of the man's house;", "3009": "meaning that he would stir up lawsuits and claims against him from some of his relations.", "3010": "In ambition he surpassed every one.", "3011": "When yet a young and unknown man he prevailed upon Epikles of Hermione, the admired performer on the harp, to practise his art in his house, hoping thereby to bring many people to it to listen.", "3012": "And he displeased the Greeks when he went to the Olympian games by vying with Kimon in the luxury of his table, his tents, and his other furniture.", "3013": "It was thought very proper for Kimon, a young man of noble birth, to do so;", "3014": "but for a man who had not yet made himself a reputa­ tion, and had not means to support the expense, such extravagance seemed mere vulgar ostentation.", "3015": "In the dramatic contest, which even then excited great interest and rivalry, the play whose expenses he paid for won the prize.", "3016": "He put up a tablet in memory of his success bearing the words :", "3017": "Themistokles of Phrearri was choragus, Phryni­ chus wrote the play, Adeimantus was archon.", "3018": "Yet he was popular, for he knew every one of the citizens by name, and gave impartial judgment in all cases referred to him as arbitrator.", "3019": "Once, when Simonides of Keos asked him to strain a point in his favour, Themistokles, who was a general at the time, answered that Simonides would be a bad poet if he sang out of tune;", "3020": "and he would be a bad magistrate if he favoured men against the law.", "3021": "A t another time he rallied Simonides on his folly in abusing the Corinthians, who inhabited so fine a city, and in having his own statue carved, though he was so ugly.", "3022": "He continued to increase in popularity by judiciously courting the favour of the people, and was at length able to secure the triumph of his own party, and the banishment of his rival Aristeides.", "3023": "VI.", "3024": "As the Persians were now about to invade Greece, th 3 Athenians deliberated as to who should be their leader.", "3025": "It is said that most men refused the post of General through fear, but that Epikydes, the son of Euphemides, a clever mob-orator, but cowardly and accessible to bribes, desired to be appointed, and seemed very likely to be elected.", "3026": "Themistokles, fearing that the state would be utterly ruined if its affairs fell into such hands, bribed him into forgetting his ambitious designs, and withdrawing hip candidature.", "3027": "He was much admired for his conduct when envoys came from the Persian king to demand earth and water, in token of submission.", "3028": "He seized the interpreter, and by a decree of the people had him put to death, because he had dared to translate the commands of a barbarian into the language of free Greeks.", "3029": "He acted in the same way to Arthmias of Zelea.", "3030": "This man, at the instance of The­ mistokles, was declared infamous, he and his children and his descendants for ever, because he brought Persian gold among the Greeks.", "3031": "His greatest achievement of all, however, was, that he put an end to all the internal wars in Greece, and reconciled the states with one another, inducing them to defer the settlement of their feuds until after the Persian war.", "3032": "In this he is said to have been greatly assisted by Chileon the Arcadian.", "3033": "VII.", "3034": "On his appointment as General, he at once en­ deavoured to prevail upon his countrymen to man their fleet, leave their city, and go to meet the enemy by sea as far from Greece as possible.", "3035": "As this met with great opposition, he, together with the Lacedæmonians, led a large force as far as the Vale of Tempe, which they in­ tended to make their first line of defence, as Thessaly had not at that time declared for the Persians.", "3036": "When, how­ ever, the armies were forced to retire from thence, and all Greece, up to Bœotia, declared for the Persians, the Athenians became more willing to listen to Themistokles about fighting by sea, and he was sent with a fleet to guard the straits at Artemisium.", "3037": "Here the Greeks chose the Lacedæmonians, and their general, Eurybiades, to take the command;", "3038": "but the Athenians refused to submit to any other state, because they alone furnished more ships than all the rest.", "3039": "Themistokles, at this crisis per­ ceiving the danger, gave up his claims to Eurybiades, and soothed the wounded pride of the Athenians, telling them that if they proved themselves brave men in the war, they would find that all the other states in Greece would cheerfully recognise their supremacy.", "3040": "On this account he seems more than any one else to deserve the credit of having saved Greece, and to have covered the Athenians with glory by teaching them to surpass their enemies in bravery, and their allies in good sense.", "3041": "When the Persian fleet reached Aphetai, Eurybiades was terrified at the number of ships at the mouth of the Straits, and, learning that two hundred sail more were gone round the outside of Euboea to take him in the rear, he at once wished to retire further into Greece, and support the fleet by the land army in Peloponnesus, for he regarded the Persian king's fleet as utterly irresistible at sea.", "3042": "Upon this the Eubœans, who feared to be deserted by the Greeks, sent one Pelagon with a large sum of money, to make secret proposals to Themis­ tokles.", "3043": "He took the money, Herodotus tells us, and gave it to Eurybiades and his party.", "3044": "One of those who most vehemently opposed him was Architeles, the captain of the Sacred Trireme, who had not sufficient money to pay his crew, and therefore wished to sail back to Athens.", "3045": "Themistokles stirred up the anger of his men to such a pitch that they rushed upon him and took away his supper.", "3046": "At this, Architeles was much vexed, but Themis­ tokles sent him a basket containing bread and meat, with a talent of silver hidden underneath it, with a message bidding him eat his supper and pay his men the next day, but that, if he did not, Themistokles would denounce him to his countrymen as having received bribes from the enemy.", "3047": "This we are told by Phanias of Lesbos.", "3048": "VIII.", "3049": "The battles which took place in the Straits with the Persian ships, were indeed indecisive, but the experience gained in them was of the greatest value to the Greeks, as they were taught by their result that multitudes of ships and splendid ensigns, and the boastful war-cries of bar­ barians, avail nothing against men who dare to fight hand to hand, and that they must disregard all these and boldly grapple with their enemies.", "3050": "Pindar seems to have under­ stood this when he says, about the battle at Artem isium, that there “ The sons of Athens laid Their freedom'a grand foundation.” for indeed confidence leads to victory.", "3051": "This Artemisium is a promontory of the island of Eubœa, stretching north­ wards beyond Hestiæa;", "3052": "and opposite to it is Olizon, which was once part of the dominions of Philoktetes.", "3053": "There is upon it a small temple of Artemis (Diana), which is called the Temple towards the East.\"", "3054": "Round it stand trees and a circle of pillars of white stone.", "3055": "This stone, when rubbed in the hand, has the colour and smell of saffron.", "3056": "On one of these pillars were written the following verses:", "3057": "“ The sons of Athens once overcame in fight All Asia's tribes, on yonder sea ;", "3058": "They raised these pillars round Diana's shrine, To thank her for their victory.\"", "3059": "Even now a place is pointed out on the beach where, under a great heap of sand, there is a deep bed of black ashes where it is thought the wrecks and dead bodies were burned.", "3060": "IX.", "3061": "But when the news of Thermopylae was brought to the Greeks at Artemisium, that Leonidas had fallen, and Xerxes was in possession of the passes, they retired further into Greece, the Athenians protecting the rear on account of their bravery, and full of pride at their achievements.", "3062": "At all the harbours and landing-places along the coast, Themistokles, as he passed by, cut conspicuous inscriptions on stones, some of which he found on the spot, and others which he himself set up at all the watering-places and convenient stations for ships.", "3063": "In these inscriptions he besought the Ionians, if possible, to come over to the Athenians, who were their fathers, and who were fighting for their liberty;", "3064": "and if they could not do this, to throw the barbarian army into confusion during battle.", "3065": "He hoped that these writings would either bring the Ionians over tJ the side of the Greeks, or make them suspected of treason by the Persians.", "3066": "Meanwhile Xerxes invaded Greece through Doris, and came into Phokis, where he burned the city of the Phokæans.", "3067": "The Greeks made no resistance, although the Athenians begged them to make a stand in Bœotia, and cover Attica, urging that they had fought in defence of the whole of Greece at Artemisium, However, as no one would listen to them, but all the rest of the Greeks determined to defend the Peloponnesus, and were collecting all their forces within it, and building a wall across the Isthmus from sea to sea, the Athenians were enraged at their treachery, and dis­ heartened at being thus abandoned to their fate.", "3068": "They had no thoughts of resisting so enormous an army;", "3069": "and the only thing they could do under the circumstances, to abandon their city and trust to their ships, was distasteful to the people, who saw nothing to be gained by victory, and no advantage in life, if they had to desert the temples of their gods and the monuments of their fathers.", "3070": "X.", "3071": "At this crisis, Themistokles, despairing of influencing the populace by human reasoning, just as a dramatist has recourse to supernatural machinery, produced signs and wonders and oracles.", "3072": "He argued that it was a portent that the sacred snake during those days deserted his usual haunt.", "3073": "The priests, who found their daily offerings to him of the firstfruits of the sacrifices left untouched, told the people, at the instigation of Themistokles, that the goddess Athena (Minerva) had left the city, and was leading them to the sea.", "3074": "He also swayed the popular mind by the oracle, in which he argued that by \" wooden walls\" ships were alluded to;", "3075": "and that Apollo spoke of Salamis as “ divine,\" not terrible or sad, because Salamis would be the cause of great good fortune to the Greeks.", "3076": "Having thus gained his point, he proposed a decree, that the city be left to the care of the tutelary goddess of the Athenians, that all able-bodied men should embark in the ships of war, and that each man should take the best measures in his power to save the women and children and slaves.", "3077": "When this decree was passed, most of the Athenians sent their aged folks and women over to Trœzen, where they were hospitably received by the Troezenians, who decreed that they should be maintained at the public expense, receiving each two obols a day, that the children should be allowed to pick the fruit from any man's tree, and even that their school expenses should be paid.", "3078": "This decree was proposed by Nikagoras.", "3079": "The Athenians at this time had no public funds, yet Aristotle tells us that the Senate of the Areopagus, by supplying each fighting man with eight drachmas, did good service in manning the fleet;", "3080": "and Kleidemus tells us that this money was obtained by an artifice of Themistokles.", "3081": "When the Athenians were going down to the Peiræus, he gave out that the Gorgon's head had been lost from the statue of the goddess.", "3082": "Themistokles, under pretext of seeking for it, searched every man, and found great stores of money hidden in their luggage, which he confiscated, and thus was able to supply the crews of the ships with abundance of necessaries.", "3083": "When the whole city put to sea, the sight affected some to pity, while others admired their courage in sending their families out of the way that they might not be disturbed by weeping and wailing as they went over to Salamis.", "3084": "Yet many of the aged citizens who were left behind at Athens afforded a piteous sight;", "3085": "and even the domestic animals, as they ran howling to the sea-shore, accompanying their masters, touched men's hearts.", "3086": "It is said that the dog of Xanthippus, the father of Perikles, could not endure to be separated from him, and jumping into the sea swam alongside of his trireme, reached Salamis, and then at once died.", "3087": "His tomb is even now to be seen at the place called Kynossema.XI.", "3088": "Besides these great achievements, Themistokles, perceiving that his countrymen longed to have Aristeides back again, and fearing that he might ally himself with the Persian, and work ruin to Greece out of anger against his own country (for Aristeides had been banished from Athens before the war when Themistokles came into power), proposed a decree, that any citizen who had been banished for a term of years, might return and do his best by word and deed to serve his country- together with the other citizens.", "3089": "Eurybiades, on account of the prestige of Sparta, held the chief command of the fleet, but was unwilling to risk a battle, preferring to weigh anchor and sail to the Isthmus where the land army of the Peloponnesians was assembled.", "3090": "This project was opposed by Themistokles ;", "3091": "and it was on this occasion that he made use of the following well-known saving:", "3092": "When Eurybiades said to him, \" Themistokles, in the public games they

him, Themistokles said, \" Strike, but hear me.\"", "3095": "When Eurybiades, in wonder at his gentle temper, bade him speak, he again urged Eurybiades to remain at Salamis.", "3096": "Some one then said, that a main without a city had no right to tell those who still possessed one to abandon it, but Themistokles turning upon him, answered, \" Wretch, we Athenians have indeed abandoned our walls

infantry, the Greeks forgot the words of Themistokles, and began to cast eager glances towards the Isthmus and to be angry with any one who proposed to do anything else than withdraw.", "3103": "They determined to retire by night, and the steersmen were given orders to prepare for a voyage.", "3104": "Themistokles, enraged at the idea of the Greek fleet dispersing, and losing the advantage of the

himself to deserve the first prize for valour, and Themistokles to deserve the second.", "3159": "However, the Lacedæmonians brought him home with them to Sparta, and gave Eurybiades the first prize for valour, but Themistokles that for wisdom, a crown of olive-leaves.", "3160": "They also gave him the best chariot in their city, and sent three hundred of their young men to escort him out of the country.", "3161": "It is also related that at the next Olympian games, when Themistokles appeared upon the race-course, all the spectators took no further interest in the contests, but passed the whole day in admiring and applauding him, and in pointing him out to such as were strangers;", "3162": "so that he was delighted, and said to his friends that he had now received his reward for all his labour on behalf of Greece.", "3163": "XVIII.", "3164": "He was by nature excessively fond of admiration, as we may judge from the stories about him which have been preserved.", "3165": "Once, when he was made admiral of the Athenian fleet, he put off all the necessary business of his office until the day appointed for sailing, in order that he might have a great many dealings with various people all at once, and so appear to be a person of great influence and importance.", "3166": "And when he saw the corpses floating in the sea with gold bracelets and necklaces, he himself passed them by, but pointed them out to a friend who was following, saying, \" Do you pick them up and keep them ;", "3167": "for you are not Themistokles.\"", "3168": "A beautiful youth, named Antiphates, regarded him coolly at first, but eventually became submissive to him because of his immense reputation.", "3169": "\" Young man,\" said Themistokles, \" it has taken some time, but we have at length both regained our right minds.\"", "3170": "He used to say that the Athenians neither admired nor respected him, but used him like a plane-tree under which they took shelter in storm, but which in fair weather they lopped and stripped of its leaves.", "3171": "Once when a citizen of Seriphos said to him that he owed his glory, not to himself but to his city, he answered, \" Very true ;",

good service, was taking a haughty tone, and comparing his exploits with those of Themistokles, he said, \" The day after a feast, once upon a time, boasted that it was better than the feast-day itself, because on that day all men are full of anxiety and trouble, while upon the next day every one enjoys what has been prepared at his leisure.", "3174": "But the feast-day answered, ' Very true,

Spartan ephors into laying aside opposition, but most writers say that he out­ witted them by proceeding to Sparta nominally on an embassy.", "3184": "Then when the Spartans complained to him that Athens was being fortified, and when Poliarchus came expressly from Ægina to charge him with it, he denied it, and bade them send commissioners to Athens to see whether it was true, wishing both to obtain time for the fortifications to be built, and also to place these commissioners in the hands of the Athenians, as hostages for his own safety.", "3185": "His expectations were realised;", "3186": "for the Lacedæmonians, on discovering the truth, did him no harm, but dissembled their anger and sent him away.", "3187": "After this he built Peiræus, as he perceived the excellence of its harbours, and was desirous to turn the whole attention of the Athenians to naval pursuits.", "3188": "In this he pursued a policy exactly the opposite to that of the ancient kings of Attica;", "3189": "for they are said to have endeavoured to keep their subjects away from the sea, and to accustom them to till the ground instead of going on board ships, quoting the legend that Athene and Poseidon had a contest for the possession of the land, and that she gained a decision in her favour by the production of the sacred olive.", "3190": "Themistokles, on the other hand, did not so much \" stick Peiræus on to Athens,\" as Aristophanes the comio poet said, as make the city dependent upon Peiraeus, and the land dependent on the sea.", "3191": "By this means he trans­ f'erred power from the nobles to the people, because sailors and pilots became the real strength of the State.", "3192": "For this reason the thirty tyrants destroyed the bema, or tribune on the place of public assembly, which was built looking towards the sea, and built another which looked inland, because they thought that the naval supremacy of Athens had been the origin of its democratic constitution, and that an oligarchy had less to fear from men who cultivated the land.", "3193": "XX.", "3194": "Themistokles had even more extended views than these about making the Athenians supreme at sea.", "3195": "When Xerxes was gone, the whole Greek fleet was drawn up on shore for the winter at Pagasæ.", "3196": "Themistokles then publicly told the Athenians that he had a plan which would save and benefit them all, but which must not be divulged.", "3197": "The Athenians bade him tell Aristeides only, and to execute his designs if he approved.", "3198": "Themistokles then told Aristeides that his design was to burn the whole Greek fleet as they lay on the beach.", "3199": "But Aristeides came forward and told the people that no proposal could be more advantageous or more villainous ;", "3200": "so that the Athenians forbade Themistokles to proceed with it.", "3201": "On another occasion the Lacedæmonians proposed, in a meeting of the Amphiktyonic council, that all States that had taken no part in the Persian war should be excluded from that council;", "3202": "Themistokles, fearing that if the Lacedæmonians should exclude Thessaly, Argos, and Thebes, they would have complete control over the votes, and be able to carry what measures they pleased, made representations to the various States, and influenced the votes of their deputies at the meeting, pointing out to them that there were only thirty-one States which took any part in the war, and that most of these were very small ones, so that it would be unreasonable for one or two powerful States to pronounce the rest of Greece outlawed, and be supreme in the council.", "3203": "After this he generally opposed the Lacedæmonians;", "3204": "wherefore they paid special court to Kimon, in order to establish him as a political rival to Themistokles.", "3205": "XXI.", "3206": "Moreover, he made himself odious to the allies by sailing about the islands and wringing money from them.", "3207": "A case in point is the conversation which Herodotus tells us he held with the people of Andros, when trying to get money from them.", "3208": "He said that he was come, bringing with him two gods, Persuasion and Necessity ;", "3209": "but they replied that they also possessed two equally powerful ones, Poverty and Helplessness, by whom they were prevented from supplying him with money.", "3210": "The poet, Tinlokreon of Rhodes, in one of his songs, writes bitterly of Themistokles, saying that he was prevailed upon by the bribes which he received from exiles to restore them to their native country, but abandoned himself, who was his

appearance.", "3232": "The Athenians made use of ostracism to banish him, in order to reduce his extravagant pretensions, as they always were wont to do in the case of men whom they thought over powerful and unfit for living in the equality of a democracy.", "3233": "For ostracism implied no censure, but was intended as a vent for envious feelings, which were satisfied by seeing the object of their hatred thus humbled.", "3234": "XXIII.", "3235": "When Themistokles was banished from Athens, he lived in Argos, during which time the proceedings of rausanias gave a great opportunity to his enemies.", "3236": "He was impeached on a charge of treason by Leobotes, the son of Alkmæon of Agraulai, and the Spartans joined in the impeachment.", "3237": "Pausanias, indeed, at first concealed his treacherous designs from Themistokles, although he was his friend;", "3238": "but when he saw that Themistokles was banished, and chafing at the treatment he had received, he was encouraged to ask him to share his treason, and showed him the letters which he had received from the Persian king, at the same time inflaming his resentment against the Greeks, whom he spoke of as ungrateful wretches.", "3239": "Themistokles refused utterly to join Pausanias, but nevertheless told no one of his treasonable practices, either because he hoped that he would desist, or that his visionary and impossible projects would be disclosed by other means.", "3240": "And thus it was that when Pausanias was put to death, certain letters and writings on this subject were found, which threw suspicion upon Themistokles.", "3241": "The Lacedaemonians loudly condemned him, and many of his own countrymen, because of the enmity they bore him, brought charges against him.", "3242": "He did not appear in person at first, but answered these attacks by letters.", "3243": "In these he told his accusers that he had always sought to rule, and was not born to obey;", "3244": "so that he never would sell

of two hundred talents for him), he fled to Ægæ, a little Æolian city, where he was known by no one except his friend Nikogenes, the richest of all the Æolians, who was well known to the Persians of

town­ ship of Alopekai.", "3356": "Of these Kleophantus is mentioned by Plato the philosopher as being an excellent horseman, but otherwise worthless.", "3357": "Of the elder ones, Neokles was bitten by a horse and died while still a child, and Diokles was adopted by his grandfather Lysander.", "3358": "He also had several daughters by his second wife, of whom Mnesi­ ptolema married Archeptolis, her father's half-brother;", "3359": "Italia married Panthoides of the island of Chios, and Sybaris married Nikomedes, an Athenian.", "3360": "After Themis­ tokles's death, his nephew Phrasikles sailed to Magnesia, and with her brother's consent married Nicomache, and also took charge of the youngest child, who was named Asia.", "3361": "The people of Magnesia show a splendid tomb of Themis­ tokles in their market-place;", "3362": "but with regard to the fate of his remains we must pay no attention to Andokides, who in his address to his friends, tells us that the Athenians stole them and tore them to pieces, because he would tell any falsehood to excite the hatred of the nobles against the people.", "3363": "Phylarchus, too, writes his history in such dramatic form that he all but resorts to the actual machinery of the stage, bringing forward one Neokles, and Demopolis as the children of Themistokles to make a touching scene, which anyone can see is untrue.", "3364": "Diodorus the topographer, in his treatise ' On Tombs' says, more as a conjecture than as knowing it for a fact, that in the great harbour of Peiraeus a kind of elbow juts out from the promontory of Alkimus, and that when one sails past this, going inwards, where the sea is most sheltered, there is a large foundation, and upon it the tomb of Themistokles, shaped like an altar.", "3365": "It is thought that the comic poet Plato alludes to this in the following verses:", "3366": "\" By the sea's margin, by the watery strand, Thy monument, Themistokles, shall stand;", "3367": "By this directed to thy

philosopher, enjoyed them.", "3371": "LIFE OF CAMILLUS.I.", "3372": "THE strangest fact in the life of Furius Camillus is that, although he was a most successful general and won great victories, though he was five times appointed dictator, triumphed four times, and was called the second founder of Rome, yet he never once was consul.", "3373": "The reason of this is to be found inthe political condition of Rome at that time;", "3374": "for the people, being at variance with the senate, refused to elect consuls, and chose military tribunes instead, who, although they had full consular powers, yet on account of their number were less offensive to the people than consuls.", "3375": "To have affairs managed by six men instead of two appears to have been a consolation to those who had suffered from the arbitrary rule of a few.", "3376": "It was during this period that Camillus reached the height of power and glory, and yet he would not become consul against the will of the people, although several occasions occurred when he might have been elected, but in his various appointments he always contrived, even when he had sole command, to share his power with others, while even when he had colleagues he kept all the glory for himself.", "3377": "His moderation prevented any one from grudging him power, while His successes were due to his genius, in which he confessedly surpassed all his countrymen.", "3378": "II.", "3379": "The family of the Furii was not a very illustrious one before Camillus gained glory in the great battle with the Æqui and Volsci, where he served under the dictator Postumius Tubertus.", "3380": "Riding out before the rest of the army, he was struck in the thigh by a dart, but tore it out, assailed the bravest of the enemy, and put them to flight.", "3381": "After this, amongst other honours he was ap­ pointed cenuor, an office of great dignity at that time.", "3382": "One admirable measure is recorded of his censorship, that by arguments and threatening them with fines he persuaded the unmarried citizens to marry the widow women, whose number was very great on account of the wars.", "3383": "Another measure to which he was forced was that of taxing orphans, who had hitherto been exempt from taxation.", "3384": "This was rendered necessary by the constant campaigns which were carried on at a great expense, and more especially by the siege of Veil.", "3385": "Some call the inhabitants of this city Veientani.", "3386": "It was the bulwark of Etruria, possessing as many fighting men as Rome itself;", "3387": "the citizens were rich, luxurious, and extravagant in their habits, and fought bravely many times for honour and for power against the Romans.", "3388": "At this period, having been defeated in several great battles, the people of Veii had given up any schemes of conquest, but had built strong and high walls, filled their city with arms and provisions, and all kinds of material of war, and fearlessly endured a siege, which was long, no doubt, but which became no less irksome and difficult to the besiegers.", "3389": "Accustomed as the Romans had been to make short campaigns in summer weather, and to spend their winters at home, they were now for the first time corn polled by their tribunes to establish forts and entrench their camp, and pass both summer and winter in the enemy's country for seven years in succession.", "3390": "The generals were complained of, and as they seemed to be carrying on the siege remissly, they were removed, and others appointed, among them Camillus, who was then tribune for the second time.", "3391": "But he effected nothing in the siege at that time, because he was sent to fight the Faliscans and Capenates, who had insulted the Roman territory throughout the war with Veil, when the Roman army was engaged elsewhere, but were now driven by Camillus with great loss to the shelter of their city walls.", "3392": "III.", "3393": "Alter this, while the war was at its height, much alarm was caused by the strange phenomenon seen at the Alban lake, which could not be accounted for on ordinary physical principles.", "3394": "The season was autumn, and the summer had not been remarkable for rain or for molst winds, so that many of the streams and marshes in Italy were quite dried up, and others held out with difficulty, while the rivers, as is usual in summer, were very low and deeply sunk in their bed.", "3395": "But the Alban lake, which is self-contained, lying as it does surrounded by fertile hills, began for no reason, except it may be the will of Heaven, to increase in volume and to encroach upon the hillsides near it, until it reached their very tops, rising quietly and without disturbance.", "3396": "At first the portent only amazed the shepherds and herdsmen of the neighbour­ hood ;", "3397": "but when the lake by the weight of its waters broke through the thin isthmus of land which restrained it, and poured down in a mighty stream through the fertile plains below to the sea, then not only the Romans, but all the people of Italy, thought it a portent of the gravest character.", "3398": "Much talk about it took place in the camp before Veil, so that the besieged also learned what was happening at the lake.", "3399": "IV.", "3400": "As always happens during a long siege, where there are frequent opportunities of intercourse between the two parties, one of the Romans had become intimate with a citizen of Veil, who was learned in legendary lore, and was even thought to have supernatural sources of infor­ mation.", "3401": "When this man heard of the overflowing of the lake, his Roman friend observed that he was overjoyed, and laughed at the idea of the siege being successful.", "3402": "The Roman told him that these were not the only por­ tents which troubled the Romans at the present time, but that there were others stranger than this, about which he should like to consult him, and, if possible, save himself in the common ruin of his country.", "3403": "The man eagerly attended to his discourse, imagining that he was about to hear some great secrets.", "3404": "The Roman thus decoyed him away farther and farther from the city gate, when he suddenly seized him and lifted him from the ground.", "3405": "Being the stronger man, and being assisted by several soldiers from the camp, he overpowered him, and brought him before the generals.", "3406": "Here the man, seeing that there was no escape, and that no one can resist his destiny, told them of the ancient oracles about his city, how it could not be taken until its enemies drove back the waters of the Alban lake, and prevented its joining the sea.", "3407": "When the senate heard this they were at a loss what to do, and determined to send an embassy to Delphi to enquire of the God.", "3408": "The embassy consisted of men of mark and importance, being Licinius Cossus, Valerius Potitus, and Fabius Ambustus.", "3409": "After a prosperous journey they returned with a response from Apollo, pointing out certain ceremonies which had been neglected in the feast of the Latin games, and bidding them, if possible, force the waters of the Alban lake away from the sea into its ancient course, or, if this could not be done, to divide the stream by canals and watercourses, and so to expend it in the plain.", "3410": "When the answer was brought back, the priests took the necessary steps about the sacrifices, while the people turned their attention to the diversion of the water.", "3411": "V.", "3412": "In the tenth year of the war, the Senate recalled all the rest of the generals, and made Camillus Dictator.", "3413": "He chose Cornelius Scipio to be his Master of the Knights, and made a vow to the gods, that, if he succeeded in bringing the war to a glorious close, he would celebrate a great festival, and build a shrine to the goddess whom the Romans call Mater Matuta.", "3414": "This goddess, from the rites with which she is worshipped, one would imagine to be the same as the Greek Leukothea.", "3415": "For they bring a slave girl into the temple and beat her, and then drive her out;", "3416": "they take their brothers' children in their arms in pre­ ference to their own, and generally their ceremonies seem to allude to the nursing of Bacchus, and to the misfortunes which befell Ino because of her husband's concubine.", "3417": "After this, Camillus invaded the Faliscan territory, and in a great battle overthrew that people, and the Capenates who came to their assistance.", "3418": "Next, he turned his atten­ tion to the siege of Veil, and, perceiving that it would be a difficult matter to take the city by assault, he ordered mines to be dug, as the ground near the walls was easily worked, and the mines could be sunk to a sufficient depth to escape the notice of the besieged.", "3419": "As this work suc­ ceeded to his wish, he made a demonstration above ground to call the enemy to the walls and distract their attention, while others made their way unperceived through the mine to the Temple of Juno in the citadel, the largest and most sacred edifice in the city.", "3420": "Here, it is said, was the King of the Veientines, engaged in sacrificing.", "3421": "The soothsayer inspected the entrails, and cried with a loud voice, that the goddess would give the victory to whoever offered that victim.", "3422": "The Romans in the mine, hearing these words, quickly tore up the floor, and burst through it with shouts and rattling arms.", "3423": "The enemy fled in terror, and they seized the victims and carried them to Camillus.", "3424": "However, this story sounds rather fabulous.", "3425": "The city was stormed, and the Romans carried off an enormous mass of plunder.", "3426": "Camillus, who viewed them from the citadel, at first stood weeping, but when con­ gratulated by the bystanders, raised his hands to heaven and said, \" Great Jupiter, and all ye other gods, that see all good and evil deeds alike, ye know that it is not in un­ righteous conquest, but in self-defence, that the Romans have taken this city of their lawless enemies.", "3427": "If,\" he continued, \"there awaits us any reverse of fortune to counterbalance this good luck, I pray that it may fall, not upon the city or army of Rome, but, as lightly as may be, upon my own head.\"", "3428": "After these words he turned round to the right, as is the Roman habit after prayer, and while turning, stumbled and fell.", "3429": "All those present were terri­ fied at the omen, but he recovered himself, saying that, as he had prayed, he had received a slight hurt to temper his great good fortune.", "3430": "VI.", "3431": "When the city was sacked, he determined to send the statue of Juno to Rome, according to his vow.", "3432": "When workmen were assembled for this purpose, he offered sacrifice, and prayed to the goddess to look kindly on his efforts, and to graciously take up her abode among the gods of Rome.", "3433": "It is said that the statue answered that it wished to do so, and approved of his proceedings.", "3434": "But Livy tells us that Camillus offered his prayers while touching the statue, and that some of the bystanders said, \" She consents, and is willing to come.\"", "3435": "However, those who insist on the supernatural form of the story have one great argument in their favour, in the marvellous fortune of Rome, which never could from such small beginnings have reached such a pitch of glory and power without many direct manifestations of the favour of Heaven.", "3436": "Moreover, other appearances of the same kind are to be compared with it, such as that statues have often been known to sweat, have been heard to groan, and have even turned away and shut their eyes, as has been related by many historians before our own time.", "3437": "And I have heard of many miraculous occurrences even at the present day, resting on evidence which cannot be lightly impugned.", "3438": "However, the weakness of human nature makes it equally dangerous to put too much faith in such matters or to entirely disbelieve them, as the one leads to superstition and folly, and the other to neglect and contempt of the­ gods.", "3439": "Our best course is caution, and the \" golden mean.\"", "3440": "VII.", "3441": "Camillus, either because he was elated by the magnificence of his exploit in having taken a city as large as Rome after a ten years' siege, or else because he had been so nattered by his admirers that his pride overcame his sober judgment, conducted his triumph with great ostentation, especially in driving through Rome in a chariot drawn by four whitehorses, which never was done by any general before or since, for this carriage is thought to be sacred to Jupiter, the king and father of the gods.", "3442": "The citizens, unaccustomed to splendour, were displeased with him for this, and their dislike was increased by his oppo-­ sition to the law for a redistribution of the people.", "3443": "The tri un proposed that the Senate and people should be­ divided into two parts,one of which should stay at Rome and the other remove to the captured city, because they would be more powerful if they possessed two great cities, instead of one, and held the land in common, still remain­ ing one nation.", "3444": "The lower classes, which were numerous and poor, eagerly took up the scheme, and continually clamoured round the speakers at the rostra, demanding to have it put to the vote.", "3445": "But the Senate and the nobles thought it wnR not a redistribution ,but the destruction of Rome which the tribunes were demanding, and in their anger rallied round Camillus.", "3446": "He, fearing to have a contest on the matter, kept putting off the people and inventing reasons for delay, so as to prevent the law being brought forward to be voted upon.", "3447": "This increased his unpopularity ;", "3448": "but the greatest and most obvious reason for the dislike which the people bore him arose from his demand for the tenth part of the spoils;", "3449": "very naturally, though perhaps he scarcely deserved it.", "3450": "On his way to Veil it seems he had made a vow, that if he took the city he would dedicate the tenth part of the spoil to Apollo.", "3451": "But when the city was taken and plundered, he either was unwilling to interfere with his countrymen, or else forgot his vow, and allowed them to enrich themselves with the booty.", "3452": "Afterwards, when he had laid down his dictator­ ship, he brought the matter before the Senate, and the soothsayers declared that the victims for sacrifice showed, when inspected, that the gods were angry and must be propitiated.", "3453": "VIII.", "3454": "The Senate decreed, not that the plunder should be given up, for that would have been scarcely possible to carry out, but that those who had taken any should be put on their oath, and contribute a tenth part of its value.", "3455": "This measure bore very hardly upon the soldiers, poor hard- working men, who were now compelled to repay so large a proportion of what they had earned and spent.", "3456": "Camillus was clamorously assailed by them, and, having no better excuse to put forward, made the extraordinary statement that he had forgotten his vow when the city was plundered.", "3457": "The people angrily said that he had vowed to offer up a tithe of the enemy's property, but that he really was taking a tithe from the citizens instead.", "3458": "However, all the contributions were made, and it was determined that with them a golden bowl should be made and sent to Apollo at Delphi.", "3459": "There was a scarcity of gold in the city, and while the government were deliberating how it was to be obtained, the matrons held a meeting among themselves, and offered their golden ornaments to make the offering, which came to eight talents' weight of gold.", "3460": "The Senate rewarded them by permitting them to have a funeral oration pro­ nounced over their graves the same as men;", "3461": "for hitherto it had not been customary at Rome to make any speeches at the funerals of women.", "3462": "They also chose three of the noblest citizens to travel with the offering, and sent them in a well-manned ship of war, splendidly equipped.", "3463": "Both storms and calms at sea are said to be dangerous, and they chanced on this occasion to come very near destruction, and miraculously escaped, for in a calm off the Æolian Islands they were assailed by Liparian triremes, who took them for pirates.", "3464": "At their earnest entreaty these people forbore to run down their vessel, but took it in tow and brought it into their harbour, where they treated it as a piratical craft, and put up the crew and the property on board for sale by public auction.", "3465": "With great difficulty, by the goodness and influence of one man, Timesitheos, a general, they obtained their release, and were allowed to proceed.", "3466": "Timesitheos even launched some ships of his own, with which he escorted them to Delphi, where he also took part in the ceremony of consecration.", "3467": "In return for his services, as was only just, he received special honours at Rome.", "3468": "IX.", "3469": "The tribunes of the people again began to agitate about the redistribution of land and occupation of Veii, but a war with the Faliscans gave the leading men a seasonable opportunity to elect magistrates after their own hearts for the coming year.", "3470": "Camillus was appointed military tribune, with five others, as it was thought that the State req uired ageneral of tried experience.", "3471": "At the decree of the Senate, Camillus raised a force and invaded the Faliscan territory.", "3472": "He now besieged Falerii, a strong city well provided with all munitions of war, which he considered it would be a work of no small time and labour to take;", "3473": "but he was desirous of employing the people in a long siege, to prevent their having leisure for factious proceedings at home.", "3474": "This was ever the policy of the Romans, to work off the elements of internal strife in attacks on their neighbours.X.", "3475": "The Faliscans thought so little of the siege, from the strength of their defences, that, except when on duty on the walls, they used to walk about their city in their ordinary dress, and their children were sent regularly to school, and used to be taken by their master to walk and take exercise outside the walls.", "3476": "For the Faliscans, like the Greeks, had one common school, as they wished all their children to be brought up together.", "3477": "The school­ master determined to betray these boys to the enemy, and led them outside the walls for exercise every day, and then led them back again.", "3478": "By this means he gradually accustomed them to going out as if there was no danger, until finally he took all the boys and handed them over to the Roman pickets, bidding them bring him to Camillus.", "3479": "When he was brought before him he said that he was a schoolmaster, that he preferred the favour of Camillus to his duty, and that he came to hand over to him the city of Falerii in the persons of these boys.", "3480": "Camillus was very much shocked.", "3481": "He said that war is indeed harsh, and is carried on by savage and unrighteous means, but yet there are laws of war which are observed by good men, and one ought not so much to strive for victory, as to forego advantages gained by wicked and villainous means:", "3482": "thus a truly great general ought to succeed by his own warlike virtues, not by the baseness of others.", "3483": "Having spoken thus, he ordered his slaves to tear the schoolmaster's clothes, tie his hands behind his back, and give the boys sticks and scourges with which to drive him back to the city.", "3484": "The Faliscans had just discovered the treachery of their schoolmaster, and, as may be expected, the whole city was filled with mourning at such a calamity, men and women together running in confusion to the gates and walls of the city, when the boys drove in their schoolmaster with blows and insults, calling Camillus their saviour, their father, and their god.", "3485": "Not only those who were parents, but all the citizens were struck with admiration at the goodness of Camillus.", "3486": "They at once assembled, and despatched ambassadors, putting themselves unreservedly in his hands.", "3487": "These men Camillus sent on to Rome, where they stated before the Senate, that the Romans, by preferring justice to conquest, had taught them to prefer submission to freedom, although they did not think that they fell short of the Romans in strength so much as in virtue.", "3488": "The Senate referred the ambassadors to Camillus for their first answer;", "3489": "and he, after receiving a contribution in money, and having made a treaty of alliance with the Faliscans, drew off his forces.", "3490": "XI.", "3491": "But the soldiers, who had been looking forward to plundering Falerii, when they returned to Rome empty handed, abused Camillus to the other citizens, saying that he was a hater of the people, and grudged poor men a chance of enriching themselves.", "3492": "When the tribunes re­ introduced the proposal of redistribution of the land, and removing half the city to Veil, Camillus openly, without caring how unpopular he became, opposed the measure.", "3493": "The people, sorely against their will, gave up the measure, but hated Camillus so fiercely that even his domestic afflictions (for he had just lost one of his two sons by sickness) could not move them to pity.", "3494": "Being of a kind and loving nature, he was dreadfully cast down at this misfortune, and spent all his time within doors mourning with the women of his family, while his enemies were preparing an impeachment against im.", "3495": "XII.", "3496": "His accuser was Lucius Apuleius, and the charge brought against him was embezzlement of the spoils of Etruria.", "3497": "He was even said to have in his possession some brazen gates which were taken in that country.", "3498": "The people were much excited against him, and it was clear that, whatever the charge against him might be, they would condemn him.", "3499": "Consequently he assembled his friends and comrades, who were a great number in all, and begged them not to permit him to be ruined by false accusations, and made a laughing-stock to his enemies.", "3500": "But when his friends, after consulting together, answered that they did not think that they could prevent his being condemned, but that they would assist him to pay any fine that might be imposed, he, unable to bear such treatment, determined in a rage to leave Rome and go into exile.", "3501": "He embraced his wife and son, and walked from his house silently as far as the gate of the city.", "3502": "There he turned back, and, stretching out his hands towards the Capitol, prayed to the gods that, if he was driven out of Rome unjustly by the insolence and hatred of the people, the Romans might soon repent of their conduct to him, and appear before the world begging him to return, and longing for their Camillus back again.", "3503": "XIII.", "3504": "Like Achilles, he thus cursed his countrymen and left them.", "3505": "His cause was undefended, and in his absence he was condemned to pay a fine of fifteen thousand aMes, which in Greek money is fifteen hundred drachmae, for the as was the Roman coin at that time, and con­ sequently ten copper ases were called a denarius.", "3506": "Every Roman believes that the prayers of Camillus were quickly heard by Justice, and that a terrible retribu­ tiun was exacted for his wrongs, which filled all men'a mouths at that time;", "3507": "so terrible a fate befell Rome, with such destruction, danger, and disgrace, whether it arose from mere chance, or whether it be the office of some god to punish those who requite virtue with ingratitude.", "3508": "XIV.", "3509": "The first omen of impending evil was the death of Julius the Censor;", "3510": "for the Romans reverence theoffice of censor, and account it sacred.", "3511": "Another omen was that, a short time before Camillus went into exile, one Marcus Cædicius, a man of no particular note, and not even a senator, but a thoroughly respectable man, corn­ niunicated a matter of some importance to the tribunes of the people.", "3512": "He said that the night before he had been walking along what is called the New Road, when some one called him by name.", "3513": "He turned round and could see no one, but heard a voice louder than man's say, \"Go, Marcus Cædicius, tell the government early in the morn­ ing that in a short time they may expect the Gauls.\"", "3514": "When the tribunes of the people heard this they laughed him to scorn, and shortly afterwards Camillus left the city.", "3515": "X V.

of Europe.", "3517": "The other body established themselves between the Pyrenees and the Alps, and for a long time dwelt near the Senones and Celtorii.", "3518": "At last they tasted wine, which was then for the first time brought thither out of Italy.", "3519": "In an ecstasy of delight at the drink they wildly snatched up their arms, took their families with them, and rushed to the Alps in search of the country which produced such fruits as this, considering all other countries to be savage and uncultivated.", "3520": "The man who first introduced wine among them and encouraged them to proceed to Italy was said to be one Aruns, an Etruscan of some note, who, though a well-meaning man, had met with the following misfortune.", "3521": "He had been left guardian to an orphan named Lucumo, one of the richest and handsomest of his countrymen.", "3522": "This boy lived in the house of Aruns from his childhood, and when he grew up he would not leave it, but pretended to delight in his society.", "3523": "It was long before Aruns discovered that Lucumo had debauched his wife, and that their passion was mutual;", "3524": "but at length they were unable any longer to conceal their intrigue, and the youth openly attempted to carry off the woman from her husband.", "3525": "He went to law, but was unable to contend with the numerous friends and great wealth of Lucumo, and so left the country.", "3526": "Hearing about the Gauls, he went to them and incited them to invade Italy.XVI.", "3527": "They immediately made themselves masters of the country, which reaches from the Alps down to the sea on both sides of Italy, which in ancient times belonged to the Etruscans, as we see by the names, for the upper sea is called the Adriatic from Adria, an Etruscan city, and the lower is called the Etruscan Sea.", "3528": "It is a thickly wooded country, with plenty of pasturage, and well watered.", "3529": "At that period it contained eighteen fair and large cities, with a

from their siege and held a conference with them.", "3536": "The Romans inquired what wrong the Gauls had suffered from the people of Clusium that they should attack their city.", "3537": "To this Brennus, the king of the Gauls, answered with a laugh, \" The people of Clusium wrong us by holding a large territory, although they can only inhabit and cultivate a small one, while they will not give a share of it to us, who are numerous and poor.", "3538": "You Romans were wronged in just the same way in old times by the people of Alba, and Fidenae, and Ardea, and at the present day by the

sharp, and the flashing of his arms prevented his face being clearly seen.", "3547": "But when he slew his antagonist and jumped down from his horse to strip his body of its spoils, Brennus recognised him, and called the gods to witness his violation of the common law of all nations, in coming to them as an ambassador and fighting against them as an enemy.", "3548": "He immediately put a stop to the battle and took no further heed of the people of Clusium, but directed his army against Rome.", "3549": "However, as he did not wish it to be thought that the bad conduct of the Somanspleased the Gauls, who only wanted apretext for hostilities, he sent and demanded that Fabius should be delivered up to him to be punished, and at the same time led his army slowly forwards.", "3550": "XVIII.", "3551": "At Rome the Senate was called together, and many blamed Fabius, while those priests who are called Feciales urged the Senate in the name of religion to throw the whole blame of what had happened upon one guilty head, and, by delivering him up, to clear the rest of the city from sharing his guilt.", "3552": "These Feciales were insti­ tuted by the mildest and justest of the kings of Rome, Numa Pompilius, to be guardians of peace, and examiners of the reasons which justify a nation in going to war.", "3553": "However the Senate referred the matter to the people, and when the priests repeated their charges against Fabius before them, the people so despised and slighted religion as to appoint Fabius and his brothers military tribunes.", "3554": "The Gauls, when they heard this, were enraged, and hur­ ried on, disregarding everything but speed.", "3555": "The nations through which they passed, terrified at their glancing arms and their strength and courage, thought that their land was indeed lost and that their cities would at once be taken, but to their wonder and delight the Gauls did them no hurt, and took nothing from their fields, but marched close by their cities, calling out that they were marching against Rome, and were at war with the Romans only, and held all other men to be their friends.", "3556": "To meet this impetuous rush, the military tribunes led out the Romans, who, in numbers indeed were quite a match for the Gauls, for they amounted to no less than forty thousand heavy- armed men, but for the most part untrained and serving for the first time.", "3557": "Besides this disadvantage, they neglected the duties -of­ religion,for they neither made the usual sacrifices nor consulted the soothsayers.", "3558": "Confusion also was produced by the number of commanders, though frequently before this, in much less important campaigns, they had chosen single generals, whom they called dictators, as they knew that nothing is so important at a dangerous crisis as that all should unanimously and in good order obey the com­ mands of one irresponsible chief.", "3559": "And the unfair treat­ ment which Camillus had received now bore disastrous fruits, for no man dared to use authority except to flatter and gain the favour of the people.", "3560": "They proceeded about eleven miles from the city, and halted for the night on the banks of the river Allia, which joins the Tiber not far from where their camp was pitched.", "3561": "Here the barbarians appeared, and, after an unskilfully managed battle, the want of discipline of the Romans caused their ruin.", "3562": "The Gauls drove the left wing into the river and destroyed it, but the right of the army, which took refuge in the hills to avoid the enemy's charge on level ground, suffered less, and most of them reached the city safely.", "3563": "The rest, who survived after the enemy were weary of slaughter, took refuge at Veil, imagining that all was over with Rome.", "3564": "XIX.", "3565": "This battle took place about the summer solstice at the time of full moon, on the very day on which in former times the great disaster betel the Fabii, when three hundred of that race were slain by the Etruscans.", "3566": "But this defeat wiped out the memory of the former one, and the day was always afterwards called that of the ARia, from the river of that name.", "3567": "It is a vexed question whether we ought to consider some days unlucky, or whether Herakleitus was right in rebuking Hesiod for calling some days good and some bad, because he knew not that the nature of all days is the same.", "3568": "However the mention of a few remarkable instances is germane to the matter of which we are treating.", "3569": "It happened that on the fifth day of the Boeotian month Hippodromios, which the Athenians call Hekatombeion,* two signal victories were won by the Bœotians, both of which restored liberty to Greece;", "3570": "one, when they con­ quered the Spartans at Leuktra, and the other, when, more than two hundred years before this, they conquered the Thessalians under Lattamyas at Keressus.", "3571": "Again, the Persians were beaten by the Greeks on the sixth of Boedromion at Marathon, and on the third they were beaten both at Platæa and at Mykale, and at Arbela on the twenty-fifth of the same month.", "3572": "The Athenians too won their naval victory under Chabrias at Naxos on the full moon of Boedromion, and that of Salamis on the twentieth of that month, as I have explained in my treatise 4 On Days.", "3573": "'", "3574": "The month of Thargelion evidently brings misfortune to the barbarians, for Alexander defeated the Persian king's generals on the Granicus in Thargelion, and the Carthaginians were defeated by Timoleon in Sicily on the twenty-seventh of Thargelion, at which same time Troy is believed to have been taken, according to Ephorus, Kallisthenes, Damastes and l'hylarchus.", "3575": "On the other hand, the month Metageitnion, which the Bœotians call Panemos, is unfavourable to the Greeks, for on the seventh of that month they were defeated by Antipater at Kranon and utterly ruined;", "3576": "and before that, were defeated during that month by Philip at Chaeronea.", "3577": "And on that same day and month and year Archidamus and his troops, who had crossed over into Italy, were cut to pieces by the natives.", "3578": "The twenty-first day of that month is also observed by the Carthaginians as that which has always brought the heaviest misfortunes upon them.", "3579": "And I am well aware that at the time of the celebration of the mysteries Thebes was destroyed for the second time by Alexander, and that after this Athens was garrisoned by Macedonian soldiers on the twentieth of Boedromion, on which day they bring out the mystic Iacchus in procession.", "3580": "And similarly the Romans, undei the command of Cæpio, on that same day lost their camp to the Gauls, and afterwards, under Lucullus, defeated Tigranes and the Armenians.", "3581": "King Attalus and Pompeiu the Great died on their own birthdays.", "3582": "And I could mention many others, who have had both good and evil fortune on the same anniversaries.", "3583": "But the Romans regard that day as especially unlucky, and on account of it, two other days in every month are thought so, as superstitious feeling is increased by misfortune.", "3584": "This subject I have treated at greater length in my treatise on 4 Roman Questions.'XX.", "3585": "If, after the battle, the Gauls had at once followed up the fugitives, nothing could have prevented their taking Rome and destroying every one who was left in it;", "3586": "such terror did the beaten troops produce when they reached home, and such panic fear seized upon every one.", "3587": "How­ ever the barbarians scarcely believed in the completeness of their victory, and betook themselves to making merry over their success and to dividing the spoils taken in the Roman camp, so that they afforded those who left the city time to effect their escape, and those who remained in it time to recover their courage and make preparations for standing a siege.", "3588": "They abandoned all but the Capitol to the enemy, and fortified it with additional ramparts and stores of missiles.", "3589": "One of their first acts was to convey most of their holy things into the Capitol, while the Vestal virgins took the sacred fire and their other sacred objects and fled with them from the city.", "3590": "Some indeed say that nothing is entrusted to them except the eternal fire, which King Numa appointed to be worshiped as the origin of all things.", "3591": "For fire has the liveliest motion of anything in nature;", "3592": "and everything is produced by motion or with some kind of motion.", "3593": "All other parts of matter when heat is absent lie useless and apparently dead, requir­ ing the power of fire as the breath of life, to call them into existence and make them capable of action.", "3594": "Numa therefore, being a learned man and commonly supposed on account of his wisdom to hold communion with the Muses, consecrated fire, and ordered it to be kept unquenched for ever as an emblem of the eternal power that orders all things.", "3595": "Others say that, as among the Greeks, a purificatory fire burns before the temple, but that within are other holy things which no man may see, except only the virgins, who are named Vestals;", "3596": "and a very wide-spread notion is, that the famous Trojan Palladium, which was brought to Italy by AEneas, is kept there.", "3597": "Others say that the Samothracian gods are there, whom Dardanus brought to Troy after he had founded it, and caused to be worshipped there, which, after the fall of Troy, Æneas carried off and kept until he settled in Italy.", "3598": "But those who pretend to know most about such matters say that there are two jars of no great size in the temple, one open and empty, and the other full and sealed, and that these may be seen only by the holy virgins.", "3599": "Others think that this is a mistake, arising from the fact that, at the time of which we are treating, the Vestal virgins placed most of their sacred things in two jars and concealed them in the earth under the Temple of Quirinus, which place even to the present day is called the Doliola, or place of the jars.", "3600": "XXI.", "3601": "However this may be, the Vestals took the most important of their holy things and betook themselves to night along the Tiber.", "3602": "Here Lucius Albinus, a plebian, was journeying among the fugitives, with his wife and infant children and their few necessaries in a waggon.", "3603": "When he saw the Vestal virgins, without any attendants, journeying on foot and in distress, carrying in their bosoms the sacred images of the gods, he at once re­ moved his wife, children, and property from the waggon and handed it over to them, to escape into one of the Greek cities in Italy.", "3604": "The piety of Albums and his care for the duties of religion at so terrible a crisis deserve to be recorded.", "3605": "The rest of the priests and the old men who had been consuls, and been honoured with triumphs, could not bear to leave the city.", "3606": "At the instance of Fabius, the Pontifex Maximus, they put on their sacred vestments and robes of state, and after offering prayer to the gods, as if they were consecrating themselves as victims to be offered on behalf of their country, they sat down in their ivory chairs in the Forum in full senatorial costume, and waited what fortune might befal them.", "3607": "XXII.", "3608": "On the third day after the battle Brennus appeared, leading his army to attack the city.", "3609": "At first, seeing the gates open and no guards on the walls, he feared some ambuscade, as he could not believe that the Romans had so utterly despaired of themselves.", "3610": "When he discovered the truth, he marched through the Colline Gate, and captured Rome, a little more than three hundred and sixty years after its foundation, if we can believe that any accurate record has been kept of those periods whose confusion has produced such difficulties in the chronology of later times.", "3611": "However, an indistinct rumour of the fall of Rome seems at once to have reached Greece :", "3612": "for Herakleides of Pontus, who lived about that time, speaks in his book '", "3613": "On the Spirit,' of a rumour from the west that an army had come from the Hyperboreans and had sacked a Greek colony called Rome, which stood somewhere in that direction, near the great ocean.", "3614": "Now, as Herakleides was fond of strange legends, I should not be surprised if he adorned the original true tale of the capture of the city with these accessories of \" the Hyper­ boreans\" and the great ocean.\"", "3615": "Aristotle, the philo­ sopher, had evidently heard quite accurately that the city was taken by the Gauls, but he says that it was saved by one Lucius:", "3616": "now Camillus's name was Marcus, not Lucius.", "3617": "All this, however, was pure conjecture.", "3618": "Brennus, after taking possession of Rome, posted a force to watch the Capitol, and himself went down to the Forum, and wondered at the men who sat there silent, with all their ornaments, how they neither rose from their seats at the approach of the enemy, nor changed colour, but sat leaning on their staffs with fearless con­ fidence, quietly looking at one another.", "3619": "The Gauls were astonished at so strange a sight, and for a long time they forbore to approach and touch them, as if they were superior beings.", "3620": "But when one of them ventured to draw near to Marcus Papirius and gently stroke his long beard, Papirius struck him on the head with his staff, at which the barbarian drew his sword and slew him.", "3621": "Upon this they fell upon the rest and killed them, with any other Romans whom they found, and spent many days in plundering the houses, after which they burned them and pulled them down in their rage at the men in the Capitol, because they would not surrender, but drove them back when they assaulted it.", "3622": "For this reason they wreaked their vengeance on the city, and put to death all their captives, men and women, old and young alike.", "3623": "XXIII.", "3624": "As the siege was a long one, the Gauls began to want for provisions.", "3625": "They divided themselves into two bodies, one of which remained with the king and carried on the siege, while the others scoured the country, plundering and destroying the villages, not going all together in a body, but scattered in small detachments in various directions, as their elation at their success caused them to have no fear about separating their forces.", "3626": "Their largest and best disciplined body marched towards Ardea, where Camillus, since his banishment, had lived as a private person.", "3627": "All his thoughts, however, were bent not upon avoiding or fleeing from the Gauls, but upon defeating them if possible.", "3628": "And so, seeing that the people of Ardea were sufficient in numbers, but wanting in confidence because of the want of experience and remissness of their leaders, he first began to tell the younger men that they ought not to ascribe the mis­ fortunes of the Romans to the bravery of the Gauls, for the misconduct of the former had given them a triumph which they did not deserve.", "3629": "It would, he urged, be a glorious thing, even at the risk of some danger, to drive away a tribe of savage barbarians, who if they were victorious always exterminated the vanquished:", "3630": "while, if they only showed bravery and confidence, he could, by watching his opportunity, lead them to certain victory.", "3631": "As the younger men eagerly listened to these words, Camillus proceeded to confer with the chief magistrates of the Ardeates.", "3632": "After obtaining their consent also, he armed all those who were capable of service, but kept them within the walls, as he wished to conceal their presence from the enemy who were now close at hand.", "3633": "But when the Gauls after scouring the country returned laden with plunder and carelessly encamped in the plain, and when at night by the influence of wine and sleep all was quiet in their camp, Camillus, who had learned the state of the case from spies, led out the men of Ardea, and marching over the intervening ground in silence, about midnight attacked their entrenched camp with loud shouts and blasts of his trumpet, which threw the Gauls, half-drunk and heavy with sleep as they were, into great confusion.", "3634": "Few recovered their senses so far as to attempt to resist Camillus, and those few fell where they stood;", "3635": "but most -or them were slain as they lay helpless with wine and sleep.", "3636": "Such as escaped from the camp and wandered about the fields were despatched by cavalry the next day.", "3637": "XXIV.", "3638": "Jhe fame of this action, when noised among the neighbouring cities, called many men to arms, especially those Romans wno had escaped to Veil after the battle of the Allia.", "3639": "These men lamented their fate, saying, \" What a general has Providence removed from Rome in Camillus, whose successes now bring glory to Ardea, while the city that produced and brought up so great a man has utterly perished.", "3640": "And now we, for want of a general to lead us, are sitting still inside the walls of a city not our own, and giving up Italy to the enemy.", "3641": "Come, let us send to the men of Ardea, and beg their general of them, or else our­ selves take up our arms and march to him.", "3642": "He is no longer an exile, nor are we any longer his countrymen, for our country is ours DO more, but is in the hands of the enemy.", "3643": "\"This was agreed, and they sent to beg Camillus to become their general.", "3644": "But he refused, saying that be would not do so without a decree from the citizens in the Capitol;", "3645": "for they as long as they survived, represented the city of Rome, and therefore although he would gladly obey their commands, he would not be so officious as to inter­ fere against their will.", "3646": "The soldiers admired the honour­ able scruples of Camillus, but there was a great difficulty in representing them to the garrison of the Capitol;", "3647": "indeed, it seemed altogether impossible for a messenger to reach the citadel while the city was in the possession of the enemy.", "3648": "XXV.", "3649": "One of the younger Romans, Pontius Cominius, of the middle class of citizens, but with an honourable ambition to distinguish himself, undertook the adventure.", "3650": "He would not take any writing to the garrison, for fear that if he were taken the enemy might discover Camillus's plans.", "3651": "He dressed himself in poor clothes, with corks concealed under them, and performed most of the journey fearlessly by daylight, but when he came near the city he went by night.", "3652": "As it was impossible to cross the river by the bridge, which was held by the Gauls, he wrapped what few clothes he had round his head, and trusted to his corks to float him over to the city.", "3653": "After he had landed, he walked round, observing by the lights and the noise where the Gauls were most wakeful, until he reached the Carmentan Gate, where all was quiet.", "3654": "At this place the Capitolian Hill forms a steep and precipitous crag, up which he climbed by a hollow in the cliff, and joined the garrison.", "3655": "After greeting them and making known his name, he proceeded to an interview with the leading men.", "3656": "A meeting of the Senate was called, at which he recounted Camillus's victory, which they had not heard of, and ex­ plained the determination of the soldiers.", "3657": "He then begged them to confirm Camillus s appointment as general, be­ cause the citizens without the walls would obey no other.", "3658": "When the Senate heard this, they deliberated, and finally appointed Camillus dictator, and sent back Pontius by the same way that he came, which he was able to accomplish as fortunately as before.", "3659": "He eluded the Gauls, and brought the decree of the senate to the Romans outside the walls.", "3660": "XXVI.", "3661": "They heard the news with enthusiasm, so that Camillus when he came, found that they already numbered twenty thousand, while he drew many additional troops from the neighbouring friendly cities.", "3662": "Thus was Camillus a second time appointed dictator, and, proceeding to Veii.", "3663": "joined the soldiers there, to whom he added many others from the allies, and prepared to attack the enemy.", "3664": "Bat meanwhile at Rome, some of the Gauls happening to pass by the place where Pontius climbed up the Capitol, noticed in many places the marks of where he had clutched at the rock with his hands and feet, torn off the plants which grew upon it, and thrown down the mould.", "3665": "They brought the news to the king, who came and viewed the place.", "3666": "He said nothing at the time, but in the evening he called together those Gauls who were lightest and most ac­ customed to climb mountains, and thus addressed them :", "3667": "\"", "3668": "The road up the rock, which we by ourselves could not discover, has been proved by our enemies not to be impassable to men, and it would be disgraceful for us after having begun so well to leave our enterprise in­ complete, and to give up the place as impregnable after the enemy themselves have shown us how it may be taken.", "3669": "Where it is easy for one man to climb, it cannot be hard for many to climb one by one, as their numbers will give them confidence and mutual support.", "3670": "Suitable honours and presents will be given to those who distinguish them­ selves.", "3671": "\"XXVII.", "3672": "After this speech of their king, the Gauls eagerly volunteered for the assault, and about midnight many of them climbed silently up the rock, which although rough and precipitous was easier of ascent than they had imagined, so that the first of them reached the top, and were on the point of preparing to attack the rampart and its sleeping garrison, for neither men nor dogs noticed them.", "3673": "But there were sacred geese kept in the temple of Juno, which in other times were fed without stint, but which then, as there was scarcely food enough for the men, were somewhat neglected.", "3674": "These birds are naturally quick of hearing and timid, and now being rendered wakeful and wild by hunger, quickly perceived the Gauls climbing up, and rushing noisily to the place woke the garri­ son, while the Gauls feeling that they were discovered no longer preserved silence, but violently assaulted the place.", "3675": "The Romans, snatching up whatever arms came first to hand, ran to repulse them:", "3676": "and first of all Manlius, a man of consular rank, strong of body and full of courage, fell in with two of the enemy.", "3677": "As one of them lifted up his battleaxe, Manlius cut off his right hand with his sword, while he dashed his shield into the other's face, and threw him backwards down the cliff.", "3678": "After this he stood upon the wall, and with the help of those who assembled round him, beat off the rest, for not many had reached the top, or effected anything commensurate with the boldness of the attempt.", "3679": "Having thus escaped the danger, the Romans threw their sentinel down the rock ;", "3680": "while on Manlius they conferred by vote a reward for his bravery, intended more for honour than advantage;", "3681": "for each man gave him a day's rations, which consisted of half a Roman pound of meal, and the fourth part of a Greek cotyle of wine.", "3682": "XXVIII.", "3683": "This affair disheartened the Gauls, who were also in want of provisions, for they could not forage as before for fear of Camillus, while disease also crept in among them, encamped as they were in the ruins of Rome among heaps of dead bodies, while the deep layer of ashes became blown by the wind into the air, making it dry and harsh, and the vapours of the conflagrations were injurious to breathe.", "3684": "They were especially distressed by the change from a cloudy country where there are plenty of shady retreats, to the flat burning plains of Rome in autumn, and their siege of the Capitol became wearisome, for they had now beleaguered it for seven months;", "3685": "so that there was much sickness in their camp, and so many died that they no longer buried the dead.", "3686": "Yet for all this the besieged fared no better.", "3687": "Hunger pressed them, and their ignorance of what Camillus was doing disheartened them;", "3688": "for no one could reach them with news, because the city was strictly watched by Gauls.", "3689": "As both parties were in these straits, proposals for a capitulation took place;", "3690": "at first among the outposts on both sides;", "3691": "afterwards the chief men on each side.", "3692": "Brennus, the Gaulish king, and Sulpicius the Roman tribune, met, and it was agreed that the Romans should pay a thousand pounds of gold, and that the Gauls should, on receiving it, at once leave the country.", "3693": "Both parties swore to observe these conditions, but when the gold was being weighed, the Gauls at first tampered with the scales unperceived, and then openly pulled the beam, so that the Romans became angry.", "3694": "But at this Brennus insolently took off his sword and belt, and flung them into the scale;", "3695": "and when Sulpicius asked, \" What is this ? \" \"", "3696": "What should it be,\" replied the Gaul;", "3697": "\" but woe to the vanquished ! \"", "3698": "At this some of the Romans were angry and thought that they ought to take back their gold into the Capitol, and again endure the siege;", "3699": "while others said that they must put up with insults, provided they were not too out­ rageous, and not think that there was any additional disgrace in paying more than they had agreed, because in paying any ransom at all, they were acting from sheer necessity rather than feelings of honour.", "3700": "XXIX.", "3701": "While the Romans were thus disputing with the Gauls, and with one another, Camillus with his army was at the gates.", "3702": "Learning what was being done, he ordered the mass of his soldiers to follow him quietly and in good order, and himself pushed on with the picked troops to join the Romans, who all made way for him, and received him as dictator with silence and respect.", "3703": "He then took the gold from the scales and gave it to his victors, and ordered the Gauls to take the scales and the beam, and depart, \" for,\" said he, \" it is the custom of the Romans to defend their country not with gold but with iron.\"", "3704": "At this Brennus became angry, and said that he was being wronged by the treaty being broken;", "3705": "and Camillus answered that the negotiations were illegal, because when they began he was already dictator, and therefore, as no one else had any authority, the treaty had been made by the Gauls with persons who were not authorized to treat.", "3706": "But now, if they wished, they might make fresh proposals, for he was come with full legal powers to pardon such as made their submission, and to punish unrepentant evil-doers.", "3707": "Enraged at this, Brennus began to skirmish, and the two parties, mixed up as they were, in houses and lands where no military formation was possible, did go so far as to draw their swords and push one another about;", "3708": "but Brennus soon recovered his temper, and drew off the Gauls, with but little loss, in their camp.", "3709": "During the night he got them all under arms, left the city, and, after a march of about eight miles, encamped by the side of the Gabinian Road.", "3710": "But at daybreak, Camillus was upon him, in glittering armour, leading on the Romans who had now recovered their courage.", "3711": "After a long and fiercely contested battle they routed the Gauls and took their camp.", "3712": "Some of the fugitives were at once pursued and slain, but most of them straggled about the country, and were put to death by the people of the neighbouring towns and villages who sallied out upon them.", "3713": "XXX.", "3714": "Thus was Rome strangely taken, and yet more strangely preserved, after having been for seven months in the possession of the Gauls, for they entered it a few days after the Ides of Quintilis, and left it about the Ides of February.", "3715": "Camillus, as we may easily imagine, entered the city in a triumph, as the- saviour of his lost country, and the restorer of Rome to itself;", "3716": "for as he drove into the city he was accompanied by those who had before left it, with their wives and children, while those who had been besieged in the Capitol, and all but starved there, came out to meet him embracing one another, weeping, and scarcely believing in their present happiness.", "3717": "The priests and servants of the gods also appeared with such of the sacred things as they had saved, either by burying them on the spot, or by carrying them away, and now displayed these images, which had not been seen for so long a time, to the citizens, who greeted them with joy, as if the gods themselves were again returning to Rome.", "3718": "Camillus performed a sacrifice to the gods, and purified the city in the manner recommended by experts, and then proceeded to restore all the previously existing temples, while he himself added another to Aim Loquutius, or Rumour, having carefully sought out the place at which the voice in the night miraculously foretold the coming of the Gaulish host to Marcus Cædicius.", "3719": "XXXI.", "3720": "With great difficulty the sites of the temples were cleared of rubbish by the zeal of Camillus and the labour of the priests;", "3721": "but as the city was utterly destroyed, and re­ quired to be entirely rebuilt, the people became disheartened at so great an undertaking.", "3722": "Men who had lost their all were inclined to wait, and indeed required rest after their misfortunes, rather than labours and toils, which neither their bodies nor their purses were able to endure.", "3723": "And thus it came to pass that they turned their thoughts a second time towards Veil, a city which stood quite ready to be inhabited.", "3724": "This gave opportunities to their mob orators to make speeches, as usual, which they knew would be pleasing to the people, in which Camillus was disrespectfully spoken of as depriving them of a city which stood ready to receive them, for his own prviate ambition, and was said to be compelling them to live encamped in the midst of ruins, and re-erect their houses in that vast heap of ashes, all in order that he might be called, not merely the leader and general of Rome, but might usurp the place of Romulus and be called her founder.", "3725": "Fearing disturbances, the Senate would not permit Camillus to lay down his dictatorship for a year, although he wished to do so, and although no dictator before this had ever remained in office for more than six months.", "3726": "In the meantime the senators themselves en­ couraged and consoled the people by personal appeals, pointing to the tombs and monuments of their ancestors, and recalling to their minds the temples and holy places which Romulus and Numa and the other kings had consecrated and left in charge to them.", "3727": "More especially they dwelt upon the omen of the newly severed head which had been found when the foundations of the Capitol were dug, by which it was proved that that spot was fated to become the head of Italy, and the fire of Vesta which the virgins had relighted after the war, and which it would be a disgrace for them to extinguish, and to abandon the city, whether they were to see it inhabited by foreigners or turned into fields for cattle to feed in.", "3728": "While per­ sistently urging these considerations both in public speeches and in private interviews with the people, they were much affected by the lamentations of the poor over their helpless condition.", "3729": "The people begged that, as they had, like people after a shipwreck, saved their lives and nothing else, they might not, in addition to this misfortune, be compelled to put together the ruins of a city which had been utterly destroyed, while another was standing ready to receive them.", "3730": "XXXII.", "3731": "Under these circumstances, Camillus deter­ mined to debate the question publicly.", "3732": "He himself made a long appeal on behalf of his native place, and many other speeches were delivered.", "3733": "Finally he rose, and bade Lucius Lucretius, whose privilege it was, to vote first, and then after him the rest in order.", "3734": "Silence was enforced, and Lucretius was just on the point of voting when a centurion in command of a detachment of the guard of the day marched by, and in a loud voice called to the standard- bearer :", "3735": "\"", "3736": "Pitch the standard here:", "3737": "here it is best for us to stay.\"", "3738": "When these words were heard so opportunely in the midst of their deliberations about the future, Lucretius reverently said that he accepted the omen, and gave his vote in accordance with it, and his example was followed by all the rest.", "3739": "The people now showed a strange revulsion of feeling, for they encouraged one another to begin the work of rebuilding, not on any regular plan, but just as each man happened to find a convenient place for his work.", "3740": "Consequently they quickly rebuilt the city, for within a year it is said thatboth the city walls and the private houses were completed;", "3741": "but it was full of intricate, narrow lanes and inconveniently placed houses.", "3742": "The priests, who had been ordered by Camillus to mark out the boundaries where the temples had stood among the general wreck, when in their circuit of the Palatine Hill they came upon the chapel of Mars, found it, like every other building, destroyed and levelled to the ground by the Gauls, but while thoroughly examining the place they found the augur's staff of Romulus hidden under a deep heap of ashes.", "3743": "This staff is curved at one end, and is called lituu8.", "3744": "They use it to divide the heavens into squares when taking the auspices, just as Romulus himself did, as he was deeply skilled in divination.", "3745": "When he vanished from among mankind, the priests kept his staff just like any other sacred object.", "3746": "That at such a time, when all the other holy things perished, this should have been preserved, gave them good hopes of Rome, which that omen seemed to presage would be eternal.", "3747": "XXXIII.", "3748": "Before they had finished rebuilding the city they became involved in a war, for the Æquians, Volscians, and Latins combined their forces and invaded the country, While the Etillscans besieged Sutrium acity in alliance with Rome.", "3749": "The tribunes in command of the Roman forces encamped near the Marcian heights, and were there besieged by the Latins and in danger of having their camp taken.", "3750": "They sent to Rome for assistance, and the Romans appointed Camillus dictator for the third time.", "3751": "About this war there are two different accounts, of which I will mention the legendary one first :", "3752": "-It is said that the Latins, either merely as a pretext, or really wishing to amalgamate the two races as before, sent a demand to Rome for free unmarried women to be delivered up for them to marry.", "3753": "As the Romans were at their wits' ends what to do, because they feared to go to war, being scarcely recovered from their late mishap, while they suspected that the women would be used as hostages if they gave them up, and that the proposal of intermarriage was merely a feint, a slave girl named Tutula, or, as some say, Philotis, advised the magistrates to send her and the best-looking of the female slaves, dressed like brides of noble birth, and that she would manage the rest.", "3754": "The magistrates approved of her proposal, chose such girls as she thought suitable, and having dressed them in fine clothes and jewellery, handed them over to the Latins, who were encamped at no great distance from the city.", "3755": "At night the girls stole the daggers of the enemies, and Tutula or l'hilotis climbed up a wild fig-tree, stretched out her cloak behind her, and raised a torch as a signal, which had been agreed upon between her and the magis­ trates, though no other citizen knew of it.", "3756": "Wherefore, the soldier.", "3757": "rushed out of the gates with a great clamour and disturbance, calling to one another and scarcely able to keep their ranks as their chiefs hurried them along.", "3758": "When they reached the enemy's camp, they found them asleep and not expecting an attack, so that they took their camp and slew most of them.", "3759": "This took place on the nones of the month Quintilis, now called July, and the festival which then takes place is in memory of the events of that day.", "3760": "First they march out of the gates in a mass, calling out the common names of the country, such as Caius, Marcus, or Lucius, in imitation of their hurried calling for each other on that occasion.", "3761": "Next, female slaves splendidly dressed walk round laughing and romping with all whom they meet.", "3762": "These girls also perform a sort of fight among themselves, like those who on that day took their share in the fight with the Latins :", "3763": "and afterwards they sit down to a feast, under the shade of fig-tree boughs.", "3764": "They call this day the nonce caprotinœ, probably from the wild fig-tree from which the slave girl waved the torch;", "3765": "for in Latin a wild fig-tree is called caprificus.", "3766": "Others say that most of these things were said and done when Romulus disappeared, for on this very day he was snatched away, outside the city gates, in a sudden storm and darkness, or as some think during an eclipse of the sun:", "3767": "and they say that the day is called nonce caprotince from the place, because Romulus was carried off while holding a meeting of the entire people at the place called the Goat'is Marsh, as is written in his life.", "3768": "XXXIV.", "3769": "The other story is approved by most writers, who relate it as follows:", "3770": "—Camillus, after being appointed dictator for the third time, and learning that the army under the command of the military tribunes was being besieged by the Latins and Volscians, was compelled to arm even those citizens who were past the age for service in the field.", "3771": "He marched by a long circuit to the Marcian heights unnoticed by the enemy, and established his army behind them.", "3772": "By lighting fires he announced his arrival to the Romans in the camp, who took courage, and began to meditate sallying out of their camp and attacking the enemy.", "3773": "But the Latins and Volscianb kept close within the rampart of their camp, which they fortified with many additional palisades, on all sides, for they now were between two hostile armies, and intended to await succour from home, while they also expected a force from Ftruria to come to their aid.", "3774": "Camillus, perceiving this, and fearing that he might be surrounded in his turn, vigorously used his opportunity.", "3775": "The rampart of the allies was formed of wood, and as a strong wind blew down from the mountains at daybreak, he prepared com­ bustibles, and early in the morning got his forces under arms.", "3776": "One division he sent to attack the enemy's camp with darts, and missile weapons, and loud shouts, while he himself, with those who were in charge of the fire, waited for his opportunity on that side towards which the wind usually blew.", "3777": "When the other troops were engaged with the enemy, the sun rose, and a strong wind got up.", "3778": "At this Camillus gave the signal for attack, and at once enveloped the palisades with lighted missiles.", "3779": "As the flames quickly spread in the thick wooden palisades, the Latins, finding their camp girt with flames, were driven into a small compass, and finally obliged to sally out of their entrenchments, outside of which the Romans stood ready to receive them.", "3780": "Few of those who broke out escaped, while all who remained in the camp perished in the flames, until the Romans extinguished them and began to plunder.", "3781": "XXXV.", "3782": "After this exploit, Camillus left his son Lucius in charge of the camp, to guard the prisoners and the booty, and himself invaded the enemy's country.", "3783": "He took the capital of the Æqui, reduced the Volsci to subjection, and marched at once upon Sutrium to relieve that city, whose inhabitants had not heard of his successes, but were still besieged by the Etruscans.", "3784": "The Sutrians had just sur­ rendered, and had been turned out of their city by the enemy with nothing but the clothes they had on.", "3785": "Camillus met them on the road with their wives and children, weeping over their misfortune.", "3786": "He was greatly moved at so piteous a sight, and, perceiving that the Romans were touched by the despairing entreaties of the people of Sutrium, who clung to them with tears in their eyes, determined that he would at once avenge their wrongs, and march upon Sutrium that very day, arguing that men who were merry with success, having just captured a wealthy city, with no enemy either left within its walls or expected from without, would be found in careless dis­ order.", "3787": "In this conjecture he was right;", "3788": "for he not only marched through the country, but even obtained possession of the walls and gates unperceived by the enemy, who had posted no guards, but were carousing in the various private houses.", "3789": "Indeed when they learned that the Romans were in possession of the town, they were in such a condition of intoxication that most of them could not even attempt to escape, but shamefully waited in the houses where they were until they were either killed or taken prisoners.", "3790": "Thus was the city of Sutrium twice taken in one day, and thus did the victors lose their prize, and the dispossessed inhabitants regain their homes by Camillus's means.", "3791": "XXXVI.", "3792": "The triumph which he enjoyed after these campaigns added to his popularitynd glory as much as either of the former;", "3793": "for even those who disliked him most, and who had insisted that all his successes were due to good fortune more than to skill, were now forced to admit the brilliancy of his generalship, and to give his genius its due.", "3794": "The chief of his enemies and detractors was Marcus Manlius, he who had been the first man to fling the Gauls down the cliff in the night attack on the Capitol, and who in remembrance of this was surnamed Capitolinus.", "3795": "This man, endeavouring to make himself the first man in Rome, and not being able to surpass the fame of Camillus by fair means, made the accusation against him usual in such cases, that he was intending to make himself king.", "3796": "This falsehood he repeated in his addresses to the people, with whom he was making him­ self popular, especially with those who were in debt ;", "3797": "some of whom he defended, and assisted in coming to terms with their creditors, while others he forcibly rescued from the officers of the law, so that many needy persons were attracted to him, and became the terror of all respectable citizens by their riotous disturbances in the Forum.", "3798": "To put an end to these disorders, Quintus Capitolinus was created dictator, and he put Manlius in prison;", "3799": "but the people upon this went into mourning, a thing only done on the occasion of some great public disaster, and the Senate, terrified at this, ordered Manlius to be acquitted.", "3800": "Manlius was not improved by his captivity, but was more tur­ bulent and disorderly in his conduct than he had been before.", "3801": "Camillus was now again electedmilitary tribune, and Manlius was impeached:", "3802": "but the place in which he was tried told greatly against his accusers.", "3803": "For the very spot on the Capitol on which Manlius fought with the Gauls on that night was visible from the Forum, and the sight of it raised a strong feeling in his favour;", "3804": "while he him­ self pointed to it, and, with tears in his eyes, reminded them of how he had fought for them, so that his judges were at their wits' end, and often adjourned the trial, for they could not acquit him of a crime which was clearly proved against him, and yet they could not bring them­ selves to let the law take its course, when the scene before them reminded them constantly of his great exploit.", "3805": "Camillus, perceiving this, removed the court to the Petelian Grove outside the city gates, where, as the Capitol was not visible, the prosecutor was able to press home his charges against Manlius, while the judges were not prevented from punishing him for his recent crimes by their remembrance of what he had done in former times.", "3806": "He was convicted, led to the Capitol, and thrown down the cliff, which thus witnessed both the most glorious deed of his life, and his miserable end.", "3807": "The Romans destroyed his house, on the site of which they built the Temple of Juno Moneta, and decreed that for the future no patrician might dwell upon the Capitol.", "3808": "XXXVII.", "3809": "Camillus, when appointed military tribune for the sixth time.", "3810": "begged to be excused, as he was growing old, and perhaps feared that such unbroken success and glory would call down upon him the wrath of the gods.-", "3811": "His most obvious reason for declining the appointment was the state of his health, for at this time he was sick.", "3812": "However, the people would not permit him to retire, but loudly urged that they did not want him to ride on horse­ back or fight in the ranks, but merely to advise and superintend.", "3813": "Thus they compelled him to accept the office, and with one of his colleagues, Lucius Furius, at once to lead an army against the enemy.", "3814": "He left the city and encamped near the enemy, where he wished to remain inactive, in order that, if a battle should be necessary, he might recover his health sufficiently to take part in it.", "3815": "But as his colleague Lucius, who longed to distinguish himself, was so eager for action that he could not be restrained, and excited the subordinate officers, Camillus, fearing that it might be supposed that he grudged younger men an opportunity of gaining laurels, agreed, sorely against his will, to allow his colleague to lead out the army and offer battle, while he with a few troops remained behind in the camp.", "3816": "But when he heard that Lucius had rashly engaged and that the Romans were defeated, he could not restrain himself, but leaping from his couch met them with his followers at the gate of the camp.", "3817": "Here .", "3818": "he forced his way through the fugitives and attacked the pursuing force, so that those Romans whom he had passed at once turned and followed him, while those who were still outside the camp rallied round him, calling upon one another not to desert their general.", "3819": "The enemy's pursuit was thus checked, and on the following day Camillus marched out with his entire force, entirely defeated them, and entering their camp together with the fugitives, put most of them to the sword.", "3820": "After this, hearing that Satria had been captured by the Etruscans, and all the Roman colonists there put to death, he sent the greater part of his force back to Rome, reserving only the young­ est and most vigorous of the soldiers, with whom he assaulted the Etruscans who held the city, and conquered them, killing many, and putting the rest to flight.", "3821": "XXXVIII.", "3822": "By his return to Rome with great spoils, he proved that those men were right who had not feared that weakness or old age would impair the faculties of a general of daring and experience, but who had chosen him, ill and unwilling to act as he was, rather than men in the prime of life, who were eager to hold military commands.", "3823": "For this reason, when the people of Tusculum were reported to be in insurrection, they bade Camillus take one of the other five tribunes as his colleague, and march against them.", "3824": "Camillus, in spite of all that the rest of the tribunes could urge, for they all wished to be taken, chose Lucius Furius, whom no one could have supposed he would have chosen ;", "3825": "for he it was who had been so eager to fight, against the better judgment of Camillus, and so had brought about the defeat in the late war;", "3826": "however, Camillus chose him rather than any other, wishing, it would appear, to conceal his misfortune and wipe out his disgrace.", "3827": "The people of Tusculum cleverly repaired their fault.", "3828": "When Camillus marched to attack them they filled the country with men working in the fields and tending cattle just as in time of peace;", "3829": "the city gates were open, the boys at school, the lower classes plying various trades, and the richer citizens walking in the market-place in peaceful dress.", "3830": "The magistrates bustled about the city, pointing out where the Romans were to be quartered, as if the thought of treachery had never entered their minds.", "3831": "Camillus, though this conduct did not shake his belief in their guilt, was moved to pity by their repentance.", "3832": "He ordered them to go to Rome and beg the Senate to pardon them;", "3833": "and when they appeared, he himself used his influence to procure their forgiveness, and the admission of Tusculum to the Roman franchise.", "3834": "These were the most remarkable events of his sixth tribuneship.", "3835": "XXXIX.", "3836": "After this, Licinius Stole put himself at the head of the plebeians in their great quarrel with the Senate.", "3837": "They demanded that consuls should be re-estab­ lished one of whom should always be a plebeian, and that they should never \"both be patricians.", "3838": "Tribunes of the people were appointed, but the people would not suffer any election of consuls to be held.", "3839": "As this want of chief magistrates seemed likely to lead to still greater disorders, the Senate, much against the will of the people, appointed Camillus dictator for the fourth time.", "3840": "He himself did not wish for the post, for he was loth to oppose men who had been his comrades in many hard-fought campaigns, as indeed he had spent much more of his life in the camp with his soldiers than with the patrician party in political intrigues, by one of which he was now appointed, as that party hoped that if successful he would crush the power of the plebeians, while in case of failure he would be ruined.", "3841": "However, he made an effort to deal with the present diffi.", "3842": "culty.", "3843": "Knowing the day on which the tribunes intended to bring forward their law, he published a muster-roll of men for military service, and charged the people to leave the Forum and meet him on the Field of Mars, threatening those who disobeyed with a heavy fine.", "3844": "But when the tribunes answered his threats by vowing that they would fine him fifty thousand drachmas unless he ceased his interference with the people's right of voting, he retired to his own house, and after a few days laid down his office on pretence of sickness.", "3845": "This he did, either because he feared a second condemnation and banishment, which would be a disgrace to an old man and one who had done such great deeds, or else because he saw that the people were too strong to be overpowered, and he did not wish to make the attempt.", "3846": "The Senate appointed another dictator, but he made that very Licinius Stole, the leader of the popular party, his master of the horse, and thus enabled him to pass a law which was especially distasteful to the patricians, for it forbade any one to possess more than five hundred jugera of land.", "3847": "Stole, after this success, became an important personage;", "3848": "but, a short time afterwards, he was convicted of possessing more land than his own law permitted, and was punished according to its provisions.", "3849": "XL.", "3850": "There still remained the difficulty about the con­ sular elections, the most important point at issue between the two parties, and the Senate was greatly disturbed at it, when news arrived that the Gauls, starting from the Adriatic Sea, were a second time marching in great force upon Home.", "3851": "At the same time evident traces of their approach could be seen, as the country was being plundered, and such of the inhabitants as could not easily reach Rome were taking refuge in the mountains.", "3852": "This terrible tidings put an end to all internal disputes.", "3853": "The Senate and people formed themselves into one assembly, and with one voice appointed Camillus dictator for the fifth time.", "3854": "He was now a very old man, being near his eightieth year;", "3855": "but at this pressing crisis he made none of his former excuses, but at once took the chief command and levied an army for the war.", "3856": "As he knew that the chief power of the Gauls lay in their swords, with which they dealt heavy blows on the heads and shoulders of their enemy, without any skill in fence, he prepared for most of his soldiers helmets made entirely of smooth iron, so that the swords would either break or glance off them, while he also had brass rims fitted to their shields, because the wood by itself could not endure a blow.", "3857": "He also instructed the soldiers to use long pikes, and to thrust them forward to receive the sword-cuts of the enemy.", "3858": "XLI.", "3859": "When the Gauls were encamped on the banks of the Anio, near the city, loaded with masses of plunder, Camillus led out his troops and posted them in a glen from which many valleys branched out, so that the greater part of the force was concealed, and that which was seen appeared to be clinging in terror to the hilly ground.", "3860": "Camillus, wishing to confirm the enemy in this idea, would not move to prevent the country being plundered before his eyes, but palisaded his camp and remained quiet within it, until he saw that the foraging parties of the Gauls straggled in careless disorder, while those in the camp did nothing but eat and drink.", "3861": "Then, sending forward his light troops before daybreak to be ready to harass the Gauls and prevent their forming their ranks properly as they came out of their camp, he marched the heavy-armed men down into the plain at sunrise, a numerous and confident body, and not, as the Gauls fancied, a few disheartened men.", "3862": "The very fact of his commencing the attack dashed the courage of the Gauls ;", "3863": "next, the attacks of the light troops, before they had got into their wonted array and divided themselves into regiments, produced disorder.", "3864": "When at last Camillus led on the heavy-armed troops, the Gauls ran to meet them brandishing their swords, but the Romans with their pikes advanced and met them, receiving their sword-cuts on their armour, which soon made the Gaulish swords bend double, as they were made of soft iron ham­ mered out thin, while the shields of the Gauls were pierced and weighed down by the pikes that stuck in them.", "3865": "They therefore dropped their own arms, and endeavoured to seize the pikes and turn them against their enemies.", "3866": "But the Romans, seeing them now defenceless, began to use their swords, and slew many of the first ranks, while the rest took to flight all over the flat country;", "3867": "for Camillus had taken care to guard the hills and rough ground, while the Gauls knew that they, in their over-confidence, had been at no pains to fortify their camp, and that the Romans could easily take it.", "3868": "This battle is said to have been fought .", "3869": "thirteen years after the capture of Rome, and in consequence of it the Romans conceived a contempt for these barbarians, whom they had before greatly dreaded, and even believed that their former victories over the Gauls were due to their being weakened by pestilence, and to fortunate circumstances, rather than to their own valour.", "3870": "This raised so great a terror of them, that a law was passed which relieved the priests from military service except in case of a Gaulish invasion.", "3871": "XLII.", "3872": "This was the last of Camillus's military exploits, though during this campaign he took the city of Velitræ, which yielded to him without a battle.", "3873": "But his greatest political struggle was yet to come, for it was harder to deal with the people now that they were elated with victory.", "3874": "They insisted that the existing constitution should be annulled, and that one of the-two chosen from among them.", "3875": "They were opposed by the Senate, which would not permit Camillus to lay down his office, as the patricians imagined that with the help of his - great power they could more easily defend their privileges.", "3876": "One day, however, as Camillus was sitting publicly doing business in the Forum, a viator or servant sent by the tribunes of the people bade him follow him, and even laid his hand upon him as if to arrest him.", "3877": "At this such a disturbance arose as had never been known before, as Camillus's party endeavoured to push the officer down from the tribunal, while the people clamoured to him to drag the dictator from his seat.", "3878": "Camillus himself, not knowing what to do, would not lay down his office, but called the Senate to meet.", "3879": "Before entering the Senate house, he turned round to the Capitol and prayed that the gods would bring affairs to a happy termination, vowing that when the present disorders were at an end he would build a Temple of Concord.", "3880": "After a violent debate, the Senate agreed to adopt the milder course of yielding to the popular demand, and permitting one of the two consuls to be chosen from the people.", "3881": "When the dictator announced this decision ofthe Senate to the people, they at once, as was natural, were delighted with the Senate, and escorted Camillus home with applause and shouts.", "3882": "On the next day they met and decreed that the Temple of Concord which Camillus had vowed should be erected on a spot facing the Forum, where these events had taken place ;", "3883": "moreover, that the Latin games should continue for four days instead of three, and that all citizens of Rome should at once offer sacrifice and crown themselves with garlands.", "3884": "In the assembly for the election of consuls, over which Camillus presided there were elected Marcus Æmilius, a patrician, and Lucius Sextius, the first plebeian ever elected consul.", "3885": "This was the result of Camillus's administration.", "3886": "XLIII.", "3887": "In the following year a pestilence broke out in Rome which destroyed enormous numbers of people, and among them most of the leading men.", "3888": "And in this year died Camillus, at a ripe old age, full of years and honours, more regretted by the Romans than all those who died of the plague.", "3889": "I. ONE day in Rome, Caesar, seeing some rich foreigners nursing and petting young lapdogs and monkeys, enquired whether in their parts of the world the women bore no children:", "3890": "a truly imperial reproof to those who waste on animals the affection which they ought to bestow upon mankind.", "3891": "May we not equally blame those who waste the curiosity and love of knowledge which belongs to human nature, by directing it to worthless, not to useful objects?", "3892": "It is indeed unavoidable that external objects, whether good or bad, should produce some effect upon our senses;", "3893": "but every man is able, if he chooses, to concen­ trate his mind upon any subject he may please.", "3894": "For this reason we ought to seek virtue, not merely in order to contemplate it, but that we may ourselves derive some benefit from so doing.", "3895": "Just as those colours whose blooming and pleasant hues refresh our sight are grateful to the eyes, so we ought by our studies to delight in that which is useful for our own lives;", "3896": "and this is to be found in the acts of good men, which when narrated incite us to imitate them.", "3897": "The effect does not take place in other cases, for we frequently admire what we do not wish to produce;", "3898": "indeed we often are charmed with the work, but despise the workman, as in the case of dyes and per­ fumery which we take pleasure in, although we regard dyers and perfumers as vulgar artizans.", "3899": "That was a clever saying of Antisthenes, who answered, when he heard that Ismenias was a capital flute-player, \" But he must be a worthless man, for if he were not, he would not be such a capital flute-player! \" and King Philip of Macedon, when his son played brilliantly and agreeably on the harp at an entertainment, said to him, \" Are you not ashamed, to play so wellIt is enough for a king, if he sometimes employs his leisure in listening to musicians, and it is quite a sufficient tribute from him to the Muses, if he is present at the performances of other persons.", "3900": "II.", "3901": "If a man devotes himself to these trifling arts, the time which he wastes upon them proves that he is in­ capable of higher things.", "3902": "No well nurtured youth, on seeing the statue of Jupiter Olympius at Pisa, wishes that he were a Pheidias, or that he were a Polykleitus on seeing the statue of Juno at Argos, nor yet while he takes pleasure in poetry, does he wish that he were an Anakreon, a Philetas, or an Archilochus;", "3903": "for it does not necessarily follow that we esteem the workman because we are pleased with the work.", "3904": "For this reason men are not benefited by any spectacle which does not encourage them to imitation, and where reflection upon what they have observed does not make them also wish to do likewise;", "3905": "whereas we both admire the deeds to which virtue incites, and long to emulate the doers of them.", "3906": "We enjoy the good things which we owe to fortune, but we admire virtuous actions;", "3907": "and while we wish to receive the former, we wish ourselves to benefit others by the latter.", "3908": "That which is in itself admirable

arranged this tenth book to contain the lives of Perikles and of Fabius Maximus, who fought against Hannibal, men who especially resembled one an­ other in the gentleness and justice of their

seems, was a sophist of the highest order, who used the name of music to conceal this accomplishment from the world, but who really trained Perikles for his political contests just as a trainer prepares an athlete for the games.", "3926": "However, Damon's use of music as a pretext did not impose upon the Athenians, who banished him by ostracism, as a busy­ body and lover of despotism.",

of how to reduce any man to silence who questioned him, and how to enclose him between the horns of a dilemma, which is alluded to by Timon of Phlius in the following verses :", "3931": "\"", "3932": "Nor weak the strength of him of two-edged tongue, Zeno that carps at all.", "3933": "\"But it was Anaxagoras of Klazomenæ who had most to do with forming Perikles's style, teaching him an eleva­ tion and sublimity of expression beyond that of ordinary popular speakers, and altogether purifying and ennobling his mind.", "3934": "This Anaxagoras was called Nous, or Intelli­ gence, by the men of that day, either because they admired his own intellect, or because he taught that an abstract intelligence is to be traced in all the concrete forms of matter, and that to this, and not to chance, the universe owes its origin.", "3935": "V.", "3936": "Perikles greatly admired Anaxagoras, and became deeply interested in these grand speculations, which gave him a haughty spirit and a lofty style of oratory far removed from vulgarity and low buffoonery, and also an imperturbable gravity of countenance, and a calmness of demeanour and appearance which no incident could disturb as he was speaking, while the tone of his voice never showed that he heeded any interruption.", "3937": "These advan­ tages greatly impressed the people.", "3938": "Once he sat quietly all day in the market-place despatching some pressing business, reviled in the foulest terms all the while by some low worthless fellow.", "3939": "Towards evening he walked home, the man following him and heaping abuse upon him.", "3940": "When about to enter hi own door, as it was dark, he ordered one of his servants to take a torch and light the man home.", "3941": "The poet Ion, however, says that Perikles was overbearing and insolent in conversation, and that his pride had in it a great deal of contempt for others;", "3942": "while he praises Kimon's civil, sensible, and polished address.", "3943": "But we may disregard Ion, as a mere dramatic poet who always sees in great men something upon which to exercise his satiric vein;", "3944": "whereas Zeno used to invite those who called the haughtiness of Perikles a mere courting of popularity and affectation of grandeur, to court popularity themselves in the same fashion, since the acting of such a part might insensibly mould their dispositions until they resembled that of their model.", "3945": "VI.", "3946": "These were not the only advantages which Perikles gained from his intimacy with Anaxagoras, but he seems to have learned to despise those superstitious fears which the common phenomena of the heavens produce in those who, ignorant of their cause, and knowing nothing about them, refer them all to the immediate action of the gods.", "3947": "Knowledge of physical science, while it puts an end to superstitious terrors, replaces them by a sound basis of piety.", "3948": "It is said that once a ram with one horn was sent from the country as a present to Perikles, and that Lampon the prophet, as soon as he saw this strong horn growing out of the middle of the creature's forehead, said that as there were two parties in the state, that of Thucydides and that of Perikles, he who possessed this mystic animal would unite the two into one.", "3949": "Anaxagoras cut open the beast's skull, and pointed out that its brain did not fill the whole space, but was sunken into the shape of an egg, and all collected at that part from which the horn grew.", "3950": "At the time all men looked with admira­ tion on Anaxagoras, but afterwards, when Thucydides had fallen, and all the state had become united under Perikles, they admired Lampon equally.", "3951": "There is, I imagine, no reason why both the prophet and the natural philosopher should not have been right, the one discovering the cause, and the other the meaning.", "3952": "The one considered why the horn grew so, and for what reason;", "3953": "the other declared what it meant by growing so, and for what end it took place.", "3954": "Those who say that when the cause of a portent is found out the portent is explained away, do not reflect that the same reasoning which explains away heavenly portents would also put an end to the meaning of the conventional signals used by mankind.", "3955": "The ringing of bells, the blaze of beacon fires, and the shadows on a dial are all of them produced by natural causes, but have a further meaning.", "3956": "But perhaps all this belongs to another subject.", "3957": "VII.", "3958": "Perikles when young greatly feared the people.", "3959": "He had a certain personal likeness to the despot Peisistratus;", "3960": "and as his own voice was sweet, and he was ready and fluent in speech, old men who had known Peisistratus were struck by his resemblance to him.", "3961": "He was also rich, of noble birth, and had powerful friends, so that he feared be might be banished by ostracism, and consequently held aloof from politics, but proved himself a brave and daring soldier in the wars.", "3962": "But when Aristeides was dead, Themistokles banished, and Kimon generally absent on distant campaigns, Perikles engaged in public affairs, taking the popular side, that of the poor and many against that of the rich and few, quite contrary to his own feelings, which were entirely aristocratic.", "3963": "He feared, it seems, that he might be suspected of a design to make himself despot, and seeing that Kimon took the side of the nobility, and was much beloved by them, he betook him­ self to the people, as a means of obtaining safety for himself, and a strong party to combat that of Kimon.", "3964": "He immediately altered his mode of life;", "3965": "was never seen in any street except that which led to the market-place and the national assembly, and declined all invitations to dinner and such like social gatherings, so utterly that during the whole of his long political life he never dined with one of his friends except when his first cousin, Euryptolemus, was married.", "3966": "On this occasion he sat at table till the libations were poured, upon which he at once got up and went away.", "3967": "For solemnity is wont to unbend at festive gatherings, and a majestic demeanour is hard to keep up when one is in familiar intercourse with others.", "3968": "True virtue, indeed, appears more glorious the more it is seen, and a really good man's life is never so much admired by the outside world as by his own intimate friends.", "3969": "But Perikles feared to make himself too common even with the people, and only addressed them after long intervals—not speaking upon every subject, and, not constantly addressing them, but, as Kritolaus says, keeping himself like the Sala­ minian trireme for great crises, and allowing his friends and the other orators to manage matters of less moment.", "3970": "One of these friends is said to have been Ephialtes, who destroyed the power of the Council of the Areopagus, \" pouring out,\" as Plato, the comic poet, said, \" a full and unmixed draught of liberty for the citizens,\" under the influence of which the poets of the time said that the Athenian people \" Nibbled at Eubcea, like a horse that spurns the rein, And wantonly would leap upon the islands in the main,\"VIII.", "3971": "Wishing to adopt a style of speaking consonant with his haughty manner and lofty spirit, Perikles made free use of the instrument which Anaxagoras as it were put into his hand, and often tinged his oratory with natural philosophy.", "3972": "He far surpassed all others by using this \" lofty intelligence and power of universal con­ summation,\" as the divine Plato calls it;", "3973": "in addition to his natural advantages, adorning his oratory with apt illustrations drawn from physical science.", "3974": "For this reason some think that he was nicknamed the Olympian ;", "3975": "though some refer this to his improvement of the city by new and beautiful buildings, and others from his power both as a politician and a general.", "3976": "It is not by any means unlikely that these causes all combined to produce the name.", "3977": "Yet the comedies of that time, when they allude to him, either in jest or earnest, always appear to think that this name was given him because of his manner of speaking, as they speak of him as \" thundering and lightening,\" and \" rolling fateful thunders from his tongue.\"", "3978": "A saying of Thucydides, the son of Melesias, has been preserved, which jestingly testifies to the power of Perikles's eloquence.", "3979": "Thucydides was the leader of the conservative party, and for a long time struggled to hold his own against Perikles in debate.", "3980": "One day Archidamus, the King of Sparta, asked him whether he or Perikles was the best wrestler. \"", "3981": "When I throw him in wrestling,\" Thucydides answered, \" he beats me by proving that he never was down, and making the spectators believe him.\"", "3982": "For all this Perikles was very cautious about his words, and whenever he ascended the tribune to speak, used first to pray to the gods that nothing unfitted for the present occasion might fall from his lips.", "3983": "He left no writings, except the measures which he brought forward, and very few of his sayings are recorded.", "3984": "One of these was, that he called Ægina \" the eyesore of the Peiræus,\" and that \" he saw war coming upon Athens from Peloponnesus.\"", "3985": "Stesimbrotus tells us that when he was pronouncing a public funeral oration over those who fell in Samos, he said that they had become immortal, even as the gods:", "3986": "for we do not see the gods, but we conceive them to be immortal by the respect which we pay them, and the blessings which we receive from them;", "3987": "and the same is the case with those who die for their country.", "3988": "IX.", "3989": "Thucydides represents the constitution under Perikles as a democracy in name, but really an aristocracy, because the government was all in the hands of one leading citizen.", "3990": "But as many other writers tell us that during his administration the people received grants of land abroad, and were indulged with dramatic entertain­ ments, and payments for their services, in consequence of which they fell into bad habits, and became extravagant and licentious, instead of sober hard-working people as they had been before, let us consider the history of this change, viewing it by the light of the facts themselves.", "3991": "First of all, as we have already said, Perikles had to measure himself with Kimon, and to transfer the affections of the people from Kimon to himself.", "3992": "As he was not so rich a man as Kimon, who used from his own ample means to give a dinner daily to any poor Athenian who required it, clothe aged persons, and take away the fences round his property, so that any one might gather the fruit, Perikles, unable to vie with him in this, turned his attention to a distribution of the public funds among the people, at the suggestion, we are told by Aristotle, of Damonides of Oia.", "3993": "By the money paid for public spectacles, for citizens acting as jurymen and other paid offices, and largesses, he soon won over the people to his side, so that he was able to use them in his attack upon the Senate of the Areopagus, of which he himself was not a member, never having been chosen Archon, or Thesmothete, or King Archon, or Polemarch.", "3994": "These offices had from ancient times been obtained by lot, and it was only through them that those who had approved themselves in the discharge of them were advanced to the Areopagus.", "3995": "For this reason it was that Perikles, when he gained strength with the populace, destroyed this Senate, making Ephialtes bring forward a bill which restricted its judicial powers, while he himself succeeded in getting Kimon banished by ostra­ cism, as a friend of Sparta and a hater of the people, although he was second to no Athenian in birth or fortune, had won most brilliant victories over the Persians, and had filled Athens with plunder and spoils of war, as will be found related in his life.", "3996": "So great was the power of Perikles with the common people.X.", "3997": "One of the provisions of ostracism was that the per­ son banished should remain in exile for ten years.", "3998": "But during this period the Lacedæmonians with a great force invaded the territory of Tanagra, and, as the Athenians at once marched out to attack them, Kimon came back from exile, took his place in full armour among the ranks of his own tribe, and hoped by distinguishing himself in the battle amongst his fellow citizens to prove the false­ hood of the Laconian sympathies with which he had been charged.", "3999": "However, the friends of Perikles drove him away, as an exile.", "4000": "On the other hand, Perikles fought more bravely in that battle than he had ever fought before, and surpassed every one in reckless daring.", "4001": "The friends of Kimon also, whom Perikles had accused of Laconian leanings, fell, all together, in their ranks:", "4002": "and the Athenians felt great sorrow for their treatment of Kimon, and a great longing for his restoration, now that they had lost a great battle on the frontier, and expected to be hard pressed during the summer by the Lacedæmon­ ians.", "4003": "Perikles, perceiving this, lost no time in gratifying the popular wish, but himself proposed the decree for his recall;", "4004": "and Kimon on his return reconciled the two States, for he was on familiar terms with the Spartans, who were hated by Perikles and the other leaders of the common people.", "4005": "Some say that, before Kimon's recall by Perikles, a secret compact was made with him by Elpinike, Kimono sister, that Kimon was to proceed on foreign service against the Persians with a fleet of two hundred ships, while Perikles was to retain his power in the city.", "4006": "It is also said that, when Kimon was being tried for his life, Elpinike softened the resentment of Perikles, who was one of those appointed to impeach him.", "4007": "When Elpinike came to beg her brother's life of him, he answered with a smile, \" Elpinike, you are too old to meddle in affairs of this sort.\"", "4008": "But, for all that, he spoke only once, for form's sake, and pressed Kimon less than any of his other prosecutors.", "4009": "How, then, can one put any faith in Idome­ neus, when he accuses Perikles of procuring the assassina­ tion of his friend and colleague Ephialtes, because he was jealous of his reputation ?", "4010": "This seems an ignoble calumny, which Idomeneus has drawn from some obscure source to fling at a man who, no doubt, was not fault­ less, but of a generous spirit and noble mind, incapable of entertaining so savage and brutal a design.", "4011": "Ephialtes was disliked and feared by the nobles, and was inexor­ able in punishing those who wronged the people ;", "4012": "where­ fore his enemies had him assassinated by means of Aristo­ dikus of Tanagra.", "4013": "This we are told by Aristotle.", "4014": "Kimon died in Cyprus, while in command of the Athenian forces.", "4015": "XI.", "4016": "The nobles now perceived that Perikles was the most important man in the State, and far more powerful than any other citizen ;", "4017": "wherefore, as they still hoped to check his authority, and not allow him to be omnipotent, they set up Thucydides, of the township of Alopekæ, as his rival, a man of good sense, and a relative of Kimon, but less of a warrior and more of a politician, who, by watch­ ing his opportunities, and opposing Perikles in debate, soon brought about a balance of power.", "4018": "He did not allow the nobles to mix themselves up with the people in the public assembly, as they had been wont to do, so that their dignity was lost among the masses;", "4019": "but he collected them into a separate body, and by thus concentrating their strength was able to use it to counterbalance that of the other party.", "4020": "From the beginning these two factions had been but imperfectly welded together, because their tendencies were different;", "4021": "but now the struggle for power between Perikles and Thucydides drew a sharp line of demarcation between them, and one was called the party of the Many, the other that of the Few.", "4022": "Perikles now courted the people in every way, constantly arranging public spectacles, festivals, and processions in the citj , by which he educated the Athenians to take pleasure in refined amusements;", "4023": "and also he sent out sixty triremes to cruise every year, in which many of the people served for hire for eight months, learning and practising seamanship.", "4024": "Besides this he sent a thousand settlers to the Chersonese, five hundred to Naxos, half as many to Andros, a thousand to dwell among the Thracian tribe of the Bisaltæ, and others to the new colony in Italy founded by the city of Sybaris, which was named Thurii.", "4025": "By this means he relieved the state of numerous idle agitators, assisted the necessitous, and overawed the allies of Athens by placing his colonists near them to watch their behaviour.", "4026": "XII.", "4027": "The building of the temples, by which Athens was adorned, the people delighted, and the rest of the world as­ tonished, and which now alone prove that the tales of the ancient power and glory of Greece are no fables, was what particularly excited the spleen of the opposite faction, who inveighed against him in the public assembly, declaring that the Athenians had disgraced themselves by trans­ ferring the common treasury of the Greeks from the island of Delos to their own custody.", "4028": "\"", "4029": "Perikles himself,\" they urged, \" has taken away the only possible excuse for such an act -the fear that it might be exposed to the attacks of the Persians when at Delos, whereas it would be safe at Athens.", "4030": "Greece has been outraged, and feels itself openly tyran­ nised over, when it sees us using the funds which we extorted from it for the war against the Persians, for gilding and beautifying our city, as if it were a vain woman, and adorning it with precious marbles, and statues, and temples, worth a thousand talents.\"", "4031": "To this Perikles replied, that the allies had no right to consider how their money was spent, so long as Athens defended them from the Persians ;", "4032": "while they supplied neither horses, ships, nor men, but merely money, which the Athenians had a right to spend as they pleased, provided they afforded them that security which it purchased.", "4033": "It was right, he argued, that, after the city had provided all that was necessary for war, it should devote its surplus money to the erection of buildings which would be a glory to it for all ages, while these works would create plenty by leaving no man unemployed, and encouraging all sorts of handi­ craft, so that nearly the whole city would earn wages, and thus derive both its beauty and its profit from itself.", "4034": "For those who were in the flower of their age, military service offered a means of earning money from the common stock;", "4035": "while, as he did not wish the mechanics and lower classes to be without their share, nor yet to see them receive it without doing work for it, he had laid the foundations of great edifices which would require industries of every kind to complete them;", "4036": "and he had done this in the interests of the lower classes, who thus, although they remained at home, would have just as good a claim to their share of the public funds as those who were serving at sea, in garrison, or in the field.", "4037": "The different materials used, such as stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypress-wood, and so forth, would require special artizans for each, such as car­ penters, modellers, smiths, stone masons, dyers, melters and moulders of gold, and ivory painters, embroiderers, workers in relief;", "4038": "and also men to bring them to the city, such as sailors and captains of ships and pilots for such as came by sea;", "4039": "and, for those who came by land, carriage builders, horse breeders, drivers, rope makers, linen manufacturers, shoemakers, road menders, and miners.", "4040": "Each trade, moreover, employed a number of unskilled labourers, so that, in a word, there would be work for persons of every age and every class, and general prosperity would be the result.", "4041": "XIII.", "4042": "These buildings were of immense size, and unequalled in beauty and grace, as the workmen endea­ voured to make the execution surpass the design in beauty ;", "4043": "but what was most remarkable was the speed with which they were built.", "4044": "All these edifices, each of which one would have thought, it would have taken many generations to complete, were all finished during the most brilliant period of one man's administration.", "4045": "We are told that Zeuxis, hearing Agatharchus, the painter, boasting how easily and rapidly he could produce a picture, said, \" I paint very slowly.\"", "4046": "Ease, and speed of execution, seldom produces work of any permanent value or delicacy.", "4047": "It is the time which is spent in laborious production for which we are repaid by the durable character of the result.", "4048": "And this makes Perikles's work all the more wonderful, because it was built in a short time, and yet has lasted for ages.", "4049": "In beauty each of them at once appeared venerable as soon as it was built;", "4050": "but even at the present day the work looks as fresh as ever, for they bloom with an eternal freshness which defies time, and seems to make the work instinct with an unfading spirit of youth.", "4051": "The overseer and manager of the whole was Pheidias, although there were other excellent architects and work­ men, such as Kallikrates and Iktinus, who built the Parthenon on the site of the old Hokatompedon, which had been destroyed by the Persians, and Korœbus, who began to build the Temple of Initiation at Eleusis, but who only lived to see the columns erected and the archi­ traves placed upon them.", "4052": "On his death, Metagenes, of Xypete, added the frieze and the upper row of columns, and Xenokles, of Cholargos, crowned it with the domed roof over the shrine.", "4053": "As to the long wall, about which Sokrates says that he heard Perikles bring forward a motion, Kallikrates undertook to build it.", "4054": "Kratinus satirises the work for being slowly accomplished, saying \"", "4055": "He builds in speeches, but he does no work.\"", "4056": "The Odeum, which internally consisted of many rows of seats and many columns, and externally of a roof sloping on all sides from a central point, was said

Jove with lofty skull appears;", "4058": "The Odeum on his head he bears, Because he fears the oyster-shell no more.", "4059": "\"Perikles at that period used his influence to pass a decree for

Acropolis.", "4068": "The golden statue of the goddess was made by Pheidias, and his name appears upon the basement in the inscription.", "4069": "Almost everything was in his hands, and he gave his orders to all the workmen -as we have said before-because of his friendship with Perikles.", "4070": "This led to their both being envied and belied ;", "4071": "for it was said that Perikles, with the connivance of Pheidias, carried on intrigues with Athenian ladies, who came ostensibly to see the works.", "4072": "This accusation was taken up by the comic poets, who charged him with great profligacy, hinting that he had an improper passion for the wife of Menippus, his friend, and a lieutenant-general in the army.", "4073": "Even the bird-fancying of Pyrilampes, because he was a friend of Perikles, was misrepresented, and he was said to give peacocks to the ladies who granted their favours to Perikles.", "4074": "But, indeed, how can we wonder at satirists bringing foul accusations against their betters, and offering them up as victims to the spite of the populace, when we find Stesimbrotus, of Thasos, actually inventing that unnatural and abominable falsehood of Perikles's in­ trigue with his own daughter-in-law.", "4075": "So hard is it to discover the truth, because the history of past ages is rendered difficult by the lapse of time;", "4076": "while in contem­ porary

money he pleased from the treasury, and spend it as he pleased, without stint.", "4083": "And finally, he underwent the trial of ostracism with Thucy­ dides, and not only succeeded in driving him into exile, but broke up his party.", "4084": "XV.", "4085": "As now there was no opposition to encounter in the city, and all parties had been blended into one, Perikles undertook the sole administration of the home and foreign affairs of Athens, dealing with the public revenue, the army, the navy, the islands and maritime affairs, and the great sources of strength which Athens derived from her alliances, as well with Greek as with foreign princes and states.", "4086": "Henceforth he became quite a different man :", "4087": "he no longer gave way to the people, and ceased to watch the breath of popular favour;", "4088": "but he changed the loose and licentious democracy, which had hitherto existed, into a stricter aristocratic, or rather monarchical, form of government.", "4089": "This he used honourably and unswervingly for the public benefit, finding the people, as a rule, willing to second the measures which he explained to them to be necessary, and to which he asked their consent,

allows his patient innocent recreation, and at another inflicts upon him sharp pains and bitter, though salutary, draughts.", "4091": "Every possible kind of disorder was to be found among a people

raising their spirits when they were cast down and disheartened.", "4093": "Thus, a* Plato says, he was able to prove that oratory is the art of influencing men's minds, and to use it in its highest application, when it deals with men's passions and characters, which, like certain strings of a musical instrument, require a skilful and delicate touch.", "4094": "The secret of his power is to be found, however, as Thucydides says, not so much in his mere oratory, as in his pure and blameless life, because he was so well known to be incor­ ruptible, and indifferent to money;", "4095": "for though he made the city, which was a great one, into the greatest and richest city of Greece, and though he himself became more more powerful than many independent sovereigns, who were able to leave their kingdoms to their sons, yet Perikles did not increase by one single drachma the estate which he received from his father.", "4096": "XVI.", "4097": "This is the clear account of his power which is given by Thucydides the historian;", "4098": "though the comic poets misrepresent him atrociously, calling his immediate followers the New Peisistratidæ, and calling upon him to swear that he never would make himself despot, as though his pre-eminence was not to be borne in a free state.", "4099": "And Telckleides says, that the Athenians delivered up into his hands \"", "4100": "The tribute

any special occasion, or when his administration was especially popular, but for forty years he held the first place among such men as Ephialtes, Leokrates, Myronides, Kimon, Tolmides, and Thucydides;", "4102": "and, after the fall and banishment of Thucydides by ostracism, he united in himself for five-and-twenty years all the various offices of state, which were supposed to last only for one year ;", "4103": "and yet during the whole of that period proved himself incorruptible by bribes.", "4104": "As to his paternal estate, he was loth to lose it, and still more to be troubled with the management of it;", "4105": "consequently, he adopted what seemed to him the simplest and most exact method of dealing with it.", "4106": "Every year's produce was sold all together, and with the money thus obtained, he would buy what was necessary for his household in the market, and thus regulate his expenditure.", "4107": "This did not make him popular with iiis sons when they grew up;", "4108": "nor yet did the women of his family think him a liberal manager, but blamed his exact regulation of his daily expenses, which allowed none of the superfluities common in great and wealthy households, but which made the debit and credit exactly balance each other.", "4109": "One servant, Euan­ gelos, kept all his accounts, as no one else had either capacity or education enough to be able to do so.", "4110": "These proceedings differed greatly from those of Anaxagoras the philosopher, who left his house, and let his estate go to ruin, while he pursued his lofty speculations.", "4111": "I con­ ceive, however, that the life of a philosopher and that of a practical politician are not the same, as the one directs his thoughts to abstract ideas, while the other devotes his genius to supplying the real wants of mankind, and in some cases finds wealth not only necessary, but most valuable to him, as indeed it was to Perikles, who assisted many of the poorer citizens.", "4112": "It is said that, as Perikles was engaged in public affairs, Anaxagoras, who was now an old man and in want, covered his head with his robe, and determined to starve himself to death;", "4113": "but when Perikles heard of this, he at once ran to him, and besought him to live, lamenting, not Anaxagoras's fate, but his own, if he should lose so valuable a political adviser.", "4114": "Then Anaxagoras uncovered his head, and said to him, \" Perikles, those who want to use a lamp supply it with oil.", "4115": "\"XVII.", "4116": "As the Lacedæmonians began to be jealous of the prosperity of the Athenians, Perikles, wishing to raise the spirit of the people and to make them feel capable of immense operations, passed a decree, inviting all the Greeks, whether inhabiting Europe or Asia, whether living in large cities or small ones, to send represen­ tatives to a meeting at Athens to deliberate about the restoration of the Greek temples which had been burned by the barbarians, about the sacrifices which were due in consequence of the vows which they had made to the gods on behalf of Greece before joining battle, and about the sea, that all men might be able to sail upon it in peace and without fear.", "4117": "To carry out this decree twenty men, selected from the citizens over fifty years of age, were sent out, five of whom invited the Ionian and Dorian Greeks in Asia and the islands as far as Lesbos and Rhodes, five went to the inhabitants of the Hellespont and Thrace as far as Byzantium, and five more proceeded to Bœotia, Phokis, and Peloponnesus, passing from thence through Lokris to the neighbouring continent as far as Akarnania and Ambrakia ;", "4118": "while the remainder journeyed through Eubœa to the Œtæans and the Malian gulf, and to the Achaians of Phthia and the Thessalians, urging them to join the assembly and take part in the deliber­ ations concerning the peace and well-being of Greece.", "4119": "However, nothing was effe ted, and the cities never assem­ bled, in consequence it is said of the covert hostility of the Lacedæmonians, and because the attempt was first made in Peloponnesus and failed there:", "4120": "yet I have in­ serted an account of it in order to show the lofty spirit and the magnificent designs of Perikles.", "4121": "XVIII.", "4122": "In his campaigns he was chiefly remarkable for caution, for ho would not, if he could help it, begin a battle of which the issue was doubtful;", "4123": "nor did he wish to emulate those generals who have won themselves a great reputation by running risks, and trusting to good luck.", "4124": "But he ever used to say to his countrymen, that none of them should come by their deaths through any act of his.", "4125": "Observing that Tolmides, the son of Tolmæus, elated by previous successes and by the credit which he had gained as a general, was about to invade Bœotia in a reckless manner, and had persuaded a thousand young men to follow him without any support whatever, he endeavoured to stop him, and made that memorable saying in the public assembly, that if Tolmides would not take the ad­ vice of Perikles, he would at any rate do well to consult that best of advisers, Time.", "4126": "This speech had but little success at the time;", "4127": "but when, a few days afterwards, the news came that Tolmides had fallen in action at Koronea, and many noble citizens with him, Perikles was greatly respected and admired as a wise and patriotic man.", "4128": "XIX.", "4129": "His most successful campaign was that in the Chersonesus, which proved the salvation of the Greeks residing there:", "4130": "for he not only settled a thousand colonists there, and thus increased the available force of the cities, but built a continuous line of fortifications reaching across the isthmus from one sea to the other, by which he shut off the Thracians, who had previously ravaged the peninsula, and put an end to a constant and harassing border war­ fare to which the settlers were exposed, as they had for neighbours tribes of wild plundering barbarians.", "4131": "But that by which he obtained most glory and renown was when he started from Pegæ, in the Megarian territory, and sailed round the Peloponnesus with a fleet of a hundred triremes;", "4132": "for he not only laid waste much of the country near the coast, as Tolmides had previously done, but he proceeded far inland, away from his ships, leading the troops who were on board, and terrified the inhabitants so much that they shut themselves up in their strongholds.", "4133": "The men of Sikyon alone ventured to meet him at Nemea, and them he overthrew in a pitched battle, and erected a trophy.", "4134": "Next he took on board troops from the friendly district of Achaia, and, crossing over to the opposite side of the Corinthian Gulf, coasted along past the mouth of the river Achelous, overran Akarnania, drove the people of Œneadæ to the shelter of their city walls, and after rava­ ging the country returned home, having made himself a terror to his enemies, and done good service to Athens ;", "4135": "for not the least casualty, even by accident, befel the troops under his command.", "4136": "XX.", "4137": "When he sailed into the Black Sea with a great and splendidly equipped fleet, he assisted the Greek cities there, and treated them with consideration;", "4138": "and showed the neighbouring savage tribes and their chiefs the greatness of his force, and his confidence in his power, by sailing where he pleased, and taking complete control over that sea.", "4139": "He left at :", "4140": "Sinope thirteen ships, and a land force under the command of Lamachus, to act against Timesileon, who had made himself despot of that city.", "4141": "When he and his party were driven out, Perikles passed a decree that six hundred Athenian volunteers should sail to Sinope, and become citizens there, receiving the houses and lands which had formerly been in the possession of the despot and his party.", "4142": "But in other cases he would not agree to the impulsive proposals of the Athenians, and he opposed them when, elated by their power and good fortune, they talked of recovering Egypt and attack­ ing the seaboard of the Persian empire.", "4143": "Many, too, were inflamed with that ill-starred notion of an attempt on Sicily, which was afterwards blown into a flame by Alki­ biades and other orators", "4144": "Some even dreamed of the con­ quest of Etruria and Carthage, in consequence of the greatness which the Athenian empire had already reached, and the full tide of success which seemed to attend it.", "4145": "XXI.", "4146": "Perikles, however, restrained these outbursts, and would not allow the people to meddle with foreign states, but used the power of Athens chiefly to preserve and guard her already existing empire, thinking it to be of paramount importance to oppose the Lacedæmonians, a task to which he bent all his energies, as is proved by many of his acts, especially in connection with the Sacred War.", "4147": "In this war the Lacedæmonians sent a force to Delphi, and made the Phokæans, who held it, give it up to the people of Delphi:", "4148": "but as soon as they were gone 1 'erikles made an expedition into the country, and restored the temple to the Phokæans;", "4149": "and as the Lacedæmonians had scratched the oracle which the Delphians had given them, on the forehead of the brazen wolf there, Perikles got a response from the oracle for the Athenians, and carved it on the right side of the same wolf.", "4150": "XXII.", "4151": "Events proved that Perikles was right in con­ fining the Athenian empire to Greece.", "4152": "First of all Eubœa revolted, and he was obliged to lead an army to subdue that island.", "4153": "Shortly after this, news came that the Megarians had become hostile, and that an army, under the command of Pleistoanax, king of the Lacedæmonians, was menacing the frontier of Attica.", "4154": "Perikles now in all haste withdrew his troops from Eubœa, to meet the in­ vader.", "4155": "He did not venture on an engagement with the numerous and warlike forces of the enemy, although repeatedly invited by them to fight:", "4156": "but, observing that Pleistoanax was a very young man, and entirely under the influence of Kleandrides, whom the Ephors had sent to act as his tutor and counsellor because of his tender years, he opened secret negotiations with the latter, who at once, for a bribe, agreed to withdraw the Peloponnesians from Attica.", "4157": "When their army returned and dispersed, the Lacedaemonians were so incensed that they imposed a fine on their king, and condemned Kleandrides, who fled the country, to be put to death.", "4158": "This Kleandrides was the father of Gylippus, who caused the ruin of the Athenian expedition in Sicily.", "4159": "Avarice seems to have been hereditary in the family, for Gylippus himself, after brilliant exploits in war, was convicted of taking bribes, and banished from Sparta in disgrace.", "4160": "This is more fully set forth in the Life of I ysander.", "4161": "XXIII.", "4162": "When Perikles submitted the accounts of the campaign to the people, there was an item of ten talents, \" for a necessary purpose,\" which the people passed without any questioning, or any curiosity to learn the secret.", "4163": "Some historians, amongst whom is Theophrastus the philosopher, say that Petikles sent ten talents an­ nually to Sparta, by means of which he bribed the chief magistrates to defer the war, thus not buying peace, but time to make preparations for a better defence.", "4164": "He immediately turned his attention to the insurgents in Eubœa, and proceeding thither with a fleet of fifty sail, and five thousand heavy armed troops, he reduced their cities to submission.", "4165": "He banished from Chalkis the \" equestrian order,\" as it was called, consisting of men of wealth and station ;", "4166": "and he drove all the inhabitants of Hestiæa out of their country, replacing them by Athenian settlers.", "4167": "He treated these people with this pitiless severity, because they had captured an Athenian ship, and put its crew to the sword.", "4168": "XXIV.", "4169": "After this, as the Athenians and Lacedaemonians made a truce for thirty years, Perikles decreed the ex­ pedition against Samos, on the pretext that they had disregarded the commands of the Athenians, to cease from their war with the Milesians.", "4170": "It was thought that he began this war with the Samians to please Aspasia, and this is, therefore, a good opportunity to discuss that person's character, and how she possessed so great influence and ability that the leading politicians of the day were at her feet, while philosophers discussed and admired her dis­ course.", "4171": "It is agreed that she was of Milesian origin, and that her father's name was Axiochus;", "4172": "and she is said to have reserved her favours for the most powerful personages in Greece, in imitation of Thargelia, an Ionian lady of ancient times, of great beauty, ability, and attractions, who had many lovers among the Greeks, and brought them all over to the Persian interest, by which means the seeds of the Persian faction were sown in many cities of Greece, as they were all men of great influence and position.", "4173": "Now some writers say that Perikles valued Aspasia only for her wisdom and political ability.", "4174": "Indeed Sokrateb and his friends used to frequent her society;", "4175": "and those who listened to her discourse used to bring their wives with them, that they too might profit by it, although her profession was far from being honourable or decent, for she kept courtesans in her house.", "4176": "Æschines says that Lysikles, the sheep dealer, a low-born and low-minded man, became one of the first men in Athens, because he lived with Aspasia after Perikles's death.", "4177": "In Plato's dialogue too, called ' Menexenus,' though the first part is written in a humorous style, yet there is in it thus much of serious truth, that she was thought to discuss questions of rhetoric with many Athenians.", "4178": "But Perikles seems to have been more enamoured of Aspasia's person than her intellect.", "4179": "He was married to a woman who was nearly related to him, who had previously been the wife of Hipponikns, by whom she became the mother of Kallias the rich.", "4180": "By her Perikles had two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus;", "4181": "but afterwards, as they could not live com­ fortably together, he, at his wife's wish, handed her over to another husband, and himself lived with Aspasia, of whom he was passionately fond.", "4182": "It is said that he never went in or out of his house during the day without kissing her.", "4183": "In the comedies of the time, she is spoken of as the new Omphale and as Deianeira, and sometimes as Hera (Juno).", "4184": "Kratinor plainly speaks of her as a harlot in the following lines :", "4185": "\" To him Vice bore a Juno new, Aspasia, shameless harlot.\"", "4186": "He is thought to have had a bastard son by her, who is mentioned by Eupolis in his play of ' The Townships,' where Perikles is introduced, asking, \" Lives then my eon ? \" to which Myronides answers :", "4187": "\"", "4188": "He lives, and long had claimed a manly name, But that he feared his harlot mother's shame.\"", "4189": "It is said that Aspasia became so illustrious and well known that the Cyrus who fought with his brother for the empire of Persia, called his favourite concubine Aspasia, though she had before been named Milto.", "4190": "She was a Phokæan by birth, the daughter of Hermotimus.", "4191": "After the death of Cyrus in battle, she was taken into the king's harem, and acquired great influence with him.", "4192": "These particulars about Aspasia occurred to my memory, and I thought that perhaps I might please my readers by relating them.", "4193": "XXV.", "4194": "Perikles is accused of going to war with Samoa to save the Milesians, at the request of Aspasia.", "4195": "These States were at war about the possession of the city of Priene, and the Samians, who were victorious, would not lay down their arms and allow the Athenians to settle the matter by arbitration, as they ordered them to do.", "4196": "For this reason Perikles proceeded to Samos, put an end to the oligarchical form of government there, and sent fifty hostages and as many children to Lemnos, to ensure the good behaviour of the leading men.", "4197": "It is said that each of these hostages offered him a talent for his own freedom, and that much more was offered by that party which was loth to see a democracy established in the city.", "4198": "Besides all this,", "4199": "Pissuthnes the Persian, who had a liking for the Samians, sent and offered him ten thousand pieces of gold if he would spare the city.", "4200": "Perikles, how­ ever, took none of these bribes, but dealt with Samos as he had previously determined, and returned to Athens.", "4201": "The Samians now at once revolted, as Pissuthnes managed to get them back their hostages, and furnished them with the means of carrying on the war.", "4202": "Perikles now made a second expedition against them, and found them in no mind to submit quietly, but determined to dispute the empire of the seas with the Athenians.", "4203": "Perikles gained a signal victory over them in a sea-fight off the Goats'", "4204": "Island, beating a fleet of seventy ships with only forty­ four, twenty of which were transports.", "4205": "XXVI.", "4206": "Simultaneously with his victory and the flight of the enemy he obtained command of the harbour of Samos, and besieged the Samians in their city.", "4207": "They, in spite of their defeat, still possessed courage enough to sally out and fight a battle under the walls;", "4208": "but soon a larger force arrived from Athens, and the Samians were completely blockaded.", "4209": "Perikles now with sixty ships sailed out of the Archi­ pelago into the Mediterranean, according to the most current report intending to meet the Phoenician fleet which was coming to help the Samians, but, according to Stesimbrotus, with the intention of attacking Cyprus, which seems improbable.", "4210": "Whatever his intention may have been, his expedition was a failure, for Melissus, the son of Ithagenes, a man of culture, who was then in command of the Samian forces, conceiving a contempt for the small force of the Athenians and the want of ex­ perience of their leaders after Perikles's departure, per­ suaded his countrymen to attack them.", "4211": "In the battle the Samians proved victorious, taking many Athenians pri­ soners, and destroying many of their ships.", "4212": "By this victory they obtained command of the sea, and were able to supply themselves with more warlike stores than they had possessed before.", "4213": "Aristotle even says that Perikles himself was before this beaten by Melissus in a sea-fight.", "4214": "The Samians branded the figure of an owl on the foreheads of their Athenian prisoners, to revenge themselves for the branding of their own prisoners by the Athenians with the figure of a samaina.", "4215": "This is a ship having a beak turned up like a swine's snout, but with a roomy hull, so as both to carry a large cargo and sail fast.", "4216": "This class of vessel is called samaina because it was first built at Samos by Polykrates, the despot of that island.", "4217": "It is said that the verse of Aristophanes, \" The Samians are a deeply lettered race,\" alludes to this branding.", "4218": "XXVII.", "4219": "When Perikles heard of the disaster which had befallen his army, he returned in all haste to assist them.", "4220": "He beat Melissus, who came out to meet him, and, after putting the enemy to rout, at once built a wall round their city, preferiing to reduce it by blockade to risking the lives of his countrymen in an assault.", "4221": "As time went on the Athenians became impatient and eager to fight, and it was hard to restrain their ardour.", "4222": "Perikles divided the whole force into eight divisions, and made them all draw lots.", "4223": "The division which drew the white bean he permitted to feast and take their ease, while the rest did their duty.", "4224": "For this reason those who are enjoy­ ing themselves call it a \" white day,\" in allusion to the white bean.", "4225": "Ephorus tells us that Perikles made use of battering engines in this siege, being attracted by their novelty, and that Artemon the mechanician was present, who was surnamed Periphoretus because he was lame, and carried in a litter to see such of the works as required his superintendence.", "4226": "This story is proved to be false by Herakleides of Pontus, he quoting Anakreon's poems, in which Artemon Periphoretus is mentioned many genera­ tions before the revolt and siege of Samos.", "4227": "He tells us that Artemon was an effeminate coward who spent most of his time indoors, with two slaves holding a brazen shield over his head for fear that anything should fall upon it, and if he was obliged to go out, used to be carried in a hammock slung so low as almost to touch the ground, from which he received t he name of Periphoretus.", "4228": "XXVIII.", "4229": "In the ninth month of the siege the Samians surrendered.", "4230": "Perikles demolished their walls, confiscated their fleet, and imposed a heavy fine upon them, some part of which was paid at once by the Samians, who gave hostages for the payment of the remainder at fixed periods.", "4231": "Douris, of Samos, makes a lamentable story of this, accusing Perikles and the Athenians of great cruelty, no mention of which is to be found in Thucydides, Ephorus, or Aristotle.", "4232": "He obviously does not tell the truth when he says that Perikles took the captains and marine soldiers of each ship to the market-place at Miletus, bound them to planks, and after they had been so for ten days and were in a miserable state, knocked them on the head with clubs and cast out their bodies without burial.", "4233": "But Douris, even in cases where he has no personal bias, prefers writing an exciting story to keeping to the exact truth, and in this instance probably exaggerated the sufferings of his countrymen in order to gratify his dislike of the Athenians.", "4234": "Perikles, after the reduction of Samos, returned to Athens, where he buried those who had fallen in the war in a magnificent manner, and was much admired for the funeral oration which, as is customary, was spoken by him over the graves of his countrymen.", "4235": "When he descended from the rostrum the women greeted him, crowning him with garlands and ribbons like a victorious athlete, and Elpinike drawing near to him said, \" A fine exploit, truly, Perikles, and well worthy of a crown, to lose many of our brave fellow-citizens, not fighting with Persians or Phœnicians, as my brother Kimon did, but in ruining a city of men of our own blood and our own allies.\"", "4236": "At these words of Elpinike, Perikles merely smiled and repeated the verse of Archilochus— \" Too old thou art for rich perfumes.\"", "4237": "Ion says that his victory over the Samians wonderfully flattered his vanity.", "4238": "Agamemnon, he was wont to say, took ten years to take a barbarian city, but he in nine months had made himself master of the first and most powerful city in Ionia.", "4239": "And the comparison was not an unjust one, for truly the war was a very great under­ taking, and its issue quite uncertain, since, as Thucydides tells us, the Samians came very near to wresting the empire of the sea from the Athenians.", "4240": "XXIX.", "4241": "After these events, as the clouds were gather­ ing for the Peloponnesian war, Perikles persuaded the Athenians to send assistance to the people of Korkyra, who were at war with the Corinthians, and thus to attach to their own hide an island with a powerful naval force, at a moment when the Peloponnesians had all but de­ clared war against them.", "4242": "When the people passed this decree, Perikles sent only ten ships under the command of Lacedæmonius, the son of Kimon, as if he designed a deliberate insult;", "4243": "for the house of Kimon was on peculiarly friendly terms with the Lacedæmonians.", "4244": "His design in sending Lace­ dæmonius out, against his will, and with so few ships, was that if he performed nothing brilliant he might be accused, even more than he was already, of leaning to the side of the Spartans.", "4245": "Indeed, by all means in his power, he always threw obstacles in the way of the advancement of Kimon's family, representing that by their very names they were aliens, one son being named Lacedæmonius, another Thessalus, another Eleius.", "4246": "More­ over, the mother of all three was an Arcadian.", "4247": "Now Perikles was much reproached for sending these ten ships, which were of little value to the Korky reans, and gave a great handle to his enemies to use against him, and in consequence sent a larger force after them to Korkyra, which arrived there after the battle.", "4248": "The Corinthians, enraged at this, complained in the congress of Sparta of the conduct of the Athenians, as did also the Megarians, who said that they were excluded from every market and every harbour which was in Athenian hands, contrary to the ancient rights and common privileges of the Hellenic race.", "4249": "The people of iEgina also considered themselves to be oppressed and ill-treated, and secretly bemoaned their grievances in the ears of the Spartans, for they dared not openly bring any charges against the Athenians.", "4250": "At this time, too, Potidæa, a city subject to Athens, but a colony of Corinth, revolted, and its siege materially hastened the outbreak of the war.", "4251": "Archidamus, indeed, the king of the Lace­ dæmonians, sent ambassadors to Athens, was willing to submit all disputed points to arbitration, and endeavoured to moderate the excitement of his allies, so that war probably would not have broken out if the Athenians could have been persuaded to rescind their decree of ex­ clusion against the Megarians, and to come to terms with them.", "4252": "And, for this reason, Perikles, who was particu­ larly opposed to this, and urged the people not to give way to the Megarians, alone bore the blame of having begun the war.", "4253": "XXX.", "4254": "It is said, that when an embassy arrived at Athens from Lacedaemon to treat upon these matters, Perikles argued that there was a law which forbade the tablet, on which the decree against the Megarians was written, to be taken down. \"", "4255": "Then,\" said Polyalkes, one of the ambassadors,\" do not take it down, but turn it with its face to the wall;", "4256": "for there is no law against that!", "4257": "\"Clever as this retort was, it had no effect on Perikles.", "4258": "He had, it seems, some private spite at the Megarians, though the ground of quarrel which he put publicly forward was that the Megarians had applied to their own use some of the sacred ground;", "4259": "and he passed a decree for a herald to be sent to the Megarians, and then to go on to the Lacedaemonians to complain of their conduct.", "4260": "This decree of Perikles is worded in a candid and reasonable manner;", "4261": "but the herald, Anthemokritus, was thought to have met his death at the hands of the Megarians, and Charinus passed a decree to the effect that Athens should wage war against them to the death, without truce or armistice ;", "4262": "that any Megarian found in Attica should be punished with death, and that the generals, when taking the usual oath for each year, should swear in addition that they would invade the Megarian territory twice every year;", "4263": "and that Anthemokritus should be buried near the city gate leading into the Thriasian plain, which is now called the Double Gate.", "4264": "Now, the Megarians say that they were not to blame for the murder of Anthemokritus, and lay it upon Perikles and Aspasia, quoting the hackneyed rhymes from the ' Acharnians,' of Aristophanes :", "4265": "* Some young Athenians in their drunken play, From Megara Simætha stole away, The men of Megara next, with angered soul, Two of Aspasia's choicest harlots stole.", "4266": "\"XXXI.", "4267": "How the dispute originated it is hard to say, but all writers agree in throwing on Perikles the blame of refusing to reverse the decree.", "4268": "Some attribute his firm­ ness to a wise calculation, saying that the demand was merely made in order to try him, and that any concessions would have been regarded as a sign of weakness;", "4269": "while others say that he treated the Lacedæmonians so cavalierly through pride and a desire to show his own strength.", "4270": "But the worst motive of all, and that to which most men attribute his conduct, was as follows:", "4271": "Pheidias, the sculptor, was, as we have related, entrusted with the task of producing the statue of the tutelary goddess of Athens.", "4272": "His intimacy with Perikles, with whom he had great influence, gained for him many enemies, who, wishing to experiment on the temper of the people towards Perikles himself, bribed Menon, one of Pheidias's fellow-workmen, to seat himself in the market-place as a suppliant who begged that he might receive protection while he denounced and prosecuted Pheidias.", "4273": "The people took this man under its protection, and Pheidias was prosecuted before the Senate.", "4274": "The alleged charges of theft were not proved, for Pheidias, by the advice of Perikles, had originally fashioned the golden part of the statue in such a manner that it could all be taken off and weighed, and this Perikles bade the prosecutor do on this occasion.", "4275": "But the glory which Pheidias ob­ tained by the reality of his work made him an object of envy and hatred, especially when in his sculpture of the battle with the Amazons on the shield of the goddess he introduced his own portrait as a bald-headed old man lifting a great stone with both hands, and also a very fine representation of Perikles, fighting with an Amazon.", "4276": "The position of the hand, which was holding a spear before the face of Perikles, was ingeniously devised as if to conceal the portrait, which, nevertheless, could plainly be seen on either side of it.", "4277": "For this, Pheidias was imprisoned, and there fell sick and died, though some say that his enemies poisoned him in order to cast sus­ picion upon Perikles.", "4278": "At the instance of Glykon, the people voted to Menon, the informer, an immunity from public burdens, and ordered the generals of the State to

harbouring free-born Athenian ladies, with whom Perikles carried on intrigues.", "4281": "Also Diopeithes proposed a decree, that prosecutions should be instituted against all persons who disbelieved in religion, and held theories of their own about heavenly phenomena.", "4282": "This was aimed at Perikles through the philosopher Anaxagoras.", "4283": "As the people adopted this decree, and eagerly listened to these slanderous accusations, another decree was carried by Drakontides, that Perikles should lay the accounts of his dealings with the public revenue before the Prytanes, and that the judges should carry their suffrage from the altar in the Acropolis, and go and determine the cause in the city.", "4284": "At the motion of Hagnon this part of the decree was reversed, but he succeeded in having the action conducted before fifteen hundred judges, in a form of trial which one might call either one for theft, or taking of bribes, or for public wrong-doing.", "4285": "Aspasia was acquitted, quite contrary to justice, according to Æschines, because Perikles shed tears and made a per­ sonal appeal to the judges on her behalf.", "4286": "He feared that Anaxagoras would be convicted, and sent him out of the.", "4287": "city before his trial commenced.", "4288": "And now, as he had be­ come unpopular by means of Pheidias, he at once blew the war into a flame, hoping to put an end to these prosecu­ tions, and to restore his own personal ascendancy by involv­ ing the State in important and dangerous crises, in which it would have to rely for guidance upon himself alone.", "4289": "These are the causes which are assigned for his refusal to permit the Athenians to make any concession to the Lacedæmonians, but the real history of the transaction will never be known.", "4290": "XXXIII.", "4291": "Now, as the Lacedaemonians knew that if he could be removed from power they would find the A the­ nians much more easy to deal with, they bade them \" drive forth the accursed thing,\" alluding to Perikles's descent from the Alkmæonidæ by his mother's side, as we are told by Thucydides the historian.", "4292": "But this attempt had just the contrary effect to that which they intended ;", "4293": "for, instead of suspicion and dislike, Perikles met with much greater honour and respect from his countrymen than before, because they saw that he was an object of especial dislike to the enemy.", "4294": "For this reason, before the Peloponnesians, under Archidamus, invaded Attica, he warned the Athenians that if Archidamus, when he laid waste everything else, spared his own private estate because of the friendly private relations existing between them, or in order to give his personal enemies a ground for impeaching him, that he should give both the land and the farm buildings upon it to the State.", "4295": "The Lacedaemonians invaded Attica with a great host of their own troops and those of their allies, led by Archidamus, their king.", "4296": "They proceeded, ravaging the country as they went, as far as Acharnæ (close to Athens), where they encamped, imagining that the Athenians would never endure to see them there, but would be driven by pride and shame to come out and fight them.", "4297": "However, Perikles thought that it would be a very serious matter to fight for the very existence of Athens against sixty thousand Peloponnesian and Bœotian* heavy-armed troops, and so he pacified those who were dissatisfied at his inactivity by pointing out that trees when cut down quickly grow again, but that when the men of a State are lost, it is hard to raise up others to take their place.", "4298": "He would not call an assembly of the people, because he feared that they would force him to act against his better judgment, but, just as the captain of a ship, when a storm comes on at sea, places everything in the best trim to meet it, and trusting to his own skill and seamanship, dis­ regarding the tears and entreaties of the sea-sick and terrified passengers;", "4299": "so did Perikles shut the gates of Athens, place sufficient forces to ensure the safety of the city at all points, and calmly carry out his own policy, taking little heed of the noisy grumblings of the discon­ tented.", "4300": "Many of his friends besought him to attack, many of his enemies threatened him and abused him, and many songs and offensive jests were written about him, speaking of him as a coward, and one who was betraying the city to its enemies.", "4301": "Kleon too attacked him, using the anger which the citizens felt against him to advance his own personal popularity, as we see from the following lines of Hermippus:", "4302": "“ King of Satyrs, wherefore fear you Spear to wield, and only dare to Talk in swelling phrase, while yet you Cower, Teles like, And when goaded on, past bearing, By our Kleon's tongue so daring, Only gnash your teeth despairing, Still afraid to strike.", "4303": "10XXXIV.", "4304": "Perikles was unmoved by any of these attacks, but quietly endured all this storm of obloquy.", "4305": "He sent a fleet of a hundred ships to attack Peloponnesus, but did not sail with it himself, remaining at home to keep a tight hand over Athens until the Peloponnesians drew off their forces.", "4306": "He regained his popularity with the common people, who suffered much from the war, by giving them allowances of money from the public revenue, and grants of land;", "4307": "for he drove out the entire population of the island of Ægina, and divided the land by lot among the Athenians.", "4308": "A certain amount of relief also was ex­ perienced by reflecting upon the injuries which they were inflicting on the enemy;", "4309": "for the fleet as it sailed round Peloponnesus destroyed many small villages and cities, and ravaged a great extent of country, while Perikles himself led an expedition into the territory of Megara and laid it all waste.", "4310": "By this it is clear that the allies, although they did much damage to the Athenians, yet suffered equally themselves, and never could have pro­ tracted the war for such a length of time as it really lasted, but, as Perikles foretold, must soon have desisted had not Providence interfered and confounded human counsels.", "4311": "For now the pestilence fell among the Athe­ nians, and cut off the flower of their youth.", "4312": "Suffering both in body and mind they raved against Perikles, just as people when delirious with disease attack their fathers or their physicians.", "4313": "They endeavoured to ruin him, urged on by his personal enemies, who assured them that he was the author of the plague, because he had brought all the country people into the city, where they were compelled to live during the heat of summer, crowded together in small rooms and stifling tents, living an idle life too, and breathing foul air instead of the pure country breezes to which they were accustomed.", "4314": "The cause of this, they s aid, was the man who, when the war began, admitted the masses of the country people into the city, and then made no use of them, but allowed them to be penned up together like cattle, and transmit the contagion from one to another, without devising any remedy or alleviation of their sufferings.", "4315": "XXXV.", "4316": "Hoping to relieve them somewhat, and also to annoy the enemy, Perikles manned a hundred and fifty ships, placed on board, besides the sailors, many brave infantry and cavalry soldiers, and was about to put to sea.", "4317": "The Athenians conceived great hopes, and the enemy no less terror from so large an armament.", "4318": "When all was ready, and Perikles himself had just embarked in his own trireme, an eclipse of the sun took place, producing total darkness, and all men were terrified at so great a portent.", "4319": "Perikles, observing that his helmsman was alarmed and knew not what to do, held his cloak over the man's eyes and asked him if he thought that a terrible portent.", "4320": "As he answered that he did not, Perikles said:", "4321": "\" What is the difference, then, between it and an eclipse of the sun, ex­ cept that the eclipse is caused by something larger than my cloak ? \"", "4322": "This subject is discussed by the philosophers in their schools.", "4323": "Perikles sailed with the fleet, but did nothing worthy of so great a force.", "4324": "He besieged the sacred city of Epidaurus, but, although he had great hopes of taking it, he failed on account of the plague, which destroyed not only his own men, but every one who came in contact with them.", "4325": "After this he again endeavoured to encourage the Athenians, to whom he had become an object of dis­ like.", "4326": "However, he did not succeed in pacifying them, but they condemned him by a public vote to be general no more, and to pay a fine which is stated at the lowest estimate to have been fifteen talents, and at the highest fifty.", "4327": "This was carried, according to Idomeneus, by Kleon, but according to Theophrastus by Simmias;", "4328": "whilst Herakleides of Pontus says that it was effected by Lakrateides.", "4329": "XXXVI.", "4330": "He soon regained his public position, for the people's outburst of anger was quenched by the blow they had dealt him, just as a bee leaves its sting in the wound;", "4331": "but his private affairs were in great distress and disorder, as he had lost many of his relatives during the plague, while others were estranged from him on political grounds.", "4332": "Xanthippus too, the eldest of his legitimate sons, who was a spendthrift by nature and married to a woman of expensive habits, a daughter of Tisander, the son of Epilykus, could not bear with his father's stingy ways and the small amount of money which he allowed him.", "4333": "He consequently sent to one of his friends and borrowed money from him as if Perikles had authorised him to do so.", "4334": "When the friend asked for his money back again, Perikles prosecuted him, at which proceeding young Xanthippus was enraged and abused his father, sneering at his way of life and his discussions with the sophists.", "4335": "When some athlete accidentally killed Epitimus of Pharsalus with a javelin, he said that Perikles spent the whole day arguing with Protagoras whether in strict accuracy the javelin, or the man who threw it, or the stewards of the games, ought to be considered the authors of the mishap.", "4336": "And, besides this, Stesimbrotus tells us that Xanthippus put about that scandal about his father and his own wife, so that the father and son remained irreconcilable enemies until Xanthippus's death, which happened during the plague, by an attack of that disorder.", "4337": "At the same time Perikles lost his sister and most of his relations, especially those who supported his policy.", "4338": "Yet he would not yield, nor abate his firmness and constancy of spirit because of these afflictions, but was not observed to weep or mourn, or attend the funeral of any of his relations, until he lost Paralus, the last of his legitimate offspring.", "4339": "Crushed by this blow, he tried in vain to keep up his grand air of indifference, and when carrying a garland to lay upon the corpse he was overpowered by his feelings, so as to burst into a passion of tears and sobs, which he had never done before in his whole life.", "4340": "XXXVII.", "4341": "Athens made trial of her other generals and public men to conduct her affairs, but none appeared to be of sufficient weight or reputation to have such a charge entrusted to him.", "4342": "The city longed for Perikles, and invited him again to lead its counsels and direct its armies;", "4343": "and he, although dejected in spirits and living in seclusion in his own house, was yet persuaded by Alkibiades and his other friends to resume the direction of affairs.", "4344": "The people apologised for their ungrateful treatment of him, and when he was again in office and elected as general, he begged of them to be released from the operations of the law of bastardy, which he himself had originally introduced, in order that his name and race might not altogether become extinct for want of an heir.", "4345": "The provisions of the law were as follows :", "4346": "—", "4347": "Perikles many years before, when he was at the height of his power and had children born to him, as we have related, of legitimate birth, proposed a law that only those born of an Athenian father and mother should be reckoned Athenian citizens.", "4348": "But when the king of Egypt sent a present of forty thousand medimni of wheat to be divided among the citizens, many lawsuits arose about the citizenship of men whose birth had never been questioned before that law came into force, and many vexatious informations were laid.", "4349": "Nearly five thousand men were convicted of illegitimacy of birth and sold for slaves, while those who retained their citizenship and proved themselves to be genuine Athenians amounted to fourteen thousand and forty.", "4350": "It was indeed an unreason­ able request that a law which had been enforced in so many instances should now be broken in the person of its own author, but Perikles's domestic misfortunes, in which he seemed to have paid the penalty for his former haughti­ ness and pride, touched the hearts of the Athenians so much that they thought his sorrows deserving of their pity, and his request such as he was entitled to make and they to grant in common charity, and they consented to his illegitimate son being enrolled in his own tribe and bearing his own name.", "4351": "This man was subsequently put to death by the people, together with all his colleagues, for their conduct after the sea-fight at Arginusæ.", "4352": "XXXVIII.", "4353": "After this it appears that Perikles was attacked by the plague, not acutely or continuously, as in most cases, but in a slow wasting fashion, exhibiting many varieties of symptoms, and gradually undermining his strength.", "4354": "Theophrastus, in his treatise on Ethics, dis­ cusses whether a man's character can be changed by disease, and whether virtue depends upon bodily health.", "4355": "As an example, he quotes a story that Perikles, when one of his friends came to visit him during his sickness, showed him a charm hung round his neck, as a proof that he must be indeed ill to submit to such a piece of folly.", "4356": "As he was now on his deathbed, the most distinguished of the citizens and his surviving friends collected round him and spoke admiringly of his nobleness and immense power, enumerating also the number of his exploits, and the trophies which he had set up for victories gained;", "4357": "for while in chief command he had won no less than nine victories for Athens.", "4358": "They were talking thus to one another in his presence, imagining that he could no longer understand them, but had lost his power of attending to them.", "4359": "He, however, was following all that they said, and suddenly broke silence, saying that he was surprised at their remembering and praising him for the exploits which depended entirely upon fortune for their success, and which many other generals had done as well as him­ self, while they did not mention his greatest and most glorious title to fame.", "4360": "“ No Athenian,\" said he,“ ever wore black because of me.", "4361": "\"XXXIX.", "4362": "Perikles was to be admired, not only for his gentleness and mildness of spirit, which he preserved through the most violent political crises and outbreaks of personal hatred to himself, but also for his lofty dispo­ sition.", "4363": "He himself accounted it his greatest virtue that he never gave way to feelings of envy or hatred, but from his own exalted pinnacle of greatness never regarded any man as so much his enemy that he could never be his friend.", "4364": "This alone, in my opinion, justifies that outrageous nickname of his, and gives it a certain propriety;", "4365": "for so serene and impartial a man, utterly uncorrupt though possessed of great power, might naturally be called Olympian.", "4366": "Thus it is that we believe that the gods, who are the authors of all good and of no evil to men, rule over us and over all created things, not as the poets describe them in their bewildering fashion, which their own poems prove to be untrue.", "4367": "The poets describe the abode of the.", "4368": "gods as a safe and untroubled place where no wind or clouds are, always enjoying a mild air and clear light, thinking such a place to be fittest for a life of immortal blessedness;", "4369": "while they represent the gods themselves as full of disorder and anger and spite and other passions, which are not becoming even to mortal men of common sense.", "4370": "These reflections, however, perhaps belong to another subject.", "4371": "Events soon made the loss of Perikles felt and regretted by the Athenians.", "4372": "Those who during his lifetime had complained that his power completely threw them into the shade, when after his death they had made trial of other orators and statesmen, were obliged to confess that with all his arrogance no man ever was really more moderate, and that his real mildness in dealing with men was as remarkable as his apparent pride and assumption.", "4373": "His power, which had been so grudged and envied, and called monarchy and despotism, now was proved to have been the saving of the State ;", "4374": "such an amount of corrupt dealing and wickedness suddenly broke out in public affairs, which he before had crushed and forced to hide itself, and so prevented its becoming incurable through impunity and licence.", "4375": "I. SUCH a man did Perikles show himself to be in his most memorable acts, as far as they are extant.", "4376": "Let us now turn our attention to Fabius.", "4377": "The first of the family is said to descend from one of the nymphs, according to some writers, according to others from an Italian lady who became the mother of Fabius by Hercules near the river Tiber.", "4378": "From him descended the family of the Fabii, one of the largest and most renowned in Rome.", "4379": "Some say that the men of this race were the first to use pitfalls in hunting, and were anciently named Fodii in consequence;", "4380": "for up to the present day ditches are called fossæ, and to dig is called fodere in Latin:", "4381": "and thus in time the two sounds became confused, and they obtained the name of Fabii.", "4382": "The family produced many dis­ tinguished men, the greatest of whom was Rullus, who was for that reason named Maximu6 by the Romans.", "4383": "From him Fabius Maximus, of whom I am now writing, was fourth in descent.", "4384": "His own personal nickname was Verrucosus, because he had a little wart growing on his upper lip.", "4385": "The name of Ovicula, signifying sheep, was also given him while yet a child, because of his slow and gentle disposition.", "4386": "He was quiet -and silent, very cautious in taking part in children's games, and learned his lessons slowly and with difficulty, which, combined with his easy obliging ways with his comrades, made those who did not, know him think that he was dull and stupid.", "4387": "Few there were who could discern, hidden in the depths of his soul, his glorious and lion-like character.", "4388": "Soon, however, as time went on, and he began to take part in public affairs, he proved that his apparent want of energy was really due to serenity of intellect, that he was cautious because he weighed matters well beforehand, and that while he was never eager or easily moved, yet he was always steady and trustworthy.", "4389": "Observing the immense extent of the empire, and the numerous wars in which it was engaged, he exercised his body in warlike exercises, regarding it as his natural means of defence, while he also studied oratory as the means by which to influenco the people, in a style suited to his own life and character.", "4390": "In his speeches there were no flowery passages, no empty graces of style, but there was a plain common sense peculiar to himself, and a depth of sententious maxims which is said to have resembled Thucydides.", "4391": "One of his speeches is extant, a funeral oration which he made in public over his son who died after he had been consul.", "4392": "II.", "4393": "He was consul five times, and in his firstconsulship obtaineda\" triumph overthe Ligurians.", "4394": "They were defeated by himand driven with great loss to take refuge in the Alps, and thus were prevented from ravaging the neighbouring parts of Italy as they had been wont to do.", "4395": "When Hannibal invaded Italy, won his first battle at the Trebia, and marched through Etruria, laying everything waste, as he went, the Romans were terribly disheartened and cast down, and terrible prodigies took place, some of the usual kind, that is, by lightning, and others of an entirely new and strange character.", "4396": "It was said that shields of their own accord became drenched with blood:", "4397": "that at Antium standing corn bled when it was cut by the reapers;", "4398": "that red-hot stones fell from heaven, and that the sky above Falerii was seen to open and tablets to fall, on one of which was written the words \"", "4399": "Mars is shaking his arms.", "4400": "\"None of these omens had any effect upon Caius Flaminius, the consul, for, besides his naturally spirited and ambitious nature, he was excited by the successes which he had previously won, contrary to all reasonable probability.", "4401": "Once, against the express command of the Senate, and in spite of the opposition of his colleague, he engaged with the Gauls and won a victory over them.", "4402": "Fabius also was but little disturbed by the omens, because of their strange and unintelligible character, though many were alarmed at them.", "4403": "Knowing how few the enemy were in numbers, and their great want of money and supplies, he advised the Romans not to offer battle to a man who had at his disposal an army trained by many previous encounters to a rare pitch of perfection, but rather to send reinforcements to their allies, keep a tight hand over their subject cities, and allow Hannibal's brilliant little force to die away like a lamp which flares up brightly with but little oil to sustain it.", "4404": "III.", "4405": "This reasoning had no effect upon Flaminius, who said that he would not endure to see an enemy marching upon Rome, and would not, like Camillus of old, fight in the streets of Rome herself.", "4406": "He ordered the military tribunes to put the army in motion, and himself leaped upon his horse's back.", "4407": "The horse for no visible reason shied in violent terror, and Flaminius was thrown head­ long to the ground.", "4408": "He did not, however, alter his determination, but marched to meet Hannibal, and drew up his forces for battle near the lake Thrasymenus, in Etruria.", "4409": "When the armies met, an earthquake took place which destroyed cities, changed the courses of rivers, and cast down the crests of precipices;", "4410": "but in spite of its violence, no one of the combatants perceived it.", "4411": "Flaminius himself, after many feats of strength and courage, fell dead, and around him lay the bravest Romans.", "4412": "The rest fled, and the slaughter was so great that fifteen thwere killed, and as many more taken prisoners.", "4413": "Hannibal generously desired to bury the body of Flaminius with military honours, to show his esteem for the consul's bravery ;", "4414": "but it could not be found among the slain, and no one knew how it disappeared.", "4415": "The defeat at the Trebia had not been clearly explained either by the general who wrote the despatch, or by the messenger who carried it, as they falsely represented it to have been a drawn battle;", "4416": "but as soon as the prætor Pomponius heard the news of this second misfortune, he assembled the people in the Forum, and said, without any roundabout apologies whatever, \" Romans, we have lost a grea t battle, the army is destroyed, and the consul Flam­ inius has fallen.", "4417": "Now, therefore, take counsel for your own safety.”", "4418": "These words produced the same impression on the people that a gust of wind does upon the sea.", "4419": "No one could calmly reflect after such a sudden downfall of their hopes.", "4420": "All, however, agreed that the State required one irresponsible ruler, which the Romans call a dictatorship, and a man who would fulfil this office with fearless energy.", "4421": "Such a man, they felt, was Fabius Maximus, who was sufficiently qualified for the office by his abilities and the respect which his countrymen bore him, and was moreover at that time of life when the strength of the body is fully capable of carrying out the ideas of the mind, but when courage is somewhat tempered by discretion.", "4422": "IV.", "4423": "As soon as the people had passed their decree, Fabius was appointed dictator,. and appointed Marcus Minucius his master of the horse.", "4424": "First, however, he begged of the Senate to allow him the use of a horse during his cam­ paigns.", "4425": "There was an ancient law forbidding this practice, either because the main strength of the army was thought to lie in the columns of infantry, and for that reason the dictator ought to remain always with them, or else because, while in all other respects the dictator's power is equal to that of a king, it was thought well that in this one point he should have to ask leave of the people.", "4426": "Next, however, Fabius, wishing at once to show the greatness and splen­ dour of his office, and so make the citizens more ready to obey him, appeared in public with all his twenty-four lictors at once ;", "4427": "and when the surviving consul met him, he sent an officer to bid him dismiss his lictors, lay aside his insignia of office, and come before him as a mere private citizen.", "4428": "After this he began in the best possible way, that is, by a religious ceremony, and assured the people that it was in consequence of the impiety and carelessness of their late general, not by any fault of the army, that they had been defeated.", "4429": "Thus he encouraged them not to fear their enemies, but to respect the gods and render them propitious, not that he implanted any superstitious observances among them, but he confirmed their valour by piety, and took away from them all fear of the enemy by the hopes which he held out to them of divine protec­ tion.", "4430": "At this time many of the holy and mysterious books, which contain secrets of great value to the State, were inspected.", "4431": "These are called the Sibylline books.", "4432": "One of the sentences preserved in these was said to have an evident bearing on contemporary events;", "4433": "what it was can only be guessed at by what was done.", "4434": "The dictator appeared before the people and publicly vowed to the gods a ver sacrum, that is, ull the young which the next spring should produce, from the goats, the sheep, and the kine on every mountain, and plain, and river, and pasture within the bounds of Italy.", "4435": "All these he swore that he would sacrifice, and moreover that he would exhibit musical and dramatic shows, and expend upon them the sum of three hundred and thirty-three sestertia, and three hundred and thirty-three denarii, and one-third of a denarius.", "4436": "The sum total of this in our Greek money is eighty-three thousand five hundred and eighty-three drachmas and two obols.", "4437": "What the particular virtue of this exact number may be it is hard to determine, unless it be on account of the value of the number three, which is by nature perfect, and the first of odd numbers, the first also of plurals, and containing within itself all the elements of the qualities of number.", "4438": "V. Fabius, by teaching the people to rest their hopes on religion, made them view the future with a more cheerful heart.", "4439": "For his own part, he trusted entirely to himself to win the victory, believing that Heaven grants men success according to the valour and conduct which they display.", "4440": "He marched against Hannibal, not with any design of fighting him, but of wearing out his army by long delays, until he could, by his superior numbers and resources, deal with him easily.", "4441": "With this object in view he always took care to secure himself from Hannibal's cavalry, by occupying the mountains overhanging the Carthaginian camp, where he remained quiet as long as the enemy did, but when they moved he used to accompany them, showing himself at intervals upon the heights at such a distance as not to be forced to fight against his will, and yet, from the very slowness of his movements, making the enemy fear that at every moment he was about to attack.", "4442": "By these dilatory manoeuvres he incurred general contempt, and was looked upon with disgust by his own soldiers, while the enemy, with the exception of one man, thought him utterly without warlike enterprise.", "4443": "That man was Hannibal himself.", "4444": "He alone perceived Fabius's true generalship and thorough comprehension of the war, and saw that either he must by some means be brought to fight a battle, or else the Carthaginians were lost, if they could not make use of their superiority in arms, but were to be worn away and reduced in number and resources, in which they were already deficient.", "4445": "He put in force every conceivable military stratagem and device, like a skilful wrestler when he tries to lay hold of his antagonist, and kept attacking Fabius, skirmishing round him, and drawing him from place to place, in his endeavours to make him quit his policy of caution.", "4446": "But Fabius was convinced that he was right, and steadily declined battle.", "4447": "His master of the horse, Minucius, who longed for action, gave him much trouble.", "4448": "This man made unseemly boasts, and harangued the army, filling it with wild excitement and self-confidence.", "4449": "The soldiers in derision used to call Fabius Hannibal's lacquey, because he followed him wherever he went, and thought Minucius a really great general, and worthy of the name of Roman.", "4450": "Minucius, encouraged in his arrogant vauntings, began to ridicule the habit of encamping on the mountain-tops, saying that the dictator always took care to provide them with good seats from which to behold the spectacle of the burning and plundering of Italy, and used to ask the friends of Fabius whether he took his army up so near the sky because he had ceased to take any interest in what went on on the earth below, or whether it was in order to conceal it from the enemy among the clouds and mists.", "4451": "When Fabius was informed of these insults by his friends, who begged him to wipe away this disgrace by risking a battle, he answered, “ If I did so, I should be more cowardly than I am now thought to be, in abandoning the policy which I have determined on because of men's slanders and sneers.", "4452": "It is no shame to fear for one's country, but to regard the opinions and spiteful criticisms of the people would be unworthy of the high office which I hold, and would show me the slave of those whom I ought to govern and restrain when they would fain do wrong.\"", "4453": "VI. After this, Hannibal made a blunder.", "4454": "Wishing to move his army further from that of Fabius, and to gain an open part of the country where the could obtain forage, he ordered his guides one night after supper to lead the way at once to Casinatum.", "4455": "They, misunderstand­ ing him because of his foreign pronunciation, led his forces to the borders of Campania, near the city of Casilinum, through the midst of which flows the river Lothronus, which the Romans call Vulturnus.", "4456": "This country is full of mountains, except one valley that runs towards the sea-coast, where the river at the end of its course overflows into extensive marshes, with deep beds of sand.", "4457": "The beach itself is rough and impracticable for shipping.", "4458": "When Hannibal was marching down this valley, Fabius, by his superior knowledge of the country, came up with him, placed four thousand men to guard the narrow outlet, established the main body in a safe position in the mountains, and with the light-armed troops fell upon and harassed the rear of Hannibal's army, throwing it all into disorder, and killing about eight hundred men.", "4459": "U pon this, Hannibal determined to retrace his steps.", "4460": "Perceiving the mistake which he had made, and the danger he was in, he crucified his guides, but still could not tell how to force his way out through the Roman army which was in possession of the mountain passes.", "4461": "While all were terrified and disheartened, believing them­ selves to be beset on all sides by dangers from which there was no escape, Hannibal decided on extricating himself by stratagem.", "4462": "Taking about two thousand captured oxen, he ordered his soldiers to bind a torch or faggot of dry wood to their horns, and at night at a given signal to set them on fire, and drive the animals towards the narrow outlet near the enemy's camp.", "4463": "While this was being done, he got the remainder of the troops under arms and led them slowly forward.", "4464": "The cattle, while the flame was moderate, and burned only the wood, walked steadily forward towards the mountain side, astonishing the shepherds on the mountain, who thought that it must be an army, marching in one great column, carrying torches.", "4465": "But when their horns were burned to the quick, causing them considerable pain, the beasts, now scorched by the tire from one another as they shook their heads, set off in wild career over the mountains, with their foreheads and tails blazing, setting fire to a great part of the wood through which they passed.", "4466": "The Romans watching the pass were terribly scared at the sight;", "4467": "for the flames looked like torches carried by men running, and they fell into great confusion and alarm, thinking that they were surrounded, and about to be attacked on all sides by the enemy.", "4468": "They dared not remain at their post, but abandoned the pass, and made for the main body.", "4469": "At that moment Hannibal's light troops took possession of the heights commanding the outlet, and the main army marched safely through, loaded with plunder.", "4470": "VII.", "4471": "It happened that while it was yet night Fabius perceived the trick;", "4472": "for some of the oxen in their flight had fallen into the hands of the Romans;", "4473": "but, fearing to fall into an ambuscade in the darkness, he kept his men quiet under arms.", "4474": "When day broke he pursued and attacked the rearguard, which led to many confused skir­ mishes in the rough ground, and produced great confusion, till Hannibal sent back his practised Spanish mountaineers from the head of his column.", "4475": "These men, being light and active, attacked the heavily-armed Roman infantry and beat off Fabius' attack with very considerable loss.", "4476": "Now Fabius's unpopularity reached its highest pitch, and he was regarded with scorn and contempt.", "4477": "He had, they said, determined to refrain from a pitched battle, meaning to overcome Hannibal by superior generalship, and he had been defeated in that too.", "4478": "And Hannibal himself, wishing to increase the dislike which the Romans felt for him, though he burned and ravaged every other part of Italy, forbade his men to touch Fabius's own estates, and even placed a guard to see that no damage was done to them.", "4479": "This was reported at Rome, greatly to his dis­ credit ;", "4480": "and the tribunes of the people brought all kinds of false accusations against him in public harangues, in­ stigated chiefly by Metilius, who was not Fabius's personal enemy, but being a relative of Minucius, the Master of the Horso, thought that he was pressing the interests of the latter by giving currency to all these scandalous reports about Fabius.", "4481": "He was also disliked by the Senate because of the terms which he had arranged with Han­ nibal about the exchange of prisoners.", "4482": "The two com­ manders agreed that the prisoners should be exchanged man for man, and that if either party had more than the other, he should redeem for two hundred and fifty drachmas per man.", "4483": "When, then, this exchange took place, two hundred and forty Romans were found remaining in Hannibal's hands.", "4484": "The Senate determined not to send these men's ransom, and blamed Fabius for having acted improperly and against the interests of the State in taking back men whose cowardice had made them fall into the hands of the enemy.", "4485": "Fabius, on hearing this, was not moved at the discontent of the citizens, but having no money, as he could not bear to deceive Hannibal and give up his countrymen, sent his son to Rome with orders to sell part of his estate, and bring him the money at once to the camp.", "4486": "The young man soon sold the land, and quickly returned.", "4487": "Fabius now sent the ransom to Hannibal and recovered the prisoners, many of whom afterwards offered to repay him ;", "4488": "but he would take nothing, and forgave their debt to them all.", "4489": "VIII.", "4490": "After this the priests recalled him to Rome to perform certain sacrifices, He now transferred the com­ mand to Minucius, and not merely ordered him as dictator not to fight or entangle himself with the enemy, but even gave him much advice and besought him not to do so, all of which Minucius set at nought, and at once attacked the enemy.", "4491": "Once he observed that Hannibal had sent the greater part of his army out to forage for provisions, and, attacking the remaining troops, he drove them into their intrenched camp, slew many, and terrified the rest, who feared that he might carry the camp by assault.", "4492": "When Hannibal's forces collected again, Minucius effected his retreat with safety, having excited both himself and the army with his success, and filled them with a spirit of reckless daring.", "4493": "Soon an inflated report of the action reached Rome.", "4494": "Fabius, when he heard of it, said that with Minucius he feared success more than failure;", "4495": "but the populace were delighted, and joyfully collected in the Forum, where Metilius the tribune ascended the rostra, and made a speech glorifying Minucius, and accusing Fabius not merely of remissness or cowardice, but of actual treachery, accusing also the other leading men of the city of having brought on the war from the very beginning in order to destroy the constitution;", "4496": "and he also charged them with having placed the city in the hands of one man as dictator, who by his dilatory proceedings would give Hannibal time to establish himself firmly and to obtain reinforcements from Africa to enable him to conquer Italy.", "4497": "IX.", "4498": "When Fabius addressed the people, he did not deign to make any defence against the accusations of the tribune, but said that he should accomplish his sacrifices and sacred duties as quickly as possible, in order to return to the army and punish Minucius for having fought a battle against his orders.", "4499": "At this a great clamour was raised by the people, who feared for their favourite Minu­ cius.", "4500": "for a dictator has power to imprison any man, and even to put him to death ;", "4501": "and they thought that Fabius, a mild-tempered man now at last stirred up to wrath, would be harsh and inexorable.", "4502": "All refrained from speak­ ing, but Metilius, having nothing to fear because of the privileges of his office of tribune (for that is the only office which does not lose its prerogatives on the election of a dictator, but remains untouched though all the rest are annulled), made a violent appeal to the people, begging them not to give up Minucius, nor allow him to be treated as Manlius Torquatus treated his son, who had him be­ headed, although he had fought most bravely and gained a crown of laurel for his victory.", "4503": "He asked them to remove Fabius from his dictatorship, and to bestow it upon one who was able and willing to save the country.", "4504": "Excited as they were by these words, they yet did not venture upon removing Fabius from his post, in spite of their feeling against him, but they decreed that Minucius should conduct the war, having equal powers with the dictator, a thing never before done in Rome, but which occurred shortly afterwards.", "4505": "after the disaster at Cannæ, when Marcus Junius was dictator in the camp, and, as many members of the Senate had perished in the battle, they chose another dictator, Fabius Buteo.", "4506": "However, he, after enrolling the new senators, on the same day dis­ missed his lictors, got rid of the crowd which escorted him, and mixed with the people in the Forum, transacting some business of his own as a private man.X.", "4507": "Now the people, by placing Minucius on the same footing with the dictator, thought to humble Fabius, but they formed a very false estimate of his character.", "4508": "He did not reckon their ignorance to be his misfortune, but as Diogenes the philosopher, when some one said \"", "4509": "They are deriding you,\" answered \"", "4510": "But I am not derided,\" thinking that those alone are derided who are affected and disturbed by it, so Fabius quietly and unconcernedly endured all that was done, hereby affording an example of the truth of that philosophic maxim that a good and honest man can suffer no disgrace.", "4511": "Yet he grieved over the folly of the people on public grounds, because they had given a man of reckless ambition an opportunity for indulging his desire for battle;", "4512": "and, fearing that Minucius would be altogether beside himself with pride and vain glory, and would soon do some irreparable mischief, he left Rome unperceived by any one.", "4513": "On reaching the camp, he found Minucius no longer endurable, but in­ solent and overbearing, and demanding to have the sole command every other day.", "4514": "To this Fabius would not agree, but divided his forces with him, thinking it better to command a part than partly to command the whole of the army.", "4515": "He took the first and fourth legion, and left the second and third to Minucius, dividing the auxiliary troops equally with him.", "4516": "As Minucius gave himself great airs, and was gratified at the thought that the greatest officer in the State had been humbled and brought low by his means, Fabius reminded him that if he judged aright, he would regard Hannibal, not Fabius, as his enemy;", "4517": "but that if he per­ sisted in his rivalry with his colleagues, he must beware lest he, the honoured victor, should appear more careless of the safety and success of his countrymen, than he who had been overcome and ill-treated by them.", "4518": "XI.", "4519": "Minucius thought all this to be merely the ex­ pression of the old man's jealousy.", "4520": "He took his allotted troops, and encamped apart from him.", "4521": "Hannibal was not ignorant of what was passing, and watched all their movements narrowly.", "4522": "There was a hill between the two armies, which it was not difficult to take, which when taken would afford an army a safe position, and one well supplied with necessaries.", "4523": "The plain by which it was surrounded appeared to be perfectly smooth, but was nevertheless intersected with ditches and other hollow depressions.", "4524": "On this account Hannibal would not take the hill, although he could easily have done so, but preferred to leave it untouched, in order to draw the enemy into fighting for its possession.", "4525": "But as soon as he saw Fabius separated from Minucius, he placed during the night some troops in the depressions and hollows which we have mentioned, and at daybreak sent a few men to take the hill, in order to draw Minucius into fighting for it, in which he succeeded.", "4526": "Minucius first sent out his light troops, then his cavalry, and finally, seeing that Hannibal was reinforcing the troops on the hill, he came down with his entire force.", "4527": "He fought stoutly, and held his own against the soldiers on the hill, who shot their missiles at him;", "4528": "when Hannibal, seeing him thoroughly deceived, and offering an unprotected flank to the troops in the ambush, gave them the signal to charge.", "4529": "Upon this they attacked the Romans from all sides, rushing upon them with loud shouts, cutting off the rearmost men, and throwing the whole army into con­ fusion and panic.", "4530": "Minucius himself lost heart and kept glancing first at one and then at another of his officers, none of whom ventured to stand their ground, but betook themselves in a confused mass to running away, a proceeding which brought them no safety, for the Numidian horsemen, as the day was now theirs, scoured the plain, encompassing the fugitives, and cut off all stragglers.", "4531": "XII.", "4532": "Fabius had carefully watched the Romans, and saw in what danger they were.", "4533": "Conscious, it would seem, of what was going to happen, he had kept his troops under arms, and gained his information of what was going on, not from the reports of scouts, but from his own eyesight, from a convenient height outside of his camp.", "4534": "As soon as he saw the army surrounded and panic- stricken, and heard the cries of the Romans, who no longer fought, but were overcome by terror, and betaking themselves to flight, he smote his thigh and with a deep sigh, said to his friends, \" By Hercules, now Minucius has ruined himself, quicker than I expected, and yet slower than his manoeuvres warranted.\"", "4535": "Having given orders to carry out the standards as quickly as possible, and for the whole army to follow, he said aloud, \" My men, hurry on your march :", "4536": "think of Marcus Minucius;", "4537": "he is a brave man and loves his country.", "4538": "If he has made any mistake in his haste to drive out the enemy, we will blame him for that at another time.\"", "4539": "The appearance of Fabius scared and drove back the Numidians, who were slaugh­ tering the fugitives in the plain;", "4540": "next he bore against those who were attacking the Roman rear, slaying all he met, though most of them, before they were cut off and treated as they had treated the Romans, betook themselves to flight.", "4541": "Hannibal seeing that the fortune of the battle was changed, and how Fabius himself, with a strength beyond his years, was forcing his way through the thick­ est battle up the hill to reach Minucius, withdrew his troops, and, sounding a retreat, led them back into his en­ trenched camp, affording a most seasonable relief to the Romans.", "4542": "It is said that Hannibal as he retired, spoke jokingly about Fabius to his friends in the words, “ Did I not often warn you that the dark cloud which has so long brooded on the mountain tops, would at last break upon us with blasts of hail and storm ?", "4543": "\"XIII.", "4544": "After the battle Fabius collected the spoils of such of the enemy as were slain, and drew off his forces without letting fall a single boastful or offensive expression about his colleague.", "4545": "But Minucius assembled his own troops, and thus addressed them, \" My fellow-soldiers, it is beyond human skill to make no mistakes in matters of importance, but it is the part of a man of courage and sense to use his mistakes as warnings for the future.", "4546": "I myself confess that I have little fault to find with Fortune, and great reason to thank her;", "4547": "for in the space of one day I have learned what I never knew in all my previous life:", "4548": "that is, that I am not able to command others, but myself require a commander, and I have no ambition to conquer a man by whom it is more glorious to be defeated.", "4549": "The dictator is your leader in every thing except in this, that I will lead you to express your thankfulness to him, by being the first to offer myself to him as an example of obedience and willingness to carry out his orders.\"", "4550": "After these words he ordered the eagles to be raised aloft and all the soldiers to follow them to the camp of Fabius.", "4551": "On entering it, he proceeded to the General's tent, to the surprise and wonderment of all.", "4552": "When Fabius was come out, he placed his standards in the ground before him, and himself addressed him as father in a loud voice, while his soldiers greeted those of Fabius by the name of their Patrons, which is the name by which freed men address those who have set them free.", "4553": "Silence being enforced, Minucius said:", "4554": "“ Dictator, you have won two victories to­ day, for you have conquered Hannibal by your bravery, and your colleague by your kindness and your generalship.", "4555": "By the one you have saved our lives, and by the other you have taught us our duty, for we have been disgrace­ fully defeated by Hannibal, but beneficially and honour­ ably by you.", "4556": "I call you my excellent father, having no more honourable appellation to bestow, since I owe a greater debt of gratitude to you than to him who begot me.", "4557": "To him I merely owe my single life, but to you I owe not only that but the lives of all my men.\"", "4558": "After these words he embraced Fabius, and the soldiers followed his example, embracing and kissing one another, so that the camp was full of joy and of most blessed tears.", "4559": "XIV.", "4560": "After this, Fabius laid down his office, and consuls were again elected.", "4561": "Those who were first elected followed the defensive policy of Fabius, avoiding pitched battles with Hannibal, but reinforcing the allies and preventing defections.", "4562": "But when Terentius Varro was made consul, a man of low birth, but notorious for his rash temper and his popularity with the people, he made no secret, in his inexperience and self-confidence, of his intention of risking everything on one cast.", "4563": "He was always reiterating in his public speeches that under such generals as Fal)ins the war made no progress, whereas he would conquer the enemy the first day he saw him.", "4564": "By means of these boastful speeches he enrolled as soldiers such a multitude as the Romans had never before had at their disposal in any war, for there collected for the battle eighty-eight thousand men.", "4565": "This caused great disquietude to Fabius and other sensible Romans, who feared that if so many of the youth of Rome were cut off, the city would never recover from the blow.", "4566": "They addressed themselves there­ fore to the other consul, Paulus Æmilius, a man of great experience in war, but disagreeable to the people and afraid of them because he had once been fined by them.", "4567": "Fabius encouraged him to attempt to hold the other consul's rashness in check, pointing out that he would have to fight for his country's safety with Terentius Varro no less than with Hannibal.", "4568": "Varro, he said, will hasten to engage because he does not know his own strength, and Hannibal will do so because he knows his own weakness.", "4569": "\"", "4570": "I myself, Paulus,\" said he, \" am more < to be believed than Varro as to the condition of Hannibal's affairs, and I am sure that if no battle takes place with him for a year, he will either perish in this country or be compelled to quit it;", "4571": "because even now, when he seems to be victorious and carrying all before him, not one of his enemies have come over to his side, while scarcely a third of the force which he brought from home is now sur­ viving.\"", "4572": "It is said that Paulus answered as follows:", "4573": "\" For my own part, Fabius, it is better for me to fall by the spears of the enemy than be again condemned by the votes of my own countrymen;", "4574": "but if public affairs are indeed in this critical situation, I will endeavour rather to approve myself a good general to you than to all those who are urging me to the opposite course.\"", "4575": "With this determination Paulus began the campaign.", "4576": "XV.", "4577": "Varro induced his colleague to adopt the system of each consul holding the chief command on alternate days..", "4578": "He proceeded to encamp near Hannibal on the banks of the river Aufidus, close to the village of Cannæ.", "4579": "At daybreak he showed the signal of battle (a red tunic displayed over the General's tent), so that the Cartha­ ginians were at first disheartened at the daring of the consul and the great number of his troops, more than twice that of their own army.", "4580": "Hannibal ordered his soldiers to get under arms, and himself rode with a few others to a rising ground, from which he viewed the enemy, who were already forming their ranks.", "4581": "When one Gisco, a man of his own rank, said to him that the numbers of the enemy were wonderful, Hannibal with a serious air replied, \" Another circumstance much more wonderful than this has escaped your notice, Gisco.”", "4582": "When Gisco asked what it might be, Hannibal answered, “ It is, that among all those men before you there is not one named Gisco.\"", "4583": "At this unexpected answer they all began to laugh, and as they came down the hill they kept telling this joke to all whom they met, so that the laugh became universal, and Hannibal's staff was quite over­ powered with merriment.", "4584": "The Carthaginian soldiers seeing this took courage, thinking that their General must be in a position to despise his enemy if he could thus laugh and jest in the presence of danger.", "4585": "XVI.", "4586": "In the battle Hannibal employed several strata­ gems:", "4587": "first, in securing the advantage of position, by getting the wind at his back, for it blew a hurricane, raising a harsh dust from the sandy plains, which rose over the Carthaginians and blew in the faces of the Romans, throwing them into confusion.", "4588": "Secondly, in his disposition of his forces he showed great skill.", "4589": "The best troops were placed on the wings, and the centre, which was composed of the worst, was made to project far beyond the rest of the line.", "4590": "The troops on each wing were told that when the Romans had driven in this part of the line and were so become partly enclosed, that each wing must turn inwards, and attack them in the flank and rear and endeavour to surround them.", "4591": "This was the cause of the greatest slaughter;", "4592": "for when the centre gave way, and made room for the pursuing Romans, Hannibal's line assumed a crescent form, and the commanders of the select battalions charging from the right and left of the Romans attacked them in flank, destroying every man except such as escaped being surrounded.", "4593": "It is related that a similar disaster betel the Roman cavalry.", "4594": "The horse of Paulus was wounded, and threw its rider, upon which man after man of his staff dismounted and came to help the consul on foot.", "4595": "The cavalry, seeing this, took it for a general order to dismount, and at once attacked the enemy on foot.", "4596": "Hannibal, seeing this, said, \" I aID better pleased at this than if he had handed them over to me bound hand and foot.\"", "4597": "This anecdote is found in those writers who have described the incidents of the battle in detail.", "4598": "Of the consuls, Varro escaped with a few followers to Venusia.", "4599": "Paulus, in the whirling eddies of the rout, covered with darts which still stuck in his wounds, and overwhelmed with sorrow at the defeat, sat down on a stone to await his death at the hands of the enemy.", "4600": "The blood with which his face and head were covered made it hard for any one to recognise him;", "4601": "but even his own friends and servants passed him by, taking no heed of him.", "4602": "Only Cornelius Lentulus, a young patrician, saw and recognised him.", "4603": "Dismounting from his horse and leading it up to him he begged him to take it and pre­ serve his life, at a time when the State especially needed a wise ruler.", "4604": "But he refused, and forced the youth, in spite of his tears, to remount his horse.", "4605": "He then took him by the hand, saying, \"Lentulus, tell Fabius Maximus, and bear witness yourself, that Paulus jEmilius followed his instructions to the last, and departed from nothing of what was agreed upon between us;", "4606": "but he was vanquished first by Varro, and secondly by Hannibal.\"", "4607": "Having given Lentulus these instructions he sent him away, and flinging himself on to the enemy's swords perished.", "4608": "In that battle it is reckoned that fifty thousand Romans fell, and four thousand were taken prisoners, besides not less than ten thousand who were taken after the battle in the camps of the two consuls.", "4609": "XVII.", "4610": "After this immense success, Hannibal was urged by his friends to follow up his victory and enter Rome with the fugitives, promising that five days thereafter he should sup in the Capitol.", "4611": "It is not easy to say what reasons could have deterred him from doing so, and it seems rather as if some divinity prevented his march, and inspired him with the dilatory and timid policy which he followed.", "4612": "It is said that the Carthaginian, Barca, said to him, “ You know how to win a victory, but do not know how to use one.\"", "4613": "Yet so great a change was effected by this victory that he, who before it had not possessed a single city, market, or harbour in Italy, and had to obtain his provisions with the utmost difficulty by plunder, having no regular base of operations, but merely wander­ ing about with his army as though carrying on brigand­ age on a large scale, now saw nearly the whole of Italy at his feet.", "4614": "Some of the largest and most powerful States came over to him of their own accord, and he attacked and took Capua, the most important city next to Rome itself.", "4615": "It would appear that the saying of Euripides, that “ ad­ versity tries our friends,” applies also to good generals.", "4616": "That which before this battle was called Fabius's coward­ ice and remissness, was now regarded as more than human sagacity, and a foresight so wonderful as to be beyond belief.", "4617": "Rome at once centred her last hopes upon Fabius, taking refuge in his wisdom as men take sanctuary at an altar, believing his discretion to be the chief cause of her surviving this present crisis, even as in the old Gaulish troubles.", "4618": "For though he had been so cautious and back­ ward at a time when there seemed to be no imminent danger, yet now when every one was giving way to use­ less grief and lamentation, he alone walked through the streets at a calm pace, with a composed countenance and kindly voice, stopped all womanish wailings and assemblies in public to lament their losses, persuaded the Senate to meet, and gave fresh courage to the magistrates, being really himself the moving spirit and strength of the State, which looked to him alone to command it.", "4619": "XVIII.", "4620": "He placed guards at the gates to prevent the mob from quitting the city, and regulated the period of mourning, bidding every man mourn for thirty days in his own house, after which all signs of mourning were to be put away.", "4621": "As the feast of Ceres fell during those days, it was thought better to omit both the sacrifices and the processions than to have them marred by the conscious­ ness of their misfortune, which would be painfully evident in the small number of worshippers and their downcast looks.", "4622": "However, everything that the soothsayers com­ manded to appease the anger of the gods and to expiate prodigies was carried out.", "4623": "Fabius Pictor, a relative of the great Fabius, was sent to Delphi, and of two of the Vestal virgins who were found to have been seduced, one was buried alive, as is the usual custom, while the other died by her own hand.", "4624": "Especially admirable was the spirit and the calm composure of the city when the consul Varro returned after his flight.", "4625": "He came humbled to the dust, as a man would who had been the cause of a terrible disaster, but at the gate the Senate and all the people went out to greet him.", "4626": "The chief men and the magistrates, amongst whom was Fabius, having obtained silence, spoke in praise of him \" because he had not des­ paired of the State after such a calamity, but had come back to undertake the conduct of affairs and do what he could for his countrymen as one who thought they might yet be saved.", "4627": "\"XIX.", "4628": "AY hen they learned that Hannibal after the battle had turned away from Rome to other parts of Italy, the Romans again took courage and sent out armies and generals.", "4629": "Of these the most remarkable were Fabius Maximus and Claudius Marcellus, both equally admirable, but from an entirely different point of view.", "4630": "Marcellus, as has been related in his Life, was a man of activity and high spirit, rejoicing in a hand-to-hand fight, and just like the lordly warriors of Homer.", "4631": "With a truly venture­ some audacity, he in his first battles outdid in boldness even the bold Hannibal himself;", "4632": "while Fabius, on the other hand, was convinced that his former reasoning was true, and believed that without any one fighting or even meddling with Hannibal, his army would wear itself out and consume away, just as the body of an athlete when overstrained and exerted soon loses its fine condition.", "4633": "For this reason Poseidonius calls Fabius the shield, and Marcellus the sword of Rome, because the steadiness of Fabius, combined with the warlike ardour of Marcellus, proved the saving of the state.", "4634": "Hannibal, frequently meeting Marcellus, who was like a raging torrent, had his forces shaken and weakened;", "4635": "while Fabius, like a deep quiet river kept constantly undermining them and wast­ ing them away unperceived.", "4636": "- Hannibal was at length reduced to such extremities that he was weary of fight­ ing Marcellus, and feared Fabius even though he did not fight:", "4637": "for these were the persons whom he generally had to deal with, as prætors, consuls, or pro-consuls, for each of them was five times consul.", "4638": "He drew Marcellus, when consul for the fifth time, into an ambuscade;", "4639": "but although he tried every art and stratagem upon Fabius he could affect nothing, except once, when he very nearly succeeded in mining him.", "4640": "He forged letters from the leading citi­ zens of Metapontum, and then sent them to Fabius.", "4641": "These letters were to the effect that the city would surrender if he appeared before it, and that the conspirators were only waiting for his approach.", "4642": "Fabius was so much moved by these letters as to take a part of his army and commence a night march thither;", "4643": "but meeting with unfavourable omens on the way he turned back, and soon afterwards learned that the letters were a stratagem of Hannibal's, who was waiting for him under the city walls.", "4644": "This escape one may attribute to the favour of Heaven.", "4645": "XX.", "4646": "In the case of revolts and insurrections among the subject cities and allies, Fabius thought it best to restrain them and discountenance their proceedings in a gentle manner, not treating every suspected person with harsh­ ness, or inquiring too strictly into every case of suspected disloyalty.", "4647": "It is said that a Marsian soldier, one of the chief men of the allies for bravery and nobility of birth, was discovered by Fabius to be engaged in organizing a revolt.", "4648": "Fabius showed no sign of anger, but admitted that he had not been treated with the distinction he deserved, and said that in the present instance he should blame his officers for distributing rewards more by favour than by merit;", "4649": "but that in future he should be vexed with him if he did not apply directly to himself when he had any request to make.", "4650": "Saying this, he presented him with a war horse and other marks of honour, so that thenceforth the man always served him with the utmost zeal and fidelity.", "4651": "He thought it a shame that trainers of horses and dogs should be able to tame the savage spirit of those animals by careful attention and education rather than by whips and clogs, and yet that a commander of men should not rely chiefly on mild and conciliatory measures, but treat them more harshly than gardeners treat the wild fig-trees, wild pears, and wild olives, which they by careful cultivation turn into trees bearing good fruit.", "4652": "His captains informed him that a certain soldier, a Lucanian by birth, was irregular and often absent from his duty.", "4653": "He made inquiries as to what his general conduct was.", "4654": "All agreed that it would be difficult to find a better soldier, and related some of his exploits.", "4655": "Fabii, at length discovered that the cause of his absence was that he was in love with a certain girl, and that he continually ran the risk of making long journeys from the camp to meet her.", "4656": "Without the knowledge of the soldier, he sent and apprehended this girl, whom he concealed in his own tent.", "4657": "Then he invited the Lucanian to a private inter­ view, and addressed him as follows:", "4658": "—“ You have been observed frequently to pass the night outside of the camp, contrary to the ancient practice and discipline of the Roman army:", "4659": "but also, you have been observed to be a brave man.", "4660": "Your crime is atoned for by your valiant deeds, but for the future I shall commit you to the custody of another person.\"", "4661": "Then, to the astonishment of the soldier, he led the girl forward, joined their hands, and said:", "4662": "“ This lady pledges her word that you will remain in the camp with us.", "4663": "You must prove by your conduct that it was not from any unworthy motive, for which she was the pretext, but solely through love for her that you used to desert your post.\"", "4664": "This is the story which is related about him.", "4665": "XXI.", "4666": "Fabius obtained possession of Tarentum by treachery in the following manner.", "4667": "In his army was a young man of Tarentum whose sister was devotedly attached to him.", "4668": "Her lover was a Bruttian, and one of the officers of Hannibal's garrison there.", "4669": "This gave the Tarentine hopes of effecting his purpose, and with the consent of Fabius he went into the city, being commonly supposed to have run away to see his sister.", "4670": "For the first few days the Bruttian remained in his quarters, as she wished her amour with him not to be known to her brother.", "4671": "He then, however, said:", "4672": "\"", "4673": "There was a rumour in the army that you were intimate with one of the chiefs of the garrison.", "4674": "Who is he ?", "4675": "for if he is as they say, a tHan of courage and distinction—war, which throws every­ thing into confusion, will care little what countryman he may be.", "4676": "Nothing is disgraceful which we cannot avoid ;", "4677": "but it is a blessing, at a time when justice has no power, that we should yield to a not disagreeable necessity.", "4678": "Upon this the lady sent for her Bruttian admirer and introduced him to her brother.", "4679": "He, by encouraging the stranger in his passion, and assuring him that he would induce his sister to loot favourably on it, had no difficulty in inducing the man, who was a mercenary soldier, to break his faith in expectation of the great rewards which he was pro­ mised by Fabius.", "4680": "This is the account given of the trans­ action by most writers, though some say that the lady by whose means the Bruttian was seduced from his allegiance was not a Tarentine, but a Bruttian by race, who was on intimate terms with Fabius ;", "4681": "and that as soon as she dis­ covered that a fellow-countryman and acquaintance of hers was in command of the Bruttian garrison, told Fabius of it, and by interviews which she had with the officer outside the walls gradually won him over to the Roman interests.", "4682": "XXII.", "4683": "While these negotiations were in progress, Fabius, wishing to contrive something to draw Hannibal away, sent orders to the troops at Rhegium to ravage the Bruttian country and take Caulonia by storm.", "4684": "The troops at Rhegium were a body of eight thousand men, mostly deserters:", "4685": "and the most worthless of those disgraced soldiers whom Marcellus brought from Sicily, so that their loss would not cause any sorrow or harm to Rome ;", "4686": "while he hoped that by throwing them out as a bait to Hannibal he might draw him away from Tarentum, as indeed he did.", "4687": "Hannibal at once started with his army to attack them, and meanwhile, on the sixth day after Fabius arrived before Tarentum, the young man having previously concerted measures with the Bruttian and his sister, came to him by night and told him that all was ready;", "4688": "knowing accurately and having well inspected the place where the Bruttian would be ready to open the gate and let in the besiegers.", "4689": "Fabius would not depend en­ tirely upon the chance of treachery;", "4690": "but though he him­ self went quietly to the appointed place, the rest of the army attacked the town both by sea and land, with great clamour and disturbance, until, when most of the Taren­ tines had run to repel the assault, the Bruttian gave the word to Fabius, and, mounting his scaling ladders, he took the place.", "4691": "On this occasion Fabius seems to have acted unworthily of his reputation, for he ordered the chief Bruttian officers to be put to the sword, that it might not be said that he gained the place by treachery.", "4692": "However, he did not obtain this glory, and gained a reputation for faithlessness and cruelty.", "4693": "Many of the Tarentines were put to death, thirty thousand were sold for slaves, and the city was sacked by the soldiers.", "4694": "Three thousand talents were brought into the public treasury.", "4695": "While everything else was being carried off, it is said that the clerk who was taking the inventory asked Fabius what his pleasure was with regard to the gods, meaning the statues and pictures.", "4696": "“ Fabius replied, \" Let us leave the Tarentines their angry gods.\"", "4697": "However, he took the statue of Hercules from Tarentum and placed it in the Capitol, and near to it he placed a brazen statue of himself on horseback, acting in this respect much worse than Marcellus, or rather proving that Marcellus was a man of extraordinary mildness and generosity of temper, as is shown in his Life.", "4698": "XXIII.", "4699": "Hannibal is said to have been hastening to relieve Tarentum, and to have been within five miles of it when it was taken.", "4700": "He said aloud :", "4701": "“", "4702": "So then, the Romans also have a Hannibal;", "4703": "we have lost Tarentum just as we gained it.\"", "4704": "Moreover in private he acknowledged to his friends that he had long seen that it was very difficult, and now thought it impossible for them to conquer Italy under existing circumstances.", "4705": "Fabius enjoyed a second triumph for this success, which was more glorious than his first.", "4706": "He had contended with Hannibal and easily baffled all his attempts just as a good wrestler disengages himself with ease from the clutches of an antagonist whose strength is beginning to fail him;", "4707": "for Hannibal's army was no longer what it had been, being partly corrupted by luxury and plunder, and partly also worn out by unremitting toils and battles.", "4708": "One Marcus Livius had been in command of Tarentum when Hannibal obtained possession of it.", "4709": "In spite of this, he held the citadel, from which he could not be dislodged, until Tarentum was recaptured by the Romans.", "4710": "This man was vexed at the honours paid to Fabius, and once, in a transport of envy and vain glory, he said before the Senate that he, not Fabius, was the real author of the recapture of the town.", "4711": "Fabius with a smile answered:", "4712": "“ Very true;", "4713": "for if you had not lost the place, I could never have recaptured it.", "4714": "\"XXIV.", "4715": "The Romans, among many other marks of respect for Fabius, elected his son consul.", "4716": "When he had entered on this office and was making some arrangements for the conduct of the war, his father, either because of his age and infirmities or else intending to try his son, mounted on horseback and rode towards him through the crowd of bystanders.", "4717": "The young man seeing him at a distance would not endure this slight, but sent a lictor to bid his father dismount and come on foot, if he wanted anything of the consul.", "4718": "Those present were vexed at this order, and looked on Fabius in silence, as if they thought that he was unworthily treated, considering his great reputation :", "4719": "but he himself instantly alighted, ran to his son, and embracing him, said :", "4720": "\"", "4721": "You both think and act rightly, my son;", "4722": "for you know whom you command, and how great an office you hold.", "4723": "Thus it was that we and our ancestors made", "4724": "Rome great, by thinking less of our parents and of our children than of the glory of our country.\"", "4725": "It is even said to be true that the great grand­ father of Fabius, although he had been consul five times, had finished several campaigns with splendid triumphs, and was one of the most illustrious men in Rome, yet acted as lieutenant to his son when consul in the field, and that in the subsequent triumph the son drove into Rome in a chariot and four, while he with the other officers followed him on horseback, glorying in the fact that although he was his son's master, and although he was and was accounted the first citizen in Home, yet he sub­ mitted himself to the laws and the chief magistrate.", "4726": "Nor did he deserve admiration for this alone.", "4727": "Fabius had the misfortune to lose his son, and this he bore with fortitude, as became a man of sense and an excellent parent.", "4728": "He himself pronounced the funeral oration which is always spoken by some relative on the deaths of illustrious men, and afterwards he wrote a copy of his speech and distributed it to his friends.", "4729": "XXV.", "4730": "Cornelius Scipio meanwhile had been sent to Spain, where he had defeated the Carthaginians in many battles and driven them out of the country, and had also overcome many tribes, taken many cities, and done glorious deeds for Rome.", "4731": "On his return he was received with great honour and respect, and, feeling that the people expected some extraordinary exploit from him, he decided that it was too tame a proceeding to fight Hannibal in Italy, and determined to pour troops into Africa, attack .", "4732": "Carthage, and transfer the theatre of war from Italy to that country.", "4733": "He bent all his energies to persuade the people to approve of this project, but was violently opposed by Fabius, who spread great alarm through the city, pointing out that it was being exposed to great danger by a reckless young man, and endeavouring by every means in his power to prevent the Romans from adopting Scipio's plan.", "4734": "He carried his point with the Senate, but the people believed that he was envious of Scipio's prosperity and desired to check him, because he feared that if he did gain some signal success, and either put an end to the war altogether or remove it from Italy, he himself might be thought a feeble and dilatory general for not having finished the war in so many campaigns.", "4735": "It appears that at first Fabius opposed him on grounds of prudence and caution, really fearing the dangers of his project, but that the contest gradually became a personal one, and he was moved by feelings of jealousy to hinder the rise of Scipio ;", "4736": "for he tried to induce Crassus, Scipio's colleague, not to give up the province of Africa to Scipio, but if the expedition were determined on, to go thither himself, and he prevented his being supplied with funds for the campaign.", "4737": "Scipio being thus compelled to raise funds himself, obtained them from the cities in Etruria which were devoted to his interests.", "4738": "Crassus likewise was not inclined to quarrel with him, and was also obliged to remain in Italy by his office of Pontifex Maximus.", "4739": "XXVI.", "4740": "Fabius now tried another method to oppose Scipio.", "4741": "He dissuaded the youth of the city from taking service with him by continually vociferating in all public meetings that Scipio not only was himself running away from Hannibal, but also was about to take all the remain­ ing forces of Italy out of the country with hill, deluding the young men with vain hopes, and so persuading them to leave their parents and wives, and their city too, while a victorious and invincible enemy was at its very gates.", "4742": "By these representations he alarmed the Romans, who decreed that Scipio should only use the troops in Sicily, and three hundred of the best men of his Spanish army.", "4743": "In this transaction Fabius seems to have acted according to the dictates of his own cautious disposition.", "4744": "However, when Scipio crossed over into Africa, news came to Rome at once of great and glorious exploits per­ formed and great battles won.", "4745": "As substantial proof of these there came many trophies of war, and the king of Numidia as a captive.", "4746": "Two camps were burned and destroyed, with great slaughter of men, and loss of horses and war material in the flames.", "4747": "Embassies also were sent to Hannibal from Carthage, begging him in piteous terms to abandon his fruitless hopes in Italy and come home to help them, while in Rome the name of Scipio was in every man's mouth because of his successes.", "4748": "At this period Fabius proposed that a successor to Scipio should be sent out, without having any reason to allege for it except the old proverb that it is dangerous to entrust such important operations to the luck of one man, because it is hard for the same man always to be lucky.", "4749": "This proposal of his offended most of his countrymen, who thought him a peevish and malignant old man, or else that he was timid and spiritless from old age, and excessively terrified at Hannibal;", "4750": "for, even when Hannibal quitted Italy and withdrew his forces Fabius, would not permit the joy of his countrymen to be unmixed with alarm, as he informed them that now the fortunes of Rome were in a more critical situation than ever, because Hannibal would be much more to be dreaded in Africa under the walls of Carthage itself, where he would lead an army, yet reeking with the blood of many Roman dictators, consuls and generals, to attack Scipio.", "4751": "By these words the city was again filled with terror, and although the war had been removed to Africa yet its alarms seemed to have come nearer to Rome.", "4752": "XXVII.", "4753": "However Scipio, after no long time, defeated Hannibal in a pitched battle and crushed the pride of Carthage under foot.", "4754": "He gave the Romans the enjoyment of a success beyond their hopes, and truly “", "4755": "Restored the city, shaken by the storm.", "4756": "\"", "4757": "Fabius Maximus did not survive till the end of the war, nor did he live to hear of Hannibal's defeat, or see the glorious and lasting prosperity of his country, for about the time when Hannibal left Italy he fell sick and died.", "4758": "The Thebans, we are told, buried Epameinondas at the public expense, because he died so poor that they say no­ thing was found in his house except an iron spit.", "4759": "Fabius was not honoured by the Romans with a funeral at the public expense, yet every citizen contributed the smallest Roman coin towards the expenses, not that he needed the money, but because they buried him as the father of the people, so that in his death he received the honourable respect which he had deserved in his life.", "4760": "I. SUCH is the story of these men's lives.", "4761": "As they both gave many proofs of ability in war and politics, let us first turn our attention to their warlike exploits.", "4762": "And here we must notice that Perikles found the Athenian people at the height of their power and prosperity, so that from the flourishing condition of the State it could scarcely meet with any great disaster, whereas Fabius per­ formed his great services to Rome when it was in the last extremity of danger, and did not merely, like Perikles, confirm the prosperity of his country, but greatly improved it, having found it in a lamentable condition.", "4763": "Moreover, the successes of Kimon, the victories of Myronides and Leo­ krates, and the many achievements of Tolmides rather gave Perikles when in chief command an occasion for pub­ lic rejoicing and festivity, than any opportunity for either conquests abroad or defensive wars at home.", "4764": "Fabius, on the other hand, had before his eyes the spectacle of many defeats and routs of Roman armies, of many consuls and generals fallen in battle, of lakes, plains and forests filled with the bodies of the slain, and of rivers running with blood.", "4765": "Yet with his mature and unbending intellect he undertook to extricate Rome from these dangers, and.", "4766": "as it were by his own strength alone supported the State, so that it was not utterly overwhelmed by these terrible disasters.", "4767": "N evertheless it would appear not to be so hard a task to manage a State in adversity, when it is humble and is compelled by its misfortunes to obey wise counsellors, as it is to check and bridle a people excited and arrogant with good fortune, which was especially the case with Peri­ kles and the Athenians.", "4768": "On the other hand, considering the terrible nature of the blows which had fallen on the Romans, Fabius must have been a great and strong-minded man not to be disconcerted by them, but still to be able to carry out the policy upon which he had determined.", "4769": "II.", "4770": "We may set the capture of Samos by Perikles against the retaking of Tarentum by Fabius, and also the conquest of Euboea by the one against that of the Campanian cities by the other, though Capua itself was recovered by the consuls, Fulvius and Appius.", "4771": "Fabius seems never to have fought a pitched battle, except that one which gained him his first triumph, while Perikles set up nine trophies for victories by sea and land.", "4772": "But again, there is no action of Perikles which can be compared to that of Fabius when he snatched away Minucius from the grasp of Hannibal, and saved an entire Roman army from destruction.", "4773": "That was an exploit glorious for the courage, generalship, and kindness of heart displayed by Fabius;", "4774": "but, on the other hand Perikles, made no such blunder as did Fabius, when out-generalled by Hannibal with the cattle.", "4775": "Here, although .", "4776": "Fabius caught his enemy in a defile which he had entered by chance, yet he let him escape by night, and next day found his tardy movements outstripped, and himself defeated by the man whom he had just before so completely cut off.", "4777": "If it be the part of a good general, not merely to deal with the present, but to make conjectures about the future, we may remark that the Peloponnesian war ended just as Perikles had foretold, for the Athenians frittered away their strength;", "4778": "whereas the Romans, con­ trary to the expectation of Fabius, by sending Scipio to attack Carthage gained a complete victory, not by chance, but by the skill of their general and the courage of their troops, who overthrew the enemy in a pitched battle.", "4779": "Thus the one was proved to be right by the misfortunes of his country, and the other proved to be wrong by its success, indeed it is just as much a fault in a general to receive a check from want of foresight as to let slip an opportunity through diffidence:", "4780": "and both these failings, excess of confidence and want of confidence, are common to all except the most consummate generals.", "4781": "Thus much for their military talents.", "4782": "III.", "4783": "In political matters, the Peloponnesian war is a great blot upon the fame of Perikles;", "4784": "for it is said to have been caused by his refusal to yield the least point to the Lacedæmonians.", "4785": "I do not imagine, however, that Fabius Maximus would have yielded anything to the Carthagi­ nians, but would have bravely risked any danger in defence of the Roman Empire.", "4786": "The kind treatment of Minucius by Fabius and his mildness of character con­ trast very favourably with the bitter party feud of Peri­ kles with Kimon and Thucydides, who were men of good birth, and belonging to the conservative party, and whom Perikles drove into exile by the ostracism.", "4787": "Then, too, the power of Perikles was much greater than that of Fabius.", "4788": "Perikles would not permit the State to suffer disaster because of the bad management of her generals.", "4789": "One of them alone, Tolmides, succeeded in having his own way, against the wishes of Perikles, and perished in an attack on the Bœotians, while all the rest, because of his immense influence and power, submitted themselves to his authority and regulated their proceedings by his ideas.", "4790": "Whereas Fabius, although he could avoid any error in managing his own army, was thwarted by his being powerless to control the movements of other generals.", "4791": "For the Romans would not have suffered so many defeats if Fabius had enjoyed the same power that Perikles did in Athens.", "4792": "As to their generosity with re­ gard to money, the one was remarkable for never receiving bribes, while the other spent much on ransoming prisoners at his own expense;", "4793": "although this was not much above six talents, while it is hard for any one to tell the amount of money which Perikles might have taken from foreign princes and Greek allied states, all of which he refused and kept his hands clean.", "4794": "As to the great public works, the construction of the temples, and of the public buildings with which Perikles adorned Athens, the whole of the edifices in Rome together, before the time of the emperors, are not worthy to be compared to them, for they far surpassed them both in largeness of scale and in beauty of design.", "4795": "I. THE pedigree of Alkibiades is said to begin with Eurysakes the son of Ajax, while on the mother's side he descended from Alkmæon, being the son of Deino­ mache, the daughter of Megakles.", "4796": "His father Kleinias fought bravely at Artemisium in a trireme fitted out at his own expense, and subsequently fell fighting the Bœotians, in the battle of Koronea.", "4797": "Alkibiades after this was entrusted to Perikles and Ariphron, the two sons of Xanthippus, who acted as his guardians because they were the next of kin.", "4798": "It has been well remarked that the friendship of Sokrates for him did not a little to increase his fame, seeing that Nikias, Demosthenes, Lamakus, I hormio, Thrasybulus, and The­ ramenes, were all men of mark in his lifetime, and yet we do not know the name of the mother of any one of them, while we know the name even of the nurse of Alkibiades, who was a I aconian, named Amykla, and that of Zopyrus, his pædagogus, one of which pieces of information we owe to Antisthenes, and the other to Plato.", "4799": "As to the beauty of Alkibiades, it is not necessary to say anything except that it was equally fascinating when he was a boy, a youth, and a man.", "4800": "The saying of Euripides, that all beauties have a beautiful autumn of their charms, is not universally true, but it was so in the case of Alkibiades and of a few other persons because of the symmetry and vigour of their frames.", "4801": "Even his lisp is said to have added a charm to his speech, and to have made his talk more persuasive.", "4802": "His lisp is mentioned by Aristophanes in the verses in which he satirises Theorus, in which Alkibiades calls him Theolus, for he pronounced the letter r like 1.", "4803": "Archippus also gives a sneering account of the son of

street, and when his turn came to throw, a loaded waggon was passing.", "4811": "He at first ordered the driver to stop his team because his throw was to take place directly in the path of the waggon.", "4812": "Then as the boor who was driving would not stop, the other children made way;", "4813": "but Alkibiades flung himself down on his face directly in front of the horses, and bade him drive on at his peril.", "4814": "The man, in alarm, now stopped his horses, and the others were terrified and ran up to him.", "4815": "In learning he was fairly obedient to all his teachers, except in playing the flute, which he refused to do, de­ claring that it was unfit for a gentleman.", "4816": "He said that playing on the harp or lyre did not disfigure the face, but that when a man was blowing at a flute, his own friends could scarcely recognise him.", "4817": "Besides, the lyre accompanies the voice of the performer, while the flute takes all the breath of the player and prevents him even from speaking.", "4818": "\"", "4819": "Let the children of the Thebans,\" he used to say, \" learn to play the flute, for they know not how to speak ;", "4820": "but we Athenians according

also tells us that he killed one of his servants by striking him with a club, at the gymnasium of Sibyrtus.", "4829": "But perhaps we ought not to believe these stories, which were written by an enemy

and the mass of sycophants by whom he was soon beset.", "4832": "For no one ever was so enclosed and enveloped in the good things of this life as Alkibiades, so that no breath of criticism or free speech could ever reach him.", "4833": "Yet, with all these flatterers about him, trying to prevent his ever hearing a word of wholesome advice or reproof, he was led by his own goodness of heart to pay special attention to Sokrates, to whom he attached himself in preference to all his rich and fashionable admirers.", "4834": "He soon became intimate with Sokrates, and when he discovered that this man did not wish to caress and admire him, but to expose his ignorance, search out his faults, and bring down his vain unreasoning conceit, he then “ Let fall his feathers like a craven cook.\"",

way of doing so in this instance.", "4853": "Consequently they begged the man to desist from bidding, and offered him money.", "4854": "Alkibiades would not permit him to take less than a talent, and when this was given him he let him go.", "4855": "This was the way in which he did him a kindness.", "4856": "VI.", "4857": "The love of Sokrates, though he had many rivals, yet overpowered them all, for his words touched the heart of Alkibiades and moved him to tears.", "4858": "Sometimes his flatterers would bribe him by the offer of some pleasure, to which he would yield and slip away from Sokrates, but he was then pursued like a fugitive slave by the latter, of whom he stood in awe, though he treated every one else with insolence and contempt.", "4859": "Kleanthes used to say that Sokrates's only hold upon him was through his ears, while he scorned to meddle with the rest of his body.", "4860": "And indeed Alkibiades was very prone to pleasure, as one would gather from what Thucydides says on the subject.", "4861": "Those too who played on his vanity and love of distinction induced him to embark on vast projects before he was ripe for them, assuring him that as soon as he began to take a leading part in politics, he would not only eclipse all the rest of the generals and orators, but would even surpass Perikles in power and renown.", "4862": "But just as iron which has been softened in the fire is again hardened by cold, and under its influence contracts its expanded particles, so did Sokrates, when he found Alkibiades puffed up by vain and empty conceit, bring him down to his proper level by his conversation, rendering him humble minded by pointing out to him his many deficiencies.", "4863": "VII.", "4864": "After he had finished his education, he went into a school, and asked the master for a volume of Homer.", "4865": "When the master said that he possessed none of Homer's writings, he struck him with his fist, and left him.", "4866": "Another schoolmaster told him that he had a copy of Homer corrected by himself.", "4867": "\" Do you,\" asked he, \" you who are able to correct Homer, teach boys to read!", "4868": "One would think that you could instruct men.", "4869": "\"One day he wished to speak to Perikles, and came to his house.", "4870": "Hearing that he was not at leisure, but was engaged in considering how he was to give in his accounts to the Athenians, Alkibiades, as he went away, said, “ It would be better if he considered how to avoid giving in any accounts at all to the Athenians.", "4871": "\"While yet a lad he served in the campaign of Potidæa, where he shared the tent of Sokrates, and took his place next him in the ranks.", "4872": "In an obstinate engagement they both showed great courage, and when Alkibiades was wounded and fell to the ground, Sokrates stood in front of him, defending him, and so saved his life and arms from the enemy.", "4873": "Properly, therefore, the prize for valour belonged to Sokrates;", "4874": "but when the generals appeared anxious to bestow it upon Alkibiades because of his great reputation, Sokrates, who wished to encourage his love for glory, was the first to give his testimony in his favour, and to call upon them to crown him as victor and to give him the suit of armour which was the prize.", "4875": "And also at the battle of Delium, when the Athenians were routed, Alkibiades, who was on horseback, when he saw Sokrates retreating on foot with a few others, would not ride on, but stayed by him and defended him, though the enemy were pressing them and cutting off many of them.", "4876": "These things, however, happened afterwards.", "4877": "VIII.", "4878": "He once struck Hipponikus, the father of Kallias, a man of great wealth and noble birth, a blow with his fist, not being moved to it by anger, or any dispute, but having agreed previously with his friends to do so for a joke.", "4879": "When every one in the city cried out at his indecent and arrogant conduct, Alkibiades next morning at daybreak came to the house of Hipponikus, knocked, and came to him.", "4880": "Here he threw off his cloak, and offered him his body, bidding him.", "4881": "flog him and punish him for what he had done.", "4882": "Hipponikus, however, pardoned him, and they became friends, so much so that Hipponikus chose him for the husband of his daughter Hipparete.", "4883": "Some writers say that not Hipponikus but Kallias his son gave Hipparete to Alkibiades to wife, with a dowry of ten talents, and that when her first child was born Alkibiades demanded and received ten more talents, as if he had made a previous agreement to that effect.", "4884": "Upon this Kallias, fearing that Alkibiades might plot against his life, gave public notice in the assembly that if he died childless, he would leave his house and all his property to the State.", "4885": "Hipparete was a quiet and loving wife, but was so constantly insulted by her husband's amours with foreign and Athenian courtesans, that she at length left his house and went to her brother's.", "4886": "Alkibiades took no heed of this, but continued in his debauchery.", "4887": "It was necessary for her to deliver her petition for separation to the magistrate with her own hand, and when she came to do so, Alkibiades laid hold of her, and took her home with him through the market-place, no one daring to oppose him and take her from him.", "4888": "She lived with him until her death, which took place not long after Alkibiades sailed for Ephesus.", "4889": "In this instance his violence does not seem to have been altogether lawless or without excuse, for the object of the law in making a wife appear in person in public seems to be that she may have an opportunity of meeting her husband and making up her quarrel with him.", "4890": "IX.", "4891": "He had a dog of remarkable size and beauty, for which he had paid seventy minæ.", "4892": "It had a very fine tail, which he cut off.", "4893": "When his friends blamed him, and said that every one was sorry for the dog and angry with him for what he had done, he laughed and said, \"", "4894": "Then I have succeeded ;", "4895": "for I wish the Athenians to gossip about this, for fear they should say something worse about me.\"X.", "4896": "It is said that his first public act was on the occasion of a voluntary subscription for the State.", "4897": "He did not intend doing anything of the sort, but as he was passing he heard a great noise, and finding that voluntary sub­ scriptions were being made, went and subscribed.", "4898": "The people cheered and applauded him, at which he was so much delighted as to forget a quail which he had in his cloak.", "4899": "When it escaped and ran about bewildered, the Athenians applauded all the more, and many rose and chased it.", "4900": "It was caught by the pilot Antiochus, who restored it, and became one of Alkibiades's greatest friends.", "4901": "Starting with great advantages from his noble birth, his wealth, his recognised bravery in battle, and his many friends and relatives, he relied upon nothing so much as on his eloquence for making himself popular and influ­ ential.", "4902": "His rhetorical powers are borne witness to by the comic dramatists;", "4903": "and the greatest of orators, Demosthenes, in his speech against Meidias, speaks of Alkibiades as being most eloquent, besides his other charms.", "4904": "If we are to believe Theophrastus, who has inquired more diligently into these various tales than any one else, Alkibiades excelled all men of his time in readiness of invention and resource.", "4905": "However, as he wished not merely to speak to the purpose, but also to clothe his thoughts in the most appropriate language, he did not always succeed in com­ bining the two, and often hesitated and stopped, seeking for the right word, and not continuing his speech until it occurred to him.", "4906": "XI.", "4907": "He was renowned for his stud, and for the number of his racing chariots.", "4908": "No other person, king or commoner, ever entered seven four-horse chariots for the race at Olympia except Alkibiades.", "4909": "His winning the first, second, and fourth prizes with these, as Thucydides tells us, though Euripides says that he won the third also, excels in glory any other successes by other persons in these races.", "4910": "The poem of Euripides runs as follows:", "4911": "\" Son of Kleinias, thee I sing, In truth it is a noble thing, First, second, and third place To win in chariot race, To hear the herald thrice thy name proclaim, And thrice to bear away the olive crown of fame.\"XII.", "4912": "His success was rendered all the more conspicuous by the manner in which the various States vied with one another in showing him honour.", "4913": "Ephesus pitched a magnificent tent for his accommodation, Chios furnished his horses with provender, and himself with animals for sacrifice ;", "4914": "and Lesbos supplied him with wine, and every thing else necessary for giving great entertainments.", "4915": "Yet even at this brilliant period of his life he incurred discredit, either by his own fault or through the spite of his enemies.", "4916": "The story is that an Athenian named Diomedes, a respectable man and a friend of Alkibiades, was desirous of winning a victory at ()lympia.", "4917": "Hearing that there was a chariot and four which belonged to the city of Argos, and knowing that Alkibiades had great influence and many friends in that place, he persuaded him to buy the chariot for him.", "4918": "Alkibiades, however, bought the chariot and entered it for the race as his own, leaving Diomedes to call upon heaven and earth to witness his ill-treatment.", "4919": "It appears that a trial took place about this matter, and Isokrates wrote a speech about this chariot in defence of the son of Alkibiades, in which Tisias, not Diomedes, is mentioned as the prosecutor.", "4920": "XIII.", "4921": "When, as a mere boy, Alkibiades plunged into political life, he at once surpassed most of the statesmen of the age.", "4922": "His chief rivals were Phæax, the son of Erasistratus, and Nikias, the son of Nikeratus, the latter a man advanced in life, and bearing the reputation of being an excellent general, while the former, like Alki­ biades himself, was a young man of good family, just rising into notice, but inferior to him in many respects, particularly in oratory.", "4923": "Though affable and persuasive in private circles, he could not speak equally well in public, for he was, as Eupolis says, “ At conversation best of men, at public speaking worst.", "4924": "”In a certain attack on Alkibiades and Phæax, we find, among other charges, Alkibiades accused of using the gold and silver plate of the city of Athens as his own for his daily use.", "4925": "There was at Athens one Hyperbolus, of the township of Peirithois, whom Thucydides mentions as a worthless man, and one who was constantly ridiculed by the comic dramatists.", "4926": "From his utter disregard of what was said of him, and his carelessness for his honour, which, though it was mere shameless impudence and apathy, was thought by some to show firmness and true courage, he was pleasing to no party, but frequently made use of by the people when they wished to have a scurrilous attack made upon those in power.", "4927": "At this time he was about to resort to the proceeding called ostracism, by which from time to time the Athenians force into exile those citizens who are remarkable for influence and power, rather because they envy them than because they fear them.", "4928": "But as it was clear that one of the three, Nikias, Pheeax, and Alkibiades, would be ostracised, Alkibiades combined their several parties, arranged matters with Nikias, and turned the ostracism against Hyperbolus himself.", "4929": "Some say that it was not Nikias but Phæax with whom Alki­ biades joined interest, and that with the assistance of his political party he managed to expel Hyperbolus, who never expected any such treatment;", "4930": "for before that time this punishment had never been extended to low persons of no reputation, as Plato, the comic dramatist, says in the lines where he mentions Hyperbolus:", "4931": "“ Full worthy to be punished though he be, Yet ostracism's not for such as he.\"", "4932": "We have elsewhere given a fuller account of this affair.", "4933": "XIV.", "4934": "Alkibiades was dissatisfied at the respect shown for Nikias, both by enemies of the State and by the citizens of Athens.", "4935": "Alkibiades was the proxenus* of the Lacedæ­ monians at Athens, and paid especial court to those Spartans who had been captured at Pylos;", "4936": "yet, when the Lacedaemonians discovered that it was chiefly by Nikias's means that they obtained peace, and recovered their prisoners, they were lavish of their attentions to him.", "4937": "The common phrase among the Greeks of that time was that Perikles had begun the war, and Nikias had finished it;", "4938": "and the peace was usually called the peace of Nikias.", "4939": "Alkibiades, irritated beyond measure at his rival's success, began to meditate how he could destroy the existing treaty.", "4940": "He perceived that the Argives, hating and fearing Sparta, wished to break off from it, and he en­ couraged them by secret assurances of an Athenian alliance, and also both by his agents and in person he urged the leading men not to give way to the Lacedæ­ monians, or yield any points to them, but to turn to Athens, and await their co-operation, for the Athenians, he said, already began to regret that they had made peace at all, and would soon break it.", "4941": "When the Lacedæmonians made an alliance with the Boeotians, and delivered up Panaktus to the Athenians in a dismantled condition, not with its walls standing, as they ought to have done, Alkibiades exasperated the rage of the Athenians by his speeches, and raised a clamour against Nikias by the plausible accusation that he, when general, had hung back from capturing the enemy's forces which were cut off in the island of Sphakteria, and that when they had been captured by another, he had released them and restored them to their homes, in order to gain the favour of the Lacedæmonians.", "4942": "And for all that, although he was such a friend of the Lacedæmonians, he had not dissuaded them from forming alliances with Corinth and with the Bœotians, while he prevented the Athenians from becoming allies of any Greek State which might wish it, if the step did not happen to please the Lacedæmonians.", "4943": "Upon this, while Nikias was smarting under these accusations, ambassadors arrived from Lacedæmon with in­ structions to propose reasonable terms, and announcing that they came with full powers to conclude the negotia­ lions for peace on an equitable basis.", "4944": "The Senate received them willingly, and next day they were to appear before the people.", "4945": "Fearing that they would succeed, Alkibiades contrived to obtain a private interview with them, in which he addressed them as follows :", "4946": "“", "4947": "What is this that you do, men of Sparta", "4948": "Do you not know that the Senate always treats those who appear before it in a kindly and reasonable manner, but the people are always full of pride and ambition ?", "4949": "If you say that you have plenary powers, they will bewilder you by their violence and force great concessions from you.", "4950": "So come, cease this folly, if you wish to negotiate with the Athenians in a moderate way, and not to be forced into conceding points against your will.", "4951": "Discuss all the points at issue, but do not say that you have full power to decide them.", "4952": "I will do my best to assist you, as a friend to Lacedæmon.”", "4953": "After these words he confirmed his promise by an oath, and thus completely detached them from Nikias and left them trusting him only, and admiring him as a man of remarkable sense and intelligence.", "4954": "On the following day the people assembled, and the ambassadors appeared before them.", "4955": "When they were politely asked by Alkibiades in what capacity they came, they said that they were not pleni­ potentiaries.", "4956": "Immediately upon this Alkibiades assailed them with furious invective, as though they, not he, were in the wrong, calling them faithless equivocators, who had not come either to speak or to do anything honest.", "4957": "The Senate was vexed at its treatment, and the people were excessively enraged, while Nikias, who knew nothing of the trick, was astounded and covered with confusion at the conduct of the ambassadors.", "4958": "XV.", "4959": "The Lacedæmonian alliance being put an end to by this means, Alkibiades, who was now elected one of the generals of Athens, at once formed an alliance with Argos, Elis and Mantinea.", "4960": "No one approved of the way in which he effected this, but still the result was very important, as it agitated all the States in Peloponnesus, and set them against one another, brought so many men into line to fight the Lacedæmonians at the battle of Mantinea, and removed the scene of conflict so far from Athens, that the Lacedæmonians could gain no great ad­ vantage by victory, whereas if they failed, they would have to struggle for their very existence.", "4961": "After this battle the select regiment at Argos, called the \" Thousand,\" en­ deavoured to overthrow the government and establish themselves as masters of the city;", "4962": "and with the assistance of the Lacedæmonians they destroyed the constitution.", "4963": "But the people took up arms again, and defeated the usurpers:", "4964": "and Alkibiades coming to their aid, made the victory of the popular side more complete.", "4965": "He persuaded the citizens to build long walls down to the sea, and to trust entirely to the Athenian naval forces for support.", "4966": "He even sent them carpenters and stonemasons from Athens, and showed great zeal on their behalf, which tended to increase his personal interest and power no less than that of his country.", "4967": "He advised the people of Patræ also to join their city to the sea by long walls;", "4968": "and when some one said to the people of Patræ, that the Athenians would swallow them up, he answered, \" Perhaps they may, but it will be by degrees and beginning with the feet, whereas the Lacedæmonians will seize them by the head and do it at once.", "4969": "\"However, Alkibiades ever pressed the Athenians to establish their empire by land as well as by sea, re­ minding them of the oath which the young men take in the Temple of Agraulos, and which it was their duty to confirm by their deeds.", "4970": "This oath is, that they will regard wheat, barley, vines and olives as the boundaries of Attica, by which it is hinted that they ought to make all cultivated and fruitful lands their own.", "4971": "XVI.", "4972": "In the midst of all this display of political ability, eloquence, and statesmanlike prudence, he lived a life of great luxury, debauchery, and profuse expenditure, swaggering through the market-place with his long effeminate mantle trailing on the ground.", "4973": "He had the deck of his trireme cut away, that he might sleep more comfortably, having his bed slung on girths instead of rest­ ing on the planks ;", "4974": "and he carried a shield not emblazoned with the ancestral bearings of his family, but with a Cupid wielding a thunderbolt.", "4975": "The leading men of Athens viewed his conduct with disgust and apprehension, fearing his scornful and overbearing manner, as being nearly allied to the demeanour of a despot, while Aristophanes has expressed the feeling of the people towards him in the line, “ They love, they hate, they cannot live without him.”", "4976": "And again he alludes to him in a bitterer spirit in the verse:", "4977": "“ A lion's cub 'tis best you should not rear, For if you do, your master he'll appear.\"", "4978": "His voluntary contributions of money to the State, his public exhibitions and services, and displays of muni­ ficence, which could not be equalled in splendour, his noble birth, his persuasive speech, his strength, beauty, and bravery, and all his other shining qualities, combined to make the Athenians endure him, and always give his errors the mildest names, calling them youthful escapades and honourable emulation.", "4979": "For example, he locked up Agatharchus the painter, and when he had painted his house let him go with a present.", "4980": "He boxed Taurea's ears because he was exhibiting shows in rivalry with him, and contending with him for the prize.", "4981": "And he even took one of the captive Melian women for his mistress, and brought up a child which he had by her.", "4982": "This was thought to show his good nature;", "4983": "but this term cannot be applied to the slaughter of all the males above puberty in the island of Melos, which was done in accordance with a decree promoted by Alkibiades.", "4984": "When Aristophon painted the courtesan Nemea em­ bracing Alkibiades, all men eagerly crowded to see it;", "4985": "but older men were vexed at these things too, thinking them only fit for despots, and considering them to be open violations of the laws.", "4986": "Indeed Archestratus spoke very much to the purpose when he said that Greece could not bear more than one Alkibiades.", "4987": "Once, when Alki­ biades had made a successful speech in the public as­ sembly, and was being conducted home in triumph by his friends, Timon the misanthrope met him, and did not get out of his way, as he did to every one else, but came up to him and took him by the hand, saying, “ Go on, my boy, increase in glory;", "4988": "for your increase will bring ruin to all this crowd.\"", "4989": "Some laughed, some cursed him, but others took his words to heart.", "4990": "So various were the opinions formed about Alkibiades, because of the in­ consistency of his character.", "4991": "XVII.", "4992": "Even during the lifetime of Perikles, the Athenians had a hankering after Sicily, and after his death they endeavoured to obtain possession of it, by sending troops to the assistance of those cities which were oppressed by the Syracusans, and thus paving the way for a greater armament.", "4993": "It was, however, Alkibiades who fanned their desires into a flame, and who persuaded them to abandon these half-hearted attempts, to proceed with a great force to the island, and to endeavour to subdue it.", "4994": "He raised great expectations among the people, but his own aspirations were far more en tensive ;", "4995": "for he regarded the conquest of Sicily not merely as an end, but as a stepping-stone to greater things.", "4996": "While Nikias was dissuading the people from the attempt, on the ground that it would be a difficult matter to capture the city of Syracuse, Alkibiades was dreaming of Car­ thage and Libya;", "4997": "and after these were gained, he medi.", "4998": "tated the conquest of Italy and of Peloponnesus, regarding Sicily as little more than a convenient magazine and place of arms.", "4999": "He greatly excited the younger Athenians by his vast designs, and they listened eagerly to the marvellous stories of the old who had served in that country ;", "5000": "so that many of them would spend their time sitting in the gymnasia and public seats, drawing sketches of the shape of the island of Sicily, and of the position of Libya and Carthage.", "5001": "It is said that Sokrates the philosopher, and Meton the astronomer, did not expect that the state would gain any advantage from this expedition;", "5002": "the former probably receiving a presentiment of disaster, as was his wont, from his familiar spirit.", "5003": "Meton either made calcu­ lations which led him to fear what was about to happen, or else gathered it from the art of prophecy.", "5004": "He feigned madness, and seizing a torch, attempted to set his house on fire.", "5005": "Some say that Meton made no pretence of madness, but that he burned down his house one night, and next morning came and besought the Athenians, after such a misfortune, to exempt his son from serving with the expedition.", "5006": "Thus he deceived his fellow citizens and carried his point.", "5007": "XVIII.", "5008": "Nikias, much against his will, was chosen to lead the expedition.", "5009": "His unwillingness was in a great measure due to the fact that Alkibiades was to act as his colleague;", "5010": "for the Athenians thought that the war would be conducted better if the rashness of Alkibiades was tempered by the prudence of Nikias, because the third general, Lamachus, although advanced in years, yet had the reputation of being no less daring and reckless a soldier than Alkibiades himself.", "5011": "When the public assembly were debating about the number of the troops and the preparation for the arma­ ment, Nikias made another attempt to oppose the whole measure and to put a stop to the war.", "5012": "Alkibiades, however, took the other side and carried all before him.", "5013": "The orator Demostratus moved, that the generals should be empowered to demand whatever stores and war material they pleased, and have absolute power to carry on the wai at their own discretion.", "5014": "This was agreed to by the people, and all was ready for setting sail, when unlucky omens occurred.", "5015": "The festival of Adonis took place at that very time, and during it the women carry about in many parts of the city figures dressed like corpses going to be buried, and imitate the ceremony of a funeral by tearing their hair and singing dirges.", "5016": "And besides this, the mutilation of the Hermæ in one night, when all of them had their faces disfigured, disturbed many even of those who, as a rule, despised such things.", "5017": "A story was put about that the Corinthians, of whom the Syracusans were a colony, had done it, hoping that such an evil omen might make the Athenians either postpone or give up their expedition.", "5018": "But the people paid no heed to this insinuation, and still less to those who argued that there was no omen in the matter at all, but that it was the work of extravagant young men after their wine.", "5019": "They regarded the incident with feelings of rage and fear, imagining that it proved the existence of an organised plot aimed at greater matters.", "5020": "Both the Senate and the General Assembly met several times during the next few days, and inquired sharply into every thing that could throw any light upon it.", "5021": "XIX.", "5022": "During this time, Androkles, a popular speaker, brought forward several slaves and resident aliens, who charged Alkibiades and his friends with mutilating certain other statues, and with parodying the ceremonies of initiation to the sacred mysteries when in their cups.", "5023": "They said that the part of the Herald was taken by Theodorus, that of the Torch-bearer by Polytion, and that of Hierophant by Alkibiades himself, while the rest of the company were present and were initiated, and were addressed by them as Mysts, which means persons who have been initiated into the mysteries.", "5024": "These are the charges which we find specified in the indictment drawn against Alkibiades by Thessalus the son of Kimon, in which he accuses Alkibiades of sacrilege against the two goddesses, Demeter (Ceres) and Proserpine.", "5025": "The people now became very much enraged with Alkibiades, and were still more exasperated by his personal enemy Androkles.", "5026": "Alkibiades was at first alarmed, but soon perceived that all the sailors of the fleet about to sail to Sicily were on his side, as were also the soldiers.", "5027": "A body of a thousand Argives and Mantineans also were heard to say that they were going to cross the seas and fight in a distant land all for the sake of Alkibiades, and that if he did not meet with fair play, they would at once desert.", "5028": "Encouraged by this, he appeared at the appointed time to defend himself, which disconcerted and disheartened his enemies, who feared that the people might deal leniently with him because they required his services.", "5029": "Matters being in this posture, they prevailed upon some of the orators who were not known to be enemies to Alkibiades, but who hated him nevertheless, to move before the people that it was an absurd proceeding for the irresponsible general of so great a force of Athe­ nians and their allies to waste his time while the court was drawing lots for the jury, and filling water-clocks with water.", "5030": "“", "5031": "Let him sail, and may good luck attend him, and when the war is finished let him return and speak in his defence, for the laws will be the same then as now.\"", "5032": "Alkibiades saw clearly their malicious object in postponing his trial, and said publicly that it was very hard to leave such accusations and slanders behind him, and to be sent out in command of a great expedition with such a terrible fate hanging over him.", "5033": "If he could not prove his innocence, he ought to be put to death;", "5034": "and if he could clear himself of these charges, it was only just that he should be enabled to attack the enemy with a light heart, without having to fear false accusers at home.", "5035": "XX.", "5036": "He did not, however, succeed in this, but was ordered to sail, and put to sea with his colleagues, having under their orders a fleet of nearly one hundred

proportion.", "5037": "After reaching Italy and capturing Rhegium, he gave his opinion as to the manner in which the war ought to be conducted;", "5038": "but as Nikias opposed him and was joined by Lamachus, he sailed over to Sicily and induced the city of Catana to join them, but did nothing further, because he was sent for at once to return and stand his trial at Athens.", "5039": "At first, as we have stated, Alkibiades was only vaguely suspected, and only the testimony of slaves and resident aliens could be obtained against him;", "5040": "but afterwards, during his absence, his enemies

suspected of having taken part in the statue-breaking, was that the large statue of Hermes, near his house, the gift of the tribe Ægeis, was one of the very few which remained unbroken.", "5055": "\\\\ herefore even at the present day it is called the Hermes of Andokides, and everyone speaks of it by that name in spite of the inscription on it.", "5056": "It happened that Andokides, while in

cleverer and more courageous.", "5057": "This man persuaded Andokides to inform against himself and some few others, because, by a decree of the people, any one who acted as informer was to be given a free pardon, whereas no one could count upon the results of a trial, which the more prominent citizens had especial reasons for dreading.", "5058": "He pointed out that it was better to save his life by a lie than to be put to death with infamy as if he was really guilty;", "5059": "moreover, looking at the whole affair, it was best to sacrifice a few persons of doubtful character to the fury of the people, and thereby to save many good men from becoming its victims.", "5060": "Andokides was convinced by these arguments of Timæus, and by in­ forming against himself and some others obtained a pardon for himself, while all those whose names he mentioned were put to death, except such as had fled the country.", "5061": "To procure greater credit to his information, Andokides even accused his own servants.", "5062": "However, the people did not abate their rage, but, ceasing to take any further interest in the statue-breakers, they turned savagely against Alkibiades.", "5063": "Finally, they despatched the Sala­ minian trireme after him, ingeniously ordering its officers not to use any personal violence, but to speak him fair and bid him return to stand his trial and set himself right with the people.", "5064": "They were afraid of an outbreak, or even of a mutiny in the army in Sicily, which Alkibiades could have raised with the greatest ease, if he had wished to do so.",

life, and he deluded the people by pretending to adopt the Laconian habits.", "5089": "When they saw him closely shaved, bathing in cold water, eating dry bread and black broth, they wondered, and began to doubt whether this man ever had kept a professed cook, used perfumes, or endured to wear a Milesian mantle.", "5090": "For Alkibiades, among his other extraordinary qualities, had this

their king, he began to speak evil of them to Tissaphernes, withholding him from assisting them thoroughly, and enabling them to conquer the Athenians, but advising him rather to starve the Lacedæmonian forces by insufficient supplies, so as to play one side off against the other, and thus encourage them to wear each other out, in order that in the end both might be so weakened as to fall an easy prey to the Persians.", "5130": "Tissaphernes at once adopted this policy, and made no secret of his regard and admiration for Alkibiades, who was now looked up to by the Greeks on both sides, while the Athenians repented of their decrees against him.", "5131": "He also began to fear that if their city were to be utterly destroyed he would necessarily fall into the hands of his enemies, the Lacedæmonians.", "5132": "The most important post in the Athenian empire at this time was the island of Samos.", "5133": "Here lay the greater part of their fleet, and it was from this headquarters that they sent out expeditions to recover the revolted cities of Ionia, and guarded those which they still retained, as, in spite of their great losses, they still possessed a fleet capable of holding its own against the Lacedaemonians.", "5134": "They were in great fear of Tissaphernes and the Phoenician fleet of a hundred and fifty sail of triremes, which was said to be on the point of arriving, because if it really came all would be over with Athens.", "5135": "Alkibiades, knowing this, sent a secret message to the Athenian leaders at Samos, holding out hopes of bringing Tissaphernes over to the Athenian side.", "5136": "He would not, he said, do this to please the populace of Athens, because he could not trust them, but he would effect it if the nobility would, like brave gentlemen, put an end to the insolent behaviour of the lower orders, and would themselves undertake to save the city and empire of Athens.", "5137": "All were eager to adopt the proposal of Alkibiades, except Phrynichus of the demos or township of Deirades, who suspected the real truth, that Alkibiades cared nothing about the form of government which might be established at Athens, but was seeking for some excuse for being restored to his native country, and thought, by his harsh language about the people, to ingratiate himself with the nobles.", "5138": "He was, however, overruled;", "5139": "and, being now clearly marked as the personal enemy of Alkibiades, sent a secret message to Astyochus, the admiral of the Lacedaemonian fleet, bidding him beware of Alkibiades,

with him, betrayed Phrynichus's letter to them.", "5142": "Alkibiades upon this at once sent persons to Samos to charge Phrynichus with this act of treason, and he, seeing that all men were shocked at what he had done, and were indignant with him, and being at his wit's end, endeavoured to heal one mischief by another.", "5143": "He sent a second letter to Astyochus, reproaching him for his betrayal of confidence, and promising that he would enable him to capture the fleet and camp of the Athenians.", "5144": "However, the treachery of Phrynichus did no harm to the Athenians, because of the counter treachery of Astyochus, who communicated this letter also to Alkibiades.", "5145": "Now Phrynichus, expecting a second charge of treason from Alkibiades, was beforehand with him, in announcing to the Athenians that the enemy were about to attack them, and advising them to keep near their ships, and to fortify their camp.-", "5146": "This they proceeded to do, when there came a second letter from Alkibiades, warning them against Phrynichus, who medi­ tated betraying the harbour to the enemy.", "5147": "This letter was not believed at the time, for men imagined that Alkibiades, who knew perfectly well all the movements and intentions of the enemy, was making use of that knowledge to destroy his personal enemy Phrynichus, by exciting an undeserved suspicion against him.", "5148": "Yet, when afterwards Hermon, one of the Athenian horse-patrol, stabbed Phrynichus with his dagger in the market-place, the Athenians, after trying the case, decided that the deceased was guilty of treason, and crowned Hermon and his comrades with garlands.", "5149": "XXVI.", "5150": "The friends of Alkibiades being in a majority at Samos, now despatched Peisander to Athens to attempt the subversion of the republic, and to encourage the nobles to seize the government, and put an end to the democratic constitution.", "5151": "If this was done, they conceived that Alkibiades would make Tissaphernes their friend and ally, and this was the pretext and excuse put forward by those who established the oligarchy.", "5152": "When, however, the so-called Five Thousand, who really were the Four Hundred, were at the head of affairs, they paid but little attention to Alkibiades, and were very remiss in carrying on the war, partly because they distrusted the citizens, who were not yet accustomed to the new constitution, and partly because they thought that the Lacedaemonians, who were always favourable to oligarchical governments, would deal more tenderly with them on that account.", "5153": "The Athenian populace remained quiet, though sorely against its will, because of the terror inspired by the oligarchs, for no small number of citizens who had opposed the Four Hundred had been put to death;", "5154": "but the men of Samos, as soon as they heard the news, were indignant, and wished at once to sail to Peiræus.", "5155": "They sent at once for Alkibiades, elected him their general, and bade him lead them on to crush this new despotism.", "5156": "Alkibiades on this occasion acted like a really great commander, and not at all as one would expect of a man who had suddenly been raised to power by popular favour.", "5157": "He refused to curry favour with the soldiery by carrying out their wishes, regardless of their having found him a homeless exile, and having made him the commander of so many ships and so many men;", "5158": "but he resisted their impulse, and by preventing their committing so great an error, without doubt saved the Athenian empire.", "5159": "For if the fleet had left Samos, the enemy could without a battle have made themselves masters of the whole of Ionia, the Hellespont, and the islands in the Ægean, while Athenians would have fought with Athenians in their own city.", "5160": "All this was prevented by Alkibiades alone, who not only persuaded the populace, and pointed out the folly of such proceedings in public speeches, but even entreated and com­ manded each individual man to remain at Samos.", "5161": "He was assisted in this by Thrasybulus, of the township of Steiria, who was present, and spoke in his loud voice, which was said to be the loudest of any Athenian of his time.", "5162": "This was a noble achievement of Alkibiades, and so, too, was his undertaking that the Phoenician fleet, which the Lacedæ­ monians expected would be sent by the Persian king to help them, should either be won over to the Athenian side, or at any rate prevented from joining the Lacedæ­ monians.", "5163": "In order to effect this, he sailed away in great haste, and, although the Phoenician fleet was at Aspendus, yet Tissaphernes brought it no further, and deceived the Lacedæmonians.", "5164": "Both parties gave Alkibiades the credit of having detained it, and more especially the Lacedæmonians, who imagined that he was teaching the Persians to allow the Greeks to destroy one another, for it was perfectly clear that such a force, if added to either of the contending parties, must have made them complete masters of the sea.", "5165": "XXVII.", "5166": "After this the government of the Four Hundred was dissolved, as the friends of Alkibiades eagerly took the side of the popular party.", "5167": "Although the Athenians now wished and even commanded Alkibiades to return to his native city, yet he felt that he ought not to come home emptyhanded, and owing his restoration to the good nature of the people, but rather to return after some glorious achievement.", "5168": "With this intention he at first left Samos with a few ships and cruised in the seas near Knidus and Kos;", "5169": "then, hearing that Mindarus, the Spartan admiral, had gone to the Hellespont with all his fleet, and that the Athenian fleet had followed him, he hurried to the assistance of the Athenian commanders.", "5170": "Sailing northwards with eighteen triremes he chanced to arrive towards evening, at the end of a sea-fight off Abydos, in which neither party had won any decided advantage.", "5171": "The appearance of his squadron caused very different feelings among the combatants, for the Athenians were alarmed, and the enemy encouraged.", "5172": "However, lie soon hoisted an Athenian flag, and bore down upon that part of the Peloponnesian fleet which had been hitherto victorious.", "5173": "He put them to flight, compelled them to run their ships ashore, and then attacking them, disabled their ships, and broke them to pieces, forcing the crews to swim ashore, where Pharnabazus the satrap led a force to the water's edge to fight for the preservation of the vessels.", "5174": "In the end the Athenians took thirty ships, recovered those of their own which had been captured, and erected a trophy, as victors.", "5175": "Alkibiades gained great glory by this splendid piece of good fortune, and at once went off with rich presents and a gorgeous military retinue, to display his fresh laurels to Tissaphernes.", "5176": "He met, however, with a very different reception to that which he expected, for Tissaphernes, whose mind had been poisoned against him by the Lacedæmonians, and who feared that the king might be displeased with his own dealings with Alkibiades, con­ sidered that he had arrived at a very opportune moment, and at once seized him and imprisoned him at Sardis ;", "5177": "thinking that this arbitrary act would prove to the world that the other suspicions of an understanding between them were unfounded.", "5178": "XXVIII.", "5179": "Thirty days afterwards, Alkibiades by some means obtained a horse, eluded his guards, and fled for refuge to Klazomenae.", "5180": "He gave out that he had been privately released by Tissaphernes himself, in order to disgrace that satrap, and at once sailed to the Athenian fleet in the Hellespont.", "5181": "Learning that Mindarus and Pharnabazus were both in the city of Kyzikus, he en­ couraged his soldiers by a speech, in which he told them that they would have to fight at sea, on land, and against the town walls too, for that if they were not completely victorious they could get no pay.", "5182": "He manned his ships and proceeded to Prokonessus, ordering all small vessels which they met to be seized and detained in the interior of the fleet, in order that the enemy might not learn his movements.", "5183": "It happened also that a heavy thunderstorm with rain and darkness assisted his design, as he not only was unseen by the enemy, but was never suspected of any intention of attack by the Athenians themselves, who had given up any idea of going to sea when he ordered them on board.", "5184": "Little by little the clouds cleared away, and disclosed the Peloponnesian fleet cruising off the harbour of Kyzikus.", "5185": "Alkibiades, fearing that if the enemy saw how numerous his own fleet was, they would take refuge on shore, ordered the other commanders to remain behind under easy sail, and himself with forty ships went on ahead to entice them to an engagement.", "5186": "The Pelo­ ponnesians, deceived by this manœuvre, at once attacked these few ships, despising their small numbers.", "5187": "But the little squadron engaged them until the rest came up, when they fled ashore in terror.", "5188": "Alkibiades with twenty of the fastest sailing ships broke through the enemy's line, ran his ships ashore, landed their crews, and attacked the fugitives from the enemy's fleet with terrible slaughter.", "5189": "Mindarus and Pharnabazus now came to the rescue, but they were beaten back;", "5190": "Mindarus died fighting bravely, and Pharnabazus only saved himself by flight.", "5191": "By this battle the Athenians obtained possession of many dead bodies of their enemies,.", "5192": "many stand of arms, the whole of the hostile fleet, and the town of Kyzikus, which they took by storm, putting its Peloponnesian garrison to the sword, as soon as Pharnabazus withdrew his troops.", "5193": "They now not merely obtained a firm hold on the Hellespont, but were able to drive the Lacedæmonians from the sea in all quarters.", "5194": "A despatch was captured,

Athenians;", "5202": "so that the soldiers of Alkibiades reproached those of Thrasyllus with this, glorifying themselves and their commander, and refusing to allow the others to make use of their places of exercise or their quarters in camp.", "5203": "However, when Pharnabazus with a large force of infantry and calvary attacked them while they were invading the territory of Abydos, Alkibiades led them out to fight him, defeated him, and, together with Thrasyllus, pursued him till night­ fall.", "5204": "After this the soldiers fraternised with each other and returned to their camp rejoicing together.", "5205": "On the following day Alkibiades erected a trophy and ravaged the country of Pharnabazus, no one daring to oppose him.", "5206": "He even took priests and priestesses

Hippokrates, and put his force to flight with severe loss.", "5215": "He now took a cruise round the Hellespont, to raise contributions from the towns on the coast, during which he took Selymbria,

made some of the townspeople less eager to fight, as they imagined that their enemies were all within the walls, while it encouraged others who hoped to arrange matters peaceably.", "5222": "While they were standing opposite to one another and parleying, Alkibiades's army came up, and he, truly conjecturing that the Selymbrians were really disposed to be friendly, began to fear that his

Lacedæmonian, but a Byzantine, and that he saw Byzantium, not Sparta, in danger, as the city was surrounded by the enemy's siege works, no provisions being brought in to it, and what there was in it being consumed by the Peloponnesians and Boeotians, while the people of Byzantium with their wives and children were starving.", "5242": "He did not, he said, betray the city to the enemy, but relieved it from the miseries of war, imitating therein the noblest Lacedæmonians, whose only idea of what was noble and just was what would serve their own country.", "5243": "The Lacedæmonians, on hearing this speech, were ashamed to press the charge, and acquitted him.", "5244": "XXXII.", "5245": "Now, at length, Alkibiades began to wish to see his native country again, and still more to be seen and admired by his countrymen after his splendid series of victories.", "5246": "He proceeded home with the Athenian fleet, which was magnificently adorned with shields and trophies, and had many prizes in tow, and the flags of many more which he had captured and destroyed-all of them together amounting to not less than two hundred.", "5247": "But we cannot believe the additions which Douris the Samian, who says that he is a descendant of Alkibiades, makes to this story, to the effect that Chrysogonus, the victor at the Pythian games, played on the flute to mark the time for the rowers, while Kallipides the tragedian, attired in his buskins, purple robe, and other theatrical properties, gave them orders, and that the admiral's ship came into harbour with purple sails, as if returning from a party of pleasure.", "5248": "Neither Theopompus, nor Ephorus, nor Xenophon men­ tions these circumstances, nor was it likely that he should present himself before the Athenians in such a swaggering fashion, when he was returning home from exile, after having suffered such a variety of misfortunes.", "5249": "The truth is, he sailed to Athens with considerable misgivings, and on his arrival would not leave his ship until from her deck he saw Euryptolemus his cousin, with many of his friends and relatives, assembled to welcome him.", "5250": "When he landed, the people seemed to have no eyes for the other generals, but all rushed towards him, and escorted him on his way, cheering him, embracing him, and crowning him with flowers.", "5251": "Those who could not get near him gazed upon him from a distance, and the older men pointed him out to the younger ones.", "5252": "Yet the joy of the citizens was mingled with tears in the midst of their rejoicings, when they thought of their past disasters, for they reflected that they would not have failed in Sicily, or met with any of their other terrible disappointments, if they had not parted with Alkibiades when in the full tide of prosperity.", "5253": "He had found Athens barely able to hold her own at sea, by land mistress of little more than the ground on which the city stood, and torn by internal strife;", "5254": "from which miserable and forlorn condition he had restored her so completely, that she was again not only omnipotent at sea, but also victorious everywhere on land.", "5255": "XXXIII.", "5256": "Before his return a decree had been passed authorising him to do so, at the instance of Kritias, the son of Kallæschrus, who himself alludes to it in his poems, mentioning the service which he performed for Alkibiades in the following verse:", "5257": "“I moved your restoration by decree, And that you're home again you owe to me.**", "5258": "Immediately on the return of Alkibiades, the people assembled in the Pnyx, where he addressed them.", "5259": "He spoke with tears of his misfortunes, for which he partly reproached his countrymen, though he attributed them chiefly to his own unlucky fortune, and he greatly raised their hopes by speaking encouragingly about their probable successes in the future.", "5260": "He was honoured with golden crowns, and elected sole general with absolute power both by sea and land.", "5261": "A decree was also passed by which his property was restored to him, and the Eumolpidæ and Kerykes were ordered to retract the curses which they had invoked upon him at the instance of the people.", "5262": "When all the rest obeyed, Theodorus the hierophant excused himself, saying, If he has done the State no wrong, I never cursed him.", "5263": "XXXIV.", "5264": "While Alkibiades was in this glorious career of prosperity, some persons in spite of his success foreboded evil from the day which he had chosen for his return home ;", "5265": "for on the day on which he sailed into the harbour the statue of Athene on the Acropolis is stripped of its garments and ornaments, which are cleaned, while it in the meanwhile is covered up to conceal it from human eyes.", "5266": "This ceremony takes place on the 25th of the month Thargelion, which day is considered by the Athe­ nians to be the unluckiest of all.", "5267": "Moreover, the goddess did not appear to receive Alkibiades with a kindly welcome, but to turn away her face from him and drive him from her presence.", "5268": "Be this as it may, all went well and just as Alkibiades wished.", "5269": "A fleet of a hundred triremes was manned, and placed at his disposal, but he with creditable pride refused to set sail until after the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries.", "5270": "Since the permanent occupation of Dekeleia and of the passes commanding the road to Eleusis by the enemy, the pro­ cession had been necessarily shorn of many of its distinctive features, as it had to be sent by sea.", "5271": "All the customary sacrifices, dances, and other rites which used to be practised on the road, when Iacchus is carried along in solemn procession, were of necessity omitted.", "5272": "It seemed therefore to Alkibiades that it would both honour the gods and increase his own reputation among men, if he restored the ancient form of this ceremony, escorting the procession with his troops and protecting it from the enemy;", "5273": "for he argued that Agis would lose prestige if he did not attack, but allowed the procession to pass unmolested, whereas if he did attack, Alkibiades would be able to fight in a holy cause, in defence of the most sacred in­ stitutions of his country, with all his countrymen present as witnesses of his own valour.", "5274": "When he determined to do this, after concerting measures with the Eumolpidæ and Kerykes, he placed vedettes on the mountains and sent an advanced guard off at day-break, following with the priests, novices, and initiators marching in the midst-of his army, in great good order and perfect silence.", "5275": "It was an august and solemn procession, and all who did not envy him said that he had performed the office of a high priest in addition of that of a general.", "5276": "The enemy made no attack, and he led his troops safely back to Athens, full of pride himself, and making his army proud to think itself invincible while under his command.", "5277": "He had so won the affections of the poor and the lower orders, that they were strangely desirous of living under his rule.", "5278": "Many even besought him to put down the malignity of his personal enemies, sweep away laws, decrees, and other pernicious nonsense, and carry on the government without fear of a factious opposition.", "5279": "XXXV.", "5280": "What his own views about making himself despot of Athens may have been we cannot tell;", "5281": "but the leading citizens took alarm at this, and hurried him away as quickly as possible to sea, voting whatever measures he pleased, and allowing him to choose his own colleagues.", "5282": "He set sail with his hundred ships, reached Andros, and defeated the inhabitants of that island, and the Lacedæ­ monian garrison there.", "5283": "He did not, however, capture the city, and this afterwards became one of the points urged against him by his enemies.", "5284": "Indeed, if there ever was a man destroyed by his reputation, it was Alkibiades.", "5285": "Being supposed to be such a prodigy of daring and subtlety, his failures were regarded with suspicion, as if he could have succeeded had he been in earnest;", "5286": "for his countrymen would not believe that he could really fail in anything which he seriously attempted.", "5287": "They expected to hear of the capture of Chios, and of the whole Ionian coast, and were vexed at not at once receiving the news of a complete success.", "5288": "They did not take into account the want of money which Alkibiades felt, while warring against men who had the king of Persia for their paymaster, and which made frequent absences from his camp necessary to provide subsistence for his troops.", "5289": "It was one of these expeditions, indeed, which exposed him to the last and most important of the many charges brought against him.", "5290": "Lysander had been sent by the Lacedæmonians to take the command of their fleet.", "5291": "On his arrival, by means of the money paid by Cyrus, he raised the pay of his sailors from three obols a day to four.", "5292": "Alkibiades, who could with difficulty pay his men even three obols, went to Caria to levy contributions, leaving in command of the fleet one Antiochus, a good seaman, but a thoughtless and silly man.", "5293": "He had distinct orders from Alkibiades not to fight even if the enemy attacked him, but such was his insolent disregard of these instructions that he manned his own trireme and one other, sailed to Ephesus, and there passed along the line of the enemy's ships, as they lay on the beach, using the most scurrilous and insulting language and gestures.", "5294": "At first Lysander put to sea with a few ships to pursue him, but as the Athenians came out to assist him, the action became general.", "5295": "The entire fleets engaged and Lysander was victorious.", "5296": "He killed Antiochus, captured many ships and men, and set up a trophy.", "5297": "When Alkibiades on his return to Samoa heard of this, he put to sea with all his ships, and offered battle to Lysander;", "5298": "but he was satisfied with his previous victory, and refused the offer.", "5299": "XXXVI.", "5300": "Thrasybulus, the son of Thrason, a bitter personal enemy of Alkibiades, now set sail for Athens to accuse him, and to exasperate his enemies in the city against him.", "5301": "He made a speech to the people, represent­ ing that Alkibiades had ruined their affairs and lost their ships by insolently abusing his authority and entrusting the command, during his own absence, to men who owed their influence with him to deep drinking and crack­ ing seamen's jokes, and that he securely traversed the pro­ vinces to raise money, indulging in drunken debauches with Ionian courtezans, while the enemy's fleet was riding close to his own.", "5302": "He was also blamed for the construction of certain forts in Thrace, near Bisanthe, which he destined as a place of refuge for himself, as if he could not or would not live in his native city.", "5303": "The Athenians were so wrought upon by these charges against Alkibiades, that they elected other generals to supersede him, thus showing their anger and dislike for him.", "5304": "Alkibiades, on learning this, left the Athenian camp altogether, got together a force of foreign troops, and made war on the irregular Thracian tribes on his own account, thus obtaining much plunder and freeing the neighbouring Greek cities from the dread of the bar­ barians.", "5305": "Now when the generals Tydeus, Menander, and Adeimantus came with the entire Athenian fleet to Ægospotamoi, they used early every morning to go to Lampsakus to challenge the fleet of Lysander, which lay there, to a sea-fight.", "5306": "After this ceremony they would return and spend the whole day in careless indolence, as if despising their enemy.", "5307": "Alkibiades, who lived close by, did not disregard their danger, but even rode over on horseback and pointed out to the generals that they were very badly quartered in a place where there was no harbour and no city, having to obtain all their provisions from Sestos, and, when the ships were once hauled up on shore, allowing the men to leave them unguarded and straggle where they pleased, although they were in the presence of a fleet which was trained to act in silence and good order at the command of one man.", "5308": "XXXVII.", "5309": "Though Alkibiades gave this advice, and urged the generals to remove to Sestos, they would not listen to him.", "5310": "Tydeus indeed rudely bade him begone.", "5311": "for they, not he, were now generals.", "5312": "Alkibiades, too, suspected that there was some treachery in the case, and retired, telling his personal friends, who escorted him out of the camp, that if he had not been so outrageously insulted by the generals, he could in a few days have compelled the Lacedæmonians either to fight a battle at sea against their will, or abandon their ships.", "5313": "To some this seemed mere boasting, while others thought that he could very possibly effect it by bringing many Thracian light-armed troops and cavalry to assault the camp on the land side.", "5314": "However, the result soon proved that he had rightly seen the fault of the Athenian position.", "5315": "Lysander suddenly and unexpectedly assailed it, and except eight triremes which escaped under Konon, took all the rest, nearly two hundred in number.", "5316": "Lysander also put three thousand prisoners to the sword.", "5317": "He shortly afterwards captured Athens, burned her ships, and pulled down her Long Walls.", "5318": "Alkibiades, terrified at seeing the Lace­ daemonians omnipotent by sea and land, shifted his quarters to Bithynia, sending thither a great amount of treasure, and taking much with him, but leaving much more in his Thracian fortresses.", "5319": "In Bithynia, however, he suffered much loss at the hands of the natives, and determined to proceed to the court of Artaxerxes, thinking that the Persian king, if he would make trial of him, would find that he was not inferior to Themistokles in ability, while he sought him in a much more honourable way;", "5320": "for it was not to revenge himself on his fellow.", "5321": "citizens, as Themistokles did, but to assist his own conntry against its enemy that he meant to solicit the king's aid.", "5322": "Imagining that Pharnabazus would be able to grant him a safe passage to the Persian court, he went into Phrygia to meet him, and remained there for some time, paying his court to the satrap, and receiving from him marks of respect.", "5323": "XXXVIII.", "5324": "The Athenians were terribly cast down at the loss of their empire ;", "5325": "but when Lysander robbed them of their liberty as well, by establishing the government of the Thirty Tyrants, they began to entertain thoughts which never had occurred to them before, while it was yet possible that the State might be saved from ruin.", "5326": "They bewailed their past blunders and mistakes, and of these they considered their second fit of passion with Alkibiades to have been the greatest.", "5327": "They had cast him off for no fault of his own, but merely because they were angry with his follower for having lost a few ships disgracefully;", "5328": "they had much more disgraced themselves by losing the services of the ablest and bravest general whom they possessed.", "5329": "Even in their present abasement a vague hope prevailed among them that Athens could not be utterly lost while Alkibiades was alive;", "5330": "for he had not during his former exile been satisfied with a quiet life, and surely now, however prosperous his private circumstances might be, he would not endure to see the triumph of the Lacedæmonians, and the arrogant tyranny of the Thirty.", "5331": "Indeed this was proved to be no vain dream by the care which the Thirty took to watch all the motions of Alkibiades.", "5332": "At last, Kritias informed Lysander, that while Athens was governed by a democracy, the Lacedæmonian empire in Greece could never be safe;", "5333": "and if the Athenians were ever so much inclined to an oligarchical form of government, Alkibiades, if he lived, would not long suffer them to submit to it.", "5334": "However, Lysander was not prevailed upon by these arguments until a despatch came from Sparta bidding him make away with Alkibiades, either because the home government feared his ability and enterprise, or because they wished to please his enemy, King Agis.", "5335": "XXXIX.", "5336": "Lysander now sent orders for his death to Pharnabazus, who entrusted their execution to his brother Magæus and his uncle Susamithres.", "5337": "Alkibiades was at this time dwelling in a village in Phrygia, with Ti­ mandra the courtezan, and one night he dreamed that he was dressed in his mistress's clothes, and that she, holding his head in her arms, was painting his face and adorning him like a woman.", "5338": "Others say that he saw Magæus in his dream cutting off his head, and his body all in flames.", "5339": "All, however, agree that the dream took place shortly before his death.", "5340": "His murderers did not dare to enter the house, but stood round it in a circle and set it on fire.", "5341": "Alkibiades, on discovering them, flung most of the bedding and clothes on to the fire, wrapped his cloak round his left arm, and with his dagger in his right dashed through the flames unhurt, not giving his clothes time to catch fire.", "5342": "None of the barbarians dared to await his onset, but as soon as they saw him they scattered, and from a distance shot at him with darts and arrows.", "5343": "After he had fallen and the barbarians were gone, Timandra took up his corpse, covered it with her own clothes, and, as far as was in her power, showed it every mark of honour and respect.", "5344": "This Timandra is said to have been the mother of Lais, commonly called the Corinthian, who really was brought as a captive from Hykkara, a small town in Sicily.", "5345": "Some writers, although they agree in their account of the manner of his death, differ as to its cause, alleging that it was neither clue to Pharnabazus nor to Lysander nor the Lacedaemonians, but that Alkibiades had debauched a girl of noble birth and was living with her, and that her relatives, enraged at this insult, during the night set fire to the house in which Alkibiades was living, and, as has been related, shot him as he leaped out through the flames.", "5346": "I. THE patrician family of the Marcii at Rome produced many illustrious men, amongst whom was Ancus Marcius, the grandson of Numa, who became king after the death of Tullus Hostilius.", "5347": "To this family also belonged Publius and Quintus Marcius, who supplied Rome with abundance of excellent water, and Censorinus, twice appointed censor by the Roman people, who afterwards passed a law that no one should hold that office twice.", "5348": "Caius Marcius, the subject of this memoir, was an orphan, and brought up by a widowed mother.", "5349": "He proved that, hard though the lot of an orphan may be, yet it does not prevent a man's becoming great and distinguished, and that the bad alone allege it as an excuse for an intemperate life.", "5350": "He also proves to us that a naturally noble nature, if it be not properly disciplined, will produce many good and bad qualities together, just as a rich field, if not properly tilled, will produce both weeds and good fruit.", "5351": "The immense energy and courage of his mind used to urge him to attempt and to perform great exploits, but his harsh and ambitious temper made it difficult for him to live on friendly terms with his companions.", "5352": "They used to admire his indifference to pleasure and pain, and his contempt for bribes, but in politics they were angered by his morose and haughty manner, too proud for a citizen of a republic.", "5353": "Indeed there is no advantage to be gained from a liberal education so great as that of softening and disciplining the natural ferocity of our disposition, by teaching it moderation, and how to avoid all extremes.", "5354": "However, at that period warlike virtues were valued above all others at Rome, which is proved by the Romans pos­ sessing only one word for virtue and for bravery, so that virtue, a general term, is applied by them to the particular form, courage.", "5355": "II.", "5356": "Marcius, having an especial passion for war, was familiar from childhood with the use of arms.", "5357": "Reflecting that artificial weapons are of little use without a body capable of wielding them, he so trained himself for all possible emergencies that he was both able to run swiftly and also to grapple with his foe so strongly that few could escape from him.", "5358": "Those who entered into any contest with him, when beaten, used to ascribe their defeat to his immense bodily strength, which no exertions could tire out.", "5359": "III.", "5360": "He served his first campaign while yet a youth, when Tarquin, the exiled King of Rome, after many battles and defeats, staked all upon one last throw, and assembled an army to attack Rome.", "5361": "His force consisted chiefly of Latins, but many other Italian states took his part in the war, not from any attachment to his person, but through fear and dislike of the growing power of Rome.", "5362": "In the battle which ensued, in which various turns of fortune took place, Marcius, while fighting bravely under the eye of the dictator himself, saw a Roman fallen and helpless near him.", "5363": "He at once made for this man, stood in front of him, and killed his assailant.", "5364": "After the victory, Marcius was among the first who re­ ceived the oak-leaf crown.", "5365": "This crown is given to him who has saved the life of a citizen in battle, and is composed of oak-leaves, either out of compliment to the Arcadians, whom the oracle calls ‘ acorn eaters,' or because in any campaign in any country it is easy to obtain oak­ boughs, or it may be that the oak, sacred to Jupiter the protector of cities, forms a suitable crown for one who has saved the life of a citizen.", "5366": "The oak is the most beautiful of all wild trees, and the strongest of those which are artificially cultivated.", "5367": "It afforded men in early times both food and drink, by its acorns and the honey found in it, while by the bird-lime which it produces, it enables them to catch most kinds of birds and other creatures, as additional dainties.", "5368": "This was the battle in which they say that the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, appeared, and immediately after the battle were seen in the Forum at Rome announcing the victory, with their horses dripping with sweat, at the spot where now there is a temple built in their honour beside the fountain.", "5369": "In memory of this, the day of the victory, the 15th of July, is kept sacred to the Dioscuri.", "5370": "IV.", "5371": "To win distinction early in life is said to quench and satisfy the eagerness of some men whose desire for glory is not keen;", "5372": "but for those with whom it is the ruling passion of their lives, the gaining of honours only urges them on, as a ship is urged by a gale, to fresh achievements.", "5373": "They do not regard themselves as having received a reward, but as having given a pledge for the future, and they feel it their duty not to disgrace the reputation which they have acquired, but to eclipse their former fame by some new deed of prowess.", "5374": "Marcius, feel­ ing this, was ever trying to surpass himself in valour, and gained such prizes and trophies that the later generals under whom he served were always striving to outdo the former ones in their expressions of esteem for him, and their testimony to his merits.", "5375": "Many as were the wars in which Rome was then engaged, Marcius never returned from any without a prize for valour or some especial mark of distinction.", "5376": "Other men were brave in order to win glory, but Marcius won glory in order to please his mother.", "5377": "That she should hear him praised, see him crowned, and embrace him weeping for joy, was the greatest honour and happi­ ness of his life.", "5378": "Epameinondas is said to have had the same feelings, and to have considered it to be his greatest good-fortune that his father and mother were both alive to witness his triumphant success at the battle of Leuktra.", "5379": "He, however, enjoyed the sympathy and applause of both parents, but Marcius, being fatherless, lavished on his mother all that affection which should have belonged to his father, besides her own share.", "5380": "So boundless was his love for Volumnia that at her earnest desire he even married a wife, but still continued to live in the house of his mother.", "5381": "V.", "5382": "At this time, when his reputation and influence were very considerable because of his prowess, there was a party-quarrel going on in Rome between the patricians, who wished to defend the privileges of men of property, and the people, who were suffering terrible ill-treatment at the hands of their creditors.", "5383": "Those who possessed a small property were forced either to pledge or to sell it, while those who were absolutely destitute were carried off and imprisoned, though they might be scarred and en­ feebled from the wars in which they had served in defence of their country.", "5384": "The last campaign was that against the Sabines, after which their rich creditors promised to treat them with less harshness.", "5385": "In pursuance of a decree of the Senate, Marcus Valerius the consul was the guarantee of this promise.", "5386": "But when, after serving manfully in this campaign and conquering the enemy, they met with no better treatment from their creditors, and the Senate seemed unmindful of its engagements, allowing them to be im­ prisoned and distresses to be levied upon their property as before, there were violent outbreaks and riots in the city.", "5387": "This disturbed condition of the commonwealth was taken advantage of by the enemy, who invaded the country and plundered it.", "5388": "When the consuls called all men of military age to arms, no one obeyed, and then at last the patricians hesitated.", "5389": "Some thought that they ought to yield to the lower classes, and make some concessions instead of enforcing the strict letter of the law against them;", "5390": ".", "5391": "while others, among whom was Marcius, opposed this idea, not because he thought the money of great consequence, but because he considered this to be the beginning of an outburst of democratic insolence which a wise government would take timely measures to suppress before it gathered strength.", "5392": "VI.", "5393": "As the Senate, although it frequently met, came to no decision on this matter, the plebeians suddenly assembled in a body, left the city, and established them­ selves on what was afterwards called the Mons Sacer, or Sacred Hill, near the river Anio.", "5394": "They abstained from all factious proceedings, and merely stated that they had been driven from the city by the wealthy classes.", "5395": "Air and water and a place in which to be buried, they said, could be obtained anywhere in Italy, and they could get nothing more than this in Rome, except the privilege of being wounded or slain in fighting battles on behalf of the rich.", "5396": "At this demonstration, the Senate became alarmed, and sent the most moderate and popular of its members to treat with the people.", "5397": "The spokesman of this embassy was Menenius Agrippa, who, after begging the plebeians to come to terms, and pleading the cause of the Senate with them, wound up his speech by the following fable:", "5398": "Once upon a time, said he, all the members revolted against the belly, reproaching it with lying idle in the body, and making all the other members work in order to provide it with food;", "5399": "but the belly laughed them to scorn, saying that it was quite true that it took all the food which the body obtained, but that it afterwards distributed it among all the members.", "5400": "“This,” he said, “ is the part played by the Senate in the body pi litic.", "5401": "It digests and arranges all the affairs of the State, and provides all of you with wholesome and useful measures.\"", "5402": "VII.", "5403": "Upon this they came to terms, after stipulating that five men should be chosen to defend the cause of the people, who are now known as tribunes of the people.", "5404": "They chose for the first tribunes the leaders of the revolt, the chief of whom were Junius Brutus and Sicinius Vellutus.", "5405": "As soon as the State was one again, the people assembled under arms, and zealously offered their services for war to their rulers.", "5406": "Marcius, though but little pleased with these concessions which the plebeians had wrung from the patricians, yet, noticing that many patricians were of his mind, called upon them not to be outdone in patriotism by the plebeians, but to prove themselves their superiors in valour rather than in political strength.", "5407": "VIII.", "5408": "Corioli was the most important city of the Volscian nation, with which Rome then was at war.", "5409": "The consul Cominius was besieging it, and the Volscians, fearing it might be taken, gathered from all quarters, meaning to fight a battle under the city walls, and so place the Romans between two fires.", "5410": "Cominius divided his army, and led one part of it to fight the relieving force, leaving Titus Lartius, a man of the noblest birth in Rome, to continue the siege with the rest of his troops.", "5411": "The garrison of Corioli, despising the small numbers of their besiegers, attacked them and forced them to take shelter within their camp.", "5412": "But there Marcius with a few followers checked their onset, slew the foremost, and with a loud voice called on the Romans to rally, lie was, as Cato said a soldier should be, not merely able to deal weighty blows, but struck terror into his enemies by the loud tones of his voice and his martial appearance, so that few dared to stand their ground before him.", "5413": "Many soldiers rallied round him and forced the enemy to retreat;", "5414": "but he, not satisfied with this, followed them close and drove them in headlong flight back to the city.", "5415": "On arriving there, although he saw that the Romans were slackening their pursuit as many missiles were aimed at them from the city walls, and none of them thought of daring to enter together with the fugitives into a city full of armed men, yet he stood and cheered them on, loudly telling them that fortune had opened the city gates as much to the pursuers as to the pursued.", "5416": "Few cared to follow him, but he, forcing his way through the crowd of fugitives, entered the city with them, none daring at first to withstand him.", "5417": "Soon, when the enemy saw how few of the Romans were within the gates, they rallied and attacked them.", "5418": "Marcius, in the confused mass of friends and foes, fought with incredible strength, swiftness, and courage, overthrowing all whom he at­ tacked, driving some to the further parts of the town, and forcing others to lay down their arms, so that Lartius was able to march the rest of the Roman army into the gates unmolested.", "5419": "IX.", "5420": "When the city was taken, the greater part of the soldiers fell to plundering it, which greatly vexed Marcius.", "5421": "He loudly exclaimed that it was a disgraceful thing, when the consul was on the point of engaging with the enemy, that they should be plundering, or, on the pretext of plunder, keeping themselves safe out of harm's way.", "5422": "Few paid any attention to him, but with those few he marched on the track of the main body, frequently encouraging his followers to greater speed, and not to give way to fatigue, and frequently praying to Heaven that he might not come too late for the battle, but arrive in time to share the labours and perils of his countrymen.", "5423": "There was at that time a custom among the Romans, when they were drawn up in order of battle, ready to take their shields in their hands, and to gird themselves with the trabea, to make their will verbally, naming their heir in the presence of three or four witnesses.", "5424": "The Roman army was found by Marcius in the act of performing this ceremony.", "5425": "At first some were alarmed at seeing him appear with only a few followers, covered with blood and sweat;", "5426": "but when he ran joyously up to the consul and told him that Corioli was taken, Cuminius embraced him, and all the ranks took fresh courage, some because they heard, and others because they guessed the glorious news.", "5427": "They eagerly demanded to be led to battle.", "5428": "Marcius now enquired of Cominius how the enemy's line of battle was arranged, and where it was strongest.", "5429": "When the consul answered that he believed that the men of Antium, the proudest and bravest troops of the Volscians, were posted in the centre, he answered, “ I beg of you, place us opposite to those men.\"", "5430": "The consul, filled with admiration for his spirit, placed him there.", "5431": "As soon as the armies met, Marcius charged before the rest, and the Volscians gave way before his onset.", "5432": "The centre, where he attacked, was quite broken, but the ranks on either side wheeled round and sur­ rounded him, so that the consul feared for his safety, and despatched the choicest of his own troops to his aid.", "5433": "They found a hot battle raging round Marcius, and many slain, but by the shock of their charge they drove off the enemy in confusion.", "5434": "As they began to pursue them, they begged Marcius, now weary with toil and wounds, to retire to the camp, but he, saying that \"it was Dot for victors to be weary,\" joined in the pursuit.", "5435": "The rest of the Volscian army was defeated, many were slain, and many taken.", "5436": "X.", "5437": "On the next day Lartius and the rest joined the consul.", "5438": "He ascended a rostrum, and after returning suitable thanks to Heaven for such unexampled successes, turned to Marcius.", "5439": "First he praised his conduct in the highest terms, having himself witnessed some part of it, and having learned the rest from Lartius.", "5440": "Next, as there were many prisoners, horses, and other spoil, he bade him, before it was divided, choose a tenth part for himself.", "5441": "He also presented him with a horse and trappings, as a reward for his bravery.", "5442": "As all the Romans murmured their approval, Marcius coming forward said that he gladly accepted the horse, and was thankful for the praise which he had received from the consul.", "5443": "As for the rest, he considered that to be mere pay, not a prize, and refused it, preferring to take his share with the rest. \"", "5444": "One especial favour,\" said he, \"I do beg of you.", "5445": "I had a friend among the Volscians, who now is a captive, and from having been a rich and free man has fallen to the con­ dition of a slave.", "5446": "I wish to relieve him from one of his many misfortunes-that of losing his liberty and being sold for a slave.\"", "5447": "After these words, Marcius was cheered more than he had been before, and men admired his dis­ interestedness more than they had admired his bravery.", "5448": "Even those who grudged him his extraordinary honours now thought that by his unselfishness he had shown himself worthy of them, and admired his courage in refusing such presents more than the courage by which he had won the right to them.", "5449": "Indeed, the right use of riches is more glorious than that of arms, but not to desire them at all is better even than using them well.", "5450": "XI.", "5451": "When the cheering caused by Marcius’ s speech had subsided, Cominius said:", "5452": "\" Fellow soldiers, we cannot force a man against his will to receive these presents;", "5453": "but, unless his achievements have already won it for him, let us give him the title of Coriolanus, which he cannot refuse, seeing for what it is bestowed, and let us confirm it by a general vote.", "5454": "\"Hence he obtained the third name of Coriolanus.", "5455": "From this we may clearly see that his own personal name was Caius, and that Marcius was the common name of his family, while the third name was added afterwards to mark some particular exploit, peculiarity, or virtue in the bearer.", "5456": "So also did the Greeks in former ages give men names derived from their actions, such as Kallinikus (the Vietor), or Soter (the Preserver);", "5457": "or from their appearance, as Fusco (the Fat), or Gripus the Hook-nosed);", "5458": "or from their virtues, as Euergetes (the Benefactor), or Philadelphus ( the Lover of his Brethren), which were names of the Ptolemies:", "5459": "or from their success, as Eudæmon (the Fortunate), a name given to the second king of the race of Battus.", "5460": "Some princes have even had names given them in jest, as Antigonus was called Boson (the Promiser), and Ptolemy Lathyrus (the Vetch).", "5461": "The Romans used this sort of name much more com­ monly, as for instance they named one of the Metelli Diadematus, or wearer of the diadem, because he walked about for a long time with his head bound up because of a wound in the forehead.", "5462": "Another of the same family was named Celer (the Swift), because of the wonderful quickness with which he pro­ vided a show of gladiators on the occasion of his father's funeral.", "5463": "Some even to the present day derive their names from the circumstances of their birth, as for instance a child is named Proculus if his father be abroad when he is born, and Postumus if he be dead.", "5464": "If one of twins survive, he is named Vopiscus.", "5465": "Of names taken from bodily peculiarities they use not only Sulla (the Pimply), Niger (the Swarthy), Rufus (the Red-haired), but even such as Cæcus (the Blind), and Claudus (the Lame), wisely endeavouring to accustom men to consider neither blindness nor any other bodily defect to be any disgrace or matter of reproach, but to answer to these names as if they were their own.", "5466": "However, this belongs to a different branch of study.", "5467": "XII.", "5468": "When the war was over, the popular orators renewed the party-quarrels, not that they had any new cause of complaint or any just grievance to proceed upon ;", "5469": "but the evil result which had necessarily been produced by their former riotous contests were now made the ground of attacks on the patricians.", "5470": "A great part of the country was left unsown and untilled, while the war gave no opportunities for importation from other countries.", "5471": "The demagogues, therefore, seeing that there was no corn in the market, and that even if there had been any, the people were not able to buy it, spread malicious accusa­ tions against the rich, saying that they had purposely produced this famine in order to pay off an old grudge against the people.", "5472": "At this juncture ambassadors arrived from the town of Velitræ, who delivered up their city to the Romans, desiring that they would send some new inhabitants to people it, as a pestilence had made such havoc among the citizens that there was scarcely a tenth part of them remaining alive.", "5473": "The wiser Romans thought that this demand of the people of Velitræ would confer a most seasonable relief on themselves, and would put an end to their domestic troubles, if they could only transfer the more violent partizans of the popular party thither, and so purge the State of its more disorderly elements.", "5474": "The consuls accordingly chose out all these men and sent them to colonize Velitræ, and enrolled the rest for a campaign against the Volsci, that they might not have leisure for revolutionary plottings, but that when they were all gathered together, rich and poor, patrician and plebeian alike, to share in the common dangers of a camp, they might learn to regard one another with less hatred and ill will.", "5475": "XIII.", "5476": "But Sicinnius and Brutus, the tribunes of the people, now interposed, crying aloud that the consuls were veiling a most barbarous action under the specious name of sending out colonists.", "5477": "They were despatching many­ poor men to certain destruction by transporting them to a city whose air was full of pestilence and the stench from unburied corpses, where they were to dwell under the auspices of a god who was not only not their own, but angry with them.", "5478": "And after that, as if it was not sufficient for them that some of the citizens should be starved, and others be exposed to the plague, they must needs plunge wantonly into war, in order that the city might suffer every conceivable misery at once, because it had refused any longer to remain in slavery to the rich.", "5479": "Excited by these speeches, the people would not enrol themselves as soldiers for the war, and looked with suspicion on the proposal for the new colony.", "5480": "The Senate was greatly perplexed, but Marcius, now a person of great importance and very highly thought of in the State, began to place himself in direct opposition to the popular leaders, and to support the patrician cause.", "5481": "In spite of the efforts of the demagogues, a colony was sent out to Velitræ, those whose names were drawn by lot being compelled by heavy penalties to go thither;", "5482": "but as the people utterly refused to serve in the campaign against the Volscians, Marcius made up a troop of his own clients, with which and what others he could persuade to join him he made an inroad into the territory of Antium.", "5483": "Here he found much corn, and captured many prisoners and much cattle.", "5484": "He kept none of it for himself, but returned to Rome with his troops loaded with plunder.", "5485": "This caused the others to repent of their determination, when they saw the wealth which these men had obtained, but it embittered their hatred of Marcius, whom they regarded as gaining glory for himself at the expense of the people.", "5486": "XIV.", "5487": "Shortly after this, however, Marcius stood for the consulship, and then the people relented and felt ashamed to affront such a man, first in arms as in place, and the author of so many benefits to the State.", "5488": "It was the custom at Rome for those who were candidates for any office to address and ingratiate themselves with the people, going about the Forum in a toga without any tunic under­ neath it, either in order to show their humility by such a dress, or else in order to display the wounds which they had received, in token of their valour.", "5489": "At that early period there could be no suspicion of bribery, and it was not for that reason that the citizens wished their candidates to come down among them ungirt and without a tunic.", "5490": "It was not till long afterwards that votes were bought and sold, and that a candidature became an affair of money.", "5491": "This habit of receiving bribes, when once introduced, spread to the courts of justice and to the armies of the commonwealth, and finally brought the city under the despotic rule of the emperors, as the power of arms was not equal to that of money.", "5492": "For it was well said that he who first introduced the habit of feasting and bribing voters ruined the constitution.", "5493": "This plague crept secretly and silently into Home, and was for a long time undis­ covered.", "5494": "We cannot tell who was the first to bribe the people or the courts of law at Rome.", "5495": "At Athens it is said that the first man who gave money to the judges for his acquittal was Anytus the son of Anthemion, when he was tried for treachery at Pylos towards the end of the Peloponnesian War, a period when men of uncorrupted simplicity and virtue were still to be found in the Forum at Rome.XV.", "5496": "Marcius displayed many scars, gained in the numerous battles in which for seventeen years in succes­ sion he had always taken a prominent part.", "5497": "The people were abashed at these evidences of his valour, and agreed among themselves that they would return him as consul.", "5498": "But when, on the day of election, he appeared in the Forum, escorted by a splendid procession of the entire Senate, and all the patricians were seen collected round him evidently intent upon obtaining his election, many of the people lost their feeling of goodwill towards him, and regarded him with indignation and envy;", "5499": "which passions were assisted by their fear lest, if a man of such aristocratic tendencies and such influence with the patri­ cians should obtain power, he might altogether destroy the liberties of the people.", "5500": "For these reasons they did not elect Marcius.", "5501": "When two persons had been elected consuls, the Senate was much irritated, considering that it, rather than its candidate Marcius, had been insulted, while he was much enraged, and could not bear his disgrace with any temper or patience, being accustomed always to yield to the more violent and ferocious emotions as being the more spirited course, without any mixture of gravity and self-restraint, virtues so necessary for political life.", "5502": "He had never learned how essential it is for one who undertakes to deal with men, and engage in public business, to avoid above all things that self-will which, as Plato says, is of the family of solitude, and to become longsuffering and patient, qualities which some foolish people hold very cheap.", "5503": "Marcius, plain and straightforward, thinking it to be the duty of a brave man to bear down all opposition, and not reflecting that it is rather a sign of weakness and feebleness of mind to be unable to restrain one's passion, flung away in a rage, bitterly irritated against the people.", "5504": "The young aris­ tocracy of Rome, who had ever been his fast friends, now did him an ill service by encouraging and exasperating his anger by their expressions of sympathy;", "5505": "for he was their favourite leader and a most kind instructor in the art of war when on a campaign, as he taught them to delight in deeds of prowess without envying aid grudging one another their proper meed of praise.", "5506": "XVI.", "5507": "While this was the state of affairs at Rome, a large amount of corn arrived there, some of which had been bought in Italy, but most of it sent ap a present from Sicily by Gelon the despot;", "5508": "which gave most men hopes that the famine would come to an end, and that the quarrel between the patricians and plebeians would, under these improved circumstances, be made up.", "5509": "The Senate at once assembled, and the people eagerly waited outside the doors of the senate house, expecting and hoping that prices would be lowered, and that the present of corn would be distributed gratis among them;", "5510": "and indeed some of the senators advised the adoption of that course.", "5511": "Marcius, however, rose and bitterly inveighed against those who favoured the people, calling them demagogues and betrayers of their own order, alleging that by such gratification they did but cherish that spirit of boldness and arrogance which had been spread among the people against the patricians, which they would have done well to crush upon its first appearance, and not suffer the plebeians to grow so strong by giving so much power to the tribunes of the people.", "5512": "Now, he urged, they had become formidable because every demand they made had been agreed to, and nothing done against their wishes;", "5513": "they contemned the authority of the consuls, and lived in defiance of the constitution, governed only by their own seditious ringleaders, to whom they gave the title of tribunes.", "5514": "For the Senate to sit and decree largesses of corn to the populace, as is done in the most democratic States in Greece, would merely be to pay them for their disobedience, to the common ruin of all classes. \"", "5515": "They cannot,\" he went on to say, \" consider this largess of corn to be a reward for the campaign in which they have refused to serve, or for the secession by which they betrayed their country, or the scandals which they have been so willing to believe against the Senate.", "5516": "As they cannot be said to deserve this bounty, they will imagine that it has been bestowed upon them by you because you fear them, and wish to pay your court to them.", "5517": "In this case there will be no bounds to their insubordination, and they never will cease from riots and disorders.", "5518": "To give it them is clearly an insane proceeding;", "5519": "nay, we ought rather, if we are wise, to take away from them this privilege of the tribuneship, which is a distinct subversion of the con.", "5520": "sulate, and a cause of dissension in the city, which now is no longer one, as before, but is rent asunder in such a manner that there is no prospect of our ever being re­ united, and ceasing to be divided into two hostile factions.", "5521": "\"", "5522": "XVII.", "5523": "With much talk to this effect Marcius excited the young men, with whom he was influential, and nearly all the richer classes, who loudly declared that he was the only man in the State who was insensible both to force and to flattery.", "5524": "Some of the elders, however, op­ posed him, foreseeing what would be the result of his policy.", "5525": "Indeed, no good resulted from it.", "5526": "The tribunes of the people, as soon as they heard that Marcius had carried his point, rushed down into the forum and called loudly upon the people to assemble and stand by them.", "5527": "A disorderly assembly took place, and on a report being made of Marcius's speech, the fury of the people was so great that it was proposed to break into the senate house;", "5528": "but the tribunes turned all the blame upon Marcius alone, and sent for him to come and speak in his own defence.", "5529": "As this demand was insolently refused, the tribunes themselves, together with the aediles, went to bring him by force, and actually laid hands upon him.", "5530": "However, the patricians rallied round him, thrust away the tribunes of the people, and even beat the aediles, their assistants in this quarrel.", "5531": "Night put an end to the conflict, but at daybreak the consuls, seeing the people terribly excited, and gathering in the forum from all quarters, began to fear the consequences of their fury.", "5532": "They assembled the senators and bade them endeavour, by mild language and healing measures, to pacify the multitude, as it was no season for pride or for standing upon their dignity, but if they were wise they would perceive that so dangerous and critical a posture of affairs required a temperate and popular policy.", "5533": "The majority of the senators yielded, and the consuls proceeded to soothe the people in the best way they could, answering gently such charges as had been brought against them, even speaking with the utmost caution when blaming the people for their late outrageous conduct, and declaring that there should be no difference of opinion between them about the way in which corn should be supplied, and about the price of provisions.", "5534": "XVIII.", "5535": "As the people now for the most part had cooled down, and from their attentive and orderly de­ meanour were evidently much wrought upon by the words of the consuls, the tribunes came forward and addressed them.", "5536": "They said that now that the Senate had come to a better frame of mind, the people would willingly make concessions in their turn;", "5537": "but they insisted that Marcius should apologise for his conduct, or deny if he could that he had excited the Senate to destroy the constitution, that when summoned to appear he had disobeyed, and that finally he had, by beating and insulting the aediles in the market-place, done all that lay in his power to raise a civil war and make the citizens shed one another's blood.", "5538": "Their object in saying this was either to humble Marcius, by making him entreat the clemency of the people, which was much against his haughty temper, or else expecting that he.", "5539": "would yield to his fiery nature and make the breach between himself and the people incurable.", "5540": "The latter was what they hoped for from their knowledge of his character.", "5541": "Marcius came forward to speak in his defence, and the people stood listening in dead silence.", "5542": "But when, instead of the apologetic speech which they expected, he began to speak with a freedom which seemed more like accusing them than defending himself, while the tones of his voice and the expression of his countenance showed a fearless contempt for his audience, the people became angry, and plainly showed their disapprobation of what he said.", "5543": "Upon this, Sicinnius, the boldest of the tribunes, after a short consultation with his colleagues, came forward and said that the tribunes had condemned Marcius to suffer the penalty of death, and ordered the aediles to lead him at once to the Capitol, and cast him down the Tarpeian rock.", "5544": "When the aediles laid hold of him, many of the people themselves seemed struck with horror and remorse, and the patricians in the wildest excitement, called upon one another to rescue him, and by main force tore him from his assailants and placed him in the midst of them­ selves.", "5545": "Some of them held out their hands and besought the populace by signs, as no voice could be heard in such an uproar.", "5546": "At last the friends and relations of the tribunes, seeing that it was impossible to carry out their sentence on Marcius without much bloodshed, persuaded them to alter the cruel and unprecedented part of the sentence, and not to put him to death by violence, or without a trial, but to refer the matter to the people, to be voted upon by them.", "5547": "Upon this Sicinnius, turning to the patricians, demanded what they meant by rescuing Marcius from the people when they intended to punish him.", "5548": "They at once retorted, \" Nay, what do you mean by dragging one of the bravest and best men in Rome to a cruel and illegal death?\"", "5549": "\"You shall not,\" answered Sicinnius, \"make that a ground of quarrel with the people, for we allow you what you demand, that this man be put on his trial.", "5550": "You, Marcius, we summon to appear in the forum on the third market-day ensuing, and prove your innocence if you can, as the votes of your countrymen will be then taken about your conduct.", "5551": "\"XIX.", "5552": "The patricians were glad enough to terminate the affair in this way, and retired rejoicing, bearing Marcius with them.",

people of Antium would enable them to put off the trial until the people's anger had abated through length of time and warlike occupations;", "5554": "afterwards, as they came to terms at once with the Antiates, the patricians held frequent meetings, in which they expressed their fear of the people, and considered by what means they could avoid delivering Marcius up to them, and prevent their mob orators from exciting them.", "5555": "Appius Claudius, who had the reputation of being the bitterest enemy of the people in Rome, gave it as his opinion that the Senate would destroy itself and ruin the State utterly if it per­ mitted the people to assume the power of trying patri­ cians and voting on their trials ;", "5556": "while the older men, and those who were more inclined to the popular side, thought that this power would render the people gentle and temperate, and not savage and cruel.", "5557": "The people, they aaid, did not despise the Senate, but imagined that they were despised by it, so that this privilege of holding the trial would agreeably salve their wounded vanity, and, as they exercised their franchise, they would lay aside their anger.", "5558": "XX.",

was charged with, and what indictment they intended to bring against him at his trial.", "5560": "When they answered that the charge against him was one of treason, because he had attempted to make himself absolute despot in Rome, and that they would prove it, he at once rose, saying that he would at once defend himself before the people on that score, and that if he were convicted, he would not refuse to undergo any punishment whatever;", "5561": "“ Only,\" said he, “ do not bring forward some other charge against me, and deceive the Senate.\"", "5562": "When they had agreed upon these

respectable men who had served the State in the wars would be swamped by those of the needy rabble who cared nothing for truth or honour.", "5565": "In the next place, they passed by the charge of treason, as being impossible to prove, and repeated what Marcius had orignally said before the Senate, when he dissuaded them from lowering the price of corn, and advised the abolition of the office of tribune.", "5566": "A new count in the indictment was that he had not paid over the money raised by the sale of the plunder after his expedition against Antium, but had divided it among his own followers.", "5567": "This last accusation is said to have disturbed Marcius more than all the rest, as he had never expected it, and was not pre­ pared with any answer that would satisfy the people, so that the praises which he bestowed on those who had made that campaign with him only angered the far greater number who had not done so.", "5568": "At last the people voted.", "5569": "Marcius was condemned by a majority of the tribes, and was sentenced to perpetual banishment.", "5570": "After sentence was passed, the people displayed greater joy than if they had won a pitched battle, while the Senate was downcast and filled with regret at not having run any risks rather than allow the people to obtain so much power, and use it so insolently.", "5571": "Nor was there any need for distinctions of dress or anything else to distinguish the two parties, because a plebeian might be told at once by his delight, a patrician by his sorrow.", "5572": "XXI.", "5573": "Marcius himself, however, remained unmoved.", "5574": "Proud and haughty as ever, he appeared not to be sorry for himself, and to be the only one of the patricians who was not.", "5575": "This calmness, however, was not due to any even­ ness of temper or any intention of bearing his wrongs meekly.", "5576": "It arose from concentrated rage and fury, which many do not know to be an expression of great grief.", "5577": "When the mind is inflamed with this passion, it casts out all ideas of submission or of quiet.", "5578": "Hence an angry man is courageous, just as a fever patient is hot, because of the inflamed throbbing excitement of his mind.", "5579": "And Marcius soon showed that this was his own condition.", "5580": "He went home, embraced his weeping wife and mother, bade them bear this calamity with patience, and at once proceeded to the city gates, escorted by the patricians in a body.", "5581": "Thence, taking nothing with him, and asking no man for any thing, he went off, accompanied by three or four of his clients.", "5582": "He remained for a few days at some farms near the city, agitated deeply by conflicting passions.", "5583": "His anger suggested no scheme by which he might benefit himself, but only how to revenge himself on the Romans.", "5584": "At length he decided that he would raise up a cruel war against them, and proceeded at once to make application to the neighbouring nation of the Volscians, whom he knew to be rich and powerful, and only to have suffered sufficiently by their late defeats to make them desirous of renewing their quarrel with Rome.", "5585": "XXII.", "5586": "There was a certain citizen of Antium named Tullus Aufidius, who, from his wealth, courage, and noble birth, was regarded as the most important man in the whole Volscian nation.", "5587": "Marcius knew that this man hated him more than any other Roman ;", "5588": "for in battle they had often met, and by challenging and defying one another, as young warriors are 'ont to do, they had, in addition to their national antipathy, gained a violent personal hatred for one another.", "5589": "In spite of this, however, knowing the generous nature of Tullus, and longing more than any Volscian to requite the Romans for their treatment, he justified the verses, “Tis hard to strive with rage, which aye, Though life's the forfeit, gains its way.\"",

did not dare to disturb him, as there was a certain dignity about his appearance and his silence, but went and told Tullus, who was at supper, of this strange incident.", "5594": "Tullus rose, went to him, and inquired who he was and what he wanted.", "5595": "Then at length Marcius uncovered his face, and, after a short pause, said, “ If you do not recognise me, Tullus, or if you do not believe your eyes, I must myself tell you who I am.", "5596": "I am Caius Marcius, who has wrought you and the Volscians more mischief than any one else, and who, lest I should deny this, have received the

strength and weakness of the enemy.", "5602": "If, however, you are tired of war, I have no wish for life, nor is it to your credit to save the life of one who once was your personal enemy, and who now is worn out and useless.\"", "5603": "Tullus was greatly delighted with this speech, and giving him his right hand, answered, \"Rise, Marcius, and be of good courage.", "5604": "You have brought us a noble present, yourself;", "5605": "rest assured that the Volscians will not be ungrateful.\"", "5606": "He then feasted Marcius with great hospi­ tal ty, and for some days they conferred together as to the boot method of carrying on the war.", "5607": "XXIV.", "5608": "Rome meanwhile was disturbed by the anger of the patricians towards the plebeians, especially on account of the

a litter;", "5614": "and as soon as he had told it, he found his bodily strength return, rose, and walked home.", "5615": "The senators, greatly astonished, inquired into the matter.", "5616": "It was found that a slave, convicted of some crime, had been ordered by his master to be flogged through the market-place, and then put to death.", "5617": "While this was being done, and the wretch was twisting his body in every kind of contortion as he writhed under the blows, the procession by chance was following after him.", "5618": "Many of those who walked in it were shocked at the unseemliness of the spectacle, and disgusted at its inhumanity, but no one did anything more than reproach and execrate a man who treated his slaves with so much cruelty.", "5619": "At that period men treated their slaves with great xindness, because the master himself worked and ate in their company, and so could sympathise more with them.", "5620": "The great punishment for a slave who had done wrong was to make him carry round the neighbourhood the piece of wood on which the pole of a waggon is rested.", "5621": "The slave who has done this and been seen by the neigh­ bours and friends, lost his credit, and was called furcifer, for the Romans call that piece of timber furca, “a fork,\" which the Greeks call hypostates, \" a supporter.\"XXV.", "5622": "So when Latinus related his dream to the sena­ tors, and they were wondering who the bad and unac­ ceptable dancer could be who had led the procession, some of them remembered the slave who had been flogged through the market-place and there put to death.", "5623": "At the instance of the priests, the master of the slave was punished for his cruelty, and the procession and ceremonies were performed anew in honour of the gods.", "5624": "Hence we may see how wisely Numa arranged this, among other matters of ceremonial.", "5625": "Whenever the magistrates or priests were engaged in any religious rite, a herald walked before them crying in a loud voice “Hoc age.\"", "5626": "The meaning of the phrase is, \" Do this,\" meaning to tell the people to apply their minds entirely to the religious ceremony, and not to allow any thought of worldly things to distract their attention, because men as a rule only attend to such matters by putting a certain constraint on their thoughts.", "5627": "It is the custom in Rome to begin a sacrifice, a pro­ cession, or a spectacle, over again, not only when anything of this kind happens, but for any trifling reason.", "5628": "Thus, if one of the horses drawing the sacred car called Thensa stumbles, or the charioteer takes the reins in his left hand, they have decreed that the procession must begin again.", "5629": "In later times they have been known to perform one sacrifice thirty times, because every time some slight omission or mistake took place.", "5630": "XXVI.", "5631": "Meanwhile Marcius and Tullus in Antium held private conferences with the chief men of the Volscians, and advised them to begin the war while Rome was divided by its domestic quarrels.", "5632": "They discountenanced this proposal, because a truce and cessation of hostilities for two years had been agreed upon :", "5633": "but the Romans themselves gave them a pretext for breaking the truce, by a proclamation which was made at the public games, that all Volscians should quit the city before sunset.", "5634": "Some say this was effected by a stratagem of Marcius, who sent a false accusation against the Volscians to the magistrates at Rome, saying that during the publiogames they meant to attack the Romans and burn the city.", "5635": "This proclamation made them yet bitterer enemies to the Romans than before;", "5636": "and Tullus, wishing to bring the business to a climax, induced his countrymen to send ambassadors to Rome to demand back the cities and territory which the Romans had taken from the Volscians in the late war.", "5637": "The Romans were very indignant when they heard these demands, and made answer, that the Volscians might be the first to take up arms, but that the Romans would be the last to lay them down.", "5638": "Upon this, Tullus convoked a general assembly, in which, after de­ termining upon war, he advised them to summon Marcius to their aid, not owing him any grudge for what they had suffered at his hands, but believing that he would be more valuable to them as a friend than he had been dangerous as an enemy.", "5639": "XXVII.", "5640": "Marcius was called before the assembly, and having addressed the people, was thought by them to know how to speak as well as how to fight, and was considered to be a man of great ability and courage.", "5641": "He, together with Tullus, was nominated general with unlimited powers.", "5642": "As he feared the Volscians would take a long time to prepare for the war, and that meanwhile the opportunity for attack might pass away, he ordered the leading men in the city to make all necessary prepara­ tions, and himself taking the boldest and most forward as volunteers, without levying any troops by compulsory conscription, made a sudden and unexpected inroad into the Roman territory.", "5643": "Here he obtained so much plunder that the Volscians were wearied with carrying it off and consuming it in their camp.", "5644": "However, his least object was to obtain plunder and lay waste the country;", "5645": "his main desire was to render the patricians suspected by the people.", "5646": "While all else was ravaged and destroyed, he carefully protected their farms, and would not allow any damage to be done or anything to be carried off from them.", "5647": "This increased the disorders at Rome, the patri­ cians reproaching the people for having unjustly banished so able a man, while the plebeians accused them of having invited Marcius to attack in order to obtain their revenge, and said that, while others fought, they sat as idle spectators, having in the war itself a sure safeguard of their wealth and estates.", "5648": "Having produced this new quarrel among the Romans, and, besides loading the Volscians with plunder, having taught them to despise their enemy, Marcius led his troops back in safety.", "5649": "XXVIII.", "5650": "By great and zealous exertions the entire Volscian nation was soon assembled under arms.", "5651": "The force thus raised was very large;", "5652": "part was left to garrison the cities, as a measure of precaution, while the rest was to be used in the campaign against Rome.", "5653": "Marcius now left Tullus to determine which corps he would command.", "5654": "Tullus, in answer, said that as Marcius, he knew, was as brave a man as himself, and had always enjoyed better fortune in all his battles, he had better command the army in the field.", "5655": "He himself, he added, would remain behind, watch over the safety of the Volscian cities, and supply the troops with necessaries.", "5656": "Marcius, strengthened by this division of the command, marched to the town of Circeii, a Roman colony.", "5657": "As it surrendered, he did it no harm, but laid waste the country of Latium, where he expected the Romans would fight a battle in defence of their allies the Latins, who frequently sent to entreat their protection.", "5658": "But at Rome the people were unwilling to fight, and the consuls were just at the expiry of their term of office, so that they did not care to run any risks, and therefore rejected the appeals of the Latins.", "5659": "Marcius now led his troops against the Latian cities, Tolerium, Labici, Pedum, and Bola, all of which he took by storm, sold the inhabitants for slaves, and plundered the houses.", "5660": "Those cities, however, which voluntarily came to his side he treated with the utmost consideration, even pitching his camp at a distance, for fear they might be injured by the soldiery against his will, and never plundering their territory.", "5661": "XXIX.", "5662": "When at last he took Bollæ, a town not more than twelve miles from Rome, obtaining immense booty and putting nearly all the adult inhabitants to the sword, then not even those Yolscians who had been appointed to garrison the cities would any longer remain at their posts, but seized their arms and joined the army of Marcius, declaring that he was their only general, and that they would recognise no other leader.", "5663": "His renown and glory spread throughout all Italy, and all men were astonished that one man by changing sides should have produced so great a change.", "5664": "The affairs of Rome were in the last disorder, the people refusing to fight, while internal quarrels and seditious speeches took place daily, until news came that Lavinium was being invested by the enemy.", "5665": "This town contains the most ancient images and sacred things of the tutelary deities of Rome, and is the origin of the Roman people, being the first town founded by AEneas.", "5666": "Upon this a very singular change of opinions betel both the people and the Senate.", "5667": "The people were eager to annul their sentence against Marcius, and to beg him to return, but the Senate, after meeting and considering this proposal, finally rejected it, either out of a mere spirit of opposition to anything proposed by the people, or because they did not wish him to return by favour of the people ;", "5668": "or it may be because they themselves were now angry with him for having shown himself the enemy of all classes alike, although he had only been injured by one, and for having become the avowed enemy of his country, in which he knew that the best and noblest all sympathised with him, and had suffered along with him.", "5669": "When this resolution was made known to the people, they were un­ able to proceed to vote or to pass any bill on the subject, without a previous decree of the Senate.", "5670": "XXX.", "5671": "Marcius when he heard of this was more ex­ asperated than ever.", "5672": "He raised his siege of Lavinium, marched straight upon Rome, and pitched his camp five miles from the city, at the place called Fossœ Cluiliœ.", "5673": "The appearance of his army caused much terror and disturbance, but nevertheless put an end to sedition, for no magistrate or patrician dared any longer oppose the people's desire to recall him.", "5674": "When they beheld the women running distractedly through the city, the ola men weeping and praying at the altars, and no one able to take courage and form any plan of defence, it was agreed that the people had been right in wishing to come to terms with Marcius, and that the Senate had committed a fatal error in inflicting a new outrage upon him, just at the time when all unkindness might have been buried.", "5675": "It was determined, therefore, by the whole city that an embassy should be despatched to Marcius, to offer him restoration to his own country, and to beg of him to make peace.", "5676": "Those of the Senate who were sent were relations of Marcius, and expected to be warmly welcomed by a man who was their near relation and personal friend.", "5677": "Nothing of the kind, however, happened.", "5678": "They were conducted through the enemy's camp, and found him seated, and displaying insufferable pride and arrogance, with the chiefs of the Volscians standing round him.", "5679": "He bade the ambassadors deliver their message;", "5680": "and after they had, in a supplicatory fashion, pronounced a con­ ciliatory oration, he answered them, dwelling with bitter­ ness on his own unjust treatment;", "5681": "and then in his capacity of general-in-chief of the Volscians, he bade them restore the cities and territory which they had conquered in the late war, and to grant the franchise to the Volscians on the same terms as enjoyed by the Latins.", "5682": "These, he said, were the only conditions on which a just and lasting peace could be made.", "5683": "He allowed them a space of thirty days for deliberation, and on the departure of the ambassadors immediately drew off his forces.", "5684": "XXXI.", "5685": "This affair gave an opportunity to several of the Volscians, who had long envied and disliked his repu tation, and the influence which he had with the people.", "5686": "Among these was Tullus himself, who had not been per­ sonally wronged by Marcius, but who, as it is natural he should, felt vexed at being totally eclipsed and thrown into the shade, for the Volscians now thought Marcius the greatest man in their whole nation, and con.", "5687": "sidered that any one else ought to be thankful for any measure of authority that he might think fit to bestow Hence secret hints were exchanged, and private meetings held, in which his enemies expressed their dissatisfaction, calling the retreat from Rome an act of treason, not indeed that he had betrayed any cities or armies to the enemy, but he had granted them time, by which all other things are won and lost.", "5688": "He had given the enemy a breathing time, they said, of thirty days, being no less than they required to put themselves in a posture of defence.", "5689": "Marcius during this time was not idle, for he attacked and defeated the allies of the Romans, and captured seven large and populous towns.", "5690": "The Romans did not venture to come to help their allies, but hung back from taking the field, and seemed as if paralysed and benumbed.", "5691": "When the term had expired, Marcius presented himself a second time before Rome, with his entire army.", "5692": "The Romans now sent a second embassy, begging him to lay aside his anger, withdraw the Volscians from the country, and then to make such terms as would be for the advantage of both nations.", "5693": "The Romans, they said, would yield nothing to fear;", "5694": "but if he thought that special concessions ought to be made to the Volscians, they would be duly considered if they laid down their arms.", "5695": "To this Marcius answered that, as general of the Volscians, he could give them no answer;", "5696": "but that as one who was still a citizen of Rome he would advise them to adopt a humbler frame of mind, and come to him in three days with a ratification of his proposals.", "5697": "If they should come to any other determine tion, he warned them that it would not be safe for them to come to his camp again with empty words.", "5698": "XXXII.", "5699": "When the ambassadors returned, and the Senate heard their report, they determined in this dread­ ful extremity to let go their sheet anchor.", "5700": "They ordered all the priests, ministers, and guardians of the sacred mysteries, and all the hereditary prophets who watched the omens given by the flight of birds, to go in procession to Marcius, dressed in their sacred vestments, and beseech him to desist from the war, and then to negotiate condi­ tions of peace between his countrymen and the Volscians.", "5701": "Marcius received the priests in his camp, but relaxed nothing of his former harshness, bidding the Romans either accept his proposals or continue the war.", "5702": "When the priests returned, the Romans resolved in future to remain within the city, repulse any assault which might be made on the walls, and trust to time and fortune, as it was evident that they could not be saved by anything that they could do.", "5703": "The city was full of con­ fusion, excitement, and panic terror, until there happened something like what is mentioned in Homer, but which men as a rule are unwilling to

fighting against them.", "5815": "As to their respective policy, that of Alkibiades was disliked by the more respectable citizens, because of his personal arrogance, and the arts to which he stooped to gain the favour of the lower classes;", "5816": "while the proud ungracious haughtiness of Coriolanus caused him to be hated by the people of Rome.", "5817": "In this respect neither of them can be praised ;", "5818": "yet he who tries to gain the favour of the people is less to blame than he who insults them for fear he should be thought to court them.", "5819": "Although it is wrong to flatter the people in order to gain power, yet to owe one's power only to terror, and to ill treat and keep down the masses is disgraceful as well as wrong.", "5820": "II.", "5821": "It is not difficult to see why Marcius is considered to have been a simple-minded and straightforward character, while Alkibiades has the reputation of a false and tricky politician.", "5822": "The latter has been especially blamed for the manner in which he deceived and outwitted the Lace­ demonian ambassadors, by which, as we learn from Thucydides, he brought the truce between the two nations to an end.", "5823": "Yet that stroke of policy, though it again involved Athens in war, rendered her strong and formidable, through the alliance with Argos and Man­ tinea, which she owed to Alkibiades.", "5824": "Marcius also, we are told by Dionysius, produced a quarrel between the Romans and the Volscians by bringing a false accusation against those Volscians who came to see the festival at Rome;", "5825": "and in this case the wickedness of his object in­ creased his guilt, because he did not act from a desire of personal aggrandisement, or from political rivalry, as did Alkibiades, but merely yielding to what Dion calls the unprofitable passion of anger, he threw a large part of Italy into confusion, and in his rage against his native country destroyed many innocent cities.", "5826": "On the other hand, the anger of Alkibiades caused great misfortune to his countrymen;", "5827": "yet as soon as he found that they had relented towards him he returned cheerfully to his allegiance, and after being banished for the second time, did not take any delight in seeing their generals defeated, and could not sit still and let them make mistakes and uselessly expose themselves to danger.", "5828": "He did just what Aristeides is so much praised for doing to Themistokles;", "5829": "he went to the generals, although they were not his friends, and pointed out to them what ought to be done.", "5830": "Marcius, again, is to be blamed for having made the whole of Rome suffer for what only a part of it had done, while the best and most important class of citizens had been wronged equally with himself, and warmly sympa­ thised with him.", "5831": "Afterwards, although his countrymen sent him many embassies, beseeching his forgiveness for their one act of ignorance and passion, he would not listen to them, but showed that it was with the intention of utterly destroying Rome, not of obtaining his own restoration to it, that he had begun that terrible and savage war against it.", "5832": "This, then, may be noted as the difference between their respective positions:", "5833": "Alkibiades went back to the Athenian side when the Spartans began to plot against him, because he both feared them and hated them ;", "5834": "but Marcius, who was in every respect well treated by the Volscians, could not honourably desert their cause.", "5835": "He had been elected their commander-in- chief and besides this great power enjoyed their entire confidence;", "5836": "while Alkibiades, though his assistance was found useful by the Lacedæmonians, was never trusted by them, but remained without any recognised position, first in Sparta and then in the camp in Asia Minor, till he finally threw himself into the arms of Tissaphernes, unless, indeed, he took this step to save Athens, hoping some day to be restored to her.", "5837": "III.", "5838": "As to money, Alkibiades has been blamed for receiving it discreditably in bribes, and for spending it in luxurious extravagance;", "5839": "while the generals who offered Marcius money as an honourable reward for his valour could not prevail upon him to accept it.", "5840": "This, however, made him especially unpopular in the debates about freeing the people from debt, because it was said that he pressed so hardly on the poor, not because he wished to make money by them, but purely through arrogance and pride.", "5841": "Antipater, in a letter to a friend on the death of Aristotle the philosopher, observes, “Bosides his other abilities, the man had the art of persuasion.\"", "5842": "Now Marcius had not this art;", "5843": "and its absence made all his exploits and all his virtues unpleasant even to those who benefited by them, as they could not endure his pride and haughtiness, which brooked no compeer.", "5844": "Alkibiades, on the other hand, knew how to deal on friendly terms with every one, and we need not therefore be surprised at the pleasure which men took in his successes, while even some of his failures had a charm of their own for.", "5845": "his friends.", "5846": "Hence it was that Alkibiades, even after inflicting many grievous losses upon his countrymen, was chosen by them as commander-in-chief, whereas Marcius, when after a splendid display of courage and conduct he tried for the consulship which he deserved, failed to obtain it.", "5847": "The one could not be hated by his countrymen, even when they were ill treated by him;", "5848": "while the other, though admired by all, was loved by none.", "5849": "IV.", "5850": "Marcius, indeed, effected nothing great when in command of his own countrymen, but only when fighting against them, whereas the Athenians frequently benefited by the successes of Alkibiades, when he was acting as their oummauder-in-chief.", "5851": "Alkibiades when present easily triumphed over his enemies, whereas Marcius, although present, was condemned by the Romans, and put to death by the Volscians.", "5852": "Moreover, though he was wrongfully slain, yet he himself furnished his enemies with a pretext for his murder, by refusing the public offer of peace made by the Romans, and then yielding to the private entreaties of his mother and wife, so that he did not put an end to the enmity between the two nations, but left them at war, and yet lost a favourable opportunity for the Volscians.", "5853": "If he was influenced by a feeling of duty towards the Volscians, he ought to have obtained their consent before withdrawing their forces from before Rome;", "5854": "but if he cared nothing for them, or for anything except the grati­ fication of his own passion, and with this feeling made war upon his country, and only paused in the moment of victory, it was not creditable to him to spare his country for his mother's sake, but rather he should have spared his country and his mother with it;", "5855": "for his mother and his wife were but a part of Rome, which he was besieging.", "5856": "That he should have treated the public supplications of ambassadors and the prayers of priests with contempt, and afterwards have drawn off his forces to please his mother, is not so much a credit to her as a disgrace to his country, which was saved by the tears and entreaties of one woman, as though it did not deserve to survive on its own merits.", "5857": "The mercy which he showed the Romans was so harshly and offensively granted that it pleased neither party;", "5858": "he withdrew his forces without having either having come to an understanding with his friends or his foes.", "5859": "All this must be attributed to his haughty, unbending temper, which is in all cases odious, but which in an ambitious man renders him savage and inexorable, Such men will not seek for popularity, thinking them­ selves already sufficiently distinguished, and then are angry at finding themselves unpopular.", "5860": "Indeed, neither Metellus, nor Aristeides, nor Epamei­ nondas would stoop to court the favour of the people, and had a thorough contempt for all that the people can either give or take away;", "5861": "yet although they were often ostracised, convicted, and condemned to pay fines, they were not angry with their fellow countrymen for their folly, but came back and became reconciled to them as soon as they repented.", "5862": "The man who will not court the people, ought least of all to bear malice against them, reflecting that anger at not being elected to an office in the state, must spring from an excessive desire to obtain it.", "5863": "V.", "5864": "Alkibiades made no secret of his delight in being honoured and his vexation when slighted, and in con­ sequence endeavoured to make himself acceptable to all with whom he had to do.", "5865": "Marcius was prevented by his pride from courting those who could have bestowed honour and advancement upon him, while his ambition tortured him if these were withheld.", "5866": "These are the points which we find to blame in his character, which in all other respects was a noble one.", "5867": "With regard to temperance, and contempt for money, he may be compared with the greatest and purest men of Greece, not merely with Alkibiades, who cared only too little for such things, and paid no regard to his reputation.", "5868": "IT was for the sake of others that I first undertook to write biographies, but I soon began to dwell upon and delight in them for myself, endeavouring to the best of my ability to regulate my own life, and to make it like that of those who were reflected in their history as it were in a mirror before me.", "5869": "By the study of their biographies, we receive each man as a guest into our minds, and we seem to understand their character as the result of a personal acquaintance, because we have obtained from their acts the best and most important means of forming an opinion about them. \"", "5870": "What greater pleasure could'st thou gain than this?\"", "5871": "What more valuable for the elevation of our own character ?", "5872": "Demokritus says, that we ought to pray that we may meet with propitious phantasms, and that from the infinite space which surrounds us good and con­ genial phantasms, rather than base and sinister ones, may be brought into contact with us.", "5873": "He degrades philosophy by foisting into it a theory which is untrue, and which leads to unbounded superstition;", "5874": "whereas we, by our familiarity with history, and habit of writing it, so train ourselves by constantly receiving into our minds the memorials of the great and good, that should anything base or vicious be placed in our way by the society into which we are neces­ sarily thrown, we reject it and expel it from our thoughts, by fixing them calmly and severely on some of these great examples.", "5875": "Of these, I have chosen for you in this present instance, the life of Timoleon the Corinthian, and that of Æmilius Paulus, men who both laid their plans with skill, and carried them out with good fortune, so as to raise a question whether it was more by good luck or by good sense that they succeeded in their most important achievements.", "5876": "I.", "5877": "The state of affairs at Syracuse, before the mission of Timoleon to Sicily, was this.", "5878": "Dion had driven out the despot.", "5879": "Dionysius, but was immediately afterwards slain by treachery, and those who, under Dion, had freed the Syra­ cusans, quarrelled amongst themselves.", "5880": "The city, which received a constant succession of despots, was almost for­ saken because of its many troubles.", "5881": "Of the rest of Sicily, one part was rendered quite ruined and uninhabited by the wars, and most of the cities were held by barbarians of various nations, and soldiers who were under no pay­ master.", "5882": "As these men willingly lent their aid to effect changes of dynasty, Dionysius, in the twelfth year of his exile, collected a body of foreign troops, drove out Nysaeus, the then ruler of Syracuse, again restored his empire, and was re-established as despot.", "5883": "He had strangely lost the greatest known empire at the hands of a few men, and more strangely still became again the lord of those who had driven him out, after having been an exile and a beggar.", "5884": "Those then of the Syracusans who remained in the city were the.", "5885": "subjects of a despot not naturally humane, and whose heart now had been embittered by misfortune:", "5886": "t but the better class of citizens and the men of note fled to Hiketes, the ruler of Leontini, swore alle­ giance to him, and chose him as their general for the war.", "5887": "This man was nowise better than the avowed despots, but they had no other resource, and they trusted him because he was a Syracusan by birth, and had a force capable of encountering that of their own despot.", "5888": "II.", "5889": "Meanwhile the Carthaginians came to Sicily with a great fleet, and were hovering off the island watching their opportunity.", "5890": "The Sicilians in terror wished to send an embassy to Greece, and ask for help from the Corinthians, not merely on account of their kinship with them, and of the, many kindnesses which they had received from them, but also because they saw that the whole city loved free­ dom, and hated despots, and that it had waged its greatest and most important wars, not for supremacy and greed of power, but on behalf of the liberty of Greece.", "5891": "But Hiketes who had obtained his post of commander-in-chief with a view, not to the liberation of Syracuse, but the establish­ ment of himself as despot there, had already had secret negotiations with the Carthaginians, though in public he commended the Syracusans, and sent ambassadors of his own with the rest to Peloponnesus:", "5892": "not that he wished that any assistance should come thence, but, in case the Corin­ thians, as was probable, should refuse their help because of the disturbed state of Greece, he hoped that he should more easily be able to bring matters round to suit the Car­ thaginian interest, and to use them as allies either against the Syracusan citizens, or against their despot.", "5893": "Of this treacherous design he was shortly afterwards convicted.", "5894": "III.", "5895": "When the ambassadors arrived, the Corinthians, who had always been in the habit of watching over the interests of their colonies, especially Syracuse, and who were not at war with any of the Greek States at that time, but living in peace and leisure, eagerly voted to help them.", "5896": "A General was now sought for, and while the government was nominating and proposing those who were eager for an opportunity of distinguishing themselves, a man of the people stood up and named Timoleon, the son of Timo­ demus, one who no longer took any part in politics, and who had no hope or thought of obtaining the post:", "5897": "but some god, it seems, put it into the man's mind to name him, such a kind fortune was at once shown at his election, and such success attended his actions, illustrating his noble character.", "5898": "He was of a good family, both his father Timodemus, and his mother Demariste being of rank in the city.", "5899": "He was a lover of his country, and of a mild temper, except only that he had a violent hatred for des­ potism and all that is base.", "5900": "His nature was so happily constituted, that in his campaigns he showed much judg­ ment when young, and no less daring when old.", "5901": "He had an elder brother, Timophanes, who was in no respect like him, but rash, and inflamed with a passion for monarchy by worthless friends and foreign soldiers, with whom he spent all his time:", "5902": "he was reckless in a campaign, and loved danger for its own sake, and by this he won the hearts of his fellow-citizens, and was given commands, as being a man of courage and of action.", "5903": "Timoleon assisted him in obtaining these commands, by concealing his faults or making them appear small, and by magnifying the clever things which he did.", "5904": "IV.", "5905": "Now in the battle which the Corinthians fought against the Argives and Kleoneans, Timoleon was ranked among the hoplites,* and his brother Timophanes, who was in command of the cavalry, fell into great danger.", "5906": "His horse received a wound, and threw him off among the enemy.", "5907": "Of his companions, some at once dispersed in panic, while those who remained by him, being a few against many, with difficulty held their own.", "5908": "When Timoleon saw what had happened, he ran to the rescue, and held his shield in front of Timophanes as he lay, and, after receiving many blows, both from missiles and in hand-to-hand fight, on his arms and body, with difficulty drove back the enemy and saved his brother.", "5909": "When the Corinthians, fearing lest they might again suffer what they did once before when their own allies took their city, decreed that they would keep four hundred mer­ cenary soldiers, they made Timophanes their commander.", "5910": "But he, disdaining truth and honour, immediately took measures to get the city into his own power, and showed his tyrannical disposition by putting to death many of the leading citizens without a trial.", "5911": "Timoleon was grieved at this, and, treating the other's crime as his own misfortune, endeavoured to argue with him, and begged him to abandon his foolish and wicked design, and to seek for some means of making amends to his fellow-citizens.", "5912": "However, as he rejected his brother's advice, and treated him with contempt, Timoleon took Æschylus, his kinsman, brother of the wife of Timophanes, and his friend the seer, whom Theopompus calls Satyrus, but Ephorus and Timæus call Orthagoras, and, after an interval of a few days, again went to his brother.", "5913": "The three men now stood round him, and besought him even now to listen to reason, and repent of his ambition ;", "5914": "but as Timophanes at first laughed at them, and then became angry and in­ dignant, Timoleon stepped a little aside, and covering his face, stood weeping, while the other two drew their swords and quickly despatched him.", "5915": "V.", "5916": "When this deed was noised abroad, the more generous of the Corinthians praised Timoleon for his abhorrence of wickedness and his greatness of soul, because, though of a kindly disposition, and fond of his own family, lie had nevertheless preferred his country to his family, and truth and justice to his own advantage.", "5917": "He had distin­ guished himself in his country's cause both by saving his brother's life, and by putting him to death when he plotted to reduce her to slavery.", "5918": "However, those who could not endure to live in a democracy, and who were accustomed to look up to those in power, pretended to rejoice in the death of the tyrant, but by their abuse of Timoleon for having done an unholy and impious deed, reduced him to a state of great melancholy.", "5919": "Hearing that his mother took it greatly to heart and that she used harsh words and invoked terrible curses upon him, he went to her to try to bring her to another state of mind, but she would not endure the sight of him, but shut the door against him.", "5920": "Then indeed he became very dejected, and disordered in his mind, so as to form an intention of destroying him­ self by starvation;", "5921": "but this his friends would not permit, but prevailed on him by force and entreaty so that he determined to live, but alone by himself.", "5922": "He gave up all interest in public affairs, and at first did not even enter the city, but passed his time wandering in the wildest part of the country in an agony of mind.", "5923": "VI.", "5924": "Thus our judgments, if they do not borrow from reason and philosophy a fixity and steadiness of pur­ pose in their acts, are easily swayed and influenced by the praise or blame of others, which make us distrust our own opinions.", "5925": "For not only, it seems, must the deed itself be noble and just, but also the principle from which we do it must be stable and unchangeable, so that we may make up our minds and then act from conviction.", "5926": "If we do not, then like those epicures who most eagerly seize upon the daintiest food and soonest become satiated and nauseate it, so we become filled with sorrow and remorse when the deed is done, because the splendid ideas of virtue and honour which led us to do it fade away in our minds on account of our own moral weakness.", "5927": "A remorseful change of mind renders even a noble action base, whereas the determination which is grounded on knowledge and reason cannot change even if its actions fail.", "5928": "Wherefore Phokion the Athenian, who opposed the measures of Leosthenes, when Leosthenes seemed to have succeeded, and he saw the Athenians sacrificing and priding them­ selves on their victory, said that he should have wished that he had himself done what had been done, but he should wish to have given the same counsel that he did give.", "5929": "Aristeides the Lokrian, one of the companions of Plato, put this even more strongly when Dionysius the elder asked for one of his daughters in marriage.", "5930": "“I had rather,\" he said, “ see the girl a corpse, than the- consort of a despot.\"", "5931": "A short time afterwards when Dionysius put his sons to death and insultingly asked him whether he were still of the same mind about the disposal of his daughter, he answered, that he was grieved at what had happened, but had not changed his mind about what he had said.", "5932": "And these words perhaps show a greater and more perfect virtue than Phokion's.", "5933": "VII.", "5934": "Now Timoleon's misery, after the deed was done, whether it was caused by pity for the dead or filial reverence for his mother, so broke down and humbled his spirit that for nearly twenty years he took no part in any important public affair.", "5935": "So when he was nominated as General, and when the people gladly received his name and elected him, Telekleides, who at that time was the first man in the city for power and reputation, stood up and spoke encouragingly to Timoleon, bidding him prove himself brave and noble in the campaign..", "5936": "“ If,\" said he, you fight well, we shall think that we slew a tyrant, but if badly, that we murdered your brother.", "5937": "\"", "5938": "While Timoleon was preparing for his voyage and collecting his soldiers, letters were brought to the Corinthians from Hiketes plainly showing that he had changed sides and betrayed them.", "5939": "For as soon as he had sent off his ambassadors to Corinth, he openly joined the Carthaginians, and in concert with them attempted to drive out Dionysius and establish himself as despot of Syracuse.", "5940": "Fearing that the opportunity would escape him if an army and general came from Corinth before he had succeeded, he sent a letter to the Corinthians to say that they need not incur the trouble and expense of sending an expedition to Sicily and risking their lives, espe­ cially as the Carthaginians would dispute their passage, and were now watching for their expedition with a numerous fleet;", "5941": "and that, as they bad been so slow, he should be obliged to make these Carthaginians his allies to attack the despot.", "5942": "When these letters were read, even if any of the Corinthians had been lukewarm about the expedition, now their anger against Hiketes stirred them up to co-operate vigorously with Timoleon and assist him in equipping his force.", "5943": "VIII.", "5944": "When the ships were ready, and everything had been provided for the soldiers, the priestesses of Proserpine had a dream that the two goddesses appeared dressed for a journey, and said that they were going to accompany Timoleon on his voyage to Sicily.", "5945": "Hereupon the Corinthians equipped a sacred trireme, and named it after the two goddesses.", "5946": "Timoleon himself proceeded to Delphi and sacrificed to the god, and when he came into the place where oracles were delivered, a portent occurred to him.",

one from Leukadia;", "5950": "and as he put to sea at night and was sailing with a fair wind, he suddenly saw the heavens open above his ship and pour down a flood of brilliant light.", "5951": "After this a torch like that used at the mysteries rose up before them, and, proceeding on the same course, alighted on that part of Italy for which the pilots were steering.", "5952": "The seers explained that this appearance corroborated the dream of the priestesses, anti that the light from heaven showed that the two god­ desses were joining the expedition;", "5953": "for Sicily is sacred to Proserpine, as the myth tells us that she was carried off there, and that the island itself was given her as a wedding present.", "5954": "The fleet, encouraged by these proofs of divine favour,

Dionysius, and taken the greater part of Syracuse;", "5957": "he had driven him into the citadel and what is called the island, and was besieging and blockading him there, and urging the Carthaginians

back to Corinth, as the war was within a little of being finished, and as the Carthaginians were determined to oppose his passage by force if he attempted it.", "5962": "So the Corinthians, when they reached Rhegium, found these ambassadors, and saw the Carthaginian fleet cruising to intercept them.", "5963": "They were enraged at this treatment, and all were filled with anger against Hiketes, and with fear for the people of Sicily, who, they clearly saw, were to be the prize of the treachery of Hiketes and the ambition of the Carthaginians.", "5964": "Yet it seemed impossible that they should

assembly broke up and Timolcon was gone, were in­ furiated at being outwitted, and became a standing joke to the people of Rhegium, because they, although they were Phoenicians, yet did not seem to enjoy a piece of deceit when it was at their own expense.", "5978": "They then sent an ambassador in a trireme to Tauromenium, who made a long speech to Andromachus, threatening him in a bombastic and barbarian style with their vengeance if he did not at once turn the Corinthians out of his city.", "5979": "At last he pointed to his outstretched hand, and turning it over threatened that he would so deal with the city.", "5980": "Andromachus laughed, and made no other answer than to hold out his own hand in the same way, now with one side up, and now with the other, and bade him sail away unless he wished to have his ship so dealt with.", "5981": "Hiketes, when he heard of Timoleon's arrival, in his terror sent for many of the Carthaginian ships of war;", "5982": "and now the Syracusans began

whose worship extends especially through­ out Sicily.", "5988": "They were at feud with one another, as one party invited Hiketes and the Carthaginians, while the other sent for Timoleon to help

altogether had no more than twelve hundred.", "5991": "Starting with these men from Tauromenium, which is forty-two miles from Adranum, he made but a short march on the first day, and then encamped.", "5992": "On the next day he marched steadily forward, passed some difficult country, and late in the day heard that Hiketas had just reached the little fortress and was encamping before it.", "5993": "On this the officers halted the van of the army, thinking that the men would be fresher after taking food and rest;", "5994": "but Timoleon went to them and begged them not to do so, but to lead them on as fast as they could, and fall upon the enemy while they were in disorder, as it was probable they would be, having just come off their march, and being busy about pitching their tents, and cooking their supper.", "5995": "Saying this he seized his shield,* and led the way himself as to an assured victory;", "5996": "and the rest, reassured, followed him confidently.", "5997": "They were distant only about thirty furlongs.", "5998": "These were soon passed, and they fell headlong upon the enemy, who were in confusion, and fled as soon as they discovered their attack.", "5999": "For this reason no more than three hundred of them were slain, but twice as many were taken prisoners, and their camp was captured.", "6000": "The people of Adranum now opened their gates, and made their submission to Timoleon, relating with awe and wonder how, at the outset of the battle, the sacred doors of the temple flew open of their own accord, and the spear of the god was seen to quiver at the point, while his face was covered with a thick sweat.", "6001": "XIII.", "6002": "These portents, it seems, did not merely presage the victory, but also the subsequent events, of which this was the prosperous beginning.", "6003": "Immediately several cities sent ambassadors and joined Timoleon, as did also Mamercus the despot of Katana, a man of warlike tastes and great wealth, who made an alliance with him.", "6004": "But the most important thing of all was that Dionysius himself, who had now lost all hope of success, and was on the point of being starved out, despising Hiketes for being so shamefully beaten, but admiring Timoleon, sent to him and offered to deliver up both himself and the citadel to the Corinthians.", "6005": "Timoleon, accepting this unexpected piece of good fortune, sent Eukleides and Telemachus, Corinthian officers, into the citadel, and four hundred men besides, not all together nor openly, for that was impossible in the face of the enemy, who were blockading it, but by stealth, and in small bodies.", "6006": "So these soldiers took possession of the citadel, and the palace with all its furniture, and all the military stores.", "6007": "There were a good many horses, and every species of artillery and missile weapon.", "6008": "Also there were arms and armour for seventy thousand men, which had been stored up there for a long time, and Dionysius also had two thousand soldiers, all of whom he handed over to Timoleon with the rest of the fortress, and then, with his money and a few of his friends, he put to sea, and passed unnoticed through Hiketes's cruisers.", "6009": "He pro­ ceeded to the camp of Timoleon, appearing for the first time as a private person in great humility, and was sent to Corinth in one ship, and with a small allowance of money.", "6010": "He had been born and bred in the most splendid and greatest of empires, and had reigned over it for ten years, but for twelve more, since the time that Dion attacked him, he had constantly been in troubles and wars, during which all the cruelties which he had exercised on others, were more than avenged upon himself, by the miserable death of his wife and family, which are more particularly dwelt upon in the life of Dion.XIV.", "6011": "Now when Dionysius reached Corinth, there was no one in Greece who did not wish to see him and speak to him.", "6012": "Some, who rejoiced in his misfortunes, came to see him out of hatred, in order to trample on him now that he was down, while others sympathised with him in his change of fortune, reflecting on the inscrutable ways of the gods, and the uncertainty of human affairs.", "6013": "For that age produced nothing in nature or art so remarkable as that change of fortune which showed the man, who not long before had been supreme ruler of Sicily, now dining at Corinth at the cook's shop, lounging at the perfumer's, drinking at the taverns, instructing female singers, and carefully arguing with them about their songs in the theatre, and about the laws of music.", "6014": "Some thought that Dionysius acted thus from folly, and indolent love of pleasure, but others considered that it was in order that he might be looked down upon, and not be an object of terror or suspicion to the Corinthians, as he would have been if they thought that he ill brooked his reverse of fortune, and still nourished ambitious designs, and that his foolish and licentious mode of life was thus to be accounted for.", "6015": "XV.", "6016": "But for all that, certain of his sayings are remem­ bered, which sufficiently prove that he showed real great­ ness of mind in adapting himself to his altered circum­ stances.", "6017": "When he arrived at Leukas, which, like Syra­ cuse, was a Corinthian colony, he said that he was like a young man who has got into disgrace.", "6018": "They associate gaily with their brothers, but are ashamed to meet their fathers, and avoid them :", "6019": "and so he was ashamed to go to the parent city, but would gladly live there with them.", "6020": "Another time in Corinth, when some stranger coarsely jeered at the philosophic studies in which he used to delight when in power, and at last asked him what good he had obtained from the wisdom of Plato, “ Do you think,\" answered he, “ that I have gained nothing from Plato, when I bear my reverse of fortune as I do.\"", "6021": "When Aristoxenus, the musician, and some others asked him what fault he had found with Plato, and why, he answered that absolute power, amongst its many evils, was especially unfortunate in this, that none of a despot's so-called friends dare to speak their mind openly.", "6022": "And he himself, he said, had been by such men deprived of the friendship of Plato.", "6023": "A man, who thought himself witty, once tried to make a joke of Dionysius by shaking out his cloak, when he came into his presence, as is the custom before despots, to show that one has no concealed weapons ;", "6024": "but he repaid the jest by begging him to do it when he left him, that he might be sure that he had not stolen any of his property.", "6025": "Philip of Macedon once, when they were drinking to­ gether, made some sneering remark about the poetry and tragedies which Dionysius the elder had written, pretend­ ing to be at a loss to know how he found time for such pursuits;", "6026": "but Dionysius cleverly answered, “ He wrote them during the time which you and I, and all who are thought such lucky fellows, spend over our wine.", "6027": "\"", "6028": "Plato never saw Dionysius at Corinth, for he was dead at that time;", "6029": "but Diogenes of Sinope, when he first met him, said, “ How unworthily you live, Dionysius.\"", "6030": "Dionysius answered him, “ Thank you, Diogenes, for sympathising with my misfortunes.\" \" Why,\" said Dio­ genes ;", "6031": "\" do you suppose that I sympathise with you, and am not rather grieved that a slave like you, a man fit, like your father, to grow old and die on a miserable throne, should be living in luxury and enjoyment amongst us ? \"", "6032": "So, when I compare with these sayings of his the lamen­ tations which Philistius pours forth over the daughters of Leptines, that they had fallen from the glories of sovereign power into a humble station, they seem to me like the complainings of a woman who has lost her per­ fumes, her purple dresses or her jewels.", "6033": "These details, I think, for readers who are at leisure, are not foreign to the design of biography, and not with­ out value.", "6034": "XVI.", "6035": "If the fall of Dionysius seems strange, the good fortune of Timoleon was no less wonderful.", "6036": "Within fifty days of his landing in Sicily, he was master of the citadel of Syracuse, and sent back Dionysius to Peloponnesus.", "6037": "Encouraged by his success, the Corinthians sent him a reinforcement of two thousand hoplites and two hundred horse.", "6038": "These men reached Thurii, but there found it im­ possible to cross over into Sicily, as the Carthaginians held the sea with a great fleet.", "6039": "As it was necessary for them to remain there for a time, they made use of their leisure to perform a most excellent action.", "6040": "For the Thurians made an expedition against the Bruttii,* and meanwhile these men took charge of their city, and guarded it carefully and trustily as if it had been their own.", "6041": "Hiketes meanwhile was besieging the citadel of Syracuse, and preventing corn from being brought by sea to the Corinthians.", "6042": "He also obtained two strangers, whom he sent to assassinate Timoleon, who, trusting in the favour shown him by the gods, was living carelessly and unsuspectingly among the people of Adranum.", "6043": "These men, hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, came into the temple with daggers under their cloaks, and mingling with the crowd round the altar, kept edging towards him.", "6044": "They were just on the point of arranging their attack, when a man struck one of them on the head with his sword, and he fell.", "6045": "Neither the assailant nor the accomplice of the fallen man stood his ground, but the one with his sword still in his hand ran and took refuge on a high rock, while the other laid hold of the altar, and begged for pardon at Timoleon's hands if he revealed the whole plot.", "6046": "When assured of his safety he confessed that he and the man who had been killed had been sent thither to assassinate Timoleon.", "6047": "Meanwhile others brought back the man from the rock, who loudly declared that he had done no wrong, but had justly slain him in vengeance for his father, whom this wretch had killed at Leontini.", "6048": "Several of those present bore witness to the truth of his story, and they marvelled much at the ways of Fortune, how she makes the most incongruous elements work together to accomplish her purposes.", "6049": "The Corinthians honoured the man with a present of ten minæ, because he had co-ope­ rated with the guardian angel of Timoleon, and had put off the satisfaction of his private wrong until a time when it saved the life of the general.", "6050": "This good fortune excited men's feelings so that they guarded and reverenced Timoleon as a sacred person sent by heaven to restore the liberties of Sicily.", "6051": "XVII.", "6052": "When Hiketes failed in this attempt on Timoleon, and saw that many were joining him, he began to blame himself for only using the great Carthaginian force that was present by stealth, and as if he was ashamed of it, concealing his alliance and using them clandestinely, and he sent for Mago, their General, to come with all the force at his disposal.", "6053": "He sailed in with a formidable fleet of a hundred and fifty ships, and took possession of the harbour, disembarked sixty thousand troops, and encamped with them in the city of Syracuse, so that all men thought that the long-talked-of and expected subjugation of Sicily to the barbarian was imminent.", "6054": "For the Carthaginians during their endless wars in Sicily had never before taken Syra­ cuse, but now, by the invitation of the traitor .", "6055": "Hiketes, the city was turned into a barbarian camp.", "6056": "The Corinthians in the citadel were in a position of great danger and diffi­ culty, as they no longer had sufficient provisions, because the harbours were blockaded, and they perpetually had to divide their forces for skirmishes and battles at the walls, and to repel every device and method of attack known in sieges.", "6057": "XVIII.", "6058": "Timoleon, however, relieved them by sending corn from Katana in small fishing-smacks and boats, which, chiefly in stormy weather, stole in through the triremes of the barbarians when they were scattered by the roughness of the sea.", "6059": "Mago and Hiketes, perceiving this, determined to take Katana, from which place the besieged drew their supplies, and they sailed from Syra­ cuse with the best of their troops.", "6060": "The Corinthian Neon, the General in command of the besieged force, observing from the citadel that those of the enemy who were left behind kept careless guard, suddenly fell upon them, and, slaying some and routing the rest he made himself master of Achradina, which is the strongest and least assailable part of the city of Syracuse, which, as it were, consists of several towns.", "6061": "Being now in possession of abundance of provisions and money, he did not leave the place, and go back to the citadel on the promontory, but fortified the circuit of Achradina and held it conjointly with the Acropolis, with which he connected its fortifications.", "6062": "A horseman from Syracuse brought the news of the capture of Achradina to Mago and Hiketes when they were close to Katana.", "6063": "Alarmed at the news they returned with all speed, having neither taken the city they went to take, nor kept the one which they had taken.", "6064": "XIX.", "6065": "It may be doubted whether these actions owe more to fortune than to courage and conduct;", "6066": "but the next event can only be ascribed to fortune.", "6067": "The Corin­ thian troops at Thurii were in fear of the Carthaginian triremes under Hanno which were watching them, and as the sea had for many days been excessively rough, in con­ sequence of a gale, determined to march on foot through the Bruttii.", "6068": "Partly by persuasion and partly by force they made their way to Rhegium, while the sea was still very stormy.", "6069": "The Carthaginian Admiral, who no longer expected the Corinthians, and thought that he was waiting there to no purpose, persuaded himself that he had invented a masterpiece of deceit.", "6070": "He ordered his sailors to crown themselves with garlands, decked out his triremes with Greek shields and wreaths of palm, and set out for Syra cuse.", "6071": "As he passed the citadel they cheered loudly, and with uproarious merriment called out to the garrison that they had come back after a complete victory over the Corinthians, hoping by this means to dispirit the besieged.", "6072": "But while he was playing these silly tricks the Corinthians had reached Rhegium, and as no one disputed their pas­ sage, and the cessation of the gale had made the straits singularly smooth and calm, they embarked in the passage boats and what fishing-smacks were to be found, and crossed over into Sicily, so easily and in such calm weather that they were able to make their horses swim alongside of the vessels and tow them by their halters.", "6073": "XX.", "6074": "As soon as they had crossed, Timoleon met them, and at once obtained possession of Messina, and, after reviewing them, marched on Syracuse at once, confiding more in his good fortune and his former successes than in the number of his troops, which amounted to no more than four thousand.", "6075": "When Mago heard of this march, he was much disquieted, and his suspicions of his allies were increased by the following circumstance.", "6076": "In the marshes round the city, into which runs much fresh water from springs and rivers which find their way into the sea, there was a great quantity of eels, which afforded plenty of sport for those who cared to fish for them;", "6077": "and the mercenary soldiers on both sides used to meet and fish whenever there was a cessation of hostili­ ties.", "6078": "As they were all Greeks, and had no private grounds for hatred, they would cheerfully risk their lives in battle against each other, but during times of truce they conversed freely.", "6079": "So then, while engaged in fishing, they talked to one another, and admired the beauty of the sea, and the fine situation of the city.", "6080": "Then one of the Corinthian garrison said, \" Can it be that you, Greeks as you are, should be endeavouring to betray to the barbarian so great and beautiful a city as this, and that you should be trying to establish these base and cruel Carthaginians nearer to our country ?", "6081": "Rather ought you to wish that there were more Sicilies to act as bulwarks of Greece.", "6082": "Do you suppose that these men have gathered together their host from the pillars of Herakles and the Atlantic coast, and risked their lives at sea, merely to support the dynasty of Hiketes ?", "6083": "He, if he had the spirit of a real prince, never would have turned out his brethren, and invited the enemy into his native land, but would have made terms with Timoleon and the Corinthians, and been honoured accordingly.\"", "6084": "These words were noised abroad in the camp by the mercenaries, and gave Mago the pretext which he had long been waiting for, to abandon their cause on the plea of suspecting their fidelity.", "6085": "Wherefore, although Hiketes begged him to remain, and pointed out how far superior he was to the enemy, yet he, thinking that Timoleon's army surpassed his in courage and good fortune as much as his did in numbers, weighed anchor at once and sailed to Africa, letting Sicily slip through his fingers, to his great dis­ grace, for no assignable reason.", "6086": "XXI.", "6087": "On the next day appeared Timoleon with his troops in battle array.", "6088": "As soon as they learned their departure, and saw the harbour, they proceeded to mock at the cowardice of Mago, and they sent a crier round the city offering a reward to any one who would tell them to what place the Carthaginian force had run away.", "6089": "Nevertheless,", "6090": "Hiketes still showed a bold front, and did not relax his hold on the city, and, as the part which was in his possession was strong and hard of access, Timoleon divided his army, and himself led the assault on the most difficult side of the position, by the river Anapus, ordering another body, under Isias the Corin­ thian, to attack from Achradina.", "6091": "A third corps, consisting of the newly arrived reinforcement under Deinarchus and Demaretus were to attack Epipolæ.", "6092": "The assault took place simultaneously on all sides.", "6093": "The speedy rout of Hiketes and capture of the city may be justly ascribed to the skill of the General;", "6094": "but the fact that not one of the Corinthians was killed or wounded is due to Timo­ leon's good fortune, which seemed to vie with his courage and try to make those who read of his exploits wonder at their good luck more than their merit.", "6095": "In a few days not only was all Sicily and Italy ringing with his fame, but throughout Greece his great successes were known, and the city of Corinth, which scarcely thought that the expedition had reached Sicily, heard at the same time that the troops were safe and victorious, so prosperously did affairs turn out, and with such speed did fortune publish the glory of his deeds.", "6096": "XXII.", "6097": "Timoleon, having thus gained possession of the fortified citadel on the promontory, did not fall into the same snare as Dion, and was not moved to spare the place for the sake of its beautiful and costly architecture.", "6098": "Dion's jealousy of the people led him to distrust them, and proved his ruin ;", "6099": "but Timoleon took a very different course.", "6100": "He made proclamation that any Syracusan who chose might come with a crowbar and take part in the destruction of the despot's castle.", "6101": "When they had -all assembled, in order to mark that day and that proclama­ tion as the real beginning of liberty, they not only destroyed and subverted the castle, but also the houses and tombs of the despots.", "6102": "Timoleon at once had the place levelled, and built upon it courts of justice, delight­ ing the citizens by substituting a republic for a tyranny.", "6103": "Having taken the city, he was now at a loss for citizens, for some had been killed in the wars and revolu­ tions, and some had gone into exile to avoid the despots, so that the market-place of Syracuse was overrun with h erbage so deep and thick that horses were pastured on it, while the grooms lay on the grass near them.", "6104": "The other cities, except a very few, had become the haunts of deer and wild boars, and persons at leisure used to hunt them with dogs in the suburbs and round the walls.", "6105": "None of those who had taken refuge in the various forts and castles would return to the city, as they all felt a dread and hatred of public assemblies and politics, which had produced the greater part of the tyrants under whom they had suffered.", "6106": "In this difficulty it occurred to Timoleon and the Syracusans to apply to the Corinthians, and ask them to send out fresh colonists from Greece.", "6107": "Otherwise, they said, the land must lie uncultivated, and, above all, they were looking forward to a great war with Africa, as they heard that on Mago’s return the Carthaginians were so enraged at his failure, that, though he committed suicide to avoid a worse fate, they had crucified his dead body, and were collecting a great force, meaning next summer to invade Sicily.", "6108": "XXIII.", "6109": "When these letters from Timoleon reached them, together with ambassadors from the Syracusans, who besought them to take upon them the care of this their poor city, and once again become the founders of it, the Corinthians were not tempted by greed to take unfair advantages and seize the city for themselves, but first sent heralds to all the games held in honour of the gods throughout Greece, and to all places where people as­ sembled, to proclaim that the Corinthians, having abolished despotism at Syracuse and driven out the despot, invite all Syracusans and other Sicilian Greeks who choose to go and dwell in the city under free institutions, receiving an equal and just share of the land.", "6110": "Next they sent mes­ sengers to Asia Minor and the islands, wherever they heard that most of the scattered bands of exiles had settled, and invited them all to come to Corinth, as the Corin­ thians would at their own expense furnish them with vessels and commanders and a safe convoy to Syracuse.", "6111": "By these proclamations Corinth gained great and well­ deserved renown, seeing that she had forced Syracuse from its tyrants, saved it from the barbarians, and given back the country to its own citizens.", "6112": "The exiles, however, when assembled at Corinth found their numbers too small, and begged to be allowed to receive among them others from Corinth and the rest of Greece.", "6113": "When by this means they had raised their numbers to not less than ten thousand, they sailed to Syracuse.", "6114": "Many citizens from Italy and Sicily had already joined Timoleon, who, when he found their numbers (according to Athanis) amount to sixty thousand, divided the country among them, and sold the houses for a thousand talents, affording the original citizens the option of purchasing their own houses.", "6115": "At the same time, to relieve the financial distress of the State, with a view to the approaching war, he even sold all the statues.", "6116": "A vote of the assembly was taken about each one, and he was condemned, like a criminal on his trial.", "6117": "On this occasion they say that the Syracusans, though they condemned all the rest, decided on keeping that of the ancient prince Gelo, because they admired and respected him for his victory over the Carthaginians at Himera.", "6118": "XXIV.", "6119": "The life of Syracuse being rekindled by this influx of citizens from all quarters, Timoleon determined to set free the other cities also, and to exterminate the despots in Sicily.", "6120": "In the course of his campaigns against them he compelled Hiketes to renounce his alliance with the Carthaginians, to demolish his castle, and to live in Leontini as a private citizen.", "6121": "Leptines, the despot of Apollonia and of several smaller towns, fearing to be taken by him, surrendered.", "6122": "Timoleon spared his life, and sent him to Corinth, as he thought that it reflected credit upon his native city, that the despots of Sicily should be seen by all Greece living there as humble exiles.", "6123": "As for the soldiers whom he had in his pay, he determined not to keep them idle, but to support them by the plunder of an enemy's country.", "6124": "So while he himself returned to Syracuse, to superintend the reconstruction of the con­ stitution, and to assist the lawgivers Kephalus and Dionysius in framing the best form of polity, he sent the troops under Deinarchus and Demaretus to subdue the western portion of the island, which had fallen into the hands of the Carthaginians.", "6125": "Here they induced several cities to revolt from the barbarians, and not only gained abundant pay and plunder for themselves from their conquests, but were able to furnish funds for the approaching war.", "6126": "XXV.", "6127": "During this time the Carthaginian forces sailed to Lily bæum with seventy thousand men, two hundred ships of war, and a thousand transports carrying engines of war, four horse chariots, provisions, and other war material, as they meant no longer to use half measures, but at one swoop tc drive the Greeks out of Sicily.", "6128": "Their force indeed was sufficient for the conquest of the Sikeliot Greeks even if they had not been weakened by their internal strife.", "6129": "Hearing that their own part of the island was being ravaged, they at once in great anger marched to attack the Corinthians, under the command of Hasdrubal and Hamilcar.", "6130": "News of this quickly reached Syracuse, and the great numbers of the enemy caused such panic among the citizens, that, numerous as they were, Timo­ leon could only induce three thousand to get under arms and follow him.", "6131": "Besides these, there was the paid force, four thousand in number;", "6132": "and of these again about a thousand were overcome by their fears on the march, and went back, declaring that Timoleon could not be in his right senses, but must be insane to march with five thousand foot and a thousand horse to attack seventy thousand men, and to separate his force eight days' jour­ ney from Syracuse, in a place where there was no hope of shelter for the fugitives or of honourable burial for the dead.", "6133": "Timoleon treated it as an advantage that these men disclosed their cowardice before the day of battle.", "6134": "He encouraged the rest, and led them with all haste to the river Krimesus, where he heard that the Carthaginians were concentrating.", "6135": "XXVI.", "6136": "As he was mounting a hill, beyond which he expected to see the camp and army of the enemy, there met him some mules loaded with parsley.", "6137": "It occurred to the soldiers that this was a bad omen, for we generally use parsley for wreathing tombs;", "6138": "indeed from this practice arises the proverb, when a man is dangerously ill, that he is ready for his parsley.", "6139": "Wishing to rid them from this superstition and to stop their fears, Timoleon halted them, and made a suitable speech, pointing out that their crown of victory had come of its own accord into their hands before the battle, for this is the herb with which the Corinthians crown the victors at the Isthmian games, accounting it sacred and peculiar to their own country.", "6140": "For then parsley was used for the crown at the Isthmian games, as it is even to this day at those of Nemea, and the pine has only been lately introduced.", "6141": "So Timoleon, having addressed his soldiers, as has been said, first crowned himself with the parsley, and then his officers and men did so likewise.", "6142": "But the prophets per­ ceiving two eagles flying towards them, one of whom carried a snake in its talons, while the other flew along with loud and inspiriting cries, pointed them out to the soldiers, who all began to pray and invoke the gods.", "6143": "XXVII.", "6144": "The time of year was the beginning of summer, near the solstice at the end of the month Thargelion.*", "6145": "A thick mist rose from the river, and all the plain was con­ cealed in fog, so that nothing could be seen of the enemy, but only a confused murmur from the movement of that great host reached the hill.", "6146": "The Corinthians, when they had reached the summit, paused and piled their arms.", "6147": "Now the sun shone out, and the mist rose from the valley.", "6148": "Gathering together, it hung in clouds about the hill-tops, while below, the river Krimesus appeared, with the enemy crossing it.", "6149": "First went the four-horse chariots in terrible pomp, all drawn up in battle array, while next to them followed ten thousand hoplites with white shields.", "6150": "These they con­ jectured to be native Carthaginians by the splendour of their equipments and their slow and orderly march.", "6151": "Following these came the other nations, turbulently and confusedly struggling across.", "6152": "Timoleon, seeing that the river kept off the mass of the enemy, and allowed them to fight with just so many as they chose, pointed out to his soldiers how the enemy's array was broken by the stream, some having crossed, and some being still crossing.", "6153": "He ordered Demaretus to take the cavalry and charge the Carthaginians, to prevent their having time to form in order of battle.", "6154": "But he himself marched down to the plain, having drawn up his force with the other Sicilian Greeks and a few strangers on each of the wings, but with his Syracusans and the best of the paid force under his own command in the centre.", "6155": "For a short time he held back, watching the effect of the cavalry charge ;", "6156": "but seeing that they were unable to come to blows with the Carthaginians because of the chariots which careered about in front of their ranks, and that they constantly had to fall back to avoid their array being broken, and then to make short rushes as occasion served, he himself took his shield, and called to the infantry to follow him and be of good cheer.", "6157": "It seemed to them that his voice was more than man's, and louder than was his wont, either from their faculties being strained by the excitement of the contest, or else because, as most of them believed, some god shouted with him.", "6158": "Quickly they raised their war-cry in answer, and begged him to lead them on and wait no longer.", "6159": "Ordering the cavalry to ride round the line of chariots and attack the infantry in flank, he closed up the foremost ranks, and with the trumpet sounding the charge, attacked the Carthaginians.", "6160": "XXVIII.", "6161": "They manfully encountered his first assault, and being armed with iron cuirasses and brass helmets, and protected with large shields, they were able to with­ stand the thrust of the Greek spears.", "6162": "But when the struggle came to be decided with swords, where skill as well as strength was employed, there suddenly broke upon them from the mountains a terrible storm of thunder with vivid flashes of lightning .", "6163": "The mist, which had hitherto hung about the mountain peaks, now rolled down on to the field of battle, with violent gusts, hail, and rain.", "6164": "The Greeks received it on their backs, while the rain beat into the faces of the barbarians, and the lightning dazzled their eyes, as the storm swept violently along with frequent flashes from the clouds.", "6165": "These were great disadvantages, especially to inexperienced men, as the thunder and the pattering of the rain and hail on their armour prevented their hearing the commands of their officers.", "6166": "The Carthaginians, not being lightly equipped, but, as has been narrated, in complete armour, slipped on the muddy ground and were encumbered by the wet folds of their dress, which rendered them less active in the fight, and easily overcome by the Greeks, since when they fell in the slippery mud they could not rise again with their shields.", "6167": "The river Krimesus, which had been held up by the multitudes that were crossing it, was now swollen to a torrent by the rain, and the plain through which it runs, lying as it does under many steep glens and ravines, was now covered with streams not running in the ordinary channels, in which the Carthaginians stumbled and were hard bested.", "6168": "At last, from the violence of the storm, and the Greeks having cut to pieces their front rank, a chosen body of four hundred men, the great mass turned and fled.", "6169": "Many were overtaken and slain on the plain, and many more perished in the river, while the light-armed troops prevented most of them from gaining the shelter of the mountains.", "6170": "It was said that among the myriads of slain there were three thousand citizens of Carthage — a great loss and grief to that city, for they belonged to the noblest and richest classes;", "6171": "nor do we ever hear of so many native Carthaginians having perished in any one battle before this, as they generally make use of Libyan, Spanish and Numidian troops, so that in case of defeat the loss falls upon other nations.", "6172": "XXIX.", "6173": "The Greeks discovered the rank of the dead by the richness of their spoil;", "6174": "for when they collected the booty no account was taken of iron or brass, such an abundance was there of silver and gold;", "6175": "for they crossed the river and captured the enemy's camp.", "6176": "Of the captives, the greater part were stolen by the soldiers, and sold privately, but a body of five thousand was brought into the common stock.", "6177": "Two hundred chariots also were taken.", "6178": "The most glorious and magnificent spectacle of all was the tent of Timoleon, round which booty of every kind was piled up in heaps, among which were a thousand corslets of exqui­ site workmanship, and ten thousand shields.", "6179": "As they were but few to gather the plunder of so many, and as they fell in with such riches, it was only on the third day that they managed to erect a trophy of their victory.", "6180": "Together with the despatch announcing his success, Timoleon sent home to Corinth the finest of the arms and armour, desiring to make his country envied by all men, when they should see, in that alone of all Greek cities, that the most important shrines were not adorned with Grecian spoils, nor with offerings obtained by the slaughter of men of their own race and blood, dismal memorials at best, but with spoils of the barbarian, whose inscriptions bore noble testimony to the justice, as well as the courage of the victors, telling how the Corinthians and their general, Timo­ leon, having freed the Greeks who dwell in Sicily from the yoke of Carthage, set up these thank-offerings to the gods.", "6181": "XXX.", "6182": "After the victory he left the paid force in the enemy's country, to ravage and plunder the Carthaginian dominions, and himself proceeded to Syracuse.", "6183": "He now ordered out of the island those mercenary troops by whom he had been deserted before the battle;", "6184": "and even forced them to quit Sicily before sunset.", "6185": "These men crossed into Italy and perished there at the hands of the Bruttians, who broke their word to them and betrayed them.", "6186": "This was the penalty which Heaven imposed on them for their desertion.", "6187": "But Mamercus, the despot of Catana, and Hiketes, either through disgust at Timoleon's successes, or else fearing him as a man not likely to keep faith with despots, made an alliance with Carthage, as they said that the Cartha­ ginians, unless they wished to be utterly driven out of Sicily, must send a competent force and a general.", "6188": "Gisco the son of Hanno sailed thither with seventy ships, and also with a force of Greek mercenary soldiers, whom the Carthaginians had never used before;", "6189": "but now they were full of admiration for the Greeks, as being the most warlike and invincible of men.", "6190": "Having effected a junction of their forces in the territory of Messina, they cut to pieces a body of four hundred foreign soldiers whom Timoleon sent against them ;", "6191": "amd in the Carthaginian dominion they laid an ambush near the place called Hietæ, and cut off the hired troops of Euthymus the Leukadian.", "6192": "Both these circumstances made the good fortune of Timoleon more renowned.", "6193": "For these were some of the men who under Philomelus of Phokis and Ono­ marchus sacrilegiously took Delphi, and shared in the plunder of the temple.", "6194": "As all men loathed them and shrank from them as from men under a curse, they wandered about Peloponnesus until Timoleon, being unable to get any other soldiers, enlisted them in his service .", "6195": "When they reached Sicily, they were victorious in every battle which they fought where he was present.", "6196": "After the most important struggles of the war were over, they were sent to reinforce others, and so perished and came to nought;", "6197": "and not all at once, but piecemeal, as if their avenging fate had given way to Timoleon's good fortune for a season, lest the good should suffer from the punishment of the wicked.", "6198": "Thus the kindness of the gods towards Timoleon was no less seen and wondered at in his failures than in his successes.", "6199": "XXXI.", "6200": "The people of Syracuse were much nettled by the insulting jests passed upon them by the despots.", "6201": "Mamercus, who plumed himself on his poems and trage­ dies, gave himself great airs after conquering the mercen­ aries, and when he hung up their shields as offerings to the gods, he inscribed this insolent elegiac couplet upon them. “", "6202": "These, with purple wrought, and ivory, gold, and amber, We with our simple shields conquered and laid in the dust.\"", "6203": "After these events, while Timoleon was on a campaign in the direction of Kalauria, Hiketes invaded the Syracusan territory, did much damage and insult, and retired loaded with spoil, past the very walls of Kalauria, despising Timoleon, who had but a small force with him.", "6204": "He, however, let him pass, but then pursued with his cavalry and light troops.", "6205": "Hiketes, perceiving this, halted after crossing the river Damyrias, and drew up his troops along the farther bank to dispute the passage, encouraged to do so by the different nature of the ford, and the steepness of the hills on either hand.", "6206": "Now a strange rivalry and contest arose among Timoleon's captains, which delayed their onset.", "6207": "No one chose to let any one else lead the way against the enemy, but each man wished to be first;", "6208": "so that their crossing was conducted in a disorderly fashion, each man trying to push by and outstrip the rest.", "6209": "Here­ upon Timoleon, wishing to choose the leaders by lot, took a ring from each.", "6210": "These he threw into his own cloak, mixed them up, and showed the first which he drew out, which happened to be engraved with the figure of a trophy of victory.", "6211": "When the young men saw this they raised a shout of joy, and would not wait for the rest to be drawn, but each man, as fast as he could, rode through the river and set upon the enemy.", "6212": "Their assault was irresistible ;", "6213": "the enemy fled, all of them throwing away their shields, and with the loss of a hundred men.XXXII.", "6214": "Soon after this, while Timoleon was campaign­ ing in the Leontine country, he took Hiketes alive, with his son Eupolemus, and Euthymus, the commander of his cavalry.", "6215": "The soldiers seized and bound them, and led them into Timoleon's presence.", "6216": "Hiketes and his son were put to death as despots and traitors;", "6217": "nor did Euthymus meet with compassion, though he was a man of renown in athletic contest, and of great personal bravery, because of a scoffing speech of which he was accused against the Corinthians.", "6218": "The story goes that he was addressing the people of Leontini on the subject of the Corinthian in­ vasion, and told them that there was nothing to be alarmed at if “ Corinthian ladies have come out from home.", "6219": "*", "6220": "Thus it is that most people seem to suffer more from hard words than hard deeds, and are more excited by insult than by actual hurt.", "6221": "What we do to our enemies in war is done of necessity, but the evil we say of them seems to spring from an excess of spite.", "6222": "XXXIII.", "6223": "On Timoleon's return the Syracusans brought the family and daughters of Hiketes before the public assembly for trial, and condemned them to death..", "6224": "And this, methinks, is the most heartless of Timoleon's actions, that for want of a word from him these poor creatures should have perished.", "6225": "He seems not to have interfered, and to have let the people give full vent to their desire to avenge Dion, who dethroned Dionysius.", "6226": "For Hiketes was the man who threw Dion's wife Arete alive into the sea, with her sister Aristomache and her little son, as is told in the Life of Dion.", "6227": "XXXIV.", "6228": "After this he marched against Mamercus at Catana.", "6229": "He beat him in a pitched battle near the river Abolus, routing him with a loss of two thousand men, no small part of whom belonged to the Phœnician contingent under Gisco.", "6230": "Hereupon, at the request of the Carthaginians, he made peace, stipulating that they should hold the country beyond the river Lykus, and that those who wished should be allowed to have it and go to reside at Syracuse, with their families and property, and also that they should give up their alliance with the despots.", "6231": "In despair at this Mamercus sailed to Italy, to try to bring the Lucanians against Timoleon and the Syracusans;", "6232": "but he was deserted by his followers, who turned their ships back, sailed to Syracuse, and surrendered Catana to Timoleon.", "6233": "Mamercus now was forced to take refuge in Messina with Hippo, the despot there.", "6234": "But Timoleon came and besieged it both by sea and land.", "6235": "Hippo endeavoured to escape on a ship, and was taken.", "6236": "The people of Messina, to whom he was delivered up, brought every one, even the boys from school, into the theatre, to witness that most salutary spectacle, a tyrant meeting with his deserts.", "6237": "He was put to death with torture;", "6238": "but Mamercus surrendered himself to Timoleon on condition that he should have a fair trial before the people of Syracuse, and that Timoleon should say nothing against him.", "6239": "When he was brought to Syracuse he was brought before the people, and tried to deliver a long premeditated speech to them, but meeting with interruptions and seeing that the assembly was inexorable he flung away his cloak and rushed across the theatre, striking his head against a stone step with the intention of killing himself.", "6240": "How­ ever he failed, and paid the penalty of his crimes by suffer­ ing the death of a pirate.", "6241": "XXXV.", "6242": "In this fashion the despotisms were put down by Timoleon, and the wars finished.", "6243": "The whole island, which had become a mere wilderness through the constant wars, and was grown hateful to the very natives, under his administration became so civilized and desirable a country that colonists sailed to it from those very places to which its own citizens had formerly betaken themselves to escape from it.", "6244": "For Akragas and Gela, large cities, which after the war with Athens had been destroyed by the Carthaginians, wore now repeopled;", "6245": "the former colonists led by Megllus and Pheristus, from Elea on the south coast of Italy, and the latter by a party led by Gorgus, who sailed from Keos and collected together the former citizens.", "6246": "When these cities were being reorganised Timoleon not only afforded them peace and safety, but also gave them great assistance, and showed so great an interest in them as to be loved and respected by them as their real Founder.", "6247": "The other cities also all of them looked upon him with the same feelings, so that no peace could be made by them, no laws established, no country divided among settlers, no constitutional changes made that seemed satisfactory, unless he had a hand in them, and arranged them just as an architect, when a building is finished, gives some graceful touches which adorn the whole.", "6248": "XXXVI.", "6249": "There were many Greeks, in his lifetime, who became great, and did great things, such as Timotheus, and Agesilaus, and Pelopidas, and Timoleon's great model, Epameinondas.", "6250": "But these men's actions produced a glory which was involved in much strain and toil, and some of their deeds have incurred censure, and even been repented of.", "6251": "Whereas those of Timoleon, if we except the terrible affair of his brother, have nothing in them to which we cannot apply, like Timaeus, that verse of Sophocles­ “", "6252": "Ye gods, what Venus or what grace divine Took part in this.”", "6253": "For as in the poetry of Antimachus, and the paintings of Dionysius, the Kolophonians, we find a certain vigour and power, yet think them forced in expression, and produced with much labour, while the paintings of Nikomachus and the verses of Homer, besides their other graces and merits, have the charm of seeming to have been composed easily and without effort, so also the campaigns of Timoleon, when compared with the laborious and hardly contested ones of Epameinondas or Agesilaus, seem to have, besides their glory, a wonderful ease, which property is not so much to be attributed to good luck as to prosperous valour.", "6254": "He, however, ascribed all his successes to Fortune, for in writing to his friends at home, and in his public speeches to the Syracusans, he frequently expressed his thankful­ ness to this goddess, who, having determined to save Sicily, had chosen to ascribe to him the credit of doing it.", "6255": "In his house he built a chapel to Automatia,—the goddess under whose auspices blessings and glory came as it were of themselves.", "6256": "To her he offered sacrifices, and conse­ crated his house to her.", "6257": "He lived in a house which the Syracusans had bestowed upon him as a special prize for his successes as general, and also the most beautiful and pleasant country seat, where indeed he spent most of his leisure time with his wife and children, whom he had sent for from Corinth.", "6258": "For he never returned to Corinth, nor mixed himself up in the troubles of Greece, nor did he expose himself to the hatred of political faction, which is the rock upon which great generals commonly split, in their insatiate thirst for honour and power;", "6259": "but he re­ mained in Sicily, enjoying the blessings of which he was the author;", "6260": "the greatest of which was to see so many cities, and so many tens of thousands, all made happy and prosperous by his means.", "6261": "XXXVII.", "6262": "But since, as Simonides says, all larks must have crests, and all republics sycophants, so two of the popular leaders, Laphystius and Demaenetus, attacked Timoleon.", "6263": "When Laphystius was insisting on his giving bail for some lawsuit, he would not permit the people to hoot at him or stop him ;", "6264": "for he said that all his labours and dangers had been endured to obtain for every Syra­ cusan the right of appealing to the laws.", "6265": "Demaenetus made many attacks in the public assembly on his general­ ship ;", "6266": "but he made him no answer except to declare his thankfulness to the gods for having granted his prayer that he might see all Syracusans in possession of liberty of speech.", "6267": "Though he confessedly had performed the greatest and most glorious actions of any Greek of his time, and though he had gained the glory of having alone done that which the orators in their speeches at great public meetings used to urge the entire nation to attempt, he was fortunately removed from the troubles which fell upon ancient Greece, and saved from defiling his hands with the blood of his countrymen.", "6268": "His courage and conduct were shown at the expense of barbarians and despots;", "6269": "his mildness of temper was experienced by Greeks;", "6270": "he was able to erect the trophies for most of his victories, without causing tears and mourning to the citizens;", "6271": "but nevertheless, within eight years, he restored Sicily to its native inha­ bitants, freed from the scourges which had afflicted it for so long a time and seemed so ineradicable.", "6272": "When ad­ vanced in years he suffered from a dimness of sight, which soon became total blindness.", "6273": "He had done nothing to cause it, and had met with no accident, but the disease was congenital, and in time produced a cataract.", "6274": "Many of his relatives are said in a similar fashion to have lost their sight when advanced in years.", "6275": "But Albania tells us that during the war with Hippo and Mamercus, at the camp at Mylae, his eyesight became affected, and that this was noticed by all, but that he did not on that account desist from the siege, but persevered in the war, till he captured the two despots;", "6276": "but as soon as he returned to Syracuse he resigned his post of commander-in-chief, begging the citizens to allow him to do so, as the war had been brought to a happy conclusion.", "6277": "XXXVIII.", "6278": "That he endured his misfortune without re­ pining is not to be wondered at;", "6279": "but one must admire the respect and love shown him when blind by the people of Syracuse.", "6280": "They constantly visited him, and brought with them any strangers that might be staying with them, both to his town and country house, to show them their benefactor, glorying in the fact that he had chosen to spend his life amongst them, and had scorned the magni­ ficent reception which his exploits would have ensured him, had he returned to Greece.", "6281": "Of the many important tributes to his worth none was greater than the decree of the Syracusans that whenever they should be engaged in war with foreign tribes, they would have a Corinthian for their general.", "6282": "Great honour was also reflected upon him by their conduct in the public assembly;", "6283": "for, though they managed ordinary business by themselves, on the occasion of any important debate they used to call him in.", "6284": "Then he would drive through the market-place into the theatre;", "6285": "and when the carriage in which he sat was brought in, the people would rise and salute him with one voice.", "6286": "Having returned their greeting, and allowed a short time for their cheers and blessings, he would hear the disputed point debated, and then give his opinion.", "6287": "When this had been voted upon his servants would lead his carriage out of the theatre, while the citizens, cheer­ ing and applauding him as he went, proceeded to despatch their other business without him.", "6288": "XXXIX.", "6289": "Cherished in his old age with such respect and honour, as the common father of his country, Timoleon at length, after a slight illness, died.", "6290": "Some time was given for the Syracusans to prepare his funeral, and for neighbours and foreigners to assemble, so that the cere­ mony was performed with great splendour.", "6291": "The bier, magnificently adorned, and carried by young men chosen by lot, passed over the place where once the castle of Dionysius had been pulled down.", "6292": "The procession was joined by tens of thousands of men and women, whose appearance was gay enough for a festival, for they all wore garlands and white robes.", "6293": "Their lamentations and tears mingled with their praises of the deceased showed that they were not performing this as a matter of mere outward respect and compliance with a decree, but that they expressed real sorrow and loving gratitude.", "6294": "At last, when the bier was placed upon the pyre, Demetrius, the loudest voiced of the heralds at that time, read aloud the following :", "6295": "­\"", "6296": "The Syracusan people solemnise, at the cost of two hundred minæ, the funeral of this man, the Corinthian Timoleon, son of Timodemus.", "6297": "They have passed a vote to honour him for all future time with festival matches in music, horse and chariot races, and gymnastics, because, after having put down the despots, subdued the foreign enemy, and recolonized the greatest among the ruined cities, he restored to the Sicilian Greeks their constitution and laws.\"", "6298": "*They buried him in the market-place, and afterwards surrounded the spot with a colonnade, and built a palastra in it for the young men to practise in, and called it the Timoleonteum;", "6299": "and, living under

patrician families of Rome.", "6302": "Those who tell us that King Numa was a pupil of Pytha­ goras, narrate also that Mamercus, the founder of this family, was a son of that philosopher, who for his singular grace and subtlety of speech was surnamed AEmilius.", "6303": "Most of the members of the family who gained distinction by their valour, were also fortunate, and even the mishap of Lucius Paullus at Cannæ bore ample testimony to his prudence and valour.", "6304": "For since he could not prevail upon his colleague to refrain from battle, he, though against his better judgment, took part in it, and disdained to fly;", "6305": "but when he who had begun the contest fled from it, he stood firm, and died fighting the enemy.", "6306": "This Æmilius had a daughter, who married Scipio the Great, and a son who is the subject of this memoir.", "6307": "Born in an age which was rendered illustrious by the valour and wisdom of many distinguished men, he eclipsed them all, though he followed none of the studies by which young men were then gaining them­ selves a reputation, but chose a different path.", "6308": "He did not practise at the bar, nor could he bring himself to court the favour of the people by the greetings, embraces, and professions of friendship to which most men used to stoop to obtain popularity.", "6309": "Not that he was by nature unfitted for such pursuits;", "6310": "but he considered it better to gain a reputation for courage, justice, and truth, in which he soon outshone his contemporaries.", "6311": "III.", "6312": "The first honourable office for which he was a candidate was that of aedile, for which he was elected against twelve others, who, they say, all afterwards became consuls.", "6313": "When chosen a priest of the college of Augurs, whom the Romans appoint to watch and register the omens derived from the flight of birds, or the signs of the heavens, he so carefully applied himself to learning the ancient customs and religion of his ancestors, that the priesthood, hitherto merely considered as an empty title of honour and sought after for that reason only, became regarded as the sublimest craft of all, confirming the saying of the philosophers, that holiness consists in a knowledge of how to serve the gods.", "6314": "Under him everything was done with both zeal and skill.", "6315": "He neglected all other duties, when engaged upon these, neither omitting any part nor adding any, arguing with his companions, when they blamed him for his care about trifles, that though a man might think that heaven was merciful and forgiving of negligences, yet that habitual disregard and overlooking of such points was dangerous for the state, seeing that no one ever begins till some flagrant breach of the law to disturb the constitution, but those who are careless of accuracy in small things soon begin to neglect the most important.", "6316": "He was no less severe in exacting and maintaining military discipline than with religious observances, never forget­ ting the general in the demagogue, nor, as many then did, endeavouring to make his first command lead to a second by indulgence and affability to his troops, but, like a priest expounding mysteries, he carefully taught them everything requisite for a campaign, and, by his severity to the careless and disobedient, restored the former glory to his country;", "6317": "for he seemed to think victory over the enemy was merely a subordinate inci­ dent in the great work of disciplining his fellow-citizens.", "6318": "IV.", "6319": "When the

defeated the barbarians in two pitched battles, with a loss of nearly thirty thousand.", "6322": "The credit of this exploit belongs peculiarly to the general, who made such use of the advantage of the ground, and the ford over a certain river, as to render victory an easy matter for his soldiers.", "6323": "He also took two hundred and fifty cities, which opened their gates to him.", "6324": "Having estab­ lished a lasting peace in his province he returned to Rome, not having gained a penny by his command.", "6325": "For he was careless of money-making, though he spent his fortune without stint;", "6326": "and it was so small, that after his death it hardly sufficed to make up the dower of his wife.", "6327": "V.", "6328": "He married Papiria, the daughter of Papirius Maso, a consular;", "6329": "and after living with her for a considerable time, divorced her, though he had by her an illustrious family, for she was the mother of the renowned Scipio, and of Fabius Maximus.", "6330": "No reason for their separation has come down to us, but there is much truth in that other story about a divorce, that some Roman put away his wife;", "6331": "and his friends then

incompatible tempers and habits, though unnoticed by the world at large, does gradually produce between married people breaches which cannot be healed.", "6337": "\"So Æmilius put away Papiria, and married again.", "6338": "By his second marriage he had two sons, whom he kept at home, but those by the former marriage he had adopted into the greatest and noblest families of Rome, the elder into

of Cato, the other Ælius Tubero, an excellent man, who supported his poverty more gloriously than any other Roman.", "6340": "There were sixteen in the family, all Ælii;", "6341": "and one small house and estate sufficed for them all, with their numerous offspring and their wives, among whom was the daughter of our Æmilius, who, though her father had twice been consul and twice triumphed, was not ashamed of the poverty of her husband, but was proud of the virtue that kept him poor.", "6342": "But nowadays brothers and kinsmen, unless their inheritances be divided by moun­ tain ranges, rivers,

opposite the Libyan coast.", "6346": "At this time they took also to seafaring, and, sailing forth in small piratical ships, they plundered and preyed upon commerce as far as the columns of Heracles.", "6347": "On Æmilius’s approach they op­ posed him, forty thousand strong;", "6348": "but he, with only eight thousand, attacked five-fold his own numbers, put them to rout, and having chased them into their fast­ nesses, offered them reasonable and moderate terms;", "6349": "for it was not the Roman policy utterly to exterminate the Ligurian race, but to leave them as an outwork to protect Italy against the constant movements of the Gaulish tribes.", "6350": "Trusting in Æmilius they surrendered all their ships and their cities into his hands.", "6351": "He did the cities no hurt, or at most destroyed the walls, and restored them to the owners, but he carried off all the ships, leaving them nothing larger than a six-oared boat;", "6352": "while he set free the numerous captives which they had taken both by sea and land, among whom were some Roman citizens.", "6353": "These were his glorious exploits in that consulship.", "6354": "Afterwards he frequently let his desire for re-election be seen, and once became a candidate, but as he failed and was passed over, he thenceforth remained in retirement, occupying himself with religious matters, and teaching his children not only the Roman education in which he himself had been brought up, but also the Greek, and that more carefully.", "6355": "For not only were the grammarians, philoso­ pliers, and orators

Roman people, and that, too, with only the remnants of his father's routed forces;", "6363": "for they did not know that Philip, after his defeat, had greatly increased the power and efficiency of the

Alexander, and who obtained for himself and his family the title of king, had a ion named Demetrius, whose son was Antigonus, called Gonatas.", "6367": "His son again was named Demetrius, who, after reigning some short time, died, leaving a son Philip, a mere boy in years.", "6368": "Fearing disturbance during his minority, the Macedonian nobles made Antigonus, a cousin of the deceased, Regent and commander-in-chief, associating with him in this office the mother of Philip.", "6369": "Finding him a moderate and useful ruler, they soon gave him the title of king.", "6370": "He had the soubriquet of Doson, as though he were only a pro­ miser, not a performer of his engagements.", "6371": "After this man, Philip came to the throne, and, while yet a boy, dis­ tinguished himself in all that becomes a king, so as to raise men's hopes that he might restore the empire of Macedon to its ancient glory, and be alone able to check the power of Rome, which now menaced the whole world.", "6372": "Defeated in a great battle at Scotussa by Titus Flamininus, he bent to the storm, surrendered all that he had to the Romans, and was thankful for mild treatment.", "6373": "After­ wards, chafing at his subordinate position, and thinking that to reign dependent on the pleasure of the Romans was more worthy of a slave who cares only for sensual pleasure, than of a man of spirit, he gave his whole mind up to preparations for war, and secretly and unscrupulously collected materials for it.", "6374": "Of the cities in his kingdom, he allowed those on the sea-coast and the main roads to fall into partial decay, so that his power might be despised, while he collected great forces in the interior.", "6375": "Here he filled all the outposts, fortresses, and cities with arms, money, and men fit for service, and thus trained the nation for war, yet kept his preparations secret.", "6376": "In his arsenals were arms for thirty thousand men;", "6377": "eight million medimni of corn were stored in his fortresses, and such a mass of treasure as would pay an army of ten thousand men for ten years.", "6378": "But before he could put all these forces in motion and begin the great struggle, he died of grief and remorse, for he had, as he admitted, unjustly put his other son Demetrius to death on the calumnies of one far worse than he was.", "6379": "Perseus, the survivor, in­ herited his father's hatred of the Romans with his kingdom, but was not of a calibre to carry out his designs, as his small and degraded mind was chiefly possessed by avarice.", "6380": "He is said not even to have been legitimate, but that Philip's wife obtained him when a baby from his real mother, a midwife of Argos, named Gnathaina, and palmed him off upon her husband.", "6381": "And this seems to have been one reason for her putting Demetrius to death, for fear that if the family had a legitimate heir, this one's bastardy would be discovered.", "6382": "IX.", "6383": "However, low-born and low-minded though he was, yet having by the force of circumstances drifted into war, he held his own and maintained himself for a long time against the Romans, defeating generals of consular rank with great armies, and even capturing some of them.", "6384": "Publius Licinius, who first invaded Macedonia, was defeated in a cavalry engagement, with a loss of two thousand five hundred brave men killed, and six hundred prisoners.", "6385": "Perseus next by a sudden attack made himself master of the Roman naval station at Oreus, took twenty store ships, sunk the rest, which were loaded with grain, and took also four quinqueremes.*", "6386": "He fought also a second battle, in which he drove back the consular general Hostilius, who was trying to invade Macedonia near Elimiæ ;", "6387": "and when he tried to steal in through Thessaly, he again offered battle, which the Roman declined.", "6388": "As an accessory to the war he now made a campaign against the Dardans, as if affecting to despise the Romans and to be at leisure.", "6389": "Here he cut to pieces ten thousand of the bar­ barians, and carried off much plunder.", "6390": "He also had secret negotiations with the Gauls who dwell near the Ister, called Basternæ, a nation of warlike horsemen, and by means of Genthius their king he endeavoured to induce the Illyrians to take part in the war.", "6391": "There was even a report that the barbarians had been induced by his bribes to march through the southern part of Gaul beside the Adriatic, and so invade Italy.X.", "6392": "The Romans, when they learnt all this, determined that they would disregard political influence in their choice of a general, and choose some man of sense and capable of undertaking great operations.", "6393": "Such a one was Paulus Æmilius, a man of advanced age, being about sixty years old, but still in full vigour of body, and surrounded by kinsmen, grown-up sons, and friends, who all urged him to listen to the appeal of his country and be consul.", "6394": "He at first treated the people with little respect, and shunned their eager professions of zeal, on the plea that he did not wish for the command;", "6395": "but as they waited on him daily, and called for him to come into the forum and shouted his name, he was at length prevailed upon.", "6396": "When a candidate, he seemed to enter the field not with a view to getting office, but to giving victory and strength in battle to his fellow-citizens;", "6397": "with such zeal and conn­ dence did they unanimously elect him consul for the second time, not permitting lots to be cast for provinces by the two consuls, as is usual, but at once decreeing to him the management of the Macedonian war.", "6398": "It is said that when he was named general against Perseus, he was escorted home in triumph by the people en masse, and found his daughter Tertia, who was quite a little child, in tears.", "6399": "He embraced her, and asked her why she was crying;", "6400": "and she, throwing her arms round him and kissing him, said, \" Do you not know,.", "6401": "father, that our Per­ seus is dead ?\" meaning a little dog which she had brought up, which was so named.", "6402": "AEmilius said, \" May this bring good luck, my daughter :", "6403": "I accept the omen.\"", "6404": "This story Cicero the orator tells in his book on Divination.", "6405": "XI.", "6406": "It being the custom that the consuls-elect should return thanks, and make a gracious speech to the people from the rostrum, Æmilius called together the people and said that he had sought for his former consulship because he wanted office, but for this one because they wanted a general:", "6407": "wherefore he felt no gratitude towards them, but would lay down his consulship if they thought that they would succeed better in the war under some one else;", "6408": "but if they felt confidence in him, he asked them not to interfere with his acts as general, nor to gossip about him, but to furnish quietly what was wanted for the war;", "6409": "for if they tried to command their commander they would afford even a more sorry spectacle than they had already done.", "6410": "By these words he made the citizens stand greatly in awe of him, and gave them great expectations of what he would effect, while all rejoiced that they had passed over those who used to flatter them, and had chosen a general of independence and spirit.", "6411": "So much did the Roman people respect bravery and honour, because it led to conquests, and to making them masters of the world.", "6412": "XII.", "6413": "I consider it to have been by divine favour that AEmilius Paulus on starting for his campaign met with such a fortunate and calm voyage, and so speedily and safely arrived at the camp;", "6414": "but as to the war itself, and his conduct of it, accomplished as it was partly by swift daring, partly by wise dispositions, by the valour of friends, confidence in the midst of dangers, and reliance on sound plans, I cannot tell of any glorious and distin- guished exploit, which, as in the case of other generals, owed its success to his good fortune;", "6415": "unless, indeed, any one should count as good fortune for Æmilius the avarice of Perseus, which destroyed the great and well-founded hopes of the Macedonians in the war, and brought them to ruin by the meanness of their chief.", "6416": "At his request there came a force of Basternæ, a thousand horse and ten thousand light troops who fought with them, all mercenary Koldiers—men who knew nothing of tilling the soil, or of sailing the sea, who did not live from the produce of their flocks, but who studied one art and business solely, ever to fight and overcome their antagonists.", "6417": "So, when in the camp at Mædike, these men mixed with the king's troops, tall in their person, admirable in their drill, boastful and haughty in their defiance of the foe, they gave confidence to the Macedonians, and made them think that the Romans never could withstand their attack, but would be terrified at their appearance and march, outlandish and ferocious as it was.", "6418": "But Perseus, now that he had got such auxiliaries as these, and put his men into such heart, because he was asked for a thousand staters for each officer, became bewildered at the amount of the sum which he would have to pay, and his meanness prevailing over his reason, refused their offers, and broke off the alliance, as if he had been steward of his kingdom for the Romans rather than fighting against them, and had to give an exact account of his expenses in the war to his enemies;", "6419": "though he might have been taught by them, who had besides other war materials, a hundred thousand soldiers collected together ready for use.", "6420": "Yet he, when engaged in war with such a power as this, where such great forces were kept on foot to contend with him, kept 1 doling out and sparing his money as if it were not his own.", "6421": "And still he was not a Lydian or Phœnician, but a man who from his descent ought to have had a share of the spirit of Philip and Alexander, who made all their conquests by the principle that empire may be gained by gold, not gold by empire.", "6422": "It used, indeed, to be a proverb that \"It is not Philip, but Philip's gold that takes the cities of Greece.\"", "6423": "Alexander, too, when begin­ ning his Indian campaign, seeing the Macedonians labori.", "6424": "ously dragging along the rich and unwieldy plunder of the Persians, first burned all the royal carriages, and then persuaded the soldiers to do the like with their own, and start for the war as light as if they had shaken off a burden.", "6425": "But Perseus, when spending his own money to defend himself, his children, and his kingdom, rather than sacrifice a little and win, preferred to be taken to Rome with many others, a rich captive, and show the Romans how much he had saved for them.", "6426": "XIII.", "6427": "For not only did he dismiss the Gauls and break his word to them, but after inducing Genthius the Illyrian to take part in the war for a bribe of three hundred talents, he lodged the money with that prince's envoys, all counted, and let them put their seals upon it.", "6428": "Genthius then thinking that he had got what he asked, did a wicked and impious deed in seizing and throwing into prison some Roman ambassadors who were sent to him.", "6429": "Perseus, thinking that Genthius no longer needed money to make him hostile to Rome, since he had given him such a pledge of his hatred of it, and had involved himself in war with it by such a crime, deprived the poor man of his three hundred talents, and shortly afterwards looked calmly on while he and his family were plucked out of their kingdom, like birds out of a nest, by Lucius Anicius, who was sent with an army against him.", "6430": "AEmilius, when he came to contend with such a rival as this, despised him as a man, but was surprised at the force which he had at his disposal.", "6431": "These were four thousand cavalry, and of infantry soldiers of the Macedonian phalanx nearly forty thousand.", "6432": "Encamped by the sea-shore, near the skirts of Mount Olympus, on ground nowhere accessible, and strongly fortified by himself with outworks and defences of wood, Perseus lived in careless security, thinking that by time and expense he should wear out Æmilius’s attack.", "6433": "But he, while he busied his mind with every possible mode of assault, perceiving that his army in consequence of its past want of discipline was impatient, and usurped the general'a province by proposing all sorts of wild schemes, severely reprimanded the soldiers, and ordered them not to meddle with what was not their concern, but only take care that they and their arms were ready, and to use their swords as Romans should when their general should give the word.", "6434": "He ordered the night sentries to go on guard without their spears, that they might be more attentive and less inclined to sleep, having no arms to defend themselves against the enemy.", "6435": "XIV.", "6436": "The army was chiefly troubled by want of water;", "6437": "for only a very little bad water ran or rather dripped out of a spring near the sea.", "6438": "Æmilius perceiving that Olympus, immediately above him, was a large and well­ wooded mountain, and guessing from the greenness of the foliage that it must contain some springs which had their courses underground, dug many pits and wells along the skirts of the mountain, which immediately were filled with pure water, which by the pressure above was driven into these vacant spaces.", "6439": "Yet some say that there are no hidden fountains of water, lying ready in such places as these, and say that it is not because they are dug out or broken into that they flow, but that they have their origin and cause in the saturation of the surrounding earth which becomes saturated by its close texture and coldness, acting upon the moist vapours, which when pressed together, low down turn into water.", "6440": "For just as women's breasts are not receptacles full of milk ready to flow, but change the nutriment which is in them into milk, and so supply it, so also the cold places which are full of springs have no water concealed in them, nor any such reservoirs as would be needed to send out deep rivers from any fixed point, but by their pressure they convert the air and vapour which is in them into water.", "6441": "At any rate, those places which are dug over break more into springs and run more with water, in answer to this treatment of their surface, just as women's breasts respond to sucking, for it moistens and softens the vapour;", "6442": "whereas land which is not worked is incapable of producing water, not having the motion by which moisture is obtained.", "6443": "Those who argue thus have given sceptics the opportunity of saying, that if it be true, there can be no blood in animals, but that it gathers about wounds, and that the flow of blood is produced by the air, or some change which takes place in the flesh.", "6444": "They are proved to be wrong by those who sink shafts for mines, and meet with rivers in the depths of the earth, which have not collected themselves by degrees, as would be the case if they derived their origin from the sudden movements of the earth, but flow with a full stream.", "6445": "Also, when mountains and rocks are fissured by a blow, there springs out a gush of water, which after­ wards ceases.", "6446": "But enough of this.", "6447": "XV. AEmilius remained quiet for some days, and it is said two such great hosts never were so near together and so quiet.", "6448": "After exploring and trying every place he discovered that there was still one pass unguarded, that, namely, through Perrhæbæ by Pythium and Petra.", "6449": "He called a council of war to consider this, being himself more hopeful of success that way, as the place was not watched, than alarmed at the precipices on account of which the enemy neglected it.", "6450": "First of those present, Scipio, sur­ named Nasica, son-in-law to Scipio Africanus, afterwards a leading man in the Senate, volunteered to lead the party which was to make this circuitous attack.", "6451": "And next Fabius Maximus, the eldest of the sons of Æmilius, though still only a youth, rose and spiritedly offered his services.", "6452": "AEmilius, delighted, placed under their command not so many troops as Polybius says in his history, but so many as Nasica himself tells us that he had, in a letter which he wrote to one of the princes of that region about this affair.", "6453": "He had three thousand Italians, besides his main body, and five thousand who composed the left wing.", "6454": "Besides these, Nasica took a hundred and twenty horse, and two hundred of Harpalus's light troops, Thracians and Cretans mixed.", "6455": "He began his march along the road towards the sea, and encamped near the temple of Herakles, as though he intended to sail round to the other side of the enemy's camp, and so surround him:", "6456": "but when the soldiers had supped, and it was dark, he explained his real plan to his officers, marched all night away from the sea, and halted his men for rest near the temple of Apollo.", "6457": "At this place Olympus is more than ten furlongs high:", "6458": "and this is proved by the epigram which the measurer wrote as follows:", "6459": "discovered its height King Apollo, hail to thee;", "6460": "be thou propitius to us.\"", "6461": "And yet geometricians say that neither the height of any mountain nor the depth of any sea is above ten stades (furlongs).", "6462": "However, Xenophanes did not take its alti­ tude conjecturally, but by a proper method with instru­ ments.", "6463": "XVI.", "6464": "Here then Nasica halted.", "6465": "Perseus in the morning saw Æmilius’s army quiet in its place, and would have had no idea of what was going on had not a Cretan deserter come and told him of the flank march of the Romans.", "6466": "Then he became alarmed, but still did not disturb his camp, but, placing ten thousand foreign mercenaries and two thousand Macedonians under the command of Milo, ordered him to march swiftly and occupy the passes.", "6467": "Now Polybius says that the Romans fell upon these men when they were in their beds, but Nasica tells us that a sharp and dangerous conflict took place upon the heights.", "6468": "He himself was assailed by a Thracian, but struck him through the breast with his spear.", "6469": "However, the enemy were forced back;", "6470": "Milo most shamefully fled in his shirt, without his arms, and Scipio was able to follow, and at the same time lead his forces on to level ground.", "6471": "Perseus, terrified and despairing when he saw them, at once broke up his camp and retreated.", "6472": "But still he was obliged either to give battle before Pydna, or else to disperse his army among the various cities of the kingdom, and so to await the Romans, who, being once entered into his country, could not be driven out without much slaughter and bloodshed.", "6473": "It was urged by his friends that he had a great numerical superiority, and that the troops would fight desperately in defence of their wives and families, especially if their king took the command and shared their danger.", "6474": "He pitched his camp and prepared for battle, viewed the ground, and arranged the commands, intending to set upon the Romans as soon as they appeared.", "6475": "N ow the position both possessed a flat plain for the manoeuvres of the phalanx, which requires level ground, and also hills rising one above another offered refuges and means for outflanking the enemy to his light troops.", "6476": "Also two rivers, the Æson and Leukus, which ran acivss it, though not very deep at that season (late autumn), were expected to give some trouble to the Romans.", "6477": "XVII.", "6478": "Æmilius, on effecting a junction with Nasica, marched in battle array against the enemy.", "6479": "When, however, he saw their position and their numbers, he halted in surprise, considering within himself what he should do.", "6480": "His young officers, eager for battle, rode up to him and begged him not to delay.", "6481": "Conspicuous among these was Nasica, excited by his successful flank march round Olympus.", "6482": "AEmilius smiled at them and answered, \" I would do so if I were of your age, but many victories have shown me the mistakes of the vanquished, and prevent my attacking a body of men drawn up in a chosen position with troops on the march and undeployed.\"", "6483": "He gave orders that those troops who were in front should gather together and appear to be forming in battle array, while those who were behind pitched their palisades and fortified a camp.", "6484": "Then by wheeling off men by degrees from the front line, he gradually broke up his line of battle, and quietly drew all his forces within the ramparts of his camp.", "6485": "When night fell, and after supper the army had betaken itself to sleep and rest, suddenly the moon, which was full and high in the heavens, became obscured, changed colour, and became totally eclipsed.", "6486": "The Romans, after their custom, called for her to shine again by clattering with brass vessels, and uplifting blazing faggots and torches.", "6487": "The Macedonians did nothing of the sort, but dismay spread over their camp, and they muttered under their breath that this portended the eclipse of their king.", "6488": "Now Æmilius was not unac­ quainted with the phenomena of eclipses, which result from the moon being at fixed periods brought into the shadow of the earth and darkened, until it passes the obscured tract and is again enlightened by the sun, yet being very devout and learned in divination, he offered to her a sacrifice of eleven calves.", "6489": "At daybreak he sacrificed twenty oxen to Herakles without obtaining a favourable response;", "6490": "but with the one-and-twentieth favourable signs appeared and portents of victory fur them, pruvided they did not attack.", "6491": "He then vowed a hecatomb and sacred games in honour of the god, and ordered his officers to arrange the men in line of battle.", "6492": "But he waited till the sun declined and drew towards the west, that his troops might not fight with the morning sun in their eyes.", "6493": "He passed away the day sitting in his tent, which was pitched looking towards the flat country and the camp of the enemy.", "6494": "XVIII.", "6495": "Some writers tell us, that about evening, by a device of AEmilius, the battle was begun by the enemy, the Romans having driven a horse without a bridle out of their camp and then tried to catch it, from which pursuit the battle began;", "6496": "but others say that Roman soldiers who were carrying fodder for the cattle were set upon by the Thracians under Alexander, and that to repel them a vigorous sortie was made with seven hundred Ligurians;", "6497": "that many on both sides came up to help their comrades, and so the battle began.", "6498": "AEmilius, like a pilot, seeing by the motion and disturbance of his camp that a storm was at hand, came out of his tent, and going along the lines of the infantry spoke encouraging words to them, while Nasica, riding up to the skirmishers, saw the whole army of the enemy just on the point of attacking.", "6499": "First marched the Thracians, whose aspect they saw was most terrible, as they were tall men, dressed in dark tunics, with large oblong shields and greaves of glittering white, brandishing aloft long heavy swords over their right shoulders.", "6500": "Next to the Thracians were the merce­ naries, variously armed, and mixed with Pæonians.", "6501": "After these came a third corps, of Macedonians, picked men of proved courage, and in the flower of their age, glittering with gilded arms and new purple dresses.", "6502": "Behind them again came the phalanxes from the camp with their brazen shields, filling all the plain with the glittering of their armour, and making the hills ring with their shouts.", "6503": "So swiftly and boldly did they advance that those who were first slain fell two furlongs only from the Roman camp.", "6504": "XIX.", "6505": "When the battle began, Æmilius came up, and found the front ranks of the Macedonians had struck their spear-heads into the Roman shields, so that they could not reach them with their swords.", "6506": "When also the other Macedonians took their shields off their shoulders and placed them in front, and then at the word of command all brought down their pikes, he, viewing the great strength of that serried mass of shields, and the menacing look of the spears that bristled before them, was amazed and terrified, having never seen a more imposing spectacle­ and often afterwards he used to speak of that sight, and of his own feelings at it.", "6507": "At the time, however, he put on a cheerful and hopeful look, and rode along the ranks showing himself to the men without helmet or cuirass.", "6508": "But the Macedonian king, according to Polybius, having joined battle, was seized with a fit of cowardice, and rode off to the city on the pretext that he was going to sacrifice to Herakles, a god unlikely to receive the base offerings of cowards or to fulfil their unreasonable prayers;", "6509": "for it is not reasonable that he who does not shoot should hit the mark, nor that he who does not stand fast at his post should win the day, or that the helpless man should succeed or the coward prosper.", "6510": "But the god heard the prayers of AEmilius, for he prayed for victory whilst fighting, sword in hand, and invited the god into the battle to aid him.", "6511": "Not but what one Poseidonius, who says that he took part in these transactions, and wrote a history of Perseus in many volumes, says that it was not from cowardice, or on the pretext of offering sacrifice that he left the field, but that on the day before the battle be was kicked on the leg by a horse;", "6512": "that in the battle, though in great pain, and entreated by his friends to desist, he ordered a horse to be brought, and without armour rode up to the phalanx.", "6513": "Here as many missiles were flying about from both sides, an iron javelin struck him, not fairly with its point, but it ran obliquely down his left side, tearing his tunic, and causing a dark bruise on his flesh, the scar of which was long visible.", "6514": "This is what Poseidonius urges in defence of Perseus.", "6515": "XX.", "6516": "Now as the Romans when they met the phalanx could make no impression upon it, Salovius, the leader of the Pelignians, seized the standard of his regiment and threw it among the enemy.", "6517": "The Pelignians, as the loss of a standard is thought to be a crime and an impiety by all Italians, rushed to the place, and a fierce conflict begin there with terrible slaughter.", "6518": "The one party tried to dash aside the long spears with their swords, and to push them with their shields, and to seize them away with their very hands, while the Macedonians, wielding their spears with both hands, drove them through their opponents, armour and all:", "6519": "for no shield or corslet could resist their thrust.", "6520": "They then cast over their own heads the bodies of these Pelignians and Marrucini, who pressed madly like wild creatures up to the line of spears and certain death.", "6521": "When the first rank fell in this manner, those behind gave way:", "6522": "it cannot be said that they fled, but they retreated to a mountain called Olokrus.", "6523": "Poseidonius tells us that Æmilius tore his clothes in despair at seeing these men give ground, while the other Romans were confounded at the phalanx, which could not be assailed, but with its close line of spears, like a palisade, offered no point for attack.", "6524": "But when he saw that, from the inequalities of the ground, and the length of their line, the Mace­ donian phalanx did not preserve its alignment, and was breaking into gaps and breaches, as is natural should happen in a great army, according to the different attacks of the combatants, who made it bulge inwards in one place, and outward in another, then he came swiftly up, and dividing his men into companies, ordered them to force their way into the spaces and intervals of the enemy's line, and to make their attack, not in any one place all together, but in several, as they were broken up into several bodies.", "6525": "As soon as AEmilius had given these instructions to the officers, who communicated them to the men, they charged into the spaces, and at once some attacked the now helpless Macedonians in flank, while others got into their rear and cut them off.", "6526": "The phalanx dissolved immediately, and with it was lost all the power and mutual assistance which it gave.", "6527": "Fighting in single combats or small groups, the Macedonians struck in vain with their little daggers at the strong shields reaching to their feet carried by the Romans.", "6528": "Their light targets could ill ward off the blows of the Roman sword, which cut right through all their defensive armour.", "6529": "After a useless resistance they turned and fled.", "6530": "XXI.", "6531": "But the fight was a sharp one.", "6532": "Here Marcus, the son of Cato, Æmilius’s son-in-law, whilst fighting with great valour let fall his sword.", "6533": "Educated as he had been in the strictest principles of honour, and owing it to such a father to give extraordinary proofs of courage, he thought that life would be intolerable for him if he allowed an enemy to carry off such a trophy from him, and ran about calling upon every friend or acquaintance whom he saw to help him to recover it.", "6534": "Many brave men thus assembled, and with one accord left the rest of the army and followed him.", "6535": "After a sharp conflict and much slaughter, they succeeded in driving the enemy from the ground, and having thus chased it, they betook themselves to searching for the sword.", "6536": "When at last after much trouble it was found among the heaps of arms and corpses, they were overjoyed, and with a shout assailed those of the enemy who still resisted.", "6537": "At length the three thousand picked men were all slain fighting in their ranks.", "6538": "A great slaughter took place among the others as they fled, so that the plain and the skirts of the hills were covered with corpses, and the stream of the river Leukus ran red with blood even on the day after the battle;", "6539": "for, indeed, it is said that more than twenty-five thousand men perished.", "6540": "Of the Romans there fell a hundred, according to Poseidonius, but Nasica says only eighty.", "6541": "XXII.", "6542": "This battle, fraught with such important issues, was decided in a remarkably short time;", "6543": "beginning to fight at the ninth hour, the Romans were victorious before the tenth.", "6544": "The remainder of the day was occupied in pursuit, which being pressed for some fifteen (English) miles, it was late before they returned to their camp.", "6545": "All the officers on their return were met by their servants with torches, and conducted with songs of triumph to their tents, which were illuminated and wreathed with ivy and laurel;", "6546": "but the general himself was deeply dejected.", "6547": "The youngest of the two sons who were serving under him—his own favourite, the noblest of all his children in character-was nowhere to be found;", "6548": "and it was feared that, being high-spirited and generous, though but a boy in years, he must have become mixed up with the enemy, and so perished.", "6549": "The whole army learned the cause of his sorrow and perplexity, and quitting their suppers, ran about with torches, some to the tent of Æmilius, and some outside the camp to look for him among the corpses.", "6550": "The whole camp was filled with sorrow, and all the plain with noise, covered as it was with men shouting for Scipio—for he had won all hearts from the very beginning, having beyond all his kinsfolk the power of commanding the affections of men.", "6551": "Very late at night, after he had been all but given up for lost, he came in with two or three comrades, covered with the blood of the enemies hE had slain, having, like a well-bred hound, been thoughtle sly carried along by the joy of the chase.", "6552": "This was that Scipio who afterwards took by storm Carthage and Numantia, and became by far the most famous and powerful of all the Romans of his time.", "6553": "So fortune, deferring to another season the expression of her jealousy at his success, now permitted AEmilius to take an unalloyed pleasure in his victory.", "6554": "XXIII.", "6555": "Perseus fled from Pydna to Pella, his cavalry having, as one would expect, all got safe out of the action.", "6556": "But when the infantry met them, they abused them as cowards and traitors, and began to push them from their horses and deal them blows, and so Perseus, terrified at the disturbance, forsook the main road, and to avoid detection took off his purple robe and laid it before him, and carried his crown in his hand;", "6557": "and, that he might talk to his friends as he walked, he got off his horse, and led him.", "6558": "But one of them made excuse that he must tie his shoes, another that he must water his horse, another that he must get himself a drink, and so they gradually fell off from him and left him, not fearing the rage of the enemy so much as his cruelty:", "6559": "for, exasperated by his defeat, he tried tc fasten the blame of it upon others instead of himself.", "6560": "When he came to Pella, his treasurers Euktus and Eulæus met him and blamed him for what had happened, and in an outspoken and unseasonable way gave him advice :", "6561": "at which he was so much enraged that he stabbed them both dead with his dagger.", "6562": "After this no one stayed with him except Evander a Cretan, Archedamus an iEtolian, and Neon a Bœotian.", "6563": "Of the common soldiers the Cretans followed him, not from any love they bore him, but being as eager for his riches as bees are for honey.", "6564": "For he carried great store of wealth with him, and out of it dis­ tributed among the Cretans cups and bowls and other gold and silver plate to the amount of fifty talents.", "6565": "But when he reached first Amphipolis, and then Galepsus, and had got a little the better of his fears, his old malady of meanness attacked him, and he would complain to his friends that he had flung some of the drinking cups of Alexander the Great to the Cretans by mistake, and en­ treated with tears those who had them to give back and take the value in money.", "6566": "Those who understood his cha­ racter were not taken in by this attempt to play the Cretan with men of Crete, but some believed him and lost their cups for nothing.", "6567": "For he never paid the money, but having swindled his friends out of thirty talents, which soon fell into the hands of the enemy, he sailed with the money to Samothrace, and took sanctuary in the temple of the Dioskuri as a suppliant.", "6568": "XXIV.", "6569": "The people of Macedon have always been thought to love their kings, but now, as if some main prop had broken, and the whole edifice of government fallen to the ground, they gave themselves up to Æmilius, and in two days constituted him master of the entire kingdom.", "6570": "This seems to confirm the opinion of those who say that these successes were owing to especial good fortune:", "6571": "and the incident of the sacrifice also was clearly sent from Heaven.", "6572": "For when AEmilius was offering sacrifice at Am­ phipolis, when the sacred ritos had been performed, light­ ning came down upon the altar, and burned up the otter­ ing.", "6573": "But in its miraculous character and good luck the swiftness with which the news spread surpasses all these ;", "6574": "for on the fourth day after Perseus had been vanquished at Pydna, while the people at Rome were assembled at a horse race, suddenly there arose amongst them a rumour that Æmilius had defeated Perseus in a great battle and had subdued all Macedonia.", "6575": "This report soon spread among the populace, who expressed their joy by applause and shouts throughout the city all that day.", "6576": "Afterwards, as the report could be traced to no trustworthy source, but was merely repeated among them vaguely, it was dis­ believed and came to nothing;", "6577": "but in a few days they learned the real story, and wondered at the rumour which had preceded it, combining truth with falsehood.", "6578": "XXV.", "6579": "There is a legend that the news of the battle on the river Sagra in Italy against the natives was carried the same day into Peloponnesus, and that of the battle of Mykale against the Medes was so carried to Platæa.", "6580": "The victory of the Romans over the Latins under the exiled Tarquins was reported at Rome a little after it took place, by two men, tall and fair, who came from the army.", "6581": "These men they conjectured to have been the Dioskuri (Castor and Pollux).", "6582": "The first man who fell in with them as they stood in the forum, near the fountain, found them washing their horses, which were covered with sweat.", "6583": "He marvelled much at their tale of the victory ;", "6584": "and then they are said to have smiled serenely and stroked his beard, which instantly changed from black to yellow, thus causing his story to be believed, besides winning for him the soubriquet of Ahenobarbus, which means ‛ brazen beard.'", "6585": "But that which happened in our own time will make all these credible.", "6586": "When Antonius rebelled against Domitian, and a great war in Germany was expected, Rome was greatly disturbed till suddenly there arose among the people a rumour of victory, and a story ran through Rome that Antonius himself was killed, and that the army under him had been utterly exterminated.", "6587": "And this report was so clear and forcible, that many of the magistrates offered sacrifice for the victory.", "6588": "When the originator of it was sought for, as he could not be found, but the story when traced from one man to another was lost in the vast crowd as if in the sea, and appeared to have no solid foundation, all belief in it died away:", "6589": "but when Domitian set out with his forces to the war, he was met on the way by messengers with despatches describing the victory.", "6590": "The day of this success was the same as that stated by the rumours, though the places were more than two thousand five hundred (English) miles distant.", "6591": "All men of our own time know this to be true.", "6592": "XXVI.", "6593": "Cnæus Octavius, the admiral under Æmilius’s orders, now cruised round Samothrace.", "6594": "He did not, from religious motives, violate Perseus's right of sanctuary, but prevented his leaving the island and escaping.", "6595": "But nevertheless Perseus somehow outwitted him so far as to bribe one Oroandes, a Cretan, who possessed a small vessel, to take him on board.", "6596": "But this man like a true Cretan took the money away by night, and bidding him come the next night with his family and attendants to the harbour near the temple of Demeter, as soon as evening fell, set sail.", "6597": "Now Perseus suffered pitiably in forcing himself, and his wife and children, who were unused to hardships, through a narrow window in the wall, and set up a most pitiful wailing when some one who met him wandering on the beach showed him the ship of Oroandes under sail far away at sea.", "6598": "Day was now breaking, and having lost his last hope, he made a hasty retreat to the town wall, and got into it with his wife, before the Romans, though they saw him, could prevent him.", "6599": "But his children he had entrusted to a man named Ion, who once had been a favourite of his, but now betrayed him, and delivered them up to the Romans, thus providing the chief means to compel him, like a wild animal, to come and surrender himself into the hands of those who had his children.", "6600": "He felt most confidence in Nasica, and inquired for him, but as he was not present, after lamenting his fate, and reflecting on the impossibility of acting otherwise, he surrendered himself to Cnaeus.", "6601": "Now he was able to prove that he had a vice yet more sordid than avarice, namely, base love of life;", "6602": "by which he lost even his title to pity, the only’ consolation of which fortune does not deprive the fallen.", "6603": "He begged to be brought into the presence of AEmilius, who, to show respect to a great man who had met with a terrible misfortune, rose, and walked to meet him with his friends, with tears in his eyes.", "6604": "But Perseus offered a degrading spectacle by flinging himself down upon his face and embracing his knees, with unmanly cries and entreaties, which Æmilius could not endure to listen to;", "6605": "but looking on him with a pained and sad expression, said, “ Wretched man:", "6606": "why do you by this conduct deprive fortune of all blame, by making yourself seem to deserve your mishaps, and to have been unworthy of your former prosperity, but worthy of your present misery?", "6607": "And why do you depreciate the value of my victory, and make my success a small one, by proving degenerate and an unworthy antagonist for Romans?", "6608": "Valour, however unfortunate, commands great respect even from enemies:", "6609": "but the Romans despise cowardice, even though it be prosperous.", "6610": "\"XXVII.", "6611":

silent, wrapt in thought for some time, to their astonishment.", "6612": "Then he said, \"Ought a man to be confident that he deserves his good fortune, and think much of himself when he has overcome a nation, or city, or empire;", "6613": "or does fortune give this as an example to the victor also of the uncertainty of human affairs, which never continue in one stay ?", "6614": "For what time can there be for us mortals to feel confident, when our victories over others especially compel us to dread fortune, and while we are exulting, the reflection that the fatal day comes now to one, now to another, in regular succession, dashes our joy.", "6615": "Can we, who in less than an hour have trampled under our feet the successor of Alexander the Great, who was so powerful and mighty, and who see these kings who but lately were guarded by their tens of thousands of foot and thousands of horse, now receiving their daily bread from the hands of their foes, can we suppose that our present prosperity is likely to endure for all time?", "6616": "You, young men, be sure that you lay aside your haughty looks and vainglory in your victory, and await with humility what the future may bring forth, ever considering what form of retribution Heaven may have in store for us to set off against our present good fortune.\"", "6617": "They say that AEmilius spoke long in this strain, and sent away his young officers with their pride and boastfulness well curbed and restrained by his words, as though with a bridle.", "6618": "XXVIII.", "6619": "After these events he sent the army into cantonments, to rest, and he himself set out to visit Greece, making a progress which was both glorious and beneficent;", "6620": "for in the cities to which he came he restored the popular constitutions, and bestowed on them presents from the king's treasury, of corn and oil.", "6621": "For so much, they say, was found stored up, that all those who received it and asked for it, were satisfied before the mass could be exhausted.", "6622": "At Delphi, seeing a large square column of white marble, on which a golden statue of Perseus was to have been placed, he ordered his own to be placed there, as the vanquished ought to give place to the victors.", "6623": "At Olympia, as the story goes, he uttered that well- known saying, that Pheidias had carved the very Zeus of Homer.", "6624": "When ten commissioners arrived from Rome, he restored to the Macedonians their country to dwell in, and their cities free and independent, imposing upon them a tribute of a hundred talents, only half what they used to pay to their kings.", "6625": "He exhibited gymnastic spectacles of every kind, and gave splendid sacrifices and feasts in honour of the gods, having boundless resources for the purpose in the king's treasury;", "6626": "and in ordering and arranging each man'a place at table, and saluting him according to his merit and degree, he showed such a delicate perception of propriety, that the Greeks were astonished that he should carry his administrative talent even into his amusements, and be so business-like in trifles.", "6627": "But he was always delighted that though many splendid things were prepared, he himself was the chief object of interest to his guests, and when they expressed their surprise at his taking such pains, he would answer that the same mind can array an army for battle in the most terrific fashion, or a feast in the most acceptable one.", "6628": "All men praised to the skies his generous magnanimity, because, when a great mass of gold and silver was collected from the king's treasury, he would not so much as look at it, but handed it over to the quæstors to be put into the public treasury.", "6629": "Of all the spoil, be only allowed his sons, who were fond of reading, to take the king's books;", "6630": "and when distributing prizes for distinguished bravery in action, he gave Ælius Tubero, his son-in-law, a silver cup of five pounds' weight.", "6631": "This Tubero is he whom we said lived with fifteen other kinsfolk on a small farm, which supported them all.", "6632": "And that, they say, was the first piece of plate

"When he had settled all things properly he took leave of the Greeks, and reminding the Macedonians to keep by orderly and unanimous conduct the liberty which the Romans had bestowed upon them, he started for Epirus, as the Senate had passed a decree that the soldiers who had been present in the battle against Perseus should be gratified with the spoil of the cities of Epirus.", "6636": "Desiring therefore to fall upon them all at once and unexpectedly, he sent for ten of the chief men from each city, and ordered them to bring together, on a fixed day, all the gold and silver which they had in their houses and temples.", "6637": "With each party he sent, as if for this purpose, a guard of soldiers and a captain, who was to pretend that he came to seek for and receive the money.", "6638": "But when day broke, they all at the same time fell to sacking and plundering the cities, so that, in one hour, a hundred and fifty thousand people were reduced to slavery, and seventy cities plundered;", "6639": "yet from such ruin and destruction as this, there resulted no more than eleven drachmae for each soldier, while all mankind shuddered at this termination of the war, that a whole nation should be cut to pieces to produce such a pitiful present.", "6640": "XXX.", "6641": "AEmilius, having performed this work, greatly against his real nature, which was kind and gentle, proceeded to Oricum, and thence crossed to Italy with his army.", "6642": "He himself sailed up the river Tiber in the king's own ship of sixteen banks of oars, adorned with the arms of the vanquished, and crowns of victory and crimson flags, so that all the people of Rome came out in a body as if to a foretaste of the spectacle of his triumphal entry, and walked beside his ship as she was gently rowed up the river.", "6643": "But the soldiery, casting longing glances at the king's treasure, like men who had not met with their deserts, were angry and dissatisfied with Æmilius;", "6644": "for this reason really, though the charge they openly put forward was that he was a harsh and tyrannical ruler:", "6645": "so they showed no eagerness for the triumph.", "6646": "Servius Galba,* an enemy of AEmilius, who had once commanded a legion under him, hearing this, plucked up spirit to propose openly that he should not be allowed a triumph.", "6647": "He disseminated among the soldiers many calumnies against their general, and so still more exas­ perately their present temper;", "6648": "next he asked the tribunes of the plebs for another day, as that day would not suffice for his speech, only four hours remaining of it.", "6649": "However, the tribunes bade him speak, and he, beginning a long and abusive speech, consumed all the time.", "6650": "At nightfall the tribunes dismissed the assembly.", "6651": "But the soldiers, now grown bolder, assembled round Galba, and, forming themselves into an organized body, again at daybreak occupied the capitol;", "6652":

rumour of this spread to the rest of the people and to the Senate.", "6656": "Though the masses were grieved at the shameful treatment of Æmilius, they exhausted themselves in useless clamour, but the leading men of the Senate crying out one to another that what was going on was scandalous, encouraged each other to resist the licentious violence of the soldiers, who, if not restrained, were ready to use any kind of lawless violence to prevent Paulus Æmilius enjoy­ ing the reward of his victory.", "6657": "These men pushed the mob aside, and mounting to the capitol in a body, bade the tribunes stop the voting until they had said what they wished to the people.", "6658": "When voting ceased and silence was obtained, Marcus Servilius, a man of consular rank, who had challenged and slain twenty-three enemies in single combat, spoke as follows :", "6659": "—”", "6660": "What a commander AEmilius Paulus must be, you are now best able to judge, seeing with what a disobedient and worthless army he has succeeded in such great exploits;", "6661": "but I am surprised at the peopled being proud of the triumphs over the Illyrians and Ligurians, and begrudging itself the sight of the king of Macedon brought alive, and all the glories of Philip and Alexander carried captive to the arms of Rome.", "6662": "Is it not a strange thing that on the unfounded rumour of this victory being circulated, you sacrificed to the gods, praying that you soon might behold this spectacle, yet now that the army has returned after a real victory, you refuse the gods the honour and yourself the pleasure of it, as if you feared to see the extent of your successes, or wished to spare the feelings of your captive enemy;", "6663": "though it would show a nobler feeling than pity for him, not to deprive your general of his triumph for a mean grudge.", "6664": "Your baseness has reached such a pitch that a man without a scar, with his body delicately nurtured in the shade, dares to speak about generalship and triumphs before us who have learned by so many wounds to judge of a general's vice and virtues.\"", "6665": "As he spoke, he opened his clothes, and showed his breast with an incredible number of scars upon it;", "6666": "then turning to Galba, who had made some remarks not very decent \"", "6667": "You laugh,\" said he, \" at these other marks :", "6668": "but I glory in

on from platforms erected in the horse course, which they call the Circus, and round the Forum;", "6676": "and in all other places which gave them a view of the procession.", "6677": "Every temple was open, and full of flowers and incense, and many officials with staves drove off people who formed disorderly mobs, and kept the way clear.", "6678": "The procession was divided into three days.", "6679": "The first scarcely sufficed for the display of the captured statues, sculptures, and paintings, which were carried on two hundred and fifty carriages.", "6680": "On the following day the finest and most costly of the Macedonian arms and armour were borne along in many waggons, glittering with newly burnished brass and iron, and arranged in a carefully studied disorder, helmets upon shields, and corslets upon greaves, with Cretan targets, Thracian wicker shields and quivers mixed with horses' bits, naked swords rising out of these, and the long spears of the phalanx ranged in order above them, making a har­ monious clash of arms, as they were arranged to clatter when they weie driven along, with a harsh and menacing sound, so that the sight of them even after victory was not without terror.", "6681": "After the waggons which bore the arms walked three thousand men, carrying the silver coin in seven hundred and fifty earthen vessels, each carrying three talents, and borne by four men.", "6682": "Others carried the silver drinking horns, and goblets and chalices, each of them disposed so that it could be well seen, and all remarkable for their size and the boldness of their carving.", "6683": "XXXIII.", "6684": "On the third day, at earliest dawn, marched the trumpeters, not playing the music of a march, but sounding the notes which animate the Romans for a charge.", "6685": "After them were led along a hundred and twenty fat oxen with gilded horns, adorned with crowns and wreaths.", "6686": "They were led by youths clad in finely-fringed waistcloths in which to do the sacrifice, while boys carried the wine for the libations in gold and silver vessels.", "6687": "After these came men carrying the gold coin, divided into vessels of three talents each like the silver.", "6688": "The number of these vessels was eighty all but three.", "6689": "Then came those who carried the consecrated bowl which Æmilius had made of ten talents of gold adorned with jewels, and men carrying the plate of Antigonus and Seleukus, and cups of Therikles-ware,* and all Perseus's own service of gold plate.", "6690": "Next came the chariot of Perseus with his armour;", "6691": "and his crown set upon the top of his armour:", "6692": "and then after a little interval came the captive children of the king, and with them a tearful band of nurses and teachers, who held out their hands in supplication to the spectators, and taught the children to beg them for mercy.", "6693": "There were two boys and one girl, all too young to comprehend the extent of their misfortune.", "6694": "This carelessness made their fallen state all the more pitiable, so that Perseus himself walked almost unnoticed;", "6695": "for the Romans in their pity had eyes only for the children, and many shed tears, while all felt that the sight was more painful than pleasing till the children were gone by.", "6696": "XXXIV.", "6697": "Behind the children and their attendants walked Perseus himself, dressed in a dark-coloured cloak with country boots, seeming to be dazed and stupefied by the greatness of his fall.", "6698": "A band of his friends and associates followed him with grief-laden countenances, and, by their constantly looking at Perseus, and weeping, gave the spectators the idea that they bewailed his fate without taking any thought about their own.", "6699": "However, Perseus had sent to Æmilius asking to be excused the walking in procession;", "6700": "but he, as it seems in mockery of his cowardice and love of life, answered, 11 That was formerly in his own hands, and is now if he pleases.\"", "6701": "Meaning that death was preferable to dishonour;", "6702": "but the dastard had not spirit enough for that, but buoyed up by some hope,

success.", "6704": "Next he came himself, sitting in a splendid chariot, a man worth looking upon even without his present grandeur, dressed in a purple robe sprinkled with gold, and holding a branch of laurel in his right hand.", "6705": "All the army was crowned with laurel and followed the car of the general in military array, at one time singing and laughing over old country songs, then raising in chorus the paean of victory and recital of their deeds, to the glory of Æmilius, who was gazed upon and envied by all, disliked by no good man.", "6706": "Yet it seems that some deity is charged with tempering these great and excessive pieces of good fortune, and skimming as it were the cream off human life, so that none may be absolutely without his ills in this life ;", "6707": "but as Homer says, they may seem to fare best whose fortune partakes equally of good and evil.", "6708": "XXXV.", "6709": "For he had four sons, two, as has been already related, adopted into other

burst into a house filled with joy and gladness, and mingled tears and funeral dirges with the triumphal paeans and songs of victory.", "6713": "XXXVI.", "6714": "Yet Emilius, rightly thinking that courage is as valuable in supporting misfortunes as it is against the Macedonian phalanx, so arranged matters as to show that for him the evil was overshadowed by the good, and that his private sorrows were eclipsed by the successes of the state, lest he should detract from the importance and glory of the victory.", "6715": "He buried the first child, and immediately afterwards triumphed, as we have said :", "6716": "and when the second died after the triumph, he assembled the people and addressed them, not so much in the words of one who needs consolation, as of one who would console his countrymen, who were grieved at his misfortunes.", "6717": "He said, that he never had feared what man could do to him, but always had feared Fortune, the most fickle and variable of all deities ;",

Career by the Romans, to a clean and habitable lodging, where, in confinement, according to most authors, he starved himself to death;", "6734": "but some give a strange and extraordinary account of how he died, saying that the soldiers who guarded him became angry with him, and not being able to vex him by any other means, they prevented his going to sleep, watching him by turns, and so carefully keeping him from rest by all manner of devices, that at last he was worn out and died.", "6735": "Two of his children died also;", "6736": "but the third, Alexander, they say became accom­

them.", "6749": "They showed this by electing him, amongst other dignities, to the Censorship;", "6750": "which office is most sacred, and confers great power, especially in examining men's lives;", "6751": "for the Censor can expel a senator of evil life from his place, and elect the President of the Senate, and punish licentious young men by taking away their horses.", "6752": "They also register the value of property, and the census of the people.", "6753": "In his time they amounted to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand four hundred and fifty-two.", "6754": "He appointed Marcus Æmilius Lepidus President of the Senate, who four times already had enjoyed that dignity, and he expelled three senators, not men of mark.", "6755": "With regard to the Equites, he and his colleague Marcius Philippus showed equal moderation.", "6756": "XXXIX.", "6757": "After most of the labours of his life were accomplished, he fell sick of a disorder which at first seemed dangerous, but as time went on appeared not to be mortal, but wearisome and hard to cure.", "6758": "At length he followed the advice of his physicians, and sailed to Pæstum, in Italy.", "6759": "There he passed his time chiefly in the peaceful meadows near the sea-shore ;", "6760": "but the people of Rome regretted his absence, and in the public theatre often would pray for his return, and speak of their longing to see him.", "6761": "When the time for some religious ceremony at which he had to be present ap­ proached, and he also considered himself sufficiently strong, he returned to Rome.", "6762": "He performed the sacrifice, with the other priests, the people surrounding him witb congratulations.", "6763": "On the next day he again officiated, offering a thank-offering to the gods for his recovery.", "6764": "When this sacrifice was finished, he went homo and lay down, and before any one noticed how changed he was, he fell into a delirious trance, and died in three days, having in his life wanted none of those things which are thought to render men happy.", "6765": "Even his funeral procession was admirable and enviable, and a noble tribute to his valour and goodness.", "6766": "I do not mean gold, ivory, and other ex­ pensive and vain-glorious apparatus, but love, honour, and respect, not only shown by his own countrymen, but also by foreigners.", "6767": "For of the Iberians, Ligurians, and Macedonians who happened to be in Rome, the strongest carried the bier, while the elder men followed after, praising Æmilius as the saviour and benefactor of their countries.", "6768": "For he not only during his period of conquest had treated them mildly and humanely, but throughout the rest of his life was always bestowing benefits upon them as persons peculiarly connected with himself.", "6769": "His estate, they say, scarcely amounted to three hundred and seventy thousand sesterces,* which he left to be shared between his two sons ;", "6770": "but Scipio, the younger, consented to give up his share to his brother, as he was a member of a rich family, that of Africanus.", "6771": "Such is said to have been the life and character of Æmilius Paulus.", "6772": "I. THE characters of these men being such as is shown in their histories, it is evident that in comparing them we shall find few differences and points of variance.", "6773": "Even their wars were in both cases waged against notable antagonists, the one with the Macedonians, the other with the Cartha­ ginians :", "6774": "while their conquests were glorious, as the one took Macedonia, and crushed the dynasty of Antigonus in the person of its seventh king, while the other drove all the despots from Sicily and set the island free.", "6775": "Unless indeed any one should insinuate that AEmilius attacked Perseus when he was in great strength and had conquered the Romans before, whereas Timoleon fell upon Dionysius when he was quite worn out and helpless:", "6776": "though again it might be urged on behalf of Timoleon that he overcame many despots and the great power of Carthage, with an army hastily collected from all sources, not, like Æmilius, commanding men who were inured to war and knew how to obey, but making use of disorderly mercenary soldiers who only fought when it pleased them to do so.", "6777": "An equal success, gained with such unequal means, reflects the greater credit on the general.", "6778": "II.", "6779": "Both were just and incorruptible in their conduct:", "6780": "but Æmilius seems to have had the advantage of the customs and state of feeling among his countrymen, by which he was trained to integrity, while Timoleon with­ out any such encouragement acted virtuously, from his own nature.", "6781": "This is proved by the fact that the Romans of that period were all submissive to authority, and carried out the traditions of the state, respecting the laws and the opinions of their countrymen:", "6782": "whereas, except Dion, no Greek leader or general of that time had anything to do with Sicilian affairs who did not take bribes :", "6783": "though many suspected than Dion was meditating making himself king, and that he had dreams of an empire like that of Sparta.", "6784": "Timæus tells us that the Syracusans sent away Gylippus in disgrace for his insatiable covetousness, and the bribes which they discovered that he received when in command.", "6785": "And many writers had dwelt upon the wicked and treacherous acts which Pharax the Spartan and Kallippus the Athenian committed, when they were endeavouring to make themselves masters of Sicily.", "6786": "Yet, what were they, and what resources had they, that they conceived such great designs:", "6787": "the one being only a follower of Dionysius when he was banished from Syracuse, the other a captain of mercenaries under Dion?", "6788": "But Timoleon, who was sent to the Syracusans as generalissimo at their own request and prayer, did not seek for command, but had a right to it.", "6789": "Yet when he received his power as general and ruler from them of their own free will, he voluntarily decided to hold it only till he should have expelled from Sicily all those who were reigning des­ potically.", "6790": "In Æmilius again we must admire this, that he subdued so great an empire and yet did not enrich himself by one drachma, and never even saw or touched the king's treasures, although he distributed much of them in presents to others.", "6791": "And still, I do not say that Timoleon is to be blamed for having received a fine house and estate;", "6792": "for there is no disgrace in receiving it by such means, though not to take it is better, and shows almost superhuman virtue, which cares not to take what is lawfully within its reach.", "6793": "Yet, as the strongest bodies are those which can equally well support the extremes of heat and cold, so the noblest minds are those which pros­ perity does not render insolent and overbearing, nor ill fortune depress:", "6794": "and here Æmilius appears more nearly to approach absolute perfection, as, when in great mis­ fortune and grief for his children, he showed the same dignity and firmness as after the greatest success.", "6795": "Whereas Timoleon, though he acted towards his brother as became a noble nature, yet could not support himself against his sorrow by reason, but was so crushed by remorse and grief that for twenty years he could not ap­ pear or speak in the public assembly.", "6796": "We ought indeed to shrink from and feel shame at what is base;", "6797": "but the nature which is over-cautious to avoid blame may be gentle and kindly, but cannot be great .", "6798": "LONDON :", "6799": "PRINTED BT WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, DUKE STRICT, STAMFORD STREET, S.K AND GREAT

was the more numerous, asked, \" And for how many do you count me ?", "23": "\"-setting a high value, as is due, upon a skilful and brave leader, whose first duty is to keep safe him who preserves all

life.", "28": "These prefatory remarks occurred to me in writing the Lives of Pelopidas and Marcellus, great men who fell in a manner scarce worthy of themselves:", "29": "for being both of them most stout in battle, and having each illustrated his country by splendid campaigns, against, too, the most terrible antagonists-the one, as we read, having routed Hannibal, who before was invincible, and the other having in a pitched battle conquered the Lacedæmonians, the ruling state by sea and land-yet they without any con­ sideration endangered themselves and flung away their lives just at the time when there was special need for such men to live and command.", "30": "And on this account I have drawn a parallel between their lives, tracing out the points of resemblance between them.", "31":

wealth, but was far from proud on account of his wealth,\" for he felt ashamed to be seen using more bodily luxuries than the poorest Theban citizen.", "38": "Epameinondas, whose poverty was hereditary, made it lighter and more easily borne by the practice of philosophy, and by choosing from the beginning a single life;", "39": "while Pelopidas made a brilliant marriage and had children

palæstra and the hunting field, while the other would listen to and discuss philosophy.", "43": "And though they have both many titles to glory, yet judicious persons think nothing so much to their credit as that their friendship should have remained from beginning to end unimpaired through so many important crises, campaigns, and administrations.", "44": "For any one who considers the administrations of Aristeides and Themistokles, and Kimon and Perikles, and Nikias and Alkibiades, how full they were of mutual enmity, distrust, and jealousy, and then contrasts them with the kindness and respect shown by Pelopidas to Epameinondas, will pronounce with truth these men to have really been colleagues in government and war rather than those who were constantly strug­ gling to get the better of one another instead of the enemy.", "45": "The true cause of this was their virtue, guided by which they sought no glory or gain for themselves from their deeds, from which envious rivalry always results, but both, inflamed by a noble desire to see their country reach its climax of power and renown in their own time, used one another's successes for this purpose as if they were their own.", "46": "Not but what most people think that their closest friendship arose from the campaign of Mantinea, which they made with a contingent sent from Thebes to serve with the Lacedæmonians, who were then their friends and allies.", "47": "Stationed together in the ranks,.", "48": "and fighting against the Arcadians, when the wing cf the Lacedæmonian army in which they were gave way, and many took to flight, they closed up together and beat off their assailants.", "49": "Pelopidas, having received seven wounds in front, fell down upon a heap of slain, friends and enemies together;", "50": "but Epameinondas, though he thought him desperately.", "51": "hurt, ran forward and stood in defence of his body and arms, risking his life alone against a multitude, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there.", "52": "He too was in evil plight, with a spear wound in the breast, and a sword-cut on the arm, when Agesipolis, the Spartan king, came to the rescue from the other wing, and most unex­ pectedly saved the lives of both.", "53": "V.", "54": "After this, the Spartans behaved towards Thebes outwardly as friends and allies, but really viewed with suspicion the spirit and strength of that state.", "55": "They espe­ cially disliked the club presided over by Ismenias and Androkleides, of which Pelopidas was a member, as being of democratic and revolutionary principles.", "56": "Consequently Archias and Leontidas t and Philippus, men of the aristo­ cratic party, wealthy and unscrupulous, persuaded Phœ­ bidas, a Laconian who was passing through the town with an armed force, to seize the Kadmeia t by surprise, and, banishing the party that opposed them, establish an aristo­ cratic oligarchy which would be subservient to Sparta.", "57": "He was persuaded to do this, and attacked the un­ suspecting Thebans during the feast of Thesmophoria.", "58": "When he gained possession of the height, Ismenias was seized and conveyed to

removed Phoebidas from his command and fined him a hundred thousand drachmas, but nevertheless held the Kadmeia with a garrison, all the other Greeks wondered at their inconsistency, in punishing the doer but approving of the deed;", "63": "but the Thebans, who had lost their old constitution and were now held in bondage by the party of Archias and Leontidas, had lost all hope of release from their tyrants, who they perceived were merely acting as a guard to the Spartan supremacy in Greece, and therefore could not be put a stop to, unless their enterprise by sea and land could also be checked.", "64": "However, Leontidas and his party, learning that the exiles were living at Athens, and were popular with the people there, and respected by the upper classes, began to plot against them, and by sending thither men who were unknown to the exiles, they killed Androkleides by stratagem, but failed with the others.", "65": "There came also despatches from Lacedæmon to the Athenians, ordering them not to take them in nor to meddle in the matter, but to banish the exiles, on the ground that they had been proclaimed to be public enemies by their allies.", "66": "But the Athenians, who besides their natural and innate kindness were returning a debt of gratitude to the Thebans, who had been main instruments in the re-establishment of their government, and had decreed that if an Athenian should march in arms against the tyrants through Bœotia, no Boeotian should see or hear him, did the Theban exiles no harm.", "67": "VII.", "68": "Now Pelopidas, although one of the youngest of the exiles, yet used to encourage each of them separately, and would make speeches to them all, pointing out that it was both dishonourable and wicked for them to endure to see their country enslaved and garrisoned by foreigners, and, caring only to save their own lives, to shelter them­ selves behind decrees of the Athenians, and to pay servile court to the orators who had influence with the people.", "69": "Rather was it, he urged, their duty to run the greatest risk, taking pattern by the courage and patriotism of Thrasybulus, so that, as he once, starting from Thebes, drove out the thirty tyrants from Athens, they also in their turn, starting from Athens, might set Thebes free.", "70": "When then he prevailed with these arguments, they sent secretly to Thebes to communicate their determination to such of their friends as were left there.", "71": "They agreed, and Charon, who was the leading man among them, offered his house for their reception, and Phillidas proceeded to act as secretary to the polemarchs, Archias and Philippus.", "72": "Epameinondas had long been instilling feelings of patriot­ ism into the youth of Thebes;", "73": "for in the gymnasia he would bid them lay hold of the Lacedæmonians and wrestle with them, and then seeing them pluming themselves on their success, he would upbraid them, telling them that they ought rather to feel ashamed at being, through their own cowardice, in bondage to men whom they so greatly excelled in strength.", "74": "VIII.", "75": "When a day was fixed on for the attempt, the exiles determined that Pherenikus, with the main body, should remain in the Thriasian * plain, while a few of the youngest men ran the risk of entering the city;", "76": "and if anything were to befall these men, the others would take care that neither their parents nor their children should want for necessaries.", "77": "First Pelopidas volunteered for the attempt, then Mellon and Damokleides and Theo­ pompus, men of the first families, faithful friends to one another, and ever rivals in glory and bravery.", "78": "Having made up a party of twelve in all, and embraced those who were to stay, and sent a messenger before them to Charon, they set out, dressed in short cloaks, with hounds and carrying stakes for hunting nets, so that no one whom they met on the road might suspect them, but that they might seem to be merely ranging about the country and hunting.", "79": "When their messenger reached Charon, and told him that they were on their way, Charon did not, even now that the danger was close to him, falter in his deter­ mination, but acted like an honourable man, and received them into his house.", "80": "But one Hipposthenides, not a bad man, but one who loved his country and favoured the exiles, yet proved wanting in that audacity which this emergency, a hazardous one indeed, and the attempt they had in hand, required.", "81": "Apparently the importance of the issue with which he was dealing turned him dizzy;", "82": "he with difficulty grasped the idea that, trusting in the desperate hopes of exiles, these men were in some fashion about to attempt to overthrow the Lacedæmonian government in Thebes, and the power of Sparta.", "83": "He went quietly home, and sent one of hi a friends to Mellon and Pelopidas, bidding them put off their design for the present, to go back to Athens, and await a better opportunity.", "84": "Chlidon was the name of the messenger, and he hurriedly went to his own house, and, leading out his horse, asked for his bridle.", "85": "His wife was at her wit's end, as she had it not to give him, but she said that she had lent it to a neighbour.", "86": "Hereupon there was a quarrel, and words of ill omen were used, for his wife said that she wished it might be a bad journey for him, and for those that sent him;", "87": "so that Chlidon, having wasted a great part of the day in this squabble, and also drawing a bad augury from what had happened, gave up his journey altogether, and betook himself to something else.", "88": "So near was this greatest and most glorious of his adventures of missing its opportunity at its very outset.", "89": "IX.", "90": "Now Pelopidas and his party changed their clothes with country people, and separating, came into the city by different ways while it was still daylight.", "91": "There was a strong wind, and the weather was snowy, so that they were the less noticed, as most people had betaken them­ selves to their houses on account of the storm ;", "92": "but those who were in the plot met them as they entered, and brought them to Charon's house.", "93": "With the exiles, they amounted to forty-eight in all.", "94": "As to their oppressors, Phillidas the secretary, who had been working with the exiles and knew all their plans, having long before invited Archias and his friends to a wine party to meet certain courtesans, intended to endeavour to hand them over to their assailants in as enervated and intoxicated a condition as possible.", "95": "How­ ever before they were very far gone in liquor a rumour was brought to their ears, which, although true, was without confirmation and very vague, to the effect that the exiles were concealed in the city.", "96": "Though Phillidas endeavoured to change the subject, still Archias sent one of his servants to Charon, ordering him to come in­ stantly.", "97": "Now it was evening, and Pelopidas and his party were preparing themselves, in the house, and had already got their corslets on, and had girt on their swords.", "98": "Suddenly, a knock was heard at the door.", "99": "One of them ran out, and hearing the servant say that Charon had been sent for by the polemarchs, he in great trepida­ tion brought the news to the rest.", "100": "At once it occurred to all that the plot had been betrayed, and that they all were lost, without even having done anything worthy of their courage.", "101": "Yet they agreed that Charon should comply with the summons and that he should un­ suspiciously present himself before the Spartan chiefs.", "102": "He was a man of courage, and slow to lose heart, but now he was panic-stricken and terrified lest when so many brave citizens lost their lives, some suspicion of treachery might rest on himself.", "103": "So, just when he was going, he brought his son from the women's apartments, a boy still, but in beauty and strength surpassing all of his own age, and handed him over to Pelopidas's party, bidding them treat him as an enemy and show no mercy, if they should find him guilty of any deceit or treachery.", "104": "Many of them shed tears at the feeling shown by Charon, and his noble spirit, and all felt shame, that he should think any of them so base and so affected by their present danger, as to suspect him or even to blame him, and they begged him not to mix up his son with them, but put him out of the way of the coming stroke, that he might be saved and escape from the tyrants, and some day return and avenge his father and his friends.", "105": "But Charon refused to take away his son, for what life, he asked, or what place of safety could be more honourable to him than an easy death with his father and so many friends ?", "106": "After praying and embracing them all, and bidding them be of good cheer, he went away, taking great pains to adopt a look and tone of voice as different as possible to that of a conspirator.", "107": "X.", "108": "When he came to the door, Archias and Philippus met him and said, \" Charon, I have heard that some people have come here, and are concealed in the city, and that some of the citizens are in league with them.\"", "109": "Charon was at first disconcerted, but then enquired who these persons might be, and who they were that gave them shelter.", "110": "Seeing then that Archias knew nothing for certain, he perceived that the news did not come from any one who knew the truth.", "111": "“ Take care,\" said he “that this be not a mere idle rumour that is alarming you.", "112": "However, I will make due enquiries;", "113": "for we ought not to disregard anything.\"", "114": "Phillidas, who was present, expressed his approval of this, and carrying Archias back again plied him with liquor, prolonging his debauch by holding out the expectation of the women.", "115": "Now when Charon returned to his house, he found the conspirators there prepared to fight, not expecting to survive or to win the day, but to die gloriously and kill as many of their enemies as possible.", "116": "He told Pelopidas's party the truth, and made up some story about Archias to satisfy the others.", "117": "This storm was just blown over when Fortune sent a second upon them.", "118": "A messenger came from Athens, from Archias the hierophant * to his namesake Archias the Spartan, whose guest and friend he was, bearing a letter which contained no vague and conjectural suspicion, but a detailed account of all that was being done, as was afterwards discovered.", "119": "Now the messenger, when brought before Archias who was drunk, gave him the letter, and said, \"He who sent you this letter bade you read it instantly, for he said it was written about most serious matters.\"", "120": "Archias laughing, said, \" Serious matters to-morrow.\"", "121": "He took the letter and placed it under the pillow on which he rested, and again listened to Phillidas about what they were talking of before.", "122": "This story, handed down in the form of a proverb, is current among the Greeks even now.", "123": "XI.", "124": "As the hour for the attempt seemed now to have arrived, they sallied forth, in two bodies:", "125": "the one, under Pelopidas and Damokleides, to attack Leontidas and Hypates, who lived near one another, while the other, under Charon and Mellon, went to Archias and Philippus, with women a gowns over their steel corslets, and their faces concealed by thick wreaths of fir and pine wood;", "126": "and so when first they entered the door of the dining-room they caused great applause and disturbance, as the guests imagined that the long-expected ladies had at length come.", "127": "TLey looked carefully round the party, and having ascertained who each of the guests were, they drew their swords, and made for Archias and Philippus.", "128": "When they thus betrayed themselves, Phillidas persuaded some few of the guests to remain quiet, but the rest, who rose and tried to assist the polemarchs, were easily disposed of on account of their drunken condition.", "129": "The task of Pelopidas and his party was a harder one;", "130": "for they went to attack Leontidas, a sober and brave man, and, finding his house shut up, for he was already asleep, they knocked for some time without rousing any one.", "131": "At length the servant heard them and came and drew back the bolt of the door;", "132": "then, as soon as the leaves of the door yielded they burst in in a body, and upsetting the servant made for the bedchamber.", "133": "Leontidas, guessing from the noise and confusion what was going on, started up and seized his dagger, but he forgot to put out the light, and make the men fall upon each other in the dark­ ness.", "134": "In full view of them, in a blaze of light, he met them at his chamber door, and with a blow of his dagger struck down Kephisodorus, the first man who entered.", "135": "As he fell dead Leontidas grappled with the next, Pelopidas.", "136": "The struggle was a fierce one and rendered difficult by the narrow passage and the corpse of Kephiso­ dorus lying in it, but at length Pelopidas gained the upper hand, and having despatched him, immediately went with his party to attack Hypates.", "137": "And in the same way they broke into his house, but he heard them sooner, and fled away to the neighbours, but was pursued and slain.", "138": "XII.", "139": "Having accomplished this, and joined Mellon's party, they sent word to the remaining exiles in Attica, and called together the citizens to complete their deliver­ ance, and as they came, gave them arms, taking down the trophies which hung in the public colonnades, and breaking into the workshops of spear-makers and sword-cutlers.", "140": "And Epameinondas and Gorgidas, with their party, came to help them, armed;", "141": "for they had collected together no small number of the younger men and the strongest of the elder ones.", "142": "By this time the whole city was roused, and there was great confusion, lights flitting about, and people running to one another's houses, but the people had not yet assembled, but being alarmed at what had happened, and knowing nothing for certain, they waited for daylight.", "143": "And here the generals of the Lacedæmonian garrison seem to have missed an opportunity in not at once sallying out and attacking them, for the garrison itself consisted of 1500 men, and many people kept running to them for refuge from the city;", "144": "however, alarmed at the shouts and fires and mass of people assembling from all parts, they remained quiet, holding the Kadmeia only.", "145": "At daybreak arrived the exiles from Attica, fully armed, and the public assembly met.", "146": "Epameinondas and Gorgidas led forward the band of Pelopidas, surrounded by the priests, who crowned them with wreaths, and called upon the citizens to fight for their country and their gods.", "147": "The whole assembly, with shouts and applause, rose at the sight, and received them as their benefactors and saviours.", "148": "XIII.", "149": "After this, Pelopidas, who was chosen Bœotarch, * with Mellon and Charon as colleagues, at once blockaded the citadel, and made assaults upon it on all sides, being eager to drive out the Lacedæmonians and recover the Kadmeia before an army should come upon them from Sparta.", "150": "And so little time had he to spare, that the garrison, when going home after their capitulation, met at Megara Kleombrotus, marching with a great force against Thebes.", "151": "Of the three men who had been governors of Thebes, the Spartans condemned two, Herippidas and Arkissus, to death, and the third, Lysanorides, was heavily fined and banished.", "152": "This adventure was called by the Greeks the \" sister \" of that of Thrasybulus, as it resembled it in the bravery and personal risk of its chief actors, and was, like the other, favoured by fortune.", "153": "It is difficult to mention any other persons, who with fewer numbers and scantier means than these, conquered men more numerous and powerful than themselves, by sheer daring and ability, or who conferred greater blessings on their own countries;", "154": "and that which made this more remarkable was the change which it effected.", "155": "The war which destroyed the prestige of Sparta, and put an end to her empire by sea and land, began in that night, in which Pelopidas, without having made himself master of any fort, stronghold, or- citadel, but merely coming to a private house with eleven others, loosed and broke to pieces, if we may use a true metaphor, the chains of Lacedæmonian supremacy, which seemed fixed and immovable.", "156": "XIV.", "157": "Now when a great Lacedæmonian army invaded Bœotia, the Athenians manifested great alarm.", "158": "They repudiated their alliance with the Thebans, and impeached those who had shown Boeotian sympathies;", "159": "some of these men were put to death, others fined and banished.", "160": "The case of the Thebans seemed desperate, as no one offered to help them;", "161": "but Pelopidas, who with Gorgidas was Bceotarch, contrived to alienate the Athenians from Sparta by the following plot.", "162": "Sphodrias, a Spartan, of great renown in the wars, but somewhat flighty and prone to wild enterprises and reckless ambition, had been left near Thespiæ with an army, to receive and assist those Thebans * who were now sent into exile because they favoured the Lacedæmonians.", "163": "Pelopidas sent secretly to this man a merchant, a friend of his own, who gave him a bribe, and also made proposals which fascinated him more than the money, that he should attempt some enter­ prise on a great scale, and surprise Peiræus by a sudden attack when the Athenians were off their guard:", "164": "for the Lacedæmonians would be better pleased with the capture of Athens than with anything else, and the Thebans would not assist them, for they were at variance with them and regarded them as traitors.", "165": "At length Sphodrias was prevailed upon to agree to this, and, with his soldiery, invaded Attica by night.", "166": "He got as far as Eleusis, but there the soldiers lost heart, and the attempt was detected.", "167": "So, having involved the Spartans in a war of no slight importance, he retired to Thespiæ.XV.", "168": "Upon this the Athenians again most eagerly allied themselves with the Thebans, and, aspiring to supremacy at sea, sent embassies round to the other maritime states, and brought over to their own side those who were willing to revolt from the Spartans.", "169": "Meanwhile the Thebans, alone in their country of Bœotia, constantly skirmishing with the Lacedæmonians, and not fighting any great battles with them, but organising themselves with the greatest care and discipline, began to pluck up spirit, gaining skill from practice, and becoming confident from the result of these encounters.", "170": "This was why they say that Antalkidas the Spartan, when King Agesilaus was being carried home wounded from Boeotia, said to him, “ Indeed, you are receiving nice lessons from the Thebans, now that you have taught them how to fight against their will.\"", "171": "But their real teacher was not Agesilaus, but those who, seizing fit opportunities, and with due management, skilfully used to let them loose upon their enemies, as men train young mastiffs, and then when they had tasted victory and self-confidence brought them safely back.", "172": "Of these leaders Pelopidas received the chief credit.", "173": "From the year in which he was first elected general they never ceased to re-elect him, and he was always either in command of the Sacred Band or most commonly acting as Bœotarch until his death.", "174": "There took place also about Platæa and Thespiæ defeats and routs of the Lacedæ­ monians, in which Phœbidas, who seized the Kadmeia, perished;", "175": "and Pelopidas routed a number of them near Tanagra, and slew Panthoides the governor.", "176": "Still, although these skirmishes raised the spirits and confi­ dence of the victors, yet they did not cast down the pride of the vanquished ;", "177": "for they were not regular battles, but the Thebans won their successes by well-timed charges and harassing the enemy by alternate retreat and advance.", "178": "However, the affair at Tegyra, which in a manner was preliminary to that at Leuktra, won Pelopidas a great reputation;", "179": "for there was no question of any other general having assisted in the design of the battle, nor of the enemy being thoroughly routed.", "180": "The city of Orchomenus had taken the Spartan side, and had received two moras * of Spartan troops for its protection.", "181": "He always had his eye upon this place, and watched his opportunity.", "182": "Hearing that the garrison had made an expedition into Lokris, he marched, hoping to catch Orchomenus defenceless, taking with him the Sacred Band and a few cavalry.", "183": "When he came to the city he found that the garrison had been relieved by fresh troops from Sparta, and so he led off his men homewards through Tegyra, the only way that he could, by a circuitous route at the foot of the mountains;", "184": "for the river Melas, which from its very source spreads into morasses and quagmires, made the direct way impassable.", "185": "Near the marshes stands a temple of Apollo of Tegyra and an oracle, which is now forsaken;", "186": "it has not been long so, but flourished up to the Persian War, when Echekrates was priest.", "187": "There the myths say that the god was born;", "188": "and the neighbouring mountain is called Delos, and there the overflowings of the river Melas cease, while behind the temple there flow two springs remark­ able for the sweetness, coldness, and volume of their waters, which we up to this day call, the one \"", "189": "The Palm,\" and the other \" The Olive,\" as though the goddess had not been delivered between two trees, but two fountains.", "190": "Indeed, close by is the Ptoüm, whence they say that she was driven in terror by the sudden apparition of a wild boar, and with regard to the legends of Tityos and Pytho, the localities are in like manner associated with the birth of the god.", "191": "I omit the greater part of these proofs, for our ancestral religion tells us that this god is not to be ranked among those divinities who were born as men, like Herakles and Dionysus, and by their merits were translated from this earthly and suffering body, but he is one of the eternal ones who know no birth, if one may form any conjecture upon such matters from the writings of our wisest and most ancient writers.", "192": "XVII.", "193": "At Tegyra, then, Pelopidas and the Thebans retiring from Orchomenus met the Lacedæmonians march­ ing back from Lokris, in the opposite direction.", "194": "When they were first descried coming out from the narrow gorges of the hills, some one ran to Pelopidas, and cried out, “ We have fallen into the midst of the enemy!\" “ Why so,\" asked he, more than they into the midst of us ? \"", "195": "He at once ordered his cavalry to the front to charge the enemy first, and closed up his infantry, three hundred in number, into a compact body, trusting that wherever he attacked the enemy he should break through, although they outnumbered him.", "196": "They consisted of two moras of Lacedæmonians :", "197": "now Ephorus says that a mora consists of 500 men, but Kallisthenes says 700, and some other authorities, and amongst them Polybius, put it at 900.", "198": "Gorgoleon and Theopompus, the polemarchs in command of the Spartans, moved confidently to the attack of the Thebans;", "199": "and the onset was directed on both sides, with great fury, specially at the persons of the leaders.", "200": "The two polemarchs dashed against Pelopidas, and both fell;", "201": "then the slaughter of their immediate followers produced a panic in the whole force, and it gave way to the Thebans, opening a lane through the centre as if for them to pass through.", "202": "But when Pelopidas led his men into the passage thus offered, and assailed those who stood their ground, passing through it with great slaughter, then all fled in hopeless rout.", "203": "The pursuit was not pressed far, for the Thebans feared the vicinity of Orchomenus and of the Spartan reinforce­ ment there ;", "204": "but as far as winning the victory, and forcing their way through the beaten enemy, they were completely successful;", "205": "so after setting up a trophy and spoiling the dead they returned home in high spirits.", "206": "For in all the wars which had previously taken place, both with Greeks and barbarians, it never before had happened that Lace­ dæmonians should be conquered by an inferior force, nor yet even when the numbers on each side were equal.", "207": "Wherefore they were invincible in their own estimation, and established an ascendant over the minds of their opponents, for they were wont to engage with men who did not themselves think that with equal force they could be a match for the same number of Spartans.", "208": "But this battle first proved to the rest of Greece that it is not only the Eurotas, and the country between Babuke and Knacion* that nurtures brave and warlike men, but that wherever the youth of a nation fears disgrace and is willing to risk life for honour, and shrinks from shame more than from danger, these form the troops most terrible to their foes.", "209": "XVIII.", "210": "The Sacred Band, they say, was first formed by Gorgidas, of 300 picked men, whom the city drilled and lodged in the Kadmeia when on service, wherefore they were called the “ city ” regiment;", "211": "for people then generally called the citadel the “ city.\"", "212": "Some say that this force was composed of intimate friends, and indeed there is current a saying of Pammenes, that Homer's Nestor is not a good general when he bids the Greeks assemble by their tribes and clans:", "213": "“That tribe to tribe, and clan to clan give aid,\" whereas he ought to have placed side by side men who loved each other, for men care little in time of danger for men of the same tribe or clan, whereas the bond of affection is one that cannot be broken, as men will stand fast in battle from the strength of their affection for others, and from feeling shame at showing themselves cowards before them.", "214": "Nor is this to be wondered at, seeing that men stand more in awe of the objects of their love when they are absent than they do of others when present, as was the case with that man who begged and entreated one of the enemy to stab him in the breast as he lay wounded, \" in order,\" said he, “ that my friend may not see me lying dead with a wound in the back, and be ashamed of me.\"", "215": "And Iolaus, the favourite of Herakles, is said to have taken part in his labours and to have accompanied him ;", "216": "and Aristotle says that even in his own time lovers would make their vows at the tomb of Iolaus.", "217": "It is probable, therefore, that the Sacred Band was so named, because Plato also speaks of a lover as a friend inspired from Heaven.", "218": "Up to the battle of Chæronea it is said to have continued invincible, and when Philip stood after the battle viewing the slain, in that part of the field where the Three Hundred lay dead in their armour, heaped upon one another, having met the spears of his phalanx face to face, he wondered at the sight, and learning that it was the Band of Lovers, burst into tears, and said, “ Perish those who suspect these men of doing or enduring anything base.", "219": "\"XIX.", "220": "As to these intimacies between friends, it was not, as the poets say, the disaster of Laius which first introduced the custom into Thebes, but their lawgivers, wishing to soften and improve the natural violence and ferocity of their passions, used music largely in their education, both in sport and earnest, giving the flute especial honour, and by mixing the youth together in the palæstra, produced many glorious examples of mutual affection.", "221": "Rightly too did they establish in their city that goddess who is said to be the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, Harmonia ;", "222": "since, wherever warlike power is duly blended with eloquence and refinement, there all things tend to the formation of a harmonious and perfect commonwealth.", "223": "Now, as to the Sacred Band, Gorgidas originally placed them in the first rank, and so spread them all along the first line of battle, and did not by this means render their valour so conspicuous, nor did he use them in a mass for any attack, but their courage was weakened by so large an infusion of inferior soldiery;", "224": "but Pelopidas, after the splendid display of their valour under his own eye at Tegyra, never separated or scattered them, but would stand the brunt of battle, using them as one body.", "225": "For as horses driven in a chariot go faster than those going loose, not because they more easily cleave the air when galloping in a solid body, but because their rivalry and racing with one another kindles, their spirit, so he imagined that brave men, inciting each other to an emulation in adventure, would prove most useful and forward when cting in one body.", "226": "XX.", "227": "When the Lacedæmonians made peace with all be other Greeks and attacked the Thebans alone, and Kleombrotus, their king, invaded Bœotia with ten thou­ sand hoplites and a thousand cavalry, the danger was not that they should be reduced to their former condition, but absolute destruction plainly threatened their city, and such terror prevailed as never before had been in Bœotia.", "228": "Pelopidas, when leaving his house, as his wife wept at parting with him and begged him to be careful of his life, answered, “ My dear, this is very good advice for private soldiers, but we who are commanders must think about saving the lives of others.\"", "229": "When he reached the camp, he found the Bœotarchs differing in opinion, and he at once gave his voice for the plan of Epameinondas, who voted for battle.", "230": "He was not named Boeotarch, but he was in command of the Sacred Band, and enjoyed great confidence, as was only just a man should who had given such proofs of patriotism.", "231": "When, then, they had determined to face the enemy, and taken up a position at Leuktra opposite to the Spartan army, Pelopidas saw a vision in his sleep which greatly disturbed him.", "232": "In the plain of Leuktra there are the tombs of the daughters of Skedasus, whom they call Leuktridæ because of the place of their burial;", "233": "for there it was that they were buried after they had been violated by some Spartan strangers.", "234": "When this base and impious deed was done, their father, as he could get no satisfaction from the Lacedæmonians, invoked curses upon the Spartan race, and slew himself at the tombs of his daughters.", "235": "Oracles and legends always had warned the Spartans to beware of the vengeance of Leuktra, though most of them did not understand it, and were not clear as to the place, since a small sea-side town in Laconia is also called Leuktron, and there is a place of the same name near Megalopolis in Arcadia, and, also, this crime was committed a long time before the battle.", "236": "XXI.", "237": "So now Pelopidas, when asleep in the camp, seemed to see the maidens weeping over their tombs and invoking curses on the Spartans, and Skedasus, who bade him sacrifice a red virgin to the maidens, if he wished to conquer his enemies.", "238": "And as this command seemed to him shocking and impious, he started up and consulted the prophets and the generals.", "239": "Some of them forbade him to neglect or disobey the warning, quoting the famous old instances of Menækeus the son of Kreon and Makaria the daughter of Herakles, and, in later times, Pherekydes the philosopher, who was killed by the Lacedæmonians, and whose skin, according to some oracle, is still kept by their kings, and Leonidas, who following the oracle did in some sort offer himself as a victim on behalf of Greece;", "240": "and futhermore they spoke of those persons whom Themistokles sacrificed to Dionysus before the sea fight-at Salamis.", "241": "All these are verified by the success which followed them.", "242": "And again, Agesilaus when starting from the same place that Agamemnon did to fight the same enemies, was asked by the god, during a vision at Aulis, to give him his daughter as a sacrifice;", "243": "but he did not give her, but by his softheartedness ruined the expedition, which in­ gloriously failed.", "244": "Others spoke on the other side, urging that so barbarous and impious a sacrifice could not be pleasing to any of the powers above, for, they said, it is not the Typhons and giants of legend that rule in heaven, but the father of all gods and men.", "245": "To believe that there are deities that delight in the blood and slaughter of mankind is probably a foolish fancy;", "246": "but if there be such, it is our duty to disregard them and treat them as powerless, for these strange and shocking desires can only take their origin and exist in feeble and depraved minds.", "247": "XXII.", "248": "While the chiefs of the army were engaged in this discussion, and Pelopidas especially was at a loss what to do, a filly escaped from some horses at pasture, and running through the ranks stopped opposite them.", "249": "They admired her coat shining with the brightest red, and the mettled courage of her neigh, but Theokritus the prophet, comprehending what was meant, called to Pelopidas:", "250": "\" Happy man!", "251": "Here is your victim;", "252": "let us not expect any other virgin, but take the gift the gods provide you.\"", "253": "Hereupon they caught the filly and led it to the tombs of the maidens.", "254": "Here, after prayer, they hung garlands on the tombs, and made the sacrifice with joy, explaining to the whole army the vision of Pelopidas and their reasons for the sacrifice.", "255": "XXIII.", "256": "In the battle, Epameinondas brought his main body slantingly towards the left, in order that the Spartan right might be drawn as far as possible away from the other Greeks, and that by falling violently on Kleombrotus with his whole force on that wing, he might overpower and crush him.", "257": "The enemy, perceiving what was being done, began to alter their own formation, extending their right, with the intention of outflanking and enveloping Epameinondas.", "258": "At this moment Pelopidas charged with the Three Hundred in serried ranks.", "259": "He caught the Lacedæmonians in a moment of confusion, when they were not standing ready to make an attack, for Kleombrotus had not time either to extend his right, or to bring the troops back again and close up the ranks.", "260": "Yet the Spartans, skilled as they were to the highest pitch in war, had been specially educated and practised in changing their formation without disorder or confusion;", "261": "each man used any other as his right-hand or rear-rank man, and wherever danger threatened they would meet it, forming and fighting simultaneously.", "262": "But now, when the main Theban phalanx under Epameinondas, projecting before all the rest of the line, bore down upon them, and when Pelopidas, by a charge of inconceivable speed and daring was already amongst their ranks, their spirit and discipline was so shaken that the rout and slaughter of the Spartans was such as had never been before.", "263": "In this victory and success as much glory belonged to Pelopidas, though not one of the generals, and only in command of a few men, as to Epameinondas, who was Bœotarch and leader of the whole force.", "264": "XXIV.", "265": "In the invasion of Peloponnesus they were both Bœotarchs, and they brought over to their side most of the nations there, for they detached from the Lacedæ­ monian alliance Elis, Argos, the whole of Arcadia, and most part of Laconia itself.", "266": "It was mid-winter, a few days only remained of the last month, and with the new year the law was that the commands should be delivered up and new generals chosen.", "267": "Death was the penalty in case of disobedience, and all the other Bœotarchs, fearing this law and wishing to avoid the severe weather, wished to withdraw the army homewards, but Pelopidas first, supported by Epameinondas, encouraged his fellow citizens, and crossed the Eurotas.", "268": "He took many of their towns and wasted all their country up to the sea-coast, with an army of 70,000 Greeks, of whom the Thebans formed less than a twelfth part.", "269": "But the great reputation which these men enjoyed made the rest follow them without any formal vote or decree to do so;", "270": "for the first and most fundamental law is that which makes men in need of help follow him who can save them;", "271": "and even if, like men sailing on a calm sea or anchored close to port, they sometimes murmur at and brave their pilot, yet in time of danger and storm they look up to him and place all their hopes in him, so the Argives and Eleans and Arcadians would at the council-board dispute the Theban claims to supremacy, but in war and at critical moments they of their own accord obeyed the Theban generals.", "272": "In this campaign, Arcadia was consolidated into one state;", "273": "they also separated Messenia, which had been annexed by the Spartans, and bringing back the Messenian exiles established them in the old capital, Ithome.", "274": "On their homeward march through Kenchreæ they gained a victory over the Athenians, who attempted to harass them and hinder their march through the narrow isthmus of Corinth.XXV.", "275": "After these exploits all men were full of admira­ tion and wonder at their courage and success, but at home the envious feelings of their countrymen and political opponents, which grew along with the growth of their renown, prepared a most scurvy reception for them.", "276": "On their return they were both tried for their lives, on the ground that whereas the law is that during the first month of the year, which they call Boukation, the Bœotarchs must lay down their office, they had held it for four additional months, during which they had been settling the affairs of Messenia, Laconia, and Arcadia.", "277": "Pelopidas was tried first, and so incurred the greater danger, but both were acquitted.", "278": "Epameinondas, who thought that true courage and magnanimity was best shown by forbearance in political strife, bore this contemptible attack with patience, but Pelopidas, who was of a hotter temper, and whose friends encouraged him to revenge, chose this for its opportunity.", "279": "Menekleides the orator had been one of the conspirators who came with Pelopidas and Mellon to Charon's house.", "280": "As, after the revolution, he did not obtain equal rights with the rest, being a man of great ability in speaking, but reckless and ill-conditioned, he took to using his powers to slander and assail the men in power, and was not silenced even by the result of that trial.", "281": "He got Epameinondas turned out of his office of Boeotarch, and for a long time succeeded in lessening his influence in the state;", "282": "but Pelopidas he could not misrepresent to the people, so he endeavoured to make a quarrel between him and Charon.", "283": "He used the usual method of detractors, who if they themselves be inferior to the object of their spite, try at any rate to prove that he is inferior to some one else;", "284": "and having the ear of the people, he was ever singing the praises of Charon, and uttering panegyrics on his skill and his success.", "285": "He endeavoured to set up a memorial of the cavalry battle at Platæa, before the battle of Leuktra, in which the Thebans under Charon were victorious, in the following manner.", "286": "Androkydes of Kyzikus had been entrusted by the state with the task of painting a picture of some other battle, and had been engaged on it at Thebes.", "287": "When the war broke out, this picture, nearly completed, was left in the hands of the Thebans;", "288": "and Menekleides persuaded them to put it up publicly and to write on it the name of Charon, in order to throw the glory of Pelopidas and Epameinond is into the shade ;", "289": "a silly exhibition of ill-feeling indeed, to compare one poor skirmish, in which Gerandas, an obscure Spartan, and some forty men fell, with the great and important services of the others.", "290": "Pelopidas indicted this proposal as illegal, arguing that it was not the custom of the Thebans to show honour to individuals, but to keep alive the name of a victory for the glory of the country at large.", "291": "He bestowed unmeasured praise upon Charon throughout the trial, and proved Menekleides to be a malignant slanderer.", "292": "He was fined a large sum, and not being able to pay it, subsequently endeavoured to bring about a revolution in the state;", "293": "by which one gains some insight into his character.", "294": "XXVI.", "295": "Alexander, the tyrant of Pherme, was at this time at open war with many states of Thessaly, and threatened the independence of all.", "296": "Ambassadors from these states were sent to Thebes, begging for a military force and a general to be despatched to their assistance.", "297": "Pelopidas, since Epameinondas was busy settling the affairs of Peloponnesus, offered himself to the Thessalians, as he could not bear that his talents and skill should lie idle, and he thought that where Epameinondas was, no second general could be needed.", "298": "So he marched with a sufficient army into Thessaly, took Larissa, and, when Alexander begged for terms of peace, endeavoured to convert him into a mild and I aw-abiding ruler.", "299": "But he, a wild, desperate, cruel barbarian, when he was accused of insolent and grasping practices, and Pelopidas used harsh and angry language, went off in a rage, with his body-guard.", "300": "Pelopidas, having relieved the Thessalians from fear of the tyrant, and reconciled them one to another, proceeded to Macedonia.", "301": "Here Ptolemy was at war with Alexander the king of Macedonia, and each of them had sent for him to act as arbitrator and judge between them, thinking that he would right whichever of them should prove to have been wronged.", "302": "He came, and settled their dispute, and after bringing back the exiled party, took Philip, the king's brother, and thirty other sons of the noblest families as hostages, and kept them at Thebes, to show the Greeks how far the Theban policy extended, merely through its reputation for power and for justice.", "303": "This was that Philip who afterwards endeavoured to enslave Greece ;", "304": "at that time he was but a lad, and lived in the house of Pammenes.", "305": "On this account he was thought to be an imitator of Epameinondas, and perhaps he did take to heart that great man's energy in war, which was one of his virtues, but as to the spirit of self..", "306": "restraint, justice, magnanimity and mildness, which formed the true greatness of his character, of this Philip neither by nature or education had the least idea.", "307": "XXVII.", "308": "After these events, the Thessalians again com­ plained of Alexander of Pherme for attacking their cities, and Pelopidas and Ismenias were sent as ambassadors to them.", "309": "Pelopidas, however, brought no army with him, as no war was expected, and was forced to make use of the native Thessalians in this emergency.", "310": "As affairs in Macedonia had again fallen into disorder (for Ptolemy had assassinated the king, and was in possession of the novereignty, while the friends of the deceased invited Pelopidas to interfere), he wished to do something;", "311": "and having no troops of his own, he hired some local merce­ naries and marched off at once against Ptolemy.", "312": "When they drew near to each other, Ptolemy by bribes induced the mercenaries to desert to himself, but, fearing the mere name and prestige of Pelopidas, he went out to him as though he were the more powerful of the two, and after greeting him and begging him to be his friend, he agreed to hold the kingdom in trust for the brothers of the deceased king, and to form a defensive and offensive alliance with Thebes.", "313": "For the fulfilment of these conditions he gave as hostages his own son Philoxenus and fifty of his companions, whom Pelopidas sent to Thebes, but as he was angry at the desertion of his mercenaries, and learned that their property, wives and children were for the most part placed in Pharsalus, so that by capturing that place he could make them pay the penalty of their crime, he got together a force of Thessalians and came to Pharsalus.", "314": "When he was just arrived, Alexander the tyrant appeared with his army.", "315": "Pelopidas and his friends supposed that he had come to establish his innocence, and went to meet him, knowing him to be profligate and bloodthirsty, yet fearing no harm, because of the name of Thebes and their own personal prestige.", "316": "But he, when he saw them approaching him unarmed and alone, at once secured them and took Pharsalus, striking fear and terror into all his subjects;", "317": "for they expected that after an act of such daring lawless­ ness he would spare no one, but treat them as one who had made up his mind to lose his own life.", "318": "XXVIII.", "319": "The Thebans when they heard of this were greatly moved, and at once despatched an army to the rescue, but on account of some quarrel with Epameinondas they appointed others to the command.", "320": "The tyrant took Pelopidas to Pheræ, and at first allowed any who chose tc converse with him, supposing that he would be cast down and humbled by his misfortunes;", "321": "but when the people of Pherme came to lament over him, Pelopidas bade them be of good courage, as now if ever the tyrant would have to pay the penalty of his crimes :", "322": "and he sent a message to the tyrant himself, saying that he was a strange man, to torture and murder his wretched and innocent citizens every day, and to spare him, who he knew would be sure to wreak vengeance on him if he should escape.", "323": "The tyrant, admiring his spirit and fearlessness, said, \" What!", "324": "does Pelopidas wish to die?\"", "325": "The other, hearing of this answered, \"Yes, that you may become even more hateful to heaven than you are now, and so may die sooner.", "326": "\"Hereupon he prevented the people from having access to him, but Thebe, the daughter of Jason, and Alexander's.", "327": "wife, having heard from the guards of Pelopidas of his daring and nobleness, desired to see the man and converse with him.", "328": "When she was come she did not, woman-like, at once perceive the greatness of his mind in the position in which he was, but judging from his short-cut hair, his dress and his food, that he was treated ill and not as became such a man, she wept.", "329": "Pelopidas, not knowing at first who she was, was surprised at this, but, when he knew her, addressed her by her father's name, for he was a companion and friend of Jason.", "330": "When she said, “ I pity your wife,\" “So do I pity you,\" answered he, \" that without being a prisoner you stay with Alexander.\"", "331": "This speech somehow touched the lady, for she was grieved at the ferocity and licentiousness of the tyrant, who, besides his other atrocities, had debauched her youngest brother.", "332": "She constantly visited Pelopidas, and, talking to him of her sufferings, became filled with courage, and with hatred of Alexander.", "333": "XXIX.", "334": "The Theban generals invaded Thessaly, but through incompetence or misfortune effected nothing, and had to retreat in disgrace.", "335": "The state fined them ten thou­ sand drachmas, but sent Epameinondas with the army.", "336": "There was at once a great fluttering of hope among the cities of Thessaly at the reputation of that general, and the cause of the tyrant tottered to its fall, such fear fell upon his officers and friends, and such a longing to subvert his government upon his subjects, who viewed the future with hope, as now they expected to see the tyrant meet with his deserts.", "337": "However, Epameinondas, disregard­ ing his own glory in comparison with the safety of Pelopidas, and fearing that if Alexander were driven to despair by seeing his kingdom falling to pieces, he might turn upon him like a wild beast, conducted the war remissly.", "338": "By degrees and after slow preparation he sur­ rounded the tyrant and confined him to one spot, so as to be able to check any attack that he might venture on, and yet not to excite his savage and ferocious nature;", "339": "for he had heard of his cruelty and disregard of what is right, and how he would bury men alive, and dress them in the skins of wild boars and bears and then set dogs at them and hunt them with spears, making this his sport, and how he surrounded two peaceful cities, Melibœa and Skottusa, with his body-guard when the inhabitants were at their public assembly, and slew them all from the youth upwards, and how he had consecrated and crowned the spear with which he killed his uncle Polyphron, and used to address prayers to it and call it the Slayer.", "340": "Once when he saw a tragedian performing Euripides' tragedy, the ‘ Troades,' he went suddenly out of the theatre, and sent a message to him to be of good courage, and not act worse for this, for he had not left the house because he disliked his acting, but because he felt ashamed that the citizens should see him weeping at the woes of Ilekuba and Andromache, though he never had pitied any of the people whom he had put to death himself.", "341": "But lie, terrified by the prestige and reputation of Epameinondas for strategy, \"Let fall his feathers like a craven cock,\" and quickly sent an embassy to him to make peace.", "342": "Epameinondas scorned to make a treaty of peace and friendship between the Thebans and such a man, but agreed to an armistice for thirty days, and taking Pelo­ pidas and Ismenias returned home.", "343": "XXX.", "344": "When the Thebans heard that ambassadors were being sent from Athens and Sparta to the Great King to make an alliance with him, they also sent Pelcpidas, a step most advantageous to his reputation.", "345": "As he went on his journey through the Persian provinces he excited the greatest admiration, for the fame of his victories over the Lacedæmonians had spread trumpet-tongued through Asia, and from the time of his first success at Leuktra it.", "346": "had begun to reach far and wide, some new exploit being ever added to it, till it reached to the furthest peoples.", "347": "Next, when he reached the court, he was an object of wonder and interest to the satraps, generals, and officers there. \"", "348": "This is the man,\" they said, \" who destroyed the Lacedæmonian dominion over sea and land, and who reduced to the little state at the foot of Taygetus by the Eurotas, that Sparta which a little while before went to war under Agesilaus with the Great King himself about Susa and Ecbatana.\"", "349": "At this Artaxerxes himself was pleased, and admired Pelopidas and showed him great honour, as he wished it to appear that he was courted and sought after by the most powerful Greeks.", "350": "After an in­ terview, in which he found that he spoke with sounder sense than the Athenians, and greater simplicity than tho Spartans, he esteemed him still more, and after the fashion", "351": "Of monarchs, did not conceal his regard, but let the other ambassadors see plainly that he was highest in favour.", "352": "Of all the Greeks he showed Antalkidas the greatest honour, when he took off his own wreath of flowers at table and dipping it in scent, gave it him to put on.", "353": "He attempted no such refinements with Pelopidas, but gave him presents, more splendid and valuable than was customary, and assented to his proposals that all Greek states should be independent, that Messenia should be reconstituted, and that the Thebans should be accounted the king's old friends.", "354": "With these answers, and none of the presents except such as were pledges of friendship and good will, he re­ turned, to the great discredit of the other ambassadors.", "355": "The Athenians condemned and executed Timagoras, and if it was for the amount of presents which he received, rightly enough;", "356": "for he not only took silver and gold, but a costly bed and slaves to make it, as if Greeks did not know how, and also eighty cows and their herdsmen, on the pretence of wanting cow's milk for some weakness that he suffered from;", "357": "and at last he went down to the sea- coast carried in a palanquin, and four talents were given by the king to his bearers-still, it does not seem to have been his venality which especially disgusted the Athenians.", "358": "At any rate, Epikrates, called the \"Bearded,\" once brought a motion before the assembly that instead of electing nine archons yearly they should send nine poor citizens as ambassadors to the Great King, that they might be enriched by him, at which there was great laughter.", "359": "But it was because of the success of the Thebans that they were so vexed, not reflecting on the power of Pelopidas's name, and how far it outweighed all their rhetoric in the estimation of one who always inclined to the stronger side.", "360": "XXXI.", "361": "On his return, Pelopidas was welcomed with no little gratitude because he had re-established Messenia, and obtained freedom for all other Greeks.", "362": "But Alexander of Pheræ had relapsed into his old courses, and had ravaged the territory of many cities of Thessaly.", "363": "The Phthiot Achæans and Magnetos formed a league to oppose him, and hearing of Pelopidas's return, these cities sent to Thebes begging for a force to help them and for him as its general.", "364": "The Thebans willingly decreed this, but when all was ready and the general was about to march, the sun was eclipsed and darkness fell upon the city.", "365": "Pelopidas, seeing that all men were disheartened at this, thought that it was useless to force frightened men full of presage of evil, to march with him, nor did he like to risk the lives of six thousand citizens, but he offered his own services to the Thessalians, and took with him three hundred horsemen, volunteers and men of other states.", "366": "With this force he started, though forbidden by the prophets and against the will of his fellow citizens, who all held that a great portent had been shown in heaven about some celebrated man.", "367": "However, he was all the fiercer against Alexander, remembering his own sufferings, and hoping from his conversations with Thêbê, that by this time his own family would have turned against him.", "368": "lie was also much encouraged by the glory of the action, that, at a time when the Lacedæmonians were sending out generals and governors to help Dionysius the Sicilian tyrant, and when the Athenians had Alexander in their pay, and had even set up a bronze statue of him as a public benefactor, he might show the Greeks that it was the Thebans alone who took up arms in defence of the op­ pressed, and who put an end to the violent and illegal rule of despots in Greece.", "369": "XXXII.", "370": "When he had come to Pharsalus and col­ lected his army there, he marched straight to attack Alexander.", "371": "But he, seeing that Pelopidas's force of Thebans was small, while he had more than double his numbers of Thessalian hoplites, met him near the shrine of Thetis.", "372": "When some one said to Pelopidas that the tyrant was coming on with a great force,

strong position, he was able to cut down the foremost, while the rest suffered from his missiles and could do nothing.", "378": "Pelopidas now recalled the cavalry, and sent it to attack the enemy's position in flank, while he himself took his shield and ran to join the infantry in their fight on the hill.", "379": "Pushing his way through their ranks till he reached the front he infused such strength and ardour into them, that the enemy thought that they attacked with new bodies as well as new spirit.", "380": "They repulsed one or two assaults, but seeing that the infantry resolutely came on, and also that the cavalry had returned from its pursuit and was threatening their flank, they made an orderly retreat.", "381": "Pelopidas, when he gained the height, saw below him the whole of the enemy not yet beaten, but confused and shaken.", "382": "He stood still and looked around him, seeking Alexander himself.", "383": "When he saw him, on the right, rallying and encouraging his mercenaries, he could no longer restrain his rage, but kindling at the sight, and, reckless of his own person and of his duties as a general, rushed far beyond the rest, shouting and challenging the tyrant to fight.", "384": "He would not await the attack, but took refuge in the ranks of his body-guard.", "385": "Pelopidas attacked these troops and cut them down, wounding several mortally, but they from a distance struck him through his armour with their spears, till the Thessalians in great anxiety charged down the hill to the rescue.", "386": "But he had by this time fallen.", "387": "The

were at the fight did not lay aside their armour, nor unbridle their horses, nor even bind up their wounds, when they heard of his death, but warm as they were from victory, in their arms, flocked round the corpse, piling up near it, as a trophy, the arms of their slain enemies.", "392": "They cut off the manes of their horses, and their own hair, and many went off to their tents, lit no fire,

victory over him.", "393": "As soon as the sad news reached the cities of Thessaly, the chief men, youths, children and priests came forth in procession to receive his body, and carried trophies and

being much enraged, summoned the man before the Senate.", "448": "He attempted many quibbles and subterfuges, and ap­ pealed to the tribunes of the people to support him, but as they refused his application he betook himself to plead­ ing denial of the charge.", "449": "There being no witnesses of what he had said, the Senate decided to send for the boy, and when they saw how he blushed and wept with a modesty mingled with unquenchable rage, they, without requiring any other proof, found Capitolinus guilty, and condemned him to pay a fine, with which Marcellus had silver libation vessels made, and consecrated them to the gods.", "450": "III.", "451": "After twenty-two years the first Punic War came to an end, and the Romans turned their attention to Gaulish troubles.", "452": "The Insubrians, a Celtic tribe dwelling in Italy at the foot of the Alps, powerful by themselves, were collecting other forces, and enrolling all those Gauls who fought for hire, called Gæsatæ.", "453": "It was a wonderful and fortunate circumstance that this Celtic war did not break out at the same time as that with Carthage, but that the Gauls, like the gladiator who waits to fight with the survivor of a pair o combatants, had remained quiet during the whole of that war, and now stepped forward and challenged the victors when they were at leisure.", "454": "Yet the war caused much terror, because it would take place on their own frontier against their neighbour states, and because of the ancient reputation of the Gauls, whom the Romans seem to fear more than any other nation.", "455": "They once lost their city at their hands, and afterwards passed a law that the priests should be exempt from all military service, except in case of another war with Gaul.", "456": "Their alarm was shown both by their preparations (for it is said that never before or since were there so many thousand Romans under arms), and by their extraordinary sacrifices.", "457": "For though they never observe the barbarous ceremonies of foreigners, but as far as possible are humane and like the Greeks in their religion, on the outbreak of this war they were compelled to follow certain prophecies in the Sibylline books, and bury alive two Greeks, a man and a woman, and likewise two Gauls, in the place called the Cattle Market:", "458": "and in accordance with these prophecies they still up to this day in the month of November perform religious mysteries, which may not be seen or spoken of by either Greeks or Gauls.", "459": "IV.", "460": "At the beginning of the war the Romanswere some­ times victorious and sometimes defeated, without coming to any decisive action, until the consulate of Flaminius and Furius, who led a great army against the Insubrians.", "461": "Then the river that passes through Picenum ran blood, and it was said that three moons were seen at the city of Ariminum, and the augurs, who watch the omens at the consular elections, declared that the appointment of these consuls was wrong and of evil omen for the people.", "462": "Hereupon the Senate immediately sent despatches to the camp recalling the consuls, that they might as soon as possible return and lay down their office and so undertake nothing as consuls against the enemy.", "463": "Flaminius, when he received these despatches, did not open them before he had routed the barbarians in battle and overrun their country.", "464": "So when he returned to Rome loaded with spoil, the people did not go out to meet him, but, because he had not at once obeyed his orders, and had treated them with insolent contempt, very nearly refused him his triumph, and after the triumph reduced him to a private station, forcing both him and his colleague to give up their office.", "465": "So much regard had the Romans for religion, that they would not on occasions of the greatest good fortune over­ look any neglect of the prophecies and customs of their ancestors, holding it more important for the safety of the state that their generals should reverence the gods than that they should conquer the enemy.", "466": "V.", "467": "As an example of this, Tiberius Sempronius, a man second to no one in Rome for courage and virtue, named as his successors when consul Scipio Nasica and Caius Marcius, and when they were actually in possession of their provinces and armies he happened to consult a book of sacred ritual, and found in it an old custom which he did not know before.", "468": "It was to this effect.", "469": "When a consul has hired a house or tent outside the city to watch the flight of birds, if he be obliged before any certain omen appears, to return to the city for what cause soever, he must give up the place which he hired and take another, and make his observation over again from the beginning.", "470": "This, it seems, Tiberius did not know, and it was after rising the same place twice that he named these men consuls.", "471": "Afterwards, having discovered his error, he laid the matter before the Senate;", "472": "and that body did not despise this apparently slight irregularity, but sent despatches to the men, who at once left their provinces, returned to Rome, and resigned their office.", "473": "Now this happened in later times ;", "474": "but in the very times of which we write two men of the best family were deprived of the priesthood:", "475": ".Cornelius Cethegus, because he handled the entrails improperly at a sacrifice, and Quintus Sulpicius, because when he was sacrificing, the created hat which he wore as flamen, fell off his head.", "476": "And because, when Minucius the dictator was appointing Caius Flaminius his master of the knights, the mouse which is called the coffin-mouse was heard to squeak, they turned them out of their office and elected others.", "477": "But, though so elaborately careful in trifles, they never admitted any superstitious observance, and neither altered nor added anything to their ancestral ritual.", "478": "VI.", "479": "When Flaminius and his colleague had resigned their offices, Marcellus was designated consul by the interreges.†", "480": "On entering upon his office he nominated Cnæus Cornelius as his colleague.", "481": "It was said that the Gauls were offering terms of reconciliation, and that the Senate wished for peace with them, but that Marcellus raised the spirit of the people and excited them to con­ tinue the war.", "482": "But still a peace was concluded;", "483": "and it seems to have been the Gæsatæ who renewed the war, by crossing the Alps and stirring up the Insubrians.", "484": "Thirty thousand in number, they joined that tribe, which was many times larger, and in high spirits at once attacked Acerræ, a city beyond the river Po. From that place Britomartus with ten thousand Gæsatæ proceeded to plunder the country near the Po.Marcellus hearing this left his colleague before Acerræ with the infantry, heavy baggage, and one third of the cavalry, and himself, with the rest of the cavalry and about six hundred of the most active foot soldiers, marched night and day till he fell in with the ten thousand Gæsatæ at Clastidium, a Gaulish village which not long before had been subject to the Romans.", "485": "There was no time for rest or refreshment;", "486": "for his arrival was at once perceived by the enemy, and his force despised, as he had so little infantry with him, for the Celts thought nothing of his cavalry.", "487": "Admirable horsemen and proud of their superior skill, they also had greatly the advantage of Mar­ cellus in numbers, and at once, their king riding foremost, charged the Romans with great impetuosity and terrible threats, expecting to sweep them away.", "488": "Marcellus, fearing that they might surround and outflank his small body, spread out his cavalry, thinning and widening his line, until he presented a front nearly equal to that of the enemy.", "489": "He was now advancing to the charge, when his horse, scared at the terrible display of the enemy, turned short round, and forcibly carried him back.", "490": "Marcellus, fearing that this might cause superstitious terror to the Romans, hastily wheeled his horse round on the bridle hand, and having again directed him against the enemy, paid his adorations to the sun, as though he had made this circle not by chance, but of set purpose ;", "491": "for the Romans have this custom, of turning round to worship the gods, and so he, as he was on the point of joining battle, vowed that he would consecrate the finest of the enemies' arms to Jupiter Feretrius.", "492": "VII.", "493": "At this moment the king of the Gauls, seeing him, and conjecturing from his dress that he was the Roman leader, rode out far beyond the rest, and made directly for him, defiantly shouting a challenge, and brandishing his spear.", "494": "He was a man distinguished from the rest of the Gauls by his tall stature and his complete armour, which glittered like the lightning with gold and silver and all kinds of gay devices with which it was incrusted.", "495": "Mar­ cellus, as he looked along the enemy's line, thought that these were the finest arms, and were those about which he had made his vow to Jupiter Feretrius.", "496": "He rushed upon the Gaul, pierced his breastplate with his spear, and by the impetus of his horse bore him to the ground alive, and with a second and third thrust killed him at once.", "497": "Leaping from his horse and seizing the armour of the dead man, he said, looking up to heaven, \" Jupiter Feretrius, thou that seest the great deeds of generals and captains in war, I call thee to witness that I am the third Roman general that has slain the enemy's general and king, by killing this man here with my own hand :", "498": "and having killed him I consecrate to thee the first and fairest of the spoils.", "499": "But do thou grant us like good fortune in the rest of this war.", "500": "\"Hereupon the Roman cavalry charged, not against cavalry by itself, but they fought against infantry and cavalry mixed together, and won a victory of an unparal­ leled and wonderful kind;", "501": "for never before or since that day did such a body of horsemen rout such numbers of horse and foot.", "502": "Having slain the greater part of them, and collected their arms and stores, he returned to his colleague, who was with difficulty holding his own against the Celts before the walls of the largest and most populous of Gaulish cities.", "503": "It is called Mediolanum, and is regarded by the Cisalpine Gauls as their metropolis:", "504": "consequently they fought vigorously in its defence, and more besieged Cornelius than were besieged by him.", "505": "But when Marcellus arrived, the Gæsatæ, as soon as they heard of the defeat and death of their king, went home.", "506": "Mediolanum fell, and the Celts of their own accord surrendered the other cities, and threw themselves upon the mercy of the Romans.", "507": "They received moderate terms of peace.", "508": "VIII.", "509": "By a decree of the Senate Marcellus alone triumphed.", "510": "His procession was glorious, as few others have been, with the splendour and value of the booty exhibited, and the great stature of the captives;", "511": "but the strangest and most interesting sight of all was the general himself, as he appeared carrying the suit of armour of the Gaul to offer it to the god.", "512": "He had cut and trimmed the trunk of a tall young oak tree, and had tied and hung the spoils upon it, each put in its proper place.", "513": "When the procession began, he himself mounted his chariot and four, and carried in state through the city, this the most glorious of all his trophies of victory.", "514": "The army marched after him with their finest armour, singing as they went songs and pæans of victory in honour of the gods and their leader.", "515": "Thus he pro­ ceeded till he reached the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.", "516": "Here he dismounted, and dedicated his spoils, being the third, and, up to our day, the last who ever did so:", "517": "first comes Romulus, with the spoils of Acron of Cæninum;", "518": "second, Cornelius Cossus offered the spoils of Tolumnius the Etruscan;", "519": "third, Marcellus offered these spoils of Britomartus, the king of the Gauls;", "520": "after Marcellus, no man.", "521": "The god to whom they are offered is called Jupiter Feretrius, according to some, from the trophy being carried upon a feretrum, or bier, as it is called in the Greek tongue, which then was much mixed with the Latin;", "522": "but ac­ cording to others, it is an attribute of Jupiter the Thun­ derer, for the Romans call striking ferire.", "523": "Others say that the name comes from striking the enemy;", "524": "fbr even now in battle when they are pursuing the enemy they keep shouting, \" Feri,” that is, \" Strike,\" to one another.", "525": "The word for ordinary spoils is spolia, but for these 8polia opima.", "526": "Yet it is said that Numa Pompilius speaks of first, second, and third degrees of spolia opima, ordering the first to be offered to Jupiter Feretrius, the second to Mars, and the third to Quirinus;", "527": "and that for the first the prize is three hundred ases, two hundred for the second, and one hundred for the third.", "528": "But the most common story runs that those spoils alone are spolia opima which are taken at a pitched battle, and first of all, and by the general of the one side from the general of the other.", "529": "But of these things enough.", "530": "The Roman people were so overjoyed at that victory and the end of the war that they made from the money paid to ransom captives, a golden statue, and sent it to Apollo at Delphi as a thank-offering, and gave a magni­ ficent share of the booty to their allies, and even sent many presents to Hiero the king of Syracuse, their friend and ally.", "531": "IX.", "532": "When Hannibal invaded Italy, Marcellus was sent with an army to Sicily:", "533": "but when the disaster at Cannæ took place, where many thousand Romans perished, and only a few fugitives collected at Canusium, it was expected that Hannibal would at once march to attack Rome, as he had cut off the greater part of the army.", "534": "Marcellus at once sent a garrison of fifteen hundred men to guard the city, and afterwards, in obedience to a senatus-consultum, went to Canusium, and taking command of the fugitives collected there, led them out of their fortified camp, to show that he would not deliver up the country to the enemy.", "535": "The Romans had lost many of their most capable leaders in the wars, and Fabius Maximus, who had the greatest reputation, was blamed by them for sloth and want of enterprise because of his excessive caution in avoiding a defeat.", "536": "Thinking, therefore, that he was an excellent general for defence, not for attack, they cast their eyes upon Marcellus, and in order to combine his vigour and daring with the cautious and fat seeing tactics of the other, they at one time elected them both consuls, at another made the one consul with the other serving as proconsul.", "537": "Poseidonius tells us that Fabius was called the shield of the state, and Marcellus the sword.", "538": "And Hannibal himself said that he feared Fabius as a schoolmaster, but regarded Marcellus as an antagonist, for the former prevented his doing any mischief, while the latter might make him suffer some.X.", "539": "At first Hannibal's soldiers, elated with their victory, roamed with careless confidence out of their camp and plundered the country;", "540": "where Marcellus fell upon them, and by a series of defeats considerably weakened them.", "541": "Next he went to Naples and Nola.", "542": "At Naples he encouraged the citizens, who of their own accord wished well to the Roman cause;", "543": "but at Kola he found the city in a state of faction, as the senate were unable to restrain the populace, who favoured Hannibal.", "544": "There was one Bandius, a man of the first nobility of the city, and renowned for bravery.", "545": "This man had fought at Cannæ with conspicuous valour, and had slain many Carthaginians.", "546": "When after the battle he was found in a heap of slain with his body pierced with darts, Hannibal, in admiration of his courage, not only dismissed him without ransom, but gave him presents and made him a personal friend.", "547": "Bandius, out of gratitude, was one of the most eager partisans of Hannibal, and, having great influence with the people, was urging them to revolt.", "548": "Marcellus thought that it Would be a crime to put to death a man of such glorious antecedents, and who had taken part in one of the greatest struggles of the Romans;", "549": "and, besides his natural kindliness, being able by his conversation to win over any man of noble nature, he on one occasion when greeted by Bandius inquired who he might be, though he knew very well, but merely wanted a pretext and oppor­ tunity for conversation with him.", "550": "For, when he answered, “ Lucius Bandius,\" Marcellus, as though surprised and pleased, said, \"Are you indeed that Bandius, of whom all those who fought at Cannæ told us at Rome, the only man who did not desert Paulus Æmilius the consul, but who received upon his own body the greater part of the darts which were aimed at him ?", "551": "\"", "552": "Bandius admitted that he was the man, and endeavoured to speak lightly of his wounds, but Marcellus went on :", "553": "“", "554": "Then, as you bear about you such marks of your devotion to our cause, why did you not at once come to me ?", "555": "Do you think us slow to requite the valour of our friends, when it is honoured even by the enemy.\"", "556": "Having spoken to him thus courteously, he embraced him, and presented him with a war-horse and five hundred silver drachmas.", "557": "XI.", "558": "After this Bandius became the firmest partisan and ally of Marcellus, and a terrible denouncer and assailant of the opposite party.", "559": "This was a numerous one;", "560": "and their design was, when the Romans should march out of the town against the enemy, to attack their baggage.", "561": "Mar. celIna, therefore, having marshalled his troops within the city, brought the baggage to the gates, and by proclama­ tion forbade the people of Nola to approach the walls.", "562": "Thus no force was visible, and he induced Hannibal to march up to the city in disorderly array, as he supposed that within it all was confusion.", "563": "Then Marcellus ordered the gate nearest him to be thrown open, and with the best equipped of his cavalry charged out of it and fell upon the enemy hand to hand.", "564": "Presently the infantry poured out of another gate, running with loud shouts:", "565": "and while Hannibal was dividing his forces to deal with them a third gate opened, and from it issued the remainder of the army, and from all sides attacked the Carthaginians, who were bewildered at the unexpectedness of the attack, and fought without spirit against their immediate assailants, because of the others who they saw would soon beset them.", "566": "There first did Hannibal's troops give way before the Romans, and were chased with great loss into their camp.", "567": "It is said that more than five thousand perished, and that no more than five hundred Romans fell.", "568": "But Livy does not consider that a great defeat took place, or that so many of the enemy fell, but he points out that Marcellus gained much glory by that battle, and that the Roman people took courage after their misfortunes, thinking that it was not against an unconquerable and invulnerable foe that they were fighting, but one who could be made to Buffer as well as themselves.", "569": "XII.", "570": "For this reason, as one of the consuls was dead, the people called for Marcellus, though he was absent, to become his successor;", "571": "and in spite of the efforts of the government they put off the day of election until he came to Rome from the army.", "572": "He was elected consul by the votes of all the tribes, but it thundered at the time, and as the priests declared this an unpropitious omen, but did not dare openly to oppose his election for fear of the people, he himself voluntarily resigned his office.", "573": "But he did not avoid military service, but was created proconsul, and returning to Nola and his army he harassed those who had chosen the side of Hannibal.", "574": "When the latter hastily marched to the assistance of his friends, and offered to fight a pitched battle with Marcellus, he declined ;", "575": "but subsequently, when the greater part of the Carthaginian army was scattered in search of plunder, and no longer expecting an attack, he fell upon it.", "576": "He had distributed long lances, such as are used on ship-board, among his infantry, and instructed them to watch their opportunity and hurl these from a distance at the Carthaginians, who had no javelin-men, and whose heavy spears were only used to thrust with at close quarters.", "577": "In consequence, it seems, of this, all who engaged with the Romans that day turned their backs and shamefully fled, losing five thousand killed, six hundred prisoners;", "578": "while of their elephants, four were killed and two taken alive.", "579": "And, what was of the greatest importance of all, on the third day after the above battle, three hundred Spanish and Numidian cavalry deserted to the Romans, a thing which never had happened to Hannibal before, as, although his army was composed of so many different nations, he had been able for a very long time to inspire it with the same spirit.", "580": "These men faithfully served Marcellus and the generals who succeeded him.", "581": "XIII.", "582": "Marcellus, when elected consul for the third time, sailed to Sicily;", "583": "for Hannibal's successes in the war had encouraged the Carthaginians to recover that island, especially as Syracusan politics were in a disturbed stato in consequence of the death of the despot Hieronymus;", "584": "and on this account a Roman army under Appius had already been sent there.", "585": "When Marcellus had taken the command of this army, he received a large accession of Roman soldiers, whose misfortune was as follows.", "586": "Of the troops who fought with Hannibal at Cannae, some fled, and some were taken alive, in such numbers that the Romans scarcely thought that they had left sufficient citizens to man the city walls, but this remnant was so full of pride and so great of soul, that, though Hannibal offered to release the captives for a small ransom, they would not take them, but refused by a decree of the Senate, and endured to see some of them put to death, and others sold out of Italy as slaves.", "587": "The mass of those who had saved themselves by flight they sent to Sicily, with orders not to set foot on the soil of Italy until the war with Hannibal was over.", "588": "So when Marcellus went to Sicily, these men came in a body into his presence, and falling on the ground before him besought him to permit them to serve as honourable soldiers, promising with cries and tears that they would prove by their actions that it was more by their bad fortune than their cowardice that the defeat at Canna) took place.", "589": "Marcellus was touched with compassion, and wrote to the Senate asking to be allowed to fill up from these men the vacancies which would occur in the ranks of his army.", "590": "Much discussion followed ;", "591": "and at last the Senate decreed that Rome did not require the services of cowardly citizens, but, if Marcellus nevertheless wished to make use of them, they must not receive any of the crowns and other rewards which are commonly bestowed by generals as the prizes of valour.", "592": "This decree vexed Marcellus, and after the war in Sicily he returned to Rome and blamed the Senate that, in spite of all that he had done for them, they would not allow him to relieve so many citizens from such a miserable position.", "593": "XIV.", "594": "In Sicily, at this time, he had just cause of complaint against Hippokrates the Syracusan general, who, favouring the Carthaginian side, and wishing to establish himself as despot, put to death many Romans at Leontini.", "595": "Marcellus took Leontini by storm, and did no harm to the inhabitants, but flogged and executed all the deserters whom he found Hippokrates first sent to Syracuse a story that Maicellus was exterminating the people of Leontini, and when this report had thrown the city into confusion he fell upon it and made himself master of it.", "596": "Marcellus hereupon proceeded to Syracuse with his whole army, and encamping near the city sent ambassadors to tell them what had really happened in Leontini.", "597": "By this, however, he gained nothing, as the Syracusans would not listen to him (for the party of Hippokrates was in the ascendant).", "598": "He now attacked the city both by sea and land, Appius commanding the land forces, while Marcellus directed a fleet of sixty quinqueremes * full of armed men and missile weapons.", "599": "He raised a vast engine upon a raft made by lashing eight ships together, and sailed with it to attack the wall, trusting to the numbers and excellency of his siege engines, and to his own personal prestige.", "600": "But Archimedes and his machines cared nothing for this, though he did not speak of any of these engines as being constructed by serious labour, but as the more holiday sports of a geometiician.", "601": "He would not indeed have constructed them but at the earnest request of King Hiero, who entreated him to leave the abstract for the concrete, and to bring his ideas within the comprehension of the people by embodying them in tangible forms.", "602": "Eudoxus and Archytas were the first who began to treat of this renowned science of mechanics, cleverly illustrating it, and proving such problems as were hard to understand, by means of solid and actual instruments, as, for instance, both of them resorted to mechanical means to find a mean proportional, which is necessary for the solution of many other geometrical questions.", "603": "This they did by the construction, from various curves and sections, of certain instruments called mesographs.", "604": "Plato was much vexed at this, and inveighed against them for destroying the real excellence of geometry by making it leave the region of pure intellect and come within that of the senses, and become mixed up with bodies which require much base servile labour.", "605": "So mechanics became separated from geometry, and, long regarded with contempt by philosophy, was reckoned among the military arts.", "606": "How­ ever Archimedes, who was a relative and friend of Hiero, wrote that with a given power he could move any given weight whatever, and, as it were rejoicing in the strength of his demonstration, he is said to have declared that if he were given another world to stand upon, he could move this upon which we live.", "607": "Hiero wondered at this, and begged him to put this theory into practice, and show him something great moved by a small force.", "608": "Archimedes took a three-masted ship, a transport in the king's navy, which had just been dragged up on land with great labour and many men ;", "609": "in this he placed her usual complement of men and cargo, and then sitting at some distance, without any trouble, by gently pulling with his hand the end of a system of pullies, he dragged it towards him with as smooth and even a motion as if it were passing over the sea.", "610": "The king wondered greatly at this, and perceiving the value of his arts, prevailed upon Archimedes to construct for him a number of machines, some for the attack and some for the defence of a city, of which he himself did not make use, as he spent most of his life in unwarlike and literary leisure, but now these engines were ready for use in Syracuse, and also, the inventor was present to direct their working.", "611": "XV.", "612": "So when the Romans attacked by sea and land at once, the Syracusans were at first terrified and silent, dreading that nothing could resist such an armament.", "613": "But Archimedes opened fire from his machines, throwing upon the land forces all manner of darts and great stones, with an incredible noise and violence, which no man could withstand ;", "614": "but those upon whom they fell were struck down in heaps, and their ranks thrown into confusion, while some of the ships were suddenly seized by iron hooks, and by a counter-balancing weight were drawn up and then plunged to the bottom.", "615": "Others they caught by irons like hands or claws suspended from cranes, and first pulled them up by their bows till they stood upright upon their sterns, and then cast down into the water, or by means of windlasses and tackles worked inside the city, dashed them against the cliffs and rocks at the base of the walls, with terrible destruction to their crews.", "616": "Often was seen the fearful sight of a ship lifted out of the sea into the air, swaying and balancing about, until the men were all thrown out or overwhelmed with stones from slings, when the empty vessel would either be dashed against the forti­ fications, or dropped into the sea by the claws being let go.", "617": "The great engine which Marcellus was bringing up on the raft, called the Harp, from some resemblance to that instrument, was, while still at a distance, struck by a stone of ten talents weight, and then another and another, which fell with a terrible crash, breaking the platform on which the machine stood, loosening its bolts, and tearing asunder the hulks which supported it.", "618": "Marcellus, despairing of success, drew off his ships as fast as possible, and sent orders to the land forces to retreat.", "619": "In a council of war, it was determined to make another assault by night;", "620": "for they argued that the straining cords which Archimedes used to propel his missiles required a long distance to work in, and would make the shot fly over them at close quar­ ters, and be practically useless, as they required a long stroke.", "621": "But he, it appears, had long before prepared engines suited for short as well as long distances, and short darts to use in them;", "622": "and from many small loop­ holes pierced through the wall small scorpions, as they are called, stood ready to shoot the enemy, though invisible to them.", "623": "XVI.", "624": "When then they attacked, expecting that they would not be seen, they again encountered a storm of blows from stones which fell perpendicularly upon their heads and darts which were poured from all parts of the wall.", "625": "They were forced to retire, and when they came within range of the larger machines missiles were showered upon them as they retreated, destroying many men and throwing the ships into great disorder, without their being able to retaliate.", "626": "For most of the engines on the walls had been devised by Archimedes, and the Romans thought that they were fighting against gods and not men, as destruction fell upon them from invisible hands.", "627": "XVII.", "628": "However, Marcellus escaped unhurt, and sar­ castically said to his own engineers:", "629": "“ Are we to give in to this Briareus of a geometrician, who sits at his ease by the sea-shore and plays at upsetting our ships, to our lasting disgrace, and surpasses the hundred-handed giant of fable by hurling so many weapons at us at once?\"", "630": "For indeed all the other Syracusans were merely the limbs of Archimedes, and his mind alone directed and guided everything.", "631": "All other arms were laid aside and the city trusted to his weapons solely for defence and safety.", "632": "At length Marcellus, seeing that the Romans had become so scared that if only a rope or small beam were seen over the wall they would turn and fly, crying out that Archimedes was bringing some engine to bear upon them, ceased assaulting the place, and trusted to time alone to reduce it.", "633": "Yet Archimedes had so great a mind and such immense philosophic speculations that although by inventing these engines he had acquired the glory of a more than human intellect, he would not condescend to leave behind him any writings upon the subject, regarding the whole business of mechanics and the useful arts as base and vulgar, but placed his whole study and delight in those speculations in which absolute beauty and excellence appear unhampered by the necessities of life, and argument is made to soar above its subject matter, since by the latter only bulk and outward appearance, but by the other accuracy of reasoning and wondrous power, can be attained:", "634": "for it is impossible in the whole science of geometry to find more difficult hypotheses explained on clearer or more simple principles than in his works.", "635": "Some attribute this to his natural genius, others say that his indefatigable industry made his work seem as though it had been done without labour, though it cost much.", "636": "For no man by himself could find out the solution of his problems, but as he reads, he begins to think that he could have discovered it himself, by so smooth and easy a road does he lead one up to the point to be proved.", "637": "One cannot therefore disbelieve the stories which are told of him:", "638": "how he seemed ever bewitched by the song of some indwelling syren of his own so as to forget to eat his food, and to neglect his person, and how, when dragged forcibly to the baths and perfumers, he would draw geometrical figures with the ashes on the hearth, and when his body was anointed would trace lines on it with his finger, absolutely possessed and inspired by the joy he felt in his art.", "639": "He discovered many beautiful problems, and is said to have begged his relatives and friends to place upon his tomb when he died a cylinder enclosing a sphere, and to write on it the proof of the ratio of the containing solid to the contained.", "640": "XVIII.", "641": "Such was Archimedes, who at this time rendered himself, and as far as lay in him, the city, invin­ cible.", "642": "During the blockade Marcellus took Megara, one of the most ancient of the Greek cities in Sicily, and also captured Hippokrates' camp at Acrillæ, with a destruction of more than eight thousand of his men, attacking them just as they were planting the palisades of the rampart.", "643": "He overran a great part of Sicily, induced cities to revolt from Carthage, and beat all forces that opposed him.", "644": "A. time went on, he took prisoner one Damippus, a Spartan, as he was sailing out of the harbour of Syracuse.", "645": "The Syracusans desired to ransom this man, and Marcellus, in the course of many negotiations and conferences about him, noticed that a certain tower was carelessly guarded, and that men might be introduced into it secretly, as the wall near it was easy to climb.", "646": "Having, from his frequent journeys to confer with the besieged near this tower, gained a good idea of its height, he prepared scaling- ladders, and waited till the Syracusans were engaged in celebrating the feast of Artemis, and given up to drinking and amusement.", "647": "Not only did he gain the tower un­ observed, but was able to occupy the whole circuit of wall with his troops, and to break into the Hexapylon.*", "648": "When the Syracusans began to discover their position and muster for their defence, he ordered trumpets to sound on all sides, which produced great terror and tumult, as they imagined that no part of the walls remained untaken.", "649": "Yet the strongest, and that too the largest and finest part of the city, was still left, called Achradina, because it is fortified on the side near the outer town, part of which is called Neapolis, and part Tyche.XIX.", "650": "These parts of the city were captured, and at day­ break Marcellus moved down through the Hexapylon, amidst the congratulations of his officers.", "651": "It is said that when, from the high ground he surveyed that great and fair city, he burst into tears, thinking how sadly it would soon be changed in appearance when sacked by his soldiers.", "652": "For none of his officers dared to oppose the soldiers when they demanded the privilege of plunder, and many encouraged them to burn and destroy.", "653": "But Marcellus would not so much as entertain the idea of this, but, much against his will, was forced to permit them to carry off the movable property and slaves, though he for­ bade them to touch freemen, and gave strict orders that none of the citizens of Syracuse should be slain, dishonoured, or enslaved.", "654": "Yet even after moderating their license to this extent he thought that the city was sadly ill-treated, and even in such a moment of triumph he showed great sorrow and sympathy for it, as he saw such great wealth and mfort swept away in a few hours;", "655": "for the treasure was said to DO not less than that which was afterwards taken in Carthage itself.", "656": "The rest of the city was taken after a short time by treachery, and the soldiers insisted upon plundering it, with the exception of the royal treasury, which was confiscated to the state.", "657": "Marcellus was especially grieved at the fate of Archi­ medes.", "658": "He was studying something by himself upon a figure which he had drawn, to which he had so utterly given up his thoughts and his sight that he did not notice the assault of the Romans and the capture of the city, and when a soldier suddenly appeared before him and ordered him to follow him into the presence of Marcellus, he refused to do so before he had finished his problem and its solution.", "659": "The man hereupon in a rage drew his sword and killed him.", "660": "Others say that the Roman fell upon him at once with a sword to kill him, but he, seeing him, begged him to wait for a little while, that he might not leave his theorem imperfect, and that while he was reflecting upon it, he was slain.", "661": "A third story is that as he was carrying into Marcellus's presence his mathematical instruments, sundials, spheres, and quadrants, by which the eye might measure the magnitude of the sun, some soldiers met with him, and supposing that there was gold in the boxes, slew him.", "662": "But all agree that Marcellus was much grieved, that he turned away from his murderer as­ though he were an object of abhorrence to gods and men, and that he sought out his family and treated them well.", "663": "XX.", "664": "The Romans up to this time had given foreign nations great proofs of their skill in war and their courage in battle, but had not shown any evidences of kindness of heart, clemency, or any social virtue.", "665": "Marcellus seems to have been the first who exhibited the Romans in a more amiable light to the Greeks.", "666": "For he so dealt with his adversaries, and treated so many individuals and cities with kindness that even if any harsh treatment did befall Enna, or Megara, or Syracuse, it was thought to be more by the fault of the vanquished than of the victors.", "667": "I will mention one instance out of many.", "668": "There is a city in Sicily called Engyion, of no great size, but very ancient, and renowned for the appearance there of the goddesses called ‛ Mothers.'", "669": "The foundation of the temple is ascribed to the Cretans, and they used to show certain lancet and helmets inscribed, some with the name of Meriones, some of Ulixes, that is, Odysseus, which were dedicated to these goddesses.", "670": "This city was eager to espouse the Carthaginian side, but was prevailed upon by one Nikias, the leading man of the city, to join the Romans, by freely speaking his mind in the public assembly and proving that his opponents did not consult the true interests of the state.", "671": "These men, fearing his power and high reputation, determined to kidnap him, and deliver him up to the Carthaginians.", "672": "Nikias, discovering this plot, quietly took measures for his own security, but publicly made unseemly speeches about the “ Mothers,\" and spoke of the received tradition of their appearance with doubt and contempt, to the delight of his enemies, as he seemed to be by these actions justifying the treatment which they meant to inflict upon him.", "673": "When all their preparations for seizing him were complete there was a public assembly of the citizens, and Nikias, in the midst of a speech upon state policy, suddenly fell to the ground, and after a short time, as all men were, naturally, silent with surprise, he raised his head, and turning it round he began to speak in deep and trembling tones, which he gradually made shriller and more intense, until, seeing the whole theatre, where the meeting was, silent with horror, he threw off his cloak, tore his tunic, and, half naked, rushed to the gate of the theatre, crying out that he was pursued by the “ Mothers.\"", "674": "As no one dared to touch or stop him, from fear of the gods, but all made way for him, he passed out of the city gate, not omitting any of the cries and trembling of body of a person under demoniacal possession.", "675": "His wife, who was in the secret, and her husband's confederate, first brought her children and prostrated herself as a suppliant before the goddesses, and then under pretence of seeking her wandering husband managed to leave the city without opposition.", "676": "Thus they safely reached Marcellus at Syracuse;", "677": "and when, after enduring many affronts and insolent proceeding from the people of Engyion Marcellus took them all prisoners, and imprisoned them, meaning to put them all to death, Nikias at first stood by weeping, but at length, embracing Marcellus as a suppliant, he begged for the lives of his countrymen, beginning with his own personal enemies, until he relented, and set them all at liberty.", "678": "Nor did he touch their city, but gave Nikias ample lands and rich presents.", "679": "This story is told by Poseidonius the philosopher.", "680": "XXI.", "681": "When the Romans recalled Marcellus, to conduct the war in their own country, ho removed most of the beautiful ornaments of the city of Syracuse, to be admired at his triumphal procession, and to adorn Rome.", "682": "For at that time Rome neither possessed nor knew of any works of art, nor had she any delicacy of taste in such matters.", "683": "Filled with the blood-stained arms and spoils of barbarians, and crowded with trophies of war and memorials of triumphs, she was no pleasant or delightful spectacle, fit to feed the eyes of unwarlike and luxurious spectators, but, as Epameinondas called the plain of Bœotia \"the Stage of Ares,\" and Xenophon called Ephesus \" the Work­ shop of War,\" so, in my opinion, you might call Rome at that time, in the words of Pindar, \" the Domain of Ares, who revels in war.\"", "684": "Wherefore Marcellus gained the greater credit with the vulgar, because he enriched the city with statues possessing the Hellenic grace and truth to nature, while Fabius Maximus was more esteemed by the elders.", "685": "He neither touched nor removed anything of the kind from the city of Tarentum, which he took, but carried off all the money and other property, and let the statues remain, quoting the proverb:", "686": "\" Let us,\" said he, \" leave the Tarentines their angry gods.\"", "687": "They blamed Marcellus's proceedings as being invidious for Rome, because he had led not only men, but also gods as captives in his triumph, and also because the people, who before this were ac­ customed either to fight or to till the ground, and were ignorant of luxury and indolent pleasures, like the Herakles of Euripides, “Unpolished, rough, but skilled in useful arts.” were made by Marcellus into idle, babbling connoisseurs of the fine arts and wasted the greater part of the day in talk about them.", "688": "He, however, prided himself upon this even before creeks, saying that he had taught the ignorant Romans to prize and admire the glories of Greek art.", "689": "XXII.", "690": "Marcellus, whose enemies opposed his claim to a triumph, on the ground that the campaign in Sicily was not completely finished, and that he did not deserve a third triumph, so far gave way as to lead the greater triumphal procession as far as the Alban Mount, and only to enter the city in the lesser form which the Greeks call evan, and the Romans an ovation.", "691": "The general conducts this, not, as in the triumph, riding in a chariot, and four with a crown of laurel, and with trumpets sounding before him, but walking on foot in low shoes surrounded by flute players, and crowned with myrtle, so as to look unwarlike and joyous rather than terrible.", "692": "And this is a great proof to me that in old times it was the manner and not the importance of the things achieved that settled the form of triumph.", "693": "Those generals who had gained their point by battle and slaughter probably made their entry in that martial and terrible fashion, having, as is customary in lustrations of armies, crowned the men and wreathed their arms with abundance of laurel:", "694": "whereas the generals who without an appeal to arms had settled matters satisfactorily by negotiation and persuasive eloquence, were given by custom this peaceful and festive entry into the city.", "695": "For the flute is a peaceful instrument, and the myrtle is the favourite plant of Aphrodite, who above all the gods hates violence and war.", "696": "This form of triumph is called ovation, not from the cry of \" Evan,\" as most people think, for the other also is accompanied with shouts and songs, but the word had been twisted by the Greeks into one that has a meaning in their language, and also they are convinced that some honour is paid to Dionysus in this ceremony, which God we name Evius and Thriambos.", "697": "It is curious to observe that the great Laconian lawgiver arranged the sacrifices differently to those of Rome.", "698": "In Sparta those ex-generals who have accomplished their purpose by persuasion or fraud sacrifice an ox, while those who have done it by battle offer a cock.", "699": "For, though warlike to excess, they thought that a victory gained by clever negotiation was greater and more befitting human beings than one gained by force and courage.", "700": "Which is to be preferred, I leave to my readers' consideration.", "701": "XXIII.", "702": "When Marcellus entered upon his fourth consulship, his enemies induced the Syracusans to send a deputation to Rome, to complain loudly to the Senate of the cruel and unjust treatment which they had received from him.", "703": "Marcellus chanced to be performing some sacrifice in the Capitol;", "704": "so when the Syracusans came to the assembled Senate, begging for a hearing that justice might be done them, the other consul stopped them, feeling that Marcellus ought not to be attacked in his absence.", "705": "But Marcellus as soon as he heard of it, came to the Senate-house, seated himself as consul, on the curule chair, and despatched business;", "706": "then, when this was finished, he came down and placed himself as a private person in the place where men on their trial usually stood, and called on the Syracusans to prove their charges against him.", "707": "They were abashed at his majestic con­ fidence of demeanour, and he who had been invincible in arms seemed to them yet more terrible and unapproach able in his consular purple.", "708": "Nevertheless, encouraged by the enemies of Marcellus, they began their impeachment, and pleaded their cause in a piteous fashion, their chief point being that they, who were friends and allies of the Romans, had been treated in a way in which many other generals had forborne to treat hostile cities.", "709": "Marcellus answered that they had done the Romans much harm, for which they had received no punishment, except such as could not be prevented in war, because victorious soldiers cannot be restrained from sacking a town which they have won, and their city, he said, was taken because they had refused his frequent offers of terms of agreement.", "710": "They could not urge that they had been forced into war by their despots, for they had themselves chosen those very despots with the intention of going to war.", "711": "After both parties had been heard, the Syracusans, according to custom, left the Senate-house.", "712": "Marcellus came out with them, leaving his colleague to preside over the assembly, and stood outside the doors, without altering his usual demeanour, either from fear of the result or anger against the Syracusans, but serenely awaiting the verdict of the Senate.", "713": "When the question was voted upon, and he was an­ nounced successful, the Syracusans prostrated themselves before him, beseeching him with tears to put away his anger against themselves, and to show pity on the city, which was sensible to kindness, and would be grateful to him.", "714": "Maroellus was touched by their appeal;", "715": "he became reconciled to them, and was a constant benefactor to their city.", "716": "He restored them their freedom, their laws, and what remained of their property, and the Senate con­ firmed his acts.", "717": "In return for this, besides many other honours they passed a law that whenever Marcellus or any of his descendants should land in Sicily, the Syra­ cusans should wear garlands of flowers and hold a festival with sacrifices to the gods.", "718": "XXIV.", "719": "Next he proceeded against Hannibal;", "720": "and whereas nearly all the other consuls and generals, after the disaster at Cannæ, had thought of nothing but avoiding battles with him, and no one had dared to measure himself with him in the field, he adopted the opposite course, arguing that while they fancied that they were wearing out Hannibal's army they did not perceive that Italy was being consumed by it.", "721": "Fabius, he urged, thought too much of safety, and by his policy of waiting, Rome, already drooping under its burdens, would at the end of the war perish as well as Hannibal.", "722": "He was, he said, like those timid surgeons who shrink from using decisive remedies, and who mistake the sinking strength of the patient for the abatement of disease.", "723": "His first act was to take some important Samnite towns which had revolted.", "724": "Here he found great stores of corn and money, and took three thousand of Hannibal's soldiers who were there as garrison.", "725": "Next, when Hannibal defeated and killed Cnæus Fulvius, the proconsul in Apulia, with a loss of eleven military tribunes and the greater part of his army, Marcellus sent despatches to Rome, bidding the citizens be of good courage, for he was already on the march, and would abate Hannibal's exultation.", "726": "Livy tells us that these despatches when read did not diminish the grief of the Romans, but added to their fear, as they reflected that the risk they were about to run was so much more serious than the defeat they had sustained, as Marcellus was superior to Fulvius.", "727": "According to his despatch, he instantly marched against Hann bal into Lucania, and finding him en­ trenched on some strong hills near the city of Numistro, he himself encamped in the plain.", "728": "On the following day he was the first to draw out his army in battle array.", "729": "Hannibal descended from his position, and fought a great and well-contested battle, for it began at the third hour, and was scarcely over by dark, but without any decisive result.", "730": "At daybreak he again led out his army and defied Hannibal to fight.", "731": "But Hannibal retired;", "732": "and Marcellus, after stripping the corpses of the enemy, and burying his own dead, pursued.", "733": "His skill and good fortune were greatly admired in this campaign, as he did not fall into any of the numerous ambuscades which were prepared for him by Hannibal, and in all his skirmishes came off victorious.", "734": "For this reason, as the comitia were impend­ ing, the Senate thought that it would be better to call the other consul away from Sicily than to recall Marcellus just as he was thoroughly engaged with Hannibal.", "735": "When the other consul arrived, they bade him name Quintus Fulvius dictator.", "736": "For a dictator is not chosen by the people or by the Senate, but one of the consuls or prætors comes forward publicly and names whom he pleases dictator.", "737": "And this is the reason that the man so named is called dictator;", "738": "for dicere in Latin means to name.", "739": "But some think that the dictator is so called because he does not require any vote or show of hands, but on his own responsibility dictates his orders;", "740": "indeed, the orders of magistrates which are called by the Greeks diatagmata, are called edicts by the Romans.XXV.", "741": "When Marcellus's colleague came to Rome from Sicily, he wished to name another person dictator, and, that he might not be forced to act against his inclination, he sailed away by night back to Sicily.", "742": "Under these circumstances the people nominated Quintus Fulvius dictator, and the Senate wrote to Marcellus bidding him vote for this person.", "743": "He did so, confirming the choice of the people, and was himself elected proconsul for the following year.", "744": "After a conference with Fabius Maximus, at which it was arranged that the latter should make an attempt on Tarentum, while Marcellus should constantly engage Hannibal and so prevent his affording the town any assistance, he set out, and came upon Hannibal near Canusium.", "745": "Hannibal frequently shifted his camp, and tried to avoid a battle, but Marcellus was not to be shaken off, and at length attacked his position, and by skirmishing provoked him to fight.", "746": "Marcellus sustained his attack, and the battle was put an end to by night.", "747": "Next morning his troops were again beheld under arms, so that Hannibal in great anxiety called together the Carthaginians and besought them to fight as they had never done before.", "748": "“", "749": "You see,\" said he, \" that even after our great victories, we cannot rest in peace, unless we drive away this fellow.\"", "750": "The armies met;", "751": "and Marcellus seems to have lost the day by an unseasonable manoeuvre.", "752": "His right wing was suffering, and he ordered up one of the legions to support it;", "753": "but this change produced confusion in the ranks, and gave the victory to the enemy, with a loss of two thousand seven hundred men to the Romans.", "754": "Marcellus, after retir­ ing to his fortified camp, called together his soldiers, and reproached them, saying that he saw before him the arms and bodies of many Romans, but not one true Roman.", "755": "They begged forgiveness, but he answered that he could not forgive them when defeated, but would forgive them if victorious.", "756": "On the morrow he said that he would renew the battle, in order that the Romans might hear of their victory before they heard of their defeat.", "757": "After these words he gave orders that the troops which had given way should be supplied with rations of barley instead of corn;", "758": "which had such an effect upon them, that although many were suffering from the hurts in the battle, yet, there was not one who did not suffer more from the reproaches of Marcellus than from his wounds.", "759": "XXVI.", "760": "At daybreak the scarlet robe, the well known signal of battle, was displayed from the general's tent.", "761": "The disgraced troops, at their own request, were placed in the first rank;", "762": "the rest of the army followed under their officers.", "763": "Hannibal hearing of this exclaimed:", "764": "\" Hercules !", "765": "What can one do with a man who knows not how to bear either good or bad fortune.", "766": "This is the only general who, when victorious allows his foe no rest, and when defeated takes none himself.", "767": "We shall always, it seems, have to be fighting this man, who is equally excited to attack by his confidence when victor, and his shame when vanquished.", "768": "\"In the battle the men on each side were fighting on equal terms, when Hannibal ordered his elephants to be brought into the front rank and to attack the Roman lines.", "769": "Great tumult and disturbance was produced by this, but one of the tribunes, by name Flavius, seizing a standard, stood his ground, and struck the first elephant with the spiked end of the staff, till he forced him to turn back.", "770": "He then attacked the next one, and those that followed.", "771": "Marcellus, seeing this, ordered his cavalry to ride as fast as they could to the scene of the confusion and complete the rout of the enemy.", "772": "They charged briskly and pursued the flying Carthaginians, cutting them down up to their very camp.", "773": "Great havoc was wrought by the wounded elephants among them;", "774": "and in all, over eight thousand are said to have perished.", "775": "Of the Roman force three thousand were killed, and almost all the survivors were wounded, which circumstance enabled Hannibal to leave his camp by night unmolested, and remove himself from the neighbourhood of Marcellus;", "776": "for Marcellus could not pursue, because of the number of wounded, but marched in a leisurely manner towards Campania, and passed the summer at Sinuessa, recruiting the health of his soldiers.", "777": "XXVII.", "778": "Hannibal, after he had thus torn himself free from Marcellus, sent his army to plunder Italy as reck­ lessly as though it were disbanded ;", "779": "and in Rome Marcellus was ill spoken of.", "780": "His enemies induced Publius Bibulus, a clever and violent partisan, to attack him.", "781": "This man frequently addressed assemblies of the people and urged them to transfer the command to another general, since “ Marcellus,\" he said,“ after a little sparring with the enemy had gone to the hot baths to refresh himself as if after a gymnastic contest.\"", "782": "Marcellus, hearing of this, left the army in charge of his legates, and went to Rome to clear his reputation from these slanders;", "783": "but, in consequence of them he found that he was to undergo a trial.", "784": "A day was fixed;", "785": "the people assembled in the Circus Flaminius;", "786": "Bibulus rose and impeached him.", "787": "Marcellus spoke shortly and simply in his own defence, but the highest and noblest citizens spoke at great length in his praise, calling on the people not to show themselv es by their vote worse judges of war than Hannibal, who was always as eager to avoid fighting with Marcellus, as he was to fight with other generals.", "788": "After these speeches had been delivered the accuser was proved to be so far wrong in his impeach­ ment, that Marcellus was not only honourably acquitted, but actually elected consul for the fifth time.", "789": "XXVIII.", "790": "On assuming his office, he first put down an insurrectionary movement in Etruria, by visiting the various towns and using conciliatory language ;", "791": "after this, he wished to consecrate a temple, which he had built out of the spoils of Sicily, to Glory and Valour, but being pre­ vented by the priests on the ground that two gods could not be included in one temple, he began to build another one, being very much vexed at the opposition he encountered, but influenced by omens:", "792": "for he was dis­ turbed at this time by many portentous occurrences, such as several temples being struck by lightning, and the gold in the temple of Jupiter being gnawed by the mice.", "793": "It was also reported that an ox had spoken with a human voice, and that a child had been born with the head of an elephant-so the priests kept him in Rome to conduct the expiatory rites and atonements for these, though he was fretting and eager to take the field;", "794": "for no man ever was so passionately desirous of anything as he was to measure himself with Hannibal in battle.", "795": "His one dream by night, his only talk to his friends and colleagues, his sole prayer to the gods was that he might meet Hannibal in a fair field.", "796": "I believe that he would most willingly have enclosed both armies within a wall or palisade, and there have fought out the quarrel.", "797": "Had it not been that he was now loaded with honours, and had given proofs of his supe­ riority in wisdom and conduct to any other general, men would have said that he showed a more boyish ambition than befitted a man of his age;", "798": "for he was over sixty years old when he entered upon his fifth consulship.", "799": "XXIX.", "800": "However, when he had completed the necessary sacrifices and purifications enjoined by the soothsayers, be took the field with his colleague, and harassed Hannibal much in the country between the towns of Bantia and Venusia.", "801": "Hannibal declined battle, but, learning that a force was detached from the Roman army to attack the Epizephyiian Lokrians, he laid an ambuscade on the mountain near Petelia, and defeated them with a loss of two thousand five hundred men.", "802": "This excited Marcellus, and he led his forces nearer to those of Hannibal.", "803": "There was between the two camps a hill of some strength as a military post, overgrown with wood.", "804": "Its sloping sides afforded a view of either camp, and upon them appeared the sources of several mountain streams.", "805": "The Romans were surprised at Hannibal, that, having had the first choice of so excellent a position as this, ho had not occupied it, but left it to the enemy.", "806": "It seems that he indeed thought it a good place to encamp in, but much better to lay an ambuscade in;", "807": "and, wishing to use it rather for this purpose, he filled the woods and glens with javelinmen and spearmen, persuaded that the place itself would, from its excellent qualities, attract the Romans into it.", "808": "Nor was he deceived in this expectation ;", "809": "for at once there was much talk in the Roman army about the necessity of occupying the hill, and men pointed out the advantages which would be gained over the enemy by encamping on it, or if necessary, by fortifying it.", "810": "Now Marcellus determined to ride forward with a few horsemen and reconnoitre it, so he sent for a soothsayer and offered sacrifice.", "811": "When the first victim was slain, the soothsayer showed him that the liver had no head.", "812": "On sacrificing for the second time the head appeared of unusual size, while all the other organs were excellent, and this seemed to set at rest the fear which had been caused by the former.", "813": "Yet the soothsayers said that they were even more disturbed and alarmed at this;", "814": "for when after very bad and menacing victims unusually excellent ones appear, the sudden change is itself suspicious.", "815": "But “", "816": "Not fire, not walls of iron can hinder fate,\" as Pindar says.", "817": "Marcellus rode forth with his colleague Crispinus and his son, who was military tribune, in all two hundred and twenty horsemen.", "818": "Of these none were Romans;", "819": "they were Etruscans, with the exception of twenty men from Fregellæ, who had given constant proofs of their courage and devotion to Marcellus.", "820": "On the overhanging crest of the woody hill, a man, unseen by the Romans, wa watching their army.", "821": "He signalled to the men in ambush what was going on, so that they permitted Marcellus to ride close to them, and then suddenly burst out upon him, and surrounding his little force on all sides, struck and threw their darts, pursued such as ran away, and fought with those who stood their ground.", "822": "These were the twenty Fregellans.", "823": "The Etruscans at the outset ran away panic- stricken;", "824": "but these men forming together defended the consuls until Crispinus, struck by two darts, galloped away, and Marcellus was pierced through the side with a lance.", "825": "Then even the few survivors of the Fregellans left him lying there, and snatching up his son, who was wounded, made their way back to the camp.", "826": "The loss amounted to little over forty killed, and five lictors and eighteen horsemen taken.", "827": "Crispinus, after a few days, died of his wounds.", "828": "Such a misfortune as this, losing both consuls in one battle, never before betel the Romans.", "829": "XXX.", "830": "Hannibal heard of the fate of all the rest with indifference, but when he was told that Marcellus had fallen he himself hastened to the place, and stood for a long time beside the corpse, admiring its strength and beauty.", "831": "He made no boastful speech, and showed no joy in his countenance, as a man who had slain a troublesome and dangerous enemy, but, wondering at the strangeness of his ending, he drew the ring from the dead man'is finger, and had the corpse decently attired and burned.", "832": "The relics he gathered into a silver urn, upon which he placed a golden crown, and sent it to Marcellus's son.", "833": "But on the way some Numidians fell in with the party who were escorting the urn, and while they tried to take it away and the others struggled to retain it, the bones were scattered on the ground.", "834": "Hannibal, on hearing of this, said, “Nothing can be done against the will of heaven.\"", "835": "He ordered the Numidians to be punished, but took no further thought about collecting or sending away the relics of Marcellus, concluding that some god had decreed the strange death and strange lack of burial which had befallen him.", "836": "This is the story related by Cornelius Nepos and Valerius Maximus, but Livy and Augustus Caesar declare that the urn was brought to his son, and that it was splendidly buried.", "837": "Besides his monuments at Rome there was a gymnasium at Katana in Sicily which bore his name, and statues and votive tablets from the plunder of Syracuse were set up in Samothrace in the temple of the gods called Kabeiri, and in Lindus (in Rhodes) in the temple of Athena.", "838": "On his statue there, according to Poseidonius, these verses are written:", "839": "\"This monument, 0 stranger, doth enshrine Marcellus, of the famous Claudian line, Who seven times was consul, and in fight His country's foes o'erthrew and put to flight.", "840": "”For the writer of this epitaph counted his two procon­ sulates as well as his five consulates.", "841": "His family re­ mained one of the chief in Rome down to the time of Marcellus, the nephew of Augustus, who was the son of Octavia, Augustus's sister, and Caius Marcellus.", "842": "He died in the office of ædile while yet a bridegroom, having just married Augustus's daughter Julia.", "843": "In honour of his memory his mother Octavia established a library, and Augustus built a theatre, both of which bore his name.", "844": "I. THE particulars which we thought worth extracting from the histories of Pelopidas and Marcellus are related above.", "845": "Their dispositions and habits were so nearly identical (for both were brave, laborious, and high- spirited) that the only point in which they differ appears to be that Marcellus put the inhabitants of several captured cities to the sword, whereas Epameinondas and Pelopidas never slew any one after they had conquered him, nor enslaved any captured city;", "846": "indeed, had they been alive, it is said that the Thebans never would have so treated the town of Orchomenus.", "847": "As to their exploits, that of Marcellus against the Gauls was great and wonder­ ful, when he drove before him with his little band of horsemen so great a multitude of horse and foot together, the like of which one cannot easily find to have been done by any other general, and the killing of the chief of the enemy.", "848": "The same thing was attempted by Pelopidas, but the despot was too quick for him, and he perished without succeeding in his effort.", "849": "Yet with these we may compare his deeds at Leuktra and Tegyra, the most important and glorious of all his feats of arms, while we have no exploit of Marcellus which corresponds to his management of the ambuscade by which he brought back the exiled popular party to Thebes, and destroyed the despots.", "850": "Indeed, of all deeds performed by secrecy and stratagem, this takes the van.", "851": "Hannibal, no doubt, was a terrible enemy to Rome, as were the Lacedæmonians to Thebes;", "852": "yet it is an established fact that at Tegyra and at Leuktra they gave way before Pelopidas, whereas Marcellus, according to Polybius, never once defeated Hannibal, but that general appears to have remained undefeated until the time of Scipio.", "853": "But we believe, following Livy, Cæsar, Cornelius Nepos, and, among Greek historians, king Juba, that Hannibal suffered some defeats at the hands of Marcellus ;", "854": "yet they never produced any signal result, and we may sus­ pect that the African sometimes only pretended to have lost the day.", "855": "But what Marcellus is so justly admired for, is that after such great armies had been routed, their generals killed, and the whole military system of Rome thrown into confusion, he inspired his troops with a confidence that enabled them to hold their own against the enemy.", "856": "He roused his men from their former timid and disheartened condition, making them eager to distinguish themselves in battle, and, what is more, never to yield the victory without a determined struggle.", "857": "And all this, as far as any single man could, was effected by Marcellus;", "858": "for whereas his troops had been accustomed to be well satisfied if they escaped with their lives from Hannibal, he taught them to be ashamed of surviving defeat, to blush to give way ever so little, and to grieve if they were not victorious.", "859": "II.", "860": "Since, then, Pelopidas never was defeated when he was in command, and Marcellus gained more victories than any Roman of his time;", "861": "perhaps he who was so hard to conquer may, in consideration of his many successes, be held equal to him who never suffered a reverse.", "862": "Moreover, the one took Syracuse, while the other failed before Lacedæmon.", "863": "But I hold it a greater feat than taking Sicily, to have marched upon Sparta, and been the first man to cross the Eurotas, unless indeed it should be said that the credit of this exploit belongs more to Epameinondas than to Pelopi­ das, as also does the battle of Leuktra, whereas the glory of Marcellus's achievements is all his own.", "864": "For he took Syracuse alone, and beat the Gauls without his colleague, and, with no one to assist him, but every one hanging back, he measured himself with Hannibal and changed the whole complexion of the war, by being the first to introduce a daring policy.", "865": "III.", "866": "As for their deaths, I can praise neither one nor the other, but I am grieved at the unworthy manner of their end.", "867": "It is strange, that Hannibal was never even wounded in a number of battles which it would weary one to recount;", "868": "and I admire the conduct of Chrysantas in Xenophon's * Cyropædia,’ who, when standing with his weapon drawn, about to strike an enemy, heard the trumpet sound the recall, and leaving his man, quietly and orderly retreated.", "869": "Yet Pelopidas may be excused by his excitement during a battle, and his courage, which urged him to avenge himself on the enemy, for the best thing is for the general to be victorious and to survive, and the next, for him to die “ breathing forth his life in valour \" as Euripides says.", "870": "Thus his death becomes no accident, but a premeditated act.", "871": "And besides Pelopidas's spirit, the assured victory which he saw within his grasp, could he but kill the despot, not unreasonably made him make his desperate attack;", "872": "for it would have been hard for him to obtain another opportunity of distinguishing himself so gloriously.", "873": "But Marcellus, without any neces­ sity, without the excitement which sometimes in perilous circumstances overpowers men's reason, pushed heedlessly into danger, and died the death of a spy rather than a general, risking his five consulships, his three triumphs, his spoils and trophies won from kings against the worth­ less lives of Iberian and Numidian mercenaries.", "874": "They themselves must have felt ashamed at their success, that the bravest, most powerful, and most celebrated of the Romans should have fallen among a reconnoitring party of Fregellans.", "875": "Still, let not this be regarded as a reproach to these great men, but rather a complaint addressed on their own behalf to them, especially to that courage, to which they sacrificed all their other virtues, disregarding their lives, as though their loss would fall upon themselves only, and not upon their friends and native country.", "876": "After his death, Pelopidas was buried by his allies, fight ing for whom he died;", "877": "but Marcellus was buried by the enemy at whose hands he fell.", "878": "The first was an enviable end, but the other is greater, as the spectacle of an enemy honouring the valour by which he has suffered is greater than that of a friend showing gratitude to a friend.", "879": "In the one case it is the man's glory alone that is respected, in the other, his usefulness and value are as much thought of as his courage.", "880": "ARISTEIDES, the son of Lysimachus, was of the tribe Antiochis, and the township of Alopekæ.", "881": "There are various reports current about his property, some saying that he lived in poverty, and that on his death he left two daughters, who remained a long while unmarried because of their poverty;", "882": "while this general opinion is contra­ dicted by Demetrius of Phalerum in his book on Sokrates, where he mentions an estate at Phalerum which he knew had belonged to Aristeides, in which he was buried, and also adduces other grounds for supposing him to have been a wealthy man.", "883": "First, he points out that Aristeides was Archon Eponymus, an office for which men were chosen by lot from the richest class, that of the Penta­ kosiomedimni, or citizens who possessed a yearly income of five hundred medimni * of dry or liquid produce.", "884": "Secondly, he mentions the fact that he was ostracised:", "885": "now, ostracism never was used against poor men, but against those who descended from great and wealthy houses, and whose pride made them feared and disliked by their fellow citizens.", "886": "Thirdly, and lastly, he writes that Aristeides placed in the temple of Dionysus tripods dedicated to the god by a victorious chorus, which even in my own time are still to be seen, and which bear the inscription:", "887": "“ The tribe Antiochis won the prize;", "888": "Aris­ teides was choragus;", "889": "Archestratus taught the chorus.\"", "890": "Now this, which seems to be the strongest argument of all, is really the weakest.", "891": "Epameinondas, whom all men know to have been born and to have passed his life in the greatest possible poverty, and Plato the philosopher, both exhibited excellent choruses, the former bearing the expense of a chorus of men playing on the flute, while the latter exhibited a cyclic.", "892": "chorus of boys.", "893": "Plato's ex. penses were borne by Dionysius of Syracuse, and those of Epameinondas by Pelopidas and his friends.", "894": "Good men do not always refuse to receive presents from their friends, but, though they would scorn to make money by them, they willingly receive them to further an honourable ambition.", "895": "Panætius, moreover, proves that Demetrius is wrong in the matter of the tripods, because from the time of the Persian war to the end of the Peloponnesian war there are only two Aristeides recorded as victors, neither of whom can be identified with the son of Lysimachus, as the father of one of them was Xenophilus, and the other was a much more modern personage, as is proved by his name being written in the characters which came into use after the archonship of Eukleides, and from the name of the poet or teacher of the chorus, Archestratus, whose name we never meet with in the time of the Persian war, but who taught several choruses (that is, wrote several successful plays) during the Peloponnesian war.", "896": "These remarks of Panætius must, however, be received with caution.", "897": "As to ostracism, any man of unusual talent, nobility of birth, or remarkable eloquence, was liable to suffer from it, for Damon, the tutor of Perikles, was ostracised, because he was thought to be a man of superior intellect.", "898": "Idomeneus tells us that Aristeides obtained the office of archon, not by lot, but by the universal voice of the people.", "899": "Now, if he, was archon after the battle of Platæa, as Demetrius himself admits, it is highly probable that his great reputation after such glorious successes may have obtained for him an office usually reserved for men of wealth.", "900": "Indeed, Demetrius evidently tries to redeem both Aristeides and Sokrates from the reproach of poverty, as though he imagined it to be a great misfortune, for he tells us that Sokrates not only possessed a house, but also seventy minæ which were borrowed by Krito.", "901": "II.", "902": "Aristeides became much attached to Kleisthenes, who established the democratic government after the expulsion of the sons of Peisistratus;", "903": "but his reverence and admiration for Lykurgus the Lacedæmonian led him to prefer an aristocratic form of government, in which he always met with an opponent in Themistokles, the son of Neokles, the champion of democracy.", "904": "Some say that even as children they always took opposite sides, both in play and in serious matters, and so betrayed their several dispositions:", "905": "Themistokles being unscrupulous, daring, and careless by what means he obtained success, while the character of Aristeides was solid and just, incapable of deceit or artifice even in sport.", "906": "Ariston of Keos tells us that their hatred of one another arose from a love affair.", "907": "Stesilaus of Keos, the most beautiful youth of his time, was passionately adored by both of them with an affection which passed all bounds.", "908": "Nor did they cease their rivalry when this boy's youthful bloom had passed away, but, as if this had merely been a preliminary trial, they each plunged into politics with great vigour and with utterly different views.", "909": "Themistokles obtained a large following, and thus became an important power in the state, so that, when some one said to him that he would make a very good governor of Athens, provided he were just and impartial with all, he answered, \" Never may I bear rule if my friends are to reap no more benefit from it than any one else.", "910": "\"Aristeides, on the other hand, pursued his way through political life unattended, because, in the first place, he neither wished to do wrong in order to please his friends, nor to vex them by refusing to gratify their wishes;", "911": "and also because he observed that many men when they were supported by a strong party of friends were led into the commission of wrong and illegal acts.", "912": "He, therefore, conceived that a good citizen ought to trust entirely to his own rectitude, both in word and in deed.", "913": "III.", "914": "In spite of this, however, when Themistokles was using every kind of political manoeuvre to thwart him, he was forced to retaliate by similar measures, partly in order to defend himself, and partly to check the power of his opponent, which depended on the favour shown him by the people.", "915": "He thought it better that he should occasionally do the people some slight wrong than that Themistokles should obtain unlimited power.", "916": "At last, when Themistokles even proposed some useful measure, he opposed it and threw it out.", "917": "On this occasion he could not refrain from saying, as he left the public assembly, that the Athenians could not be saved unless they threw both himself and Themistokles into the barathrum.*", "918": "Another time he brought forward a bill, which was vehemently debated upon, but was at length carried.", "919": "But just before the votes of the people were given, he, perceiving from what had been said that it would prove a bad law, withdrew it.", "920": "Frequently he made use of other persons to bring forward propositions, lest the public should suffer from the contest which would otherwise take place between Themistokles and himself.", "921": "Indeed, his evenness of temper was the more remarkable when contrasted with the changefulness of other poli­ ticians, for he was never unduly excited by the honours which were bestowed upon him, and bore misfortune with a quiet cheerfulness, thinking it to be his duty to serve his country, not merely without being paid for it in money, but without even gaining honour for so doing.", "922": "This was the reason, I suppose, that when Æschylus's verses on Amphiaraus were being recited in the theatre :",

towards Aristedes, thinking that he came nearest to this ideal virtue.", "926": "IV.", "927": "He stood up vigorously for justice, not merely when it was his interest and that of his friends, but when it was in favour of his enemies and contrary to his own personal feelings to do so.", "928": "It is said that once when arguing a cause against one of his enemies in a court of law, the judges refused to hear the other party speak in his own defence, after listening to the speech of Aristeides, but were about to condemn him unheard.", "929": "At this Aristeides came forward and vigorously supported his antagonist's claim to be allowed his legal right of reply.", "930": "Again, when acting as arbitrator between two persons, one of them said that his adversary had done much wrong to Aristeides.",

obtained a verdict.", "934": "However, the better class of citizens being grieved at this, not only remitted the fine, but at once elected him to the same office.", "935": "He now pretended to regret his former rigour, and was much more remiss in performing his duties, which rendered him very popular with those who were in the habit of embezzling the public money, so that they were loud in his praise, and canvassed the people on his behalf, trusting that he might be re-elected archon.", "936": "But when the voting was about to begin, he rose and rebuked the Athenians. \"", "937": "When,\"

whole of Greece, he landed at Marathon, and commenced laying waste the country.", "943": "Of the ten generals appointed by the Athenians for the conduct of the war, Miltiades had the highest reputation, while Aristeides held the second place.", "944": "He used his influence in the council of war to support the proposition of Miltiades to fight the enemy at once, and also, as each general had sole command for one day, when his day came round, he gave it to Miltiades, thus teaching his colleagues that obedience to those who know how to command is not any disgrace, but a noble and useful act.", "945": "By this means he was enabled to put an end to the rivalries between the generals, and to strengthen Miltiades by concentrating in him the power which had before been passed from hand to hand.", "946": "In the battle the Athenian centre was hard pressed, as the Persians resisted longest in that part of their line which was opposed to the tribes Leontis and Antiochis.", "947": "Here

the Persians forced into their ships, they were observed not to sail towards the Archipelago, but to be proceeding in the direction of Athens.", "949": "Fearing that they might catch the city defenceless, the Athenians determined to hurry back with nine tribes to protect it, and they accomplished their march in one day.", "950": "Aristeides, with his own tribe, was left to guard the prisoners and the plunder, and well maintained his reputation.", "951": "Although gold and silver was lying about in heaps, with all kinds of rich tapestry and other countless treasures, he would neither touch them himself nor allow the others to do so, though some helped themselves without his knowledge.", "952": "Among these was Kallias, the torch-bearer in the Eleusinian mysteries.", "953":

Mardonius was defeated at Platæa, whereas the name of Aristeides does occur next to that of Phanippus, in whose archonship the victory at Marathon was won.", "960": "VI.", "961": "Of all the virtues of Aristeides his justice was that which chiefly commended itself to the people, being that which is of most value in ordinary life.", "962": "Hence it was that he, although a poor man of mean birth,

Victorious, while some are known as the Eagle or the Hawk, because apparently they prefer strength and lawless violence to justice and goodness.", "964": "Yet for all this, the gods, to whom they so

first made him beloved by the people, but afterwards it gained him their ill-will, chiefly because Themistokles circulated reports that Aristeides had practically closed the public courts of justice

nothing more than a safety-valve, providing a vent for the dislike felt by the people for those whose greatness offended them.", "979": "It did no irreparable injury to those who fell under its operation, but only banished them for a space of ten years.", "980": "In later times mean and contemptible persons were subjected to ostracism, until at last, after the ostracism of Hyperbolus the practice was discontinued.", "981": "The ostracism of Hyperbolus is said to have been brought about in the following manner.", "982": "Alkibiades and Nikias, the two most powerful citizens in the state, were at the head of two rival parties.", "983": "The people determined to apply the ostracism to them, and would certainly have banished one or the other of them.", "984": "They, however, came to terms with one another, combined their several factions, and agreed to have Hyper­ bolus banished.", "985": "The people, enraged at this, and thinking that they had been treated with contempt, abolished the practice of ostracism.", "986": "The way in which it was conducted was as follows.", "987": "Each man took an oyster-shell, wrote upon it the name of the citizen whom he wished to be banished, and then carried it to a place in the market-place which was fenced off with palings.", "988": "The archons now first of all counted the whole number of shells;", "989": "for if the whole number of voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was null and void.", "990": "After this, they counted the number of times each name occurred, and that man against whom most votes were

speaking, a very ignorant country fellow is said to have brought his shell to Arts­ teides, who was one of the bystanders, and to have asked him to write upon it the name of Aristeides.", "992":

encourage the Greeks to defend their liberty, and after his return, when Themistokles was in sole com­ mand of the forces of Athens, he assisted him in every way by word and deed, cheerfully raising his bitterest enemy to the highest position in the state, because the state was benefited thereby.", "999": "When Eurybiades and his party were meditating a retreat from Salamis, the Persian ships put

upon.", "1025": "\"To the Athenians he sent privately proposals from the Great King, who offered to rebuild their city, present them with a large sum of money, and make them lords over all Greece, if they would desist from the war.", "1026": "The Lace­ dæmonians, hearing this, were much alarmed, and sent ambassadors to beg the Athenians to send their wives and children to Sparta, and offering to support their old people, as the Athenians were in great distress for food, having lost their city and their country.", "1027": "However, after listen­ ing to the Lacedæmonian ambassadors, at the instance of Aristeides they returned a spirited answer, saying that they could forgive their enemies, who knew no better, for supposing that everything could be bought with money, but that they were angry with the Lacedaemonians for only regarding the present poverty and distress of the Athenians, and that forgetting how bravely they had fought, they should now offer them food to bribe them to fight for Greece.", "1028": "Having parsed this motion Aristeidea called the ambassadors back into the assembly, and bade them tell the Lacedæmonians that there was not as much gold in the world, either above or under-ground, as the Athenians would require to tempt them to betray Greece.", "1029": "In answer to the herald sent from Mardonius he pointed to the sun, and said:", "1030": "“ As long as yonder sun shall con tinue its course the Athenians will be enemies to the Persians, because of their ravaged lands and desecrated temples.\"", "1031": "Further, he made the priests imprecate curses on any one who had dealings with the Persians or deserted the Greek cause.", "1032": "When Mardonius invaded Attica a second time, the Athenians again took refuge in Salamis.", "1033": "Aristeides was sent to Lacedæmon and upbraided the Spartans with their slowness and indifference, for allowing the enemy to take Athens a second time, and begged them to help what remained of Greece.", "1034": "The Ephors, on hearing this, pre­ tended to pass the rest of the day in feasting and idleness, for it was the festival of the Hyacinthia;", "1035": "but at night­ fall they chose five thousand Spartans, each attended by seven Helots, and sent them off without the knowledge of the Athenian embassy.", "1036": "So when Aristeides next day resumed his reproachful strain, they answered with mock­ ing laughter, that he was talking nonsense and was asleep, for that the army was by this time at the tomb of Orestes in its march against the strangers * (by strangers they meant the Persians).", "1037": "To this Aristeides answered that it was a sorry jest to have deceived their friends instead of their enemies.", "1038": "These particulars are related by Idomen­ eus, but in the decree of Aristeides for sending ambassadors it is not his name, but those of Kimon, Xanthippus, and Myronides that are mentioned.", "1039": "XI.", "1040": "He was elected general with unlimited powers, and proceeded to Platæa with eight thousand Athenians.", "1041": "Here he was met by Pausanias, the commander-in-chief of the Greek forces, with the Spartan contingent, and the rest of the Greek troops joined them there.", "1042": "The Persian army was encamped along the course of the river Asopua", "1043": "On account of its enormous size it was not contained in a fortified camp, but a quadrangular wall was constructed round the baggage and most valuable material.", "1044": "Each Bide of this square was ten furlongs in length.", "1045": "Tisamenus of Elis, the prophet, now told Pausanias and all the Greeks that they would win the victory if they stood on the defensive and did r ot attack.", "1046": "Aristeides sent to Delphi, and received a response from the oracle, that the Athenians would conquer if they prayed to Zeus, to Hera of Kithæron, and to Pan and the nymphs Sphragi­ tides, and if they sacrificed to the heroes Androkrates, Leukon, Peisander, Damokrates, Hypsion, Aktaion, and Polyidus, and if they would fight in their own territory, in the plain of Demeter of Eleusis and her daughter.", "1047": "This oracle greatly disturbed Aristeides.", "1048": "The heroes to whom he was bidden to sacrifice are the original founders of the city of Platæa, and the cave of the nymphs called Sphragitides, is on one of the peaks of Kith­ æron, looking towards the point where the sun sets in summer.", "1049": "It is said that there was formerly an oracle there, and that many of the people became possessed, and were called \" nympholeptæ.”", "1050": "But as to the plain of the Eleusinian Demeter, and the promise of victory to the Athenians if they fought in their own country, this meant no less than to recall them to Attica and forbid their taking any further part in the war.", "1051": "Whilst Aristeides was thus perplexed, Arimnestus, the general of the Pla­ tæans, saw a vision in his sleep.", "1052": "In his dreams he thought that Zeus the Preserver appeared and enquired of him what the Greeks had decided to do, and that he answered, “ Lord, to-morrow we shall lead away the army to Eleusis, and fight the Persians there, according to the oracle.\"", "1053": "Upon this the god answered, that they had missed the meaning of the oracle, for the places mentioned were near Platæa, where they themselves were encamped, and if they sought they would find them.", "1054": "Arimnestus, after this distinct vision, awoke.", "1055": "He at once sent for the oldest and most learned of the citizens of Platæa, and after debating the matter with them, discovered that near Hysiae, under Mount Kithæron, stood a very ancient temple, dedicated to the Eleusinian Demeter and her daughter.", "1056": "He immediately took Aristeides with him and proceeded to the spot, which was excellently placed for the array of an infantry force in the presence of an overwhelming cavalry, because the spurs of Mount Kithæron, where they run down into the plain by the temple, render the ground impassable for cavalry.", "1057": "Close by is the chapel of the hero Androkrates, in the midst of a thick matted grove of trees.", "1058": "In order, however, that the oracle might in no way be defective in its promise of victory, Arimnes­ tus proposed, and the Platæans decreed, that the boundary marks of their territory on the side towards Attica should be removed, and the country given to the Athenians, so that they might fight in their own land for Greece, accord­ to the oracle.", "1059": "This noble act of the Platæans became so famous in later times, that, many years afterwards, Alexander the Great himself, when he had conquered all Asia, caused the walls of Platæa to be rebuilt, and made proclamation at the Olympian games by a herald, “ that the king bestowed this honour upon the Platæans in memory of their magnanimous conduct in giving up their territory, and venturing their lives on behalf of the Greeks in the Persian war.\"XII.", "1060": "A controversy arose between the Athenians and the men of Tegea about their respective places in the line of battle.", "1061": "The Tegeans argued that if the Lacedæ­ monians had the light wing, they ought to be posted on the left;", "1062": "and they spoke at great length about the achieve­ ments of their ancestors, as entitling them to that honour.", "1063": "The Athenians were vexed at their pretensions, but Aris­ teides said :", "1064": "“", "1065": "The present time is not suitable for disput­ ing with the Tegeans about bravery;", "1066": "but to you, men of Sparta, and to the rest of the Greeks, we say that a particular post neither confers courage nor takes it away , but, that in whatever part of the line you may think fit to place us, we will endeavour so to array our ranks and fight the enemy as not to impair the honour which we have gained in former battles.", "1067": "We did not come hither to quarrel with our allies, but to fight the enemy;", "1068": "not to boast about our ancestors, but to fight bravely for Greece.", "1069": "The coming struggle will clearly show to all the Greeks the real worth and value of each city, each general, and each single citizen.\"", "1070": "When the council of generals heard this speech, they allowed the claim of the Athenians, and gave up the left wing to them.", "1071": "XIII.", "1072": "While the cause of Greece was thus trembling in the balance, and Athens was especially in danger, certain Athenians of noble birth, who had lost their former wealth during the war, and with it their influence in the city, being unable to bear to see others exalted at their expense, met in secret in a house in Plateea and entered into a plot to overturn the free constitution of Athens.", "1073": "If they could not succeed in this, they pledged themselves to ruin the city and betray it to the Persians.", "1074": "While these men were plotting in the camp, and bringing many over to their side, Aristeides discovered the whole conspiracy.", "1075": "Afraid at such a crisis to take any decisive step, he determined, while carefully watching the conspirators, yet not at once to seize them all, not knowing how far he might have to proceed if he acted according to strict justice.", "1076": "From all the conspirators he arrested eight.", "1077": "Two of these, who would have been the first to be put on their trial, Æschines of Lampra, and Agesias of Acharnæ, made their escape out of the camp, and Aristeides pardoned the others, as he wished to give an opportunity to those who believed themselves unsuspected, to take courage and repent.", "1078": "He also hinted to them that the war afforded them a means of clearing themselves from any suspicion of disloyalty by fighting for their country like good men and true.", "1079": "XIV.", "1080": "After this, Mardonius made trial of Grecian courage, by sending the whole of his cavalry, in which he was much the stronger, to attack them where they were, all except the Megarians, encamped at the foot of Mount Kithæron, in an easily-defended rocky country.", "1081": "These men, three thousand in number, were encamped nearer the plain, and suffered much from the attacks of the horsemen, who surrounded them on all sides.", "1082": "They sent a mebsenger in great haste to Pausanias, begging him to send assistance, as they could not by themselves resist the great numbers of the barbarians.", "1083": "Pausanias, hearing this, and seeing the camp of the Megarians overwhelmed with darts and arrows, while the defenders were huddled together in a narrow compass, knew not what to do.", "1084": "He did not venture to attack cavalry with the heavy-armed Lacedæmonian infantry, but offered it as an opportunity for winning praise and honour, to the generals who were with him, that they should volunteer to go to help the Mega­ rians in their extremity.", "1085": "All hesitated, but Aristcides claimed the honour for the Athenians, and sent the bravest of his captains, Olympiodorus, with three hundred picked men, besides some archers.", "1086": "As they quickly got into array and charged at a run, Masistius, the leader of the enemy, a man of great bodily strength and beauty, seeing them, wheeled round his horse, and rode to attack them.", "1087": "They sustained his attack and closed with his horsemen, and a sharp struggle took place, both parties fighting as though the issue of the war depended on their exertions.", "1088": "The horse of Masistius was at length wounded by an arrow and threw his rider.", "1089": "Encumbered by his armour, Masistius was too heavy for his own men to carry him away, but also was protected by it from the stabs of the Athenians who fell upon him, for not only his head and breast, but his limbs also were protected by brass and iron.", "1090": "Some one, however, drove the spike at the lower end of his spear through the eye-hole of the helmet, and then the rest of the Persians abandoned the body and fled.", "1091": "The Greeks discovered the importance of their exploit, not from the number of the dead, for but few had fallen, but from the lamentations of the enemy.", "1092": "They cut off their own hair, and the manes of their horses and mules, in sign of mourning for Masistius, and filled the whole plain with weeping and wailing, having lost a man who for courage and high position, was second only to Mardonius himself.", "1093": "XV.", "1094": "After this cavalry action, both the parties remained quiet for a long time, for the soothsayers foretold victory both to the Greeks and to the Persians if they fought in self-defence, but foretold defeat if they attacked.", "1095": "At length Mardonius, as he only had provisions for a few days longer, and as the Greek army kept growing stronger by the continual reinforcements which it received, deter­ mined, sorely against his will, to delay no longer, but to cross the Asopus at daybreak and fall upon the Greeks unexpectedly.", "1096": "In the evening he gave orders to his captains to this effect.", "1097": "About midnight a solitary horse­ man rode up straight to the Greek camp.", "1098": "He bade the guard send for Aristeides the Athenian, who was at once brought, when the stranger spoke as follows :", "1099": "\"", "1100": "I am Alexander of Macedon, and I have come hither at the greatest risk to myself to do you a service, for fear you should be taken by surprise.", "1101": "Mardonius will attack to-morrow, not because he has any new hope of success, but because he is destitute of provisions, although the soothsayers all forbid him to fight because the sacrifices and oracles are unfavourable, and the army is disheartened.", "1102": "Thus he is forced to put all on a venture, or else to starve if he remains quiet.\"", "1103": "When he had said this, Alexander begged Aristeides to keep the secret to himself, and communicate it to no one else.", "1104": "Aristeides, however, answered that it would not be right for him to conceal it from Pausanias, who was commander-in chief.", "1105": "Before the battle he said that he would keep it secret from every one else, but that if Greece was victorious, all men then should know the good service so bravely rendered by Alexander.", "1106": "After these words the king of Macedon rode away, and Aristeides, proceeding to the tent of Pausanias, told him the whole matter;", "1107": "they then sent for the other generals, and ordered them to keep the troops under arms, as a battle was expected.", "1108": "XVI.", "1109": "At this time, Herodotus tells us, Pausanias asked Aristeides to remove the Athenians from the left to the right wing, so as to be opposite to the native Persian troops, on the ground that they would be better able to contend with them, because they understood their mode of fighting, and were confident because they had beaten them once before, while he with the Spartans would take the left wing of the army, where he would be opposed to those Greeks who had taken the Persian side.", "1110": "Most of the Athenian generals thought this a silly and insolent proceeding of Pausanias, that he should leave all the other Greeks in their place, and march them backwards and forward like holots, only to place them opposite the bravest troops of the enemy.", "1111": "Aristeides, however, said that they were entirely mistaken, for a few days before they had been wrangling with the Tegeans for the honour of being posted on the left wing, and had been delighted when they obtained it;", "1112": "but now, when the Lacedæmonians of their own free will yielded the right wing to them, and in some sort offered them the post of honour in the whole army, they were not delighted at it, and did not consider what an advantage it was to have to fight against foreign barbarians, and not against men of their own race and nation.", "1113": "After these words, the Athenians cheerfully exchanged places with the Lacedæmonians, and much talk went on among them as each man reminded his comrades that the Persians who would come to attack them were no braver, nor better armed than those whom they had defeated at Marathon, but that they had the same bows and arrows, the same embroidered robes and gold ornaments on their effeminate bodies, while we, they said, have arms and bodies such as we had then, and greater confidence because of our victories.", "1114": "We also fight, not merely as other Greeks do, in defence of our city and territory, but for the trophies of Marathon and Salamis, lest the battle of Marathon should be thought to have been won more by Miltiades and Fortune, than by the valour of the Athenians.", "1115": "With such encouraging talk as this the Athenians took up their new position;", "1116": "but the Thebans discovered what had been done from deserters and told Mardonius.", "1117": "He at once, either from fear of the Athenians, or from a chivalrous wish to fight the Spartans himself, led the native Persian troops to his right wing, and ordered the renegade Greeks to take ground opposite the Athenians.", "1118": "When these changes were being observed, Pausanias returned to his original position on the right.", "1119": "Mardonius then returned to the left as before, and the day passed without an engagement.", "1120": "The Greeks now determined in a council of war, to remove their camp to a place farther away and better supplied with water, because they were prevented from using the springs near where they were by the enemy's great superiority in cavalry.", "1121": "XVII.", "1122": "When night fell the generals began to lead the army to the place selected for a new camp.", "1123": "The soldiers were very unwilling to follow them thither and keep together in a body, but as soon as they quitted their first entrenchments, most of them made for the city of Platæa ;", "1124": "and there was much confusion as they wandered about and pitched their tents here and there.", "1125": "The Lacedæmo­ nians, much against their will, chanced to be left behind, and quite separated from the rest.", "1126": "One Amompharetus, at spirited and daring man, who had long been eager to fight, and chafed much at the long delays and counter- marches which had taken place, now cried aloud that this change of position was no better than a cowardly flight.", "1127": "He refused to leave his post, and said that he and his company would stand where they were, and withstand Mardonius alone.", "1128": "When Pausanias came and assured him that the Greeks in council had decided upon this measure, Amompharetus heaved up a huge stone with both his hands and flinging it down at the feet of Pausanias, said, \" With this pebble I give my vote for battle, and for disregarding the cowardly counsels of other Greeks.\"", "1129": "Pausanias, not knowing what to do, sent to the Athenians, who were already on the march, begging them to wait and support them, while he set off with the rest of the Spartans in the direction of Platæa, hoping thus to make Amompharetus move.", "1130": "While these movements were being executed day broke, and Mardonius, who had perceived that the Greeks were leaving their camp, at once marched in order of battle to attack the Lacedæmonians, the Persians shouting and clattering their arms as though they were not going to fight, but to destroy the Greeks as they retreated, which indeed they very nearly succeeded in doing;", "1131": "for Pausanias, when he saw what was taking place, halted his own men, and placed them in battle array, but either because of his anger at Amompharetus, or his excitement at the sudden­ ness of the attack, forgot to send any orders to the main body of the Greeks.", "1132": "For this reason they came up not in a regular body, but straggling, and after the Lacedæmonians were already engaged.", "1133": "Pausanias was busy sacrificing to the gods, and as the sacrifices were unfavourable, he ordered the Lace­ dæmonians to hold their shields quietly rested on the ground at their feet and await his orders, without attempt­ ing any resistance, while he sacrificed again.", "1134": "The enemy's cavalry was now close at hand, their arrows reached the Lacedæmonians and killed several of them.", "1135": "It was at this moment that Kallikrates, the tallest and handsomest man in the whole Greek army, is said to have been mortally wounded by an arrow.", "1136": "When dying, he said that he did not lament his death, for he left his home meaning to lay down his life for Greece, but that he was grieved that he had never exchanged blows with the enemy before he died.", "1137": "At this time the Lacedæmonians were offering no resistance to the assaults of the enemy, but were standing still in their ranks, shot at by the arrows of the enemy, awaiting the time when it should be the will of the gods and their general that they should fight.", "1138": "Some writers tell us that while Pausanias was offering sacrifice and prayer a little beyond the ranks, some Lydians suddenly fell upon him, and began to plunder the sacrificial vessels, but that Pausanias, and those with him, having no arms, drove them away with sticks and whips ;", "1139": "in memory of which they beat young men on the altar at Sparta at the present day, and afterwards lead what is called the Lydian pro­ cession.", "1140": "X V III.", "1141": "Pausanias was deeply grieved at what was taking place, seeing the priests offering sacrifice after sacrifice, not one of which pleased the gods;", "1142": "at last he turned his eyes towards the temple of Hera and wept.", "1143": "Holding up his hands he besought Hera of Mount Kithæron and all the other gods of the land of Platæa that if it were not the will of the gods that the Greeks should conquer, they might at any rate do some valorous deed before they died, and let their conquerors know that they had fought with brave and experienced warriors.", "1144": "When Pausanias prayed thus, the sacrifices at once became favourable and the soothsayers prophesied victory.", "1145": "The word was given to set themselves in order of battle, and then at cnce the Lacedaemonian force resembled some fierce beast turning to bay and setting up his bristles, while the barbarians saw that they had to deal with men who were prepared to fight to the death.", "1146": "Wherefore they set up their great wicker shields in front of them, and from this shelter shot their arrows at the Lacedæmonians.", "1147": "But the latter advanced without breaking their ranks, overturned the line of wicker shields, and with terrible thrusts of their spears at the faces and breasts of the Persians, laid many of them low by their fierce and well-dis­ ciplined charge.", "1148": "The Persians too fought bravely, and resisted for a long while, laying hold of the spears with their bare hands and breaking most of them in that manner, fighting hand to hand, with their scimitars and axes, and tearing the Lacedæmonians' shields out of their hands by force.", "1149": "Meanwhile the Athenians had for a long time stood quietly awaiting the Lacedæmonians.", "1150": "When, however, they heard the shouting and noise of the battle, and a messenger, it is said, reached them from Pausanias, they marched with all speed to help him.", "1151": "As they were hurry­ ing over the plain to where the shouts were heard, the Greeks who had taken the Persian side attacked them.", "1152": "At first when Aristeides saw them, he ran out far before the rest and besought them in a loud voice in the name of the gods of Greece not to hinder the Athenians when they were going to assist those who were venturing their lives on behalf of Greece.", "1153": "But when he saw that they took no notice of his appeal, he no longer attempted to help the Lacedæmonians, but attacked these troops, who numbered about fifty thousand.", "1154": "Of these the greater part gave way at once and retreated, because they saw their barbarian allies retreating, but a fierce battle is said to have raged where the Thebans were, because the best and noblest men of that state had eagerly taken the Persian side from the beginning, while the common people followed them, not of their free will, but being accustomed to obey the nobles.", "1155": "XIX.", "1156": "Thus was the battle divided into two parts.", "1157": "The Lacedæmonians were the first to rout the Persians.", "1158": "A Spartan, named Arimnestus, killed Mardonius by a blow on the head with a stone, as the oracle in the temple of Amphiaraus had foretold to him.", "1159": "For Mardonius sent a Lydian thither, and another man, a Karian, to the oracle in the cave of Trophonius.", "1160": "This latter was spoken to in the Karian language by the prophet, but the other slept in the sacred enclosure round the temple of Amphiaraus, and in his dreams saw a servant of the god standing beside him and bidding him legone.", "1161": "When he refused to go, the figure cast a great stone at his head, so that he dreamed that he died of the stroke.", "1162": "This is the story which is told of Mardonius.", "1163": "The Persian fugitives were now driven to take shelter within their wooden fortification.", "1164": "Shortly after these events took place, the Athenians defeated the Thebans, who lost three hundred of their noblest citizens in that battle.", "1165": "After this there came a messenger to them, telling them that the Persians were being besieged in their fortified camp.", "1166": "Hearing this, the Athenians allowed the renegade Greeks to escape, and marched at once to the assault of the camp.", "1167": "Here they found the Lacedæmonians, who were not pressing the enemy, because they had no experience in sieges and attacks on fortified places.", "1168": "The Athenians forced their way in and took the camp with an immense slaughter of the enemy.", "1169": "It is said that out of three hundred thousand only forty thousand under Arta­ bazus escaped.", "1170": "On the side of the Greeks fell only thirteen hundred and sixty men.", "1171": "Of these there were fifty-two Athenians of the Aiantid tribe,.", "1172": "which, we are told by Kleidemus, distinguished itself beyond all others on that day.", "1173": "For this reason, the Aiantid tribe offered the sacrifice to the nymphs Sphragitides, ordered by the oracle for the victory, at the public expense.", "1174": "Of the Lacedæmonians, there fell ninety-one, and of the Tegeans sixteen.", "1175": "It is hard, therefore, to understand Herodotus when he says that these alone came to blows with the enemy, and that no other Greeks were engaged at all;", "1176": "for both the number of the slain and the tombs of the fallen prove that the victory was won by all the Greeks together.", "1177": "If only three cities had fought, and the rest had done nothing, they never would have inscribed on the altar:", "1178": "“ The Greeks in battle drove the Persian forth By force of arms, and bravely Greece set free, To Zeus Protector they this altar reared, Where all might thank him for their victory.", "1179": "\"This battle was fought on the day of the month Boed­ romion, according to the Athenian calendar;", "1180": "and on the twenty-sixth of the month Panemus according to that of the Boeotians, on which day the Hellenic meeting still takes place at Platæa, and sacrifice is offered to Zeus, the Protector of Liberty, in memory of this victory.", "1181": "The discrepancy of the dates is no marvel, seeing that even at the present day, when astronomy is more accurately understood, different cities still begin and end their months on different days.", "1182": "XX.", "1183": "After the battle, as the Athenians would not assign the prize of valour * to the Lacedæmonians, nor suffer them to set up a trophy, the common cause of Greece was within a little of being ruined by the quarrels of the two armies, had not Aristeides by argument and entreaty prevailed upon his colleagues, especially Leokrates and Myronides, to submit the dispute to the decision of all the Greeks.", "1184": "Upon this a council was held, at which Theogeiton of Megara said that the prize for valour ought to be given to another city, and not either to Athens or Sparta, if they did not wish to bring about a civil war.", "1185": "To this Kleokritus of Corinth made answer.", "1186": "All men expected that he would demand the honour for Corinth, which city had acquitted itself best, next to Athens and Sparta;", "1187": "but he made a very excellent and conciliatory speech, demanding that the prize should be bestowed on the Platæans, by which means neither of the claimants would be aggrieved.", "1188": "This proposal was agreed to by Aristeides on behalf of the Athenians, and by Pausanias on behalf of the Lacedæmonians.", "1189": "Having thus settled their differences, they set apart from the plunder eighty talents for the Platæans, with which they built the temple of Athena, and the shrine, and also decorated the temple with paintings, which even to this present day retain their lustre.", "1190": "The Lacedæmonians set up a trophy for themselves, and the Athenians another one apart.", "1191": "When they enquired at Delphi what sacrifice was to be offered, the oracle bade them set up an altar to Zeus the Protector of the Free, and not to sacrifice upon it until they had first put out all fires throughout the country, because it had been defiled by the presence of the barbarian, and had then fetched a new fire pure from pollution, from the the hearth at Delphi, which is common to all Greece.", "1192": "The chiefs of the Greeks at once proceeded throughout the Platæan territory, forcing every one to extinguish his fire, even in the case of funeral piles, while Euchidas of Platæa, who promised that he would fetch fire as quickly as possible, proceeded to Delphi.", "1193": "There he purified his body, and having been besprinkled with holy water and crowned with laurel, took fire from the altar, set off running back to Platæa, and arrived there about sunset, having run a distance of a hundred and twenty-five miles in one day.", "1194": "He embraced his fellow citizens, handed the fire to them, fell down, and in a few moments died.", "1195": "The Platæans, to show their admiration of him, buried him in the temple of Artemis Eukleia, with this inscription on his tomb:", "1196": "“ Euchidas rail to Delphi and back again in one day.", "1197": "\"As for Eukleia, most persons believe her to be Artemis, and worship her as that goddess ;", "1198": "but some say that she was a daughter of Herakles and Myrto, the daughter of Mencetius, who was the sister of Patroklus, and who, dying a virgin, is worshipped by the Boeotians and Lokrians.", "1199": "An altar and image of her stands in every market-place in these countries, and those who are about to marry, sacrifice to her.", "1200": "XXI.", "1201": "After this Aristeides proposed at a general assembly of all the Greeks, that all the cities of Greece should every year send deputies and religious representa­ tives to the city of Platæa, and that every fifth year Eleutheria, or a festival in honour of Freedom, should be celebrated there.", "1202": "Also he proposed that there should be a general levy throughout Greece, for the war against the Persians, of ten thousand heavy armed troops, a thousand horse, and a hundred ships of war;", "1203": "and that the Platæans should be held inviolable, and consecrated to the service of the gods, to whom they offered sacrifice on behalf of all Greece.", "1204": "These things were ratified, and the people of Platæa undertook to make yearly sacrifices in honour of those who had fallen fighting for Greece, and whose bodies were buried there.", "1205": "This they perform even at the present day in the following fashion.", "1206": "On the sixteenth day of the month Maimakterion, which in the Bœoti calendar is called Alalkomenius, they make a procession headed by a trumpeter sounding the charge.", "1207": "After him follow waggons full of myrtle and garlands of flowers, a black bull, libations of wine and milk in jars, and earthenware vessels full of oil and perfume.", "1208": "These are carried by young men of noble birth, for no slave is allowed to take any part in the proceedings, because the men in whose honour the sacrifice is made, died fighting for liberty.", "1209": "Last of all comes the chief magistrate of Platæa, who, during the rest of his term of office, is not allowed to touch iron, or to wear clothes of any colour but white.", "1210": "On this day, however, he wears a scarlet tunic, takes an urn* from the public record office in one hand, and a sword in the other, and proceeds through the middle of the city to the sepulchres.", "1211": "There he with his own hands draws water from the well, washes the head-stones of the graves, and anoints them with oil.", "1212": "After this he cuts the throat of the bull, places his bones on a funeral pile, and with prayer to Zeus, and Hermes who conducts men's souls into the nether world, he calls on the brave men who died for Greece, to come to the feast and drink the libations of blood.", "1213": "Next he mixes a large bowl of wine and water, pours out a cup for himself, and says, \" I drink to those who died in defence of the freedom of Greece.\"", "1214": "This custom is observed even to this day by the Platæans.", "1215": "XXII.", "1216": "After the return of the Athenians to their own city, Aristeides observed that they desired to adopt a demo­ cratic form of government.", "1217": "As he considered that the people had by their bravery deserved a share in the management of affairs, and likewise thought that it would be hard to turn them from their purpose as they had arms in their hands, and were confident in their strength because of the victories which they had won, he carried a decree that every citizen should have a share in the government, and that the archons should be chosen out of the whole body of Athenians.", "1218": "When Themistokles told the Athenian assembly that he had in his mind a proposition most valuable to the state, which nevertheless could not be openly discussed, the people bade Aristeides alone listen to what it was and give his opinion upon it.", "1219": "Then Themistokles told Aris­ teides, that he meditated burning the entire fleet of the Greeks, as they lay drawn up on the beach, as by this means Athens would become the greatest state in Greece, and mistress of all the others.", "1220": "Aristeides, on hearing this, came forward to the assembly and said that the proposal of Themistokles, although most advantageous, was yet most wicked and unjust.", "1221": "When the people heard this, they forbade Themistokles to prosecute his design.", "1222": "So highly did the Athenians prize justice, and so well and faithfully did Aristeides serve them.", "1223": "XXIII.", "1224": "Being sent as general, with Kimon as his colleague, to the war with Persia, he perceived that Pausanias and the other Spartan generals were harsh and insolent to their allies;", "1225": "and he himself, by treating them with kindness and consideration, aided by the gentle and kindly temper shown by Kimon in the campaign, gradually obtained supreme authority over them, not having won it by arms or fleets, but by courtesy and wise policy.", "1226": "The Athenians, already beloved by the Greeks, on account of the justice of Aristeides and the kindliness of Kimon, were much more endeared to them by the insolent brutal­ ity of Pausanias, who always spoke roughly and angrily to the chiefs of the various contingents of allies, and used to punish the common men by stripes, or by forcing them to stand all day with a heavy iron anchor on their shoulders.", "1227": "No one was permitted to obtain straw or forage for their horses, or to draw water from a well before the Spartans had helped themselves, and servants were placed with whips to drive away any who attempted to do so.", "1228": "Aristeides once endeavoured to complain of this to Pausanias, but he knitting his brows, rudely told him that he was not at leisure, and took no notice of his words.", "1229": "' this the generals and admirals of the Greek states, especially those from Chios, Samoa, and Lesbos, besought Aristeides to make himself commander-in-chief, and rally round him all the allied cities, who had long desired to get rid of the Spartan supremacy and to take the side of Athens.", "1230": "He answered that he admitted the justice and even the necessity of their proposals, but that they must prove themselves to be in earnest by some act which would make it impossible for the great body of them to draw back.", "1231": "Upon this, Ouliades of Samos, and Antagoras of Chios conspired together, and off Byzantium, they ran on board of the ship of Pausanias, which was sailing before the rest.", "1232": "He on seeing this, rose up in a rage and threat­ ened that in a short time he would let them know that they had not endangered his ship, but their own native cities.", "1233": "They in answer bade him go his way and be thankful for the victory at Platæa won under his command, for that it was which alone restrained the Greeks from dealing with him as he deserved.", "1234": "Finally they left him, and sailed away to join the Athenian ships.", "1235": "On this occasion the magnanimous conduct of the Lacedæmonians deserves high praise.", "1236": "When they perceived that the heads of their generals were being turned by the greatness of their power, they of their own accord withdrew from the supreme power, and no longer sent any generals to the wars, choosing rather to have moderate citizens who would abide by their laws at home, than to bear rule over the whole of Greece.", "1237": "Even while the Lacedæmonians remained in command, the Greeks paid a certain contribution to pay the expenses of the war;", "1238": "and as they wished each city to be assessed to pay a reasonable sum, they asked the Athenians to appoint Aristeides to visit each city, learn the extent of its territory and revenues, and fix upon the amount which each was capable of contributing according to its means.", "1239": "Although he was in possession of such a power as this­ the whole of Greece having as it were given itself up to be dealt with at his discretion-yet he laid down his office a poorer man than when he accepted it, but having com­ pleted his assessment to the satisfaction of all.", "1240": "As the ancients used to tell of the blessedness of the golden age, even so did the states of Greece honour the assessment made by Aristeides, calling the time when it was made, fortunate and blessed for Greece, especially when no long time afterwards it was doubled, and subsequently trebled.", "1241": "The money which Aristeides proposed to raise amounted to four hundred and sixty talents;", "1242": "to which Perikles added nearly a third part, for Thucydides tells us that at the commencement of the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians received six hundred talents a year from their allies.", "1243": "After the death of Perikles, the popular orators gradually raised the sum total to thirteen hundred talents.", "1244": "It was not so much that the money was required for the expenses of a long and costly war, as that these men had accustomed the people to largesses of money, dramatic representations, and the erection of statues and temples.", "1245": "Themistokles was the only man who had sneered at the great reputation which Aristeides had won by his assessment of the Greek states, saying, that the praise which was lavished on him was not suitable to a man, but to a chest which kept money safe.", "1246": "This he said as a retort to a saying of Aristeides, who once, when Themistokles said that he thought it the most valuable quality for a general to be able to divine beforehand what the enemy would do, answered, “ That, Themistokles, is very true, but it is also the part of an honourable general to keep his hands clean.\"XXV.", "1247": "Aristeides, moreover, bound all the Greeks by an oath to keep the league against the Persians, and him­ self swore on behalf of Athens, throwing wedges of red hot iron into the sea after the oath was taken, and pray­ ing that the gods might so deal with those that broke their faith.", "1248": "But afterwards, when circumstances forced the Athenians to govern with a stronger hand, ho bade the Athenians act as they pleased, for he would take upon himself any guilt of perjury which they might incur.", "1249": "And throughout his life Theophrastus observes that Aristeides, though scrupulously just in his dealings with his fellow-citizens, yet sometimes in dealing with other states was guided rather by advantage than by equity.", "1250": "For instance, when the Athenians were debating a proposal of the Samians, that the treasure of the league should be removed from Delos to Athens, a thing distinctly con­ trary to the articles of the alliance, Aristeides said that it was not just, but that it was expedient to do so.", "1251": "He himself, at the end of his life, after raising his city to be the ruler of so many people, remained in his original poverty, and took no less pride in his poverty than in the victories which he had won.", "1252": "This is proved by the following anecdote.", "1253": "Kallias, the torch-bearer in the Eleusinian mysteries, a relation of his, was being prose­ cuted on a capital charge by his private enemies.", "1254": "After speaking with great moderation upon the subject of the indictment, they used the following argument to the jury:", "1255": "\"Gentlemen, you all know Aristeides the son of Lysimachus, whose name is renowned throughout Greece.", "1256": "How think you that man fares at home, when you see him appearing in public with such a worn-out cloak?", "1257": "May we not suppose when we see him shivering out of doors, that he has but little to eat at home, and is in want of common necessaries?", "1258": "Yet Kallias, the richest man in Athens, allows this man, who is his own cousin, to be in want, he and his wife and children, though he has often benefited by him and profited by his influence with you.\"", "1259": "Kallias, perceiving that the jury were especially wrought upon by this appeal and that it was likely to tell against him, called Aristeides into the court, and begged of him to bear witness to the jury that although lie had often offered him money and begged him to accept it he had always refused, answering that he prided him­ self more upon his poverty than Kallias did upon his wealth;", "1260": "for one may see many persons making both a good and a bad use of riches, but it is hard to meet with a man who bears poverty with honour.", "1261": "Those only should be ashamed of poverty who are poor against their wills.", "1262": "When Aristeides bore witness to the truth of this, on behalf of Kallias, there was no one who heard him but left the court wishing rather to be poor like Aristeides than rich like Kallias.", "1263": "This story is preserved by AEschines, the companion of Sokrates.", "1264": "Plato considers that this man alone, of all the great men of Athens, is worthy of mention by him.", "1265": "Themis­ tokles, and Kimon, and Perikles, did indeed fill the city with public buildings, and money, and folly, but Aria­ teides in his political acts cared for nothing but virtue", "1266": "Une great proof of this is his kindly treatment of Themis­ tokles.", "1267": "Though this man was his enemy throughout, and was the cause of his banishment by ostracism, yet when Themistokles gave him an opportunity of reveng­ ing himself in a similar manner he never remembered the injuries which he had received at his hands, but while Kimon, and Alkmæon, and many others, were en­ deavouring to drive him into exile and bringing all kinds of accusations against him,Aristeides alone never did or said anything against him, and did not rejoice over the spectacle of his enemy's ruin, just as he never envied his previous prosperity.", "1268": "XXVI.", "1269": "Some writers say that Aristeides died in Pontus, to which country he had been sent on matters of state:", "1270": "while others say that he died of old age at Athens, respected and honoured by all his countrymen there.", "1271": "Kraterus of Macedonia tells us the following particulars about his end.", "1272": "After Themistokles went into exile the common people grew insolent and produced a numerous brood of informers, who constantly assailed the noblest and most powerful citizens through envy of their pros­ perity and influence.", "1273": "One of these men, Diophantus of Amphitrope by name, obtained a verdict against Aris­ teides on a charge of receiving bribes.", "1274": "It was stated that when he was regulating the assessment of the Ionians he received money from them to tax them more lightly.", "1275": "As he was unable to pay the fine of fifty mines, which the court laid upon him, he left Athens and died some­ where in Ionia.", "1276": "But Kraterus offers no documentary evidence of this, neither of the sentence of his condem­ nation nor the decree of the people, although in general it is his habit to quote his authority for statements of this kind.", "1277": "And almost all others who have spoken of the harsh treatment of generals by the people mention the banishment of Themistokles, the imprisonment of Mil­ tiades, the fine imposed on Perikles, and the suicide of Paches in court when sentence was pronounced against him, but although they speak of the banishment of Aristeides, they never allude to this trial and sentence upon him.", "1278": "XXVII.", "1279": "Moreover, there is his tomb at Phalerum, which is said to have been constructed at the public expense, because he did not leave enough money to defray his funeral expenses.", "1280": "It is also related that his daughters were publicly married at the charges of the state, which provided them each with a dowry of three thousand drachmas.", "1281": "At the instance of Alkibiades, his son Lysimachus was also presented with a hundred silver minæ, and as many acres of planted land, and in addition to this, an allowance of four drachmas a day.", "1282": "Kallisthenes also tells us that this Lysimachus leaving a daughter named Polykrite, she was assigned by the Athenians the same daily allowance of food as is bestowed upon the victors in the Olympian games.", "1283": "But Demetrius of Phalerum, Hieronymus of Rhodes, Aristoxenus the musician, and Aristotle, (if we are to believe the ‘ Treatise on Nobility ’ to be a genuine work of his) say, that Myrto, the granddaughter of Aristeides, lived in the house of Sokrates the philosopher, who was indeed married to another woman, but who took her into his house because she was a widow and destitute of the necessaries of life.", "1284": "These authors are sufficiently confuted by Panætius in his writings on Sokrates.", "1285": "Demetrius of Phalerum says, in his book about Sokrates, that he knew one Lysimachus, a very poor man, who dwelt near the Temple of Iacchus and made his living by the interpre­ tation of dreams.", "1286": "Demetrius further states that he carried a bill before the Assembly by which this man's mother and sister were provided with a pension of three obols daily at the public expense.", "1287": "Demetrius, however, when himself a legislator, appointed that each of these women should receive a drachma instead of three obols a day.", "1288": "And we need not wonder at the people taking such care of the resident citizens, when we read that, hearing that the granddaughter of Aristogeiton was living in poverty at Lemnos, so poor that no one would marry her, they brought her back to Athens, gave her in marriage to a man of high birth, and bestowed upon her a farm at Potamus for a marriage portion.", "1289": "The city of Athens has shown many instances of this kindness and goodness of heart even down to our times, and is justly praised and admired for it1.", "1290": "MARCUS CATO is said to have been born at Tusculum, but to have been brought up and spent his time upon a farm belonging to his father in the Sabine territory, before he began to take part in war or politics.", "1291": "We know nothing of his ancestry, except that he himself tells us that his father, Marcus, was a good man and brave soldier, and that his grandfather, Cato, received several military rewards for his services, and that having had five horses killed under him, he received the value of them from the public treasury, as an acknowledgment of his gallantry.", "1292": "It was the Roman custom to call those who had no ancestry to recommend them, but who rose by their own merits, new men.", "1293": "This name was applied to Cato, who said that he was indeed new to honours and posts of importance, but that, in respect of his brave and virtuous ancestry, he was a man of ancient family.", "1294": "His third name originally was not Cato, but Priscus, and was changed to Cato on account of his wisdom, for in Latin catus means \" clever.\"", "1295": "In appearance he was rather red- haired, and grey-eyed, peculiarities which are ill-naturedly dwelt upon by the writer of the epigram­ “ Red-haired, grey-eyed, and savage-tusked as well, Porcius will find no welcome e'en in hell.", "1296": "\"Accustomed as he was to hard exercise, temperate living, and frequent campaigns, his body was always both healthy and strong;", "1297": "while he also practised the power of speech, thinking it a necessary instrument for a man who does not intend to live an obscure and inactive life.", "1298": "He consequently improved his talents in this respect by pleading causes in the neighbouring villages and towns, so that he was soon admitted to be a capable speaker, and afterwards to be a good orator.", "1299": "From this time all who conversed with him perceived a gravity and wisdom in his mind which qualified him to undertake the most important duties of a statesman.", "1300": "Not only was he so dis­ interested as to plead without receiving money from his clients, but he also did not think the glory which ho gained in these contests to be that after which a man ought to strive, in comparison with that which is gained in battle and campaigns, in which he was so eager to distinguish himself that when quite a lad his body was covered with wounds, all in front.", "1301": "He himself tells us that he made his first campaign at the age of seventeen, when Hannibal was ranging through Italy uncontrolled.", "1302": "In battle he was prompt, stedfast, and undismayed, and was wont to address the enemy with threats and rough language, and to encourage the others to do so, as he rightly pointed out that this often cows the enemy's spirit as effectually as blows.", "1303": "When on the march he used to carry his own arms, and be followed by one servant who carried his provisions.", "1304": "It is said that he never spoke harshly to this man, no matter what food he placed before him, but that he would often help him to do his work when he was at leisure from military duty.", "1305": "He drank only water when campaigning, except that when suffering from parching thirst he would ask for some vinegar, and sometimes when his strength fairly failed he would drink a little wine.", "1306": "II.", "1307": "Near his estate was a cottage which had once belonged to Manius Curius, who three times received the honour of a triumph.", "1308": "Cato used frequently to walk over and look at this cottage, and, as he observed the smallness of the plot of ground attached to it, and the simplicity of the dwelling itself, he would reflect upon how Curius, after having made himself the first man in Rome, after conquering the most warlike nations, and driving King Pyrrhus out of Italy, used to dig this little plot of ground with his own hands, and dwelt in this little cottage, after having thrice triumphed.", "1309": "It was there that the ambassa­ dors of the Samnites found him sitting by the hearth, cooking turnips, and offered him much gold ;", "1310": "but he sent them away, saying, “ that a man who was contented with such a supper, had no need of gold, and that it was more honourable for him to conquer those who possessed gold, than to possess it himself.\"", "1311": "Cato, after leaving the cottage, full of these memories, returned to his own house and farm, and after viewing its extent and the number of slaves upon it, he increased the amount of his own daily labour, and retrenched his superfluous expenses.", "1312": "When Fabius Maximus took the city of Tarentum, Cato, who was a very young lad at the time, was serving in his army.", "1313": "He became intimate there with one Nearchus, a philosopher of the Pythagorean school, and listened with much interest to his discourses.", "1314": "Hearing this man, like Plato, describe pleasure as the greatest temptation to evil, and the body as the chief hindrance to the soul, which can only free and purify itself by such a course of reason­ ing as removes it from and sets it above all bodily passions and feelings, he was yet more encouraged in his love of simplicity and frugality.", "1315": "In other respects he is said to have studied Hellenic literature late in life, and not to have read Greek books till extreme old age, when he greatly improved his style of oratory, partly by the study of Thucydides, but chiefly by that of Demosthenes.", "1316": "Be this as it may, his writings are full of Greek ideas and Greek anecdotes:", "1317": "and many of his apophthegms and maxims are literally translated from the Greek.", "1318": "III.", "1319": "The estate adjoining that of Cato belonged to one of the most powerful and highly born patricians of Rome, Valerius Flaccus, a man who had a keen eye for rising merit, and generously fostered it until it received public recognition.", "1320": "This man heard accounts of Cato's life from his servants, how he would proceed to the court early in the morning, and plead the causes of all who required his services, and then on returning to his farm would work with his servants, in winter wearing a coarse coat without sleeves, in summer nothing but his tunic, and how he used to sit at meals with his servants, eating the same loaf and drinking the same wine.", "1321": "Many other stories of his good­ ness and simplicity and sententious remarks were related to Valerius, who became interested in his neighbour, and invited him to dinner.", "1322": "They became intimate, and Valerius, observing his quiet and ingenuous disposition, like a plant that requires careful treatment and an exten­ sive space in which to develop itself, encouraged and urged him to take part in the political life of Rome.", "1323": "On going to Rome he at once gained admirers and friends by his able pleadings in the law courts, while he obtained considerable preferment by the interest of Valerius, being appointed first military tribune, and then quæstor.", "1324": "After this he became so distinguished a man as to be able to compete with Valerius himself for the highest offices in the state, and they were elected together, first as consuls, and afterwards as censors.", "1325": "Of the older Romans, Cato attached himself particularly to Fabius Maximus, a man of the greatest renown and power, although it was his dis­ position and mode of life which Cato especially desired to imitate.", "1326": "Wherefore he did not hesitate to oppose Scipio the Great, who was then a young man, but a rival and opponent of Fabius.", "1327": "Cato was appointed to act as his quæstor in the war in Africa, and on perceiving that Scipio was living with his usual lavish expenditure, and supplying his soldiery with extravagant pay, he sharply rebuked him, saying, \" that it was not the waste of the public money that vexed him so much as the ruin of the old frugal habits of the soldiers, who were led to indulge in pleasure and luxury by receiving more pay than was necessary to supply their daily wants.\"", "1328": "When Scipio answered that he did not require an economist for his quæstor, at a time when he was preparing to wage war on a grand scale, and reminded him that he would have to give an account to the Roman people of battles won, not of money expended, Cato left the army of Scipio, which was then being assembled in Sicily.", "1329": "He proceeded at once to Rome, and by adding his voice to that of Fabius in the Senate, in blame of Scipio's unspeakable waste of money, and his childish and unsoldierly love of the public games.", "1330": "and the theatre, conduct more worthy of the president of a public festival than of the commander-in-chief of an army, prevailed upon the people to send tribunes to enquire into the charges against him, and if they proved true, to bring him back to Rome.", "1331": "When they arrived in Sicily, however, Scipio pointed out to them that the pre­ parations which he had made would ensure him the victory, and that although he loved pleasant society", "1332": "In his hours of leisure, yet that he had never allowed his plea­ sures to interfere with his serious duties.", "1333": "The tribunes were perfectly satisfied with this explanation, and Scipio sailed for Africa.", "1334": "IV.", "1335": "Cato, however, gained considerable credit by his speeches on this occasion, and the Romans generally called him the new Demosthenes;", "1336": "yet his manner of life was more admired than his eloquence.", "1337": "Cleverness of speech was a quality which nearly all the young men of the time sought to attain, but Cato was singular in his keeping up the severe traditions of his ancestors in labouring with his own hands, eating a simple dinner, lighting no fire to cook his breakfast, wearing a plain dress, living in a mean house, and neither coveting super­ fluities nor courting their possessors.", "1338": "The Romans were at this period extending their empire so much as to lose much of their own original simplicity of living, as each new conquest brought them into contact with foreign customs and new modes of life.", "1339": "They therefore naturally looked with admiration upon Cato, observing that while they became enervated by pleasures and broke down under labours, he on the other hand seemed unaffected by either, and that too, not only while he was young and eager for fame:", "1340": "but even when he was an old grey-headed man, after he had been consul and had triumphed, ho yet, like a victorious athlete, still kept himself in training, and never relaxed his severe discipline.", "1341": "He himself tells us that he never wore a garment worth more than a hundred drachmas, that when he was general and consul he still drank the same wine as his servants, that his dinner never cost him more than thirty ases in the market, and that he only indulged himself to this extent for the good of the state, that he might be strong and able to serve his country in the field.", "1342": "When he was left a piece of Babylonian tapestry he at once disposed of it;", "1343": "none of his rooms were whitewashed, and he never bought a slave for more than fifteen hundred drachmas, seeing that he required, not effeminate and handsome servants, but hardworking and strong men, to tend his horses and lord his cattle :", "1344": "and these, too, when they grew old and past work he thought it best to sell, and not feed them at his expense when they were useless.", "1345": "His rule was that nothing is cheap which one does not want, but that superfluities are dearly purchased even if they cost but one penny:", "1346": "and that it is better to buy land which can be ploughed, or where cattle can graze, than beds of flowers which require watering, and paths which have to be swept and kept in order.", "1347": "V.", "1348": "These habits some ascribed to narrowness of mind, while others thought that he carried parsimony and avarice to excess in himself in order by his example to reform and restrain others.", "1349": "Be this as it may, I for my own part consider that his conduct in treating his slaves like beasts of burden, and selling them when old and worn out, is the mark of an excessively harsh disposition, which disregards the claims of our common human nature, and merely considers the question of profit andloss.", "1350": "Kindness, in­ deed, is OF wider application than mere justice;", "1351": "for we naturally treat men alone according to justice and the laws, while kindness and gratitude, as though from a plenteous spring, often extend even to irrational animals.", "1352": "It is right for a good man to feed horses which have been worn out in his service, and not merely to train dogs when they are young, but to take care of them when they are old.", "1353": "When the Athenian people built the Parthenon, they set free the mules which had done the hardest work in drawing the stones up to the acropolis, and let them graze where they pleased unmolested.", "1354": "It is said that one of them came of its own accord to where the works were going on, and used to walk up to the acropolis with the beasts who were drawing up their loads, as if to encourage them and show them the way.", "1355": "This mule was, by a decree of the people of Athens, maintained at the public expense for the rest of its life.", "1356": "The racehorses of Kimon also, who won an Olympic victory, are buried close to the monument of their master.", "1357": "Many persons, too, have made friends and com­ panions of dogs, as did Xanthippus in old times, whose dog swam all the way to Salamis beside his master's ship when the Athenians left their city, and which he buried on the promontory which to this day is called the Dog's Tomb.*", "1358": "We ought not to treat living things as we do our clothes and our shoes, and throw them away after we have worn them out;", "1359": "but we ought to accustom ourselves to show kindness in these cases, if only in order to teach ourselves our duty towards one another.", "1360": "For my own part I would not even sell an ox that had laboured for me because he was old, much less would I turn an old man out of his accustomed haunts and mode of life, which is as great an affliction to him as sending him into a foreign land, merely that I might gain a few miserable coins by selling one who must be as useless to his buyer as he was to his seller.", "1361": "Cato, however, as if taking a perverse pleasure in flaunting his meannesses, relates that he left behind him in Spain the horse which he rode when consul there, in order to save the state the cost of carrying him over to Italy.", "1362": "Whether these acts of his are to be ascribed to magnanimity or narrow-mindedness the reader must decide for himself.", "1363": "VI.", "1364": "He was a man of wonderful temperance, in all other respects also.", "1365": "For example, when he was general, he only drew from the public stock three Attic bushels of wheat a month for himself and his servants, and less than three half-bushels of barley a day for his horses.", "1366": "When he was Governor of Sardinia, where former governors had been in the habit of charging their tents, bedding, and wearing-apparel to the province, and like­ wise making it pay large sums for their entertainment and that of their friends, he introduced an unheard-of system of economy.", "1367": "He charged nothing to the province, and visited the various cities without a carriage, walking on foot alone, attended by one single public servant carry­ ing his robe of state and the vessel to make libations at a sacrifice.", "1368": "With all this he showed himself so affable and simple to those under his rule, so severe and inex­ orable in the administration of justice, and so vigilant and careful in seeing that his orders were duly executed, that the government of Rome never was more feared or more loved in Sardinia than when he governed that island.", "1369": "VII.", "1370": "His conversation seems also to have had this character, for he was cheerful and harsh all at once, pleasant and yet severe as a companion, fond of jokes, but morose at the same time, just as Plato tells us that Sokrates, if judged merely from his outside, appeared to be only a silly man with a face like a satyr, who was rude to all he met,

had settled in the province should be altered or rearranged, Scipio found that it was he rather than Cato that was disgraced, as he had to pass his time in inglorious idleness, while Cato, after

one man since the time of Hannibal.", "1453": "Antiochus had originally inherited nearly the whole of Asia, that is, as much as Seleukus Nikator had possessed, and having added many warlike tribes to his empire, was so elated by his conquests as to attack the Romans, whom he regarded as the only nation remaining in the whole world which was worthy to be his antago­ nist.", "1454": "He put forward

his fathers, and administer a rebuke to those who extravagantly admired the Greeks.", "1461": "Thus he laughed at Postumius Albinus, who wrote a history in Greek and begged that his mistakes might be pardoned, saying that it would be right to pardon them if he wrote his history by a decree of the council of Amphiktyons.", "1462": "He himself says that the Athenians were surprised at the shortness

the Greek forces by a circuitous march over the mountains, took a part of the force and set off by night.", "1467": "When they had gone for some distance over the mountains, the prisoner who served as their guide lost his way, and wandered about in that precipitous and pathless wilderness so as to cause great discouragement to the soldiers.", "1468": "Seeing this,", "1469": "Cato ordered every one to halt and await his orders, and himself, with one companion, one Lucius Manlius, an experienced mountaineer, laboriously and daringly plunged along through intense darkness, for there was no moon, while the trees and rocks added to their difficulties by preventing their seeing distinctly whither they were going, until they came to a path, which, as they thought, led directly down upon the camp of the enemy.", "1470": "Hereupon they set up marks to guide them upon some conspicuous crags of Mount Kallidromus, and returning to the army, led it to these marks, and started along the paths which they had descried.", "1471": "But before they had proceeded far the path ended in a preci­ pice, at which they were both surprised and disheartened;", "1472": "for they could not tell, either by sight or hearing, that they were close to the enemy.", "1473": "It was now about day­ break, and they thought that they heard voices near at hand, and soon were able to see a Greek camp and an outpost at the foot of the precipice.", "1474": "Cato hereupon halted his army, and ordered the Firmiani,* in whom he reposed especial confidence, to come forward alone.", "1475": "When they had assembled round him, he said, \" I wish to take one of the enemy prisoner, and learn from him of what troops this outpost is formed, what their numbers are, how the rest of the army are placed, and what preparations they have made to resist us.", "1476": "You must dash upon them as quickly and boldly as lions do upon their defenceless prey.\"", "1477": "At these words of Cato's the Firmiani at once rushed down and attacked the outpost.", "1478": "The suddenness of theis onset threw the enemy into complete confusion, and they soon caught one of them and brought him before Cato.", "1479": "Learning from this man that all the rest of the army was with King Antiochus himself, guarding the pass of Thermopylae, and that only a body of six hundred picked Ætolians were watching the path over the moun­ tains, Cato despising so small and contemptible a force, at once drew his sword, and led on his troops with shouts and trumpets sounding the charge.", "1480": "The Ætolians, as soon as they saw the Romans descending from the hills, fled to the main body, and filled it with confusion and terror.", "1481": "XIV.", "1482": "Mean while Manius on the lower ground had attacked the fortifications in the pass with his entire force.", "1483": "Antiochus was struck on the mouth with a stone which knocked out several of his teeth, and the pain of his wound compelled him to wheel round his horse and retreat.",

marshy ground on the one hand and inaccessible rocks upon the other, and there trampled each other to death for fear of the swords of the Romans.", "1485": "Cato never seems to have been sparing of his own praise, and thought that great deeds required to be told in boastful language.", "1486": "He gives a very pompous account of this battle, and says that all those who saw him pursuing and cutting down the enemy felt that Cato did not owe so much to the Romans, as the Romans owed to Cato.", "1487": "He also says that the consul Manius immediately after the victory was won, enfolded him for a long time in a close embrace, and loudly declared that neither he nor all the Roman people could ever do as much for Cato as he had that day done for them.", "1488": "He was sent immediately after the battle to bear the news of the victory to Rome, and reached Brundusium after a prosperous voyage.", "1489": "From that place he drove in one day to Talentum, and in four more days reached Rome with the news, on the fifth day after his landing.", "1490": "His arrival filled the whole city with feasting and rejoicing, and made the Roman people believe that there was no nation in the world which could resist their arms.", "1491": "XV. Of Cato's warlike exploits these which we have related are the most remarkable.", "1492": "In his political life he seems to have thought one of his most important duties to be the impeachment and prosecution of those whom he thought to be bad citizens.", "1493": "He himself attacked many persons, and aided and encouraged others in doing so, a notable example being his conduct towards Scipio in the affair of Petillius.", "1494": "However, as Scipio was a man of noble birth and great spirit, he treated the attack made upon him with contempt, and Cato, perceiving that he could not succeed in getting him condemned to death, desisted from annoying him.", "1495": "But he was active in obtaining the condemnation of Scipio's brother Lucius, who was adjudged to pay a heavy fine, which was beyond his means to pro­ vide, so that he had nearly been cast into prison, but was set free by the intervention of the tribunes of the people.", "1496": "It is related of him that he once met in the forum a young man who had just succeeded in obtaining the dis­ franchisement, by an action at law, of an enemy of his father, who was dead.", "1497": "Cato took him by the hand and laid, \"", "1498":

defendant in nearly fifty actions, the last of which was tried when he was eighty-six years of age:", "1500": "on which occasion he uttered that well-known saying, that it was hard for a man who -had lived in one generation to be obliged to defend himself before another.", "1501": "And this was not the end of his litigations, for four years later, when at the age of ninety, he impeached Servius Galba.", "1502": "Indeed his life, like that of Nestor, seems to have reached over three generations.", "1503": "He, as had been related, was a bitter political opponent of Scipio Africanus the Great,

years after his consulship, Cato became a candidate for the office of censor.", "1506": "This is the highest dignity to which a Roman can aspire, and may be regarded as the goal of political life.", "1507": "Its powers are very extensive, and it is especially concerned with the regulation of public morals, and the mode of life of the citizens of Rome.", "1508": "The Romans thought that none of a man's actions, his marriage, his family, his mode of life, his very entertain­ ments, ought to be uncontrolled, and managed accord­ ing to his own will and pleasure.", "1509": "They considered that a man's true character was much more clearly shown by his .", "1510": "private life than by his public behaviour, and were wont to choose two citizens, one a patrician, and the other a plebeian, whose duty it was to watch over the morals of the people, and check any tendency to licentiousness or extravagance.", "1511": "These officers they called censors, and they had power to deprive a Roman knight of his horse, and to expel men of loose and disorderly life from the Senate.", "1512": "They also took a census of property, and kept a register of the various tribes and classes of the citizens ;", "1513": "and they likewise exercised various other important powers.", "1514": "Cato's candidature was opposed by nearly all the most dis­ tinguished members of the Senate, for, the patricians viewed him with especial dislike, regarding it as an insult to the nobility that men of obscure birth should attain to the highest honours in the state, while all those who were conscious of any private vices or departures from the ways of their fathers, feared the severities of one who, they knew, would be harsh and inexorable when in power.", "1515": "These classes consequently combined together against Cato, and put up no less than seven candidates to contest the censorship with him, and endeavoured to soothe the people by holding out to them hopes of a lenient censor, as though that were what they required.", "1516": "Cato on the other hand would not relax his severity in the least, but threatened evil doers in his speeches from the rostra, and insisted that the city required a most searching reforma­ tion.", "1517": "He told the people that if they were wise, they would choose not the most agreeable, but the most thorough physicians to perform this operation for them, and that these would be himself and Valerius Flaccus ;", "1518": "for with him as a colleague he imagined that he might make some progress in the work of destroying, by knife and cautery, the hydra of luxury and effeminacy.", "1519": "Of the other candidates he said that he saw that each one was eager to get the office and fill it badly, because he was afraid of those who could fill it well.", "1520": "The Roman people on this occasion showed itself so truly great and worthy to be courted by great men, as not to be alarmed at the earnest severity of Cato;", "1521": "but, setting aside all those plausible candidates who promised merely to consult their pleasure, elected Cato and Valerius censors.", "1522": "It seemed, indeed, as if Cato, instead of being a candidate for election, was already in office and issuing his commands to the people, which were at once obeyed.", "1523": "XVII.", "1524": "As soon as he was elected, Cato appointed his friend and colleague, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, chief of the Senate.", "1525": "He expelled several senators, amongst whom was Lucius Quintius, who had been consul seven years before, and, which was even a greater distinction than the consul­ ship, was the brother of Titus Quintius Flamininus, the conqueror of Philip.", "1526": "He was expelled from the Senate for the following reason.", "1527": "Lucius had a

gladiators at Rome, yet I did not stay to see it, but came out here to you, although I longed to see a man killed.\"", "1530": "Lucius, to please him, answered in the same tone, \" If that be all, do not lie there and fret, for I will soon gratify your wish.\"", "1531": "He at once ordered a condemned criminal to be brought into the banqueting hall, and one of his servants to stand by him with an axe, and then again asked his favourite whether he wished to see a man struck dead.", "1532": "When the boy said that he did, he bade the servant cut off the man's head.", "1533": "This is the account which most writers give of the transaction, and it is that which Cicero introduces Cato as relating in his dialogue \"", "1534": "On Old Age but Livy says that the man who was put to death was a Gaulish deserter, and that Lucius did not employ a servant, but slew him with his own hand, and this is the version which Cato has followed in his written account of the matter.", "1535": "When Cato discussed what took place at this wine party, Lucius endeavoured to deny it, but on being challenged to state exactly what happened he refused to answer.", "1536": "He was most justly condemned to lose his right as a senator;", "1537": "but afterwards, when some spectacle was being witnessed in the theatre, he walked past the place reserved for men of consular rank, and sat down in the humblest seat of all, which so moved the people to compassion, that they forced him by their clamour to resume his former seat, thus as far as they were able reversing the sentence upon him and condoning his offence.", "1538": "Cato expelled another senator, who was thought likely to be soon elected consul, named Manilius, because he had kissed his wife in the daytime in the presence of his daughter.",

"1541": "His conduct in depriving of his horse Lucius Scipio, the brother of Scipio Africanus, a man who had been decreed a triumph, was censured, as being merely prompted by private spite ;", "1542": "as he seemed merely to do it in order to insult Scipio Africanus after his death.", "1543": "But what caused the greatest dissatisfaction were his re­ strictions on luxury.", "1544": "This he could not attack openly, because it had taken such deep root among the people, but he caused all clothes, carriages, women's ornaments, and furniture, which exceeded fifteen hundred drachmas in value to be rated at ten times their value and taxed accordingly, as he thought that those who possessed the most valuable property ought to contribute most largely to the revenues of the state.", "1545": "In addition to this he imposed a tax on all citizens of three copper ases for every thousand, in order that those who were burdened with an excessive taxation on objects of luxury, when they saw persons of frugal and simple habits paying so small a tail on the same income, might cease from their extravagance.", "1546": "This measure gained him the hatred of those who were taxed so heavily for their luxuries, and of those who, to avoid excessive taxation, were obliged to give up their luxuries.", "1547": "Most persons are as much irritated at losing the means of displaying their wealth as at losing their wealth itself, and it is in superfluities, not in necessaries, that wealth can be displayed.", "1548": "This is what is said to have so much surprised Ariston the Philosopher, that men should consider those persons fortunate who possess what is superfluous, rather than those who possess what is necessary and useful.", "1549": "Skopas the Thessalian also, when one of his friends asked him for something which was not particularly useful to him, and added, that he did not ask for anything necessary or useful, answered, \" Indeed, it is in these useless and superfluous things

the vulgar.", "1551": "XXX.", "1552": "Cato paid no attention to those who blamed his conduct, and proceeded to measures of still greater severity.", "1553": "He cut off the water-pipes, by which water was conveyed from the public fountains into private houses and gardens, destroyed all houses that encroached upon the public streets, lowered the price of contracts for public works, and farmed out the public revenues for the highest possible rents.", "1554": "All this made him still more un- -popular.", "1555": "Titus Flami ninus and Mends attacked him, and prevailed upon the Senate to annul the contracts which he had made for the building of temples and the construction of public works, on the ground that they were disadvantageous to the state.", "1556": "They also encouraged the boldest of the tribunes to proseonte him before the people, and to fine him two talents.", "1557": "He likewise received violent opposition in the matter of the basilica, or public hall, which he built at the public expense in the forum below the senate house, and which was called the Basilica Porcia.", "1558": "In spite of all this, his censorship seems to have been wonderfully popular with the Roman people.", "1559": "When they placed his statue in the Temple of Hygieia, they did not enumerate his campaigns or triumphs in the inscrip­ tion on the base, but wrote what we may translate as follows:", "1560": "\" This statue was erected to Cato because, when Censor, finding the state of Rome corrupt and degenerate, he, by introducing wise regulations and virtuous discipline, restored

marble, they forgot that the fairest image was that of himself which every citizen bore in his heart.", "1562": "When any one expressed surprise at his not having a statue, when so many obscure men had obtained that honour, he answered, \" I had rather that men should ask why I have no statue, than that they should ask why I have one.\"", "1563": "A good citizen, he said, ought not even to allow himself to be praised, unless the state were benefited thereby.", "1564": "He has glorified himself by recording that when men were detected in any fault, they would excuse themselves by saying that

"Also he states that the Senate looked to him in great emergencies as men in a storm look to the pilot, and that when he was not present, they frequently postponed their more important business.", "1567": "This indeed is confirmed by other writers :", "1568": "for he had great influence in Rome on account of his virtuous life, his eloquence, and his great age.", "1569": "XX.", "1570": "He was a good father and a good husband, and was in his private life an economist of no ordinary kind, as he did not despise money-making or regard it as unworthy of his abilities.", "1571": "For this reason I think I ught to relate how well he managed his private affairs.", "1572": "He married a wife who was well born, though not rich ;", "1573": "for he thought that though all classes might possess equally good sense, yet that a woman of noble birth would be more ashamed of doing wrong, and therefore more likely to encourage her husband to do right.", "1574": "He used to say that a man who beat his wife or his children laid sacri­ legious hands on the holiest of things.", "1575": "He also said that he had rather be a good husband than a great statesman, and that what he especially admired in Sokrates the Philosopher was his patience and kindness in bearing with his ill-tempered wife and his stupid children.", "1576": "When his son was born, he thought that nothing except the most important business of state ought to prevent his being present while his wife washed the child and wrapped it in swaddling clothes.", "1577": "His wife suckled the child herself;", "1578": "nay she often gave her breast to the children of her slaves, and so taught them to have a brotherly regard for her own son.", "1579": "As soon as he was able to learn, Cato himself taught him his letters, although he had a clever slave named Chilon, who taught many children to read.", "1580": "He himself declares that he did not wish a slave to reprove his son or pull his ears because he was slow at learning.", "1581": "He taught the boy to read, and instructed him also in the Roman law and in bodily exercises;", "1582": "not confining himself to teaching him to hurl the javelin, to fight in complete armour, and to ride, but also to use his fists in boxing, to endure the extremes of heat and cold, and to swim through swiftly-flowing and eddying rivers.", "1583": "He tells us that he himself wrote books on history with his own hands in large letters, that the boy might start in life with a useful knowledge of what his forefathers had done, and he was as careful not to use an indecent expression before his son as he would have been before the vestal virgins.", "1584": "He never bathed with him;", "1585": "which indeed seems to have been customary at Rome, as even fathers-in-law scrupled to bathe naked before their sons-in-law.", "1586": "In later times, however, the Romans learned from the Greeks the habit of bathing naked, and have taught the Greeks to do so even in the presence of women.", "1587": "While Cato was engaged in this great work of forming his son's character and completing his education he found him eager to learn, and able to make great progress from his natural ability but he appeared so weak and delicate that his father was obliged to relax the stern simplicity of his own life in his favour, and allow him some indul­ gences in diet.", "1588": "The young man, although so weakly, yet proved himself a good soldier in the wars, and distin­ guished himself greatly in the battle in which Æmilius Paulus defeated King Perseus.", "1589": "Afterwards, upon the same day, he either had his sword struck from his hand or let it fall from weakness, and in his grief at the loss got together some of his friends and prevailed upon them again to charge the enemy.", "1590": "With great exertions they succeeded in clearing a space, and at length discovered his sword under a great heap of arms and corpses of friends and foes alike which were piled upon it.", "1591": "Paulus, the commander-in-chief, was much pleased with the youth's eagerness to regain his sword, and sent a letter to Cato in which ho spoke in the highest terms of the courage and honourable feeling which he had shown.", "1592": "He after­ wards married Tertia, the sister of Scipio, and had the gratification of pleasing his father as much as himself by thus allying himself with one of the noblest families in Rome.", "1593": "Thus was Cato rewarded for the care which he had bestowed upon his son's education.", "1594": "XXI.", "1595": "He possessed a large number of slaves, and when captives were for sale he always purchased those who were young, and who, like colts or puppies, could be taught and trained to their duties.", "1596": "None of them ever entered any house but his own, unless sent thither by Cato or by his wife:", "1597": "and if they were asked what Cato was doing, they always answered that they did not know.", "1598": "His rule was, that a slave ought either to be doing his business or to be asleep;", "1599": "and he greatly preferred good sleepers, as he thought that they were more easy tempered than wakeful persons, and also that men who had slept well were better able to work than those who had lain awake.", "1600": "Knowing that love affairs lead slaves into mischief more than anything else, he permitted them to consort with his own female slaves at a fixed price, but forbade them to have anything to do with other women.", "1601": "Cato in his earlier days, being a poor man, and always employed in service in the field, never complained of any thing that he ate, and thought it most disgraceful to quarrel with his servant for not having pleased his palate.", "1602": "Subsequently, however, as he bicame richer, he used to invite his friends and colleagues to dinner, and after the repast was wont to punish with the scourge those servants who had made mistakes or cooked the food badly.", "1603": "He always endeavoured to establish some quarrel amongst his slaves, so that they might plot against one another, instead of combining against himself;", "1604": "and when any of them appeared to have committed any crime deserving to be punished by death, the offender was formally tried, and if found guilty, was put to death in the presence of all his fellow-servants.", "1605": "As Cato grew more eager to make money, he declared that farming was more an amusement than a source of income, and preferred investing his money in remunerative undertakings, such as marshes that required draining, hot springs, establishments for washing and cleaning clothes, land which would produce an income by pasturage or by the sale of wood, and the like, which afforded him a considerable revenue, and one which, as he said, not Jupiter himself could injure, meaning that he was not dependent upon the weather for his income, as farmers are.", "1606": "He also used to deal in marine assurance, which is thought to be a most dangerous form of investment, which he managed in the following manner.", "1607": "For the sake of security he made those who wished to borrow money form themselves into an association of fifty persons, representing as many ships, and held one share in the undertaking himself, which was managed by his freedman Quintio, who himself used to sail in the ships of the association and transact their mercantile business.", "1608": "He used to lend money to his slaves, if they desired it.", "1609": "They used with the money to buy young slaves, teach them a trade at Cato's expense for a year, and then dispose of them.", "1610": "Many of these Cato retained in his own service, paying the price offered by the highest bidder, and deducting from it the original cost of the slave.", "1611": "When endeavouring to encourage his son to act in a similar manner, he used to say that it was not the part of a man, but of a lone woman, to diminish one's capital;", "1612": "and once, with an excessive exaggeration, he said that the most glorious and godlike man was he who on h a death was found to have earned more than he inherited.", "1613": "XXII.", "1614": "When he was an old man, Karneades the academic, and Diogenes the stoic philosopher, came as ambassadors to Rome on the part of the Athenians, to beg that they might not be forced to pay a fine of five hundred talents which had been imposed upon them in consequence of an action at law, brought against the Athenians by the people of Oropus, before the people of Sikyon as judges, having been allowed to go against them by default.", "1615": "Such of the Roman youths as had any taste for literature frequented the society of these men, and took great interest in hearing their discussions.", "1616": "They were especially de­ lighted with Karneades, a man of great and recognised ability, who obtained large and enthusiastic audiences at his lectures, and filled the whole city with his fame.", "1617": "Nothing was talked of except how a single Greek with wonderful powers of eloquence and persuasion had so bewitched the youth of Rome that they forsook all other pleasures, and plunged wildly into philosophic speculations.", "1618": "The greater part of the citizens were well pleased with this, and looked on with great satisfaction at their sons' study of Greek literature, and their intimacy with such celebrated men ;", "1619": "but Cato, when the taste for philosophy first sprang up in Rome, was vexed at it, and feared that the young men might become more eager to gain distinc­ tion by fluent speaking than by warlike exploits.", "1620": "How­ ever, when the fame of the philosophers increased, and a distinguished man, Caius Acilius,- at the general request, translated their first lectures to the Senate, Cato decided that the philosophers must at once be conducted with all due honours out of the city.", "1621": "He came to the Senate and made a speech, in which he blamed them for having allowed an embassy to remain so long at Rome without accomplishing its purpose, although nothing was easier than for it to gain its point.", "1622": "He called upon them there­ fore, to decide as soon as possible and come to a vote upon the matter about which this embassy was come, in order that these philosophers might return to their schools and instruct.", "1623": "the young men of Greece, while those of Rome might, as before, give their attention to the laws and the magi trates.", "1624": "XXIII.", "1625": "Cato acted thus, not as some writers imagine, from any private quarrel with Karneades, but because he disliked the philosophy altogether, and from a feeling of patriotism, regarded all Greek literature and methods of education with hatred and contempt.", "1626": "He used to say that Sokrates was a wordy and dangerous man, who endeavoured in his own way to make himself supreme in Athens, by destroying the best of the national customs and teaching the citizens to hold opinions at variance with the laws.", "1627": "He ridiculed Isokrates as a teacher of rhetoric, saying that his disciples stayed with him so long learning their profession, that they were only able to practice what they had learned in the court where Minos sat as judge in the next world.", "1628": "In his endeavours to dissuade his son from the study of Greek literature, he abused the privileges of old age so far as to utter a prophecy that the Romans would ruin their empire by too intimate an acquaintance with the arts of Greece.", "1629": "Time, however, has proved this to be a mere empty slander, seeing that since then Rome has risen to a wonderful height of power and glory, and yet is thoroughly familiar with Greek writings and studies.", "1630": "Cato not only disliked the Greek philosophers, but also looked with suspicion on the Greek physicians who then practised at Rome.", "1631": "He had heard some story about Hippokrates, who, when the king of Persia offered him a large sum of money if he would come to Persia, answered that he never would give his services to barbarians who were the enemies of Greece.", "1632": "Cato used to say that all Greek physicians had sworn an oath to act like Hippokrates, and warned his son never tc have any dealings with any of them.", "1633": "He himself had a book full of recipes, according to which he used to physick and regulate the diet of any who fell sick in his house, being careful never to allow the patient to fast, but making him eat salad, with ducks, pigeons, and hares, which he said were light food, and suitable for sick persons, except that it often happened that those who ate of them suffered from nightmares.", "1634": "He used to declare that by following this regimen, he kept both himself and all his household in perfect health.XXIV.", "1635": "He seems to have been justly rewarded for his quackery, for he lost both his wife and his son by sickness.", "1636": "He himself, however, being of an iron constitution, made a second marriage, in spite of his advanced age, being led into it by the following circumstances.", "1637": "After the death of his wife he arranged a marriage between his son and the daughter of Æmilius Paulus, who was the sister of Scipio.", "1638": "He himself meanwhile solaced himself by an intrigue with a maid-servant who visited him by stealth.", "1639": "However, in a small house with a daughter-in-law in it this could not be kept secret;", "1640": "and one day when this woman was insolently swaggering into his father's bedchamber, young Cato was observed by the old man to glance at her with bitter hatred and then turn away in disgust.", "1641": "As soon as Cato perceived that his conduct vexed his children, he said not a word, but went into the forum with his friends, as was his wont.", "1642": "Here one Salonius, who was one of his under-secretaries, met him and began to pay his respects to him, when Cato asked him in a loud voice whether he had provided a hus­ band for his daughter.", "1643": "On the man's replying that he had not, and would not presume to do so without consult­ ing him, Cato replied, \" Well, I, by Jupiter, have found a very suitable person to marry her, unless his age be any objection:", "1644": "for he is very passable in all respects except that he is very old.\"", "1645": "As Salonius upon this bade him carry out his intention and marry the girl to whomsoever he pleased, seeing that she was his client- and he was her patron, Cato without a moment's delay told him that he wished to marry the girl himself.", "1646": "This proposal at first, as might be expected, astonished the secretary, who had thought that a man at Cato's time of life was very un­ likely to marry, and had never dreamed that his humble family would be allied with a house which could boast of consulates and triumphs;", "1647": "but as he saw that Cato was in earnest he gladly accepted his offer.", "1648": "While the preparations for the marriage were in progress, young Cato, taking his relatives with him, went and inquired of his father whether he had reproached or annoyed him in any way, that he was putting a mother-in-law over him.", "1649": "Cato at this question cried out aloud, “ Hush, my son;", "1650": "I approve of all that you have done, and find no fault with you:", "1651": "I only desire to leave behind me more sons of my race, and more citizens to serve the state.\"", "1652": "It is said that this remark was first made by Peisistratus, the despot of Athens, when, although he had sons grown up, he married Timonassa of Argos, by whom we are told that he had two sons, Iophon and Thes­ salus.", "1653": "Cato also had a son by his second marriage, whom he named Salonius after his mother.", "1654": "His eldest son died during his prætorship.", "1655": "Cato often mentions him in his writings as having been a brave and good man, but is said to have borne his loss with philosophic resignation, and to have taken as keen an interest in politics as before.", "1656": "He did not, as was.", "1657": "afterwards done by Lucius Lucullus or Metellus Pius, abandon public life when he grew old, and think that it was a burden to take part in politics;", "1658": "still less did he imitate Scipio Africanus, who some years before had proudly turned his back on the people who grudged him the glory he had won, and spent the rest of his life in ease and retirement.", "1659": "Some one is said to have told Dionysius of Syracuse that an absolute monarchy is the best thing for a man to die in, and so Cato seemed to think that political life was the best for him to grow old in, while he amused himself in his leisure moments by writ­ ing and farming.", "1660": "XXV.", "1661": "He compiled works on various subjects, especially on history.", "1662": "Farming he applied himself to when very young, on account of his poverty, for he himself tells us that he had only two sources of income, farming and fru­ gality.", "1663": "In later life he derived both amusement and instruction from watching the operations of agriculture, and he has written a farmer's manual, in which there is even an account of how to cook cakes and preserve fruits, so desirous was he to show a thorough knowledge of every subject.", "1664": "His table was never so well served as when he was in the country ;", "1665": "for he used to invite all his friends and acquaintances from the neighbourhood, and make him­ self very agreeable to them, as he was a pleasant companion not only to men of his own age, but also to the young, having in the course of his long life seen and heard from others much that was interesting and curious.", "1666": "He re­ garded the table as the best means of forming friendships, and when dining used to praise the good without stint, but never would allow the names of worthless men to be mentioned, either by way of praise or blame, at his enter tainments.", "1667": "XXVI.", "1668": "The last of his political acts is said to have been the destruction of Carthage.", "1669": "This was actually brought to pass by Scipio the Younger, but it was chiefly owing to the counsels of Cato that the war was begun.", "1670": "His reason for insisting on its destruction was this.", "1671": "He was sent on a mission to Africa to investigate the grounds of a quarrel which existed between the Carthaginians and Masinissa, the king of the Numidians.", "1672": "Masinissa had always been the friend of Rome, whereas the Cartha­ ginians, after their defeat by Scipio, had been subjected to hard conditions, having lost their sovereignty over the neighbouring tribes, and having been compelled to pay a large sum as tribute to Rome.", "1673": "Cato, however, found the city, not, as the Romans imagined it to be, crushed by its recent overthrow, but full of young men, overflowing with wealth, well provided with arms and munitions of war, and, as may be expected, full of warlike spirit.", "1674": "He concluded that it was no time for the Romans to arbitrate about the grievances of Masinissa and his Numidians, but that, unless they at once destroyed a city which bore them an undying hatred and which had recovered its strength in an incredibly short space of time, they would have as much:", "1675": "tofear from Carthage as ever.", "1676": "He quickly returned home, and pointed out to the Senate that the former defeats and misfortunes suffered by the Carthaginians had not really broken their strength so much as they had dissipated their overweening self-confidence, and that in the late war they had not lost so much in strength as they had gained in experience and skill.", "1677": "Their present difference with the Numidians was, he urged, merely a prelude to an attack upon Rome, with which city they kept up the fiction of a peace which would soon upon a suitable opportunity be exchanged for war.", "1678": "XXVII.", "1679": "After these words it is said that Cato threw down in the senate house some ripe figs which he had brought on purpose;", "1680": "and when the senators admired their size and beauty, he remarked that\" the country which produced this fruit is only three days' sail distant from Rome.\"", "1681": "Another and a mor violent method of forcing the Romans to attack them was his habit, when giving his opinion on any subject whatever, to append the words, “ And I also am of opinion that Carthage must be de­ stroyed.\"", "1682": "On the other hand, Publius Scipio, called Nasica, used to end all his speeches with the words, \"And I further am of opinion that Carthage should be left alone.\"", "1683": "Scipio's reason for this was that he perceived that the lower classes in Rome, elated by success, were becoming difficult for the Senate to in anage, and practically forced the State to adopt whatever measures they chose.", "1684": "He thought that to have this fear of Carthage kept constantly hanging over them would be a salutary check upon the insolence of the people, and he thought that although Carthage was too weak to conquer the Romans, yet that it was too strong to be despised by them.", "1685": "Cato, on the other hand, thought it a dangerous thing that, at a time when the Romans were giddy and drunk with power, they should leave in existence a city which always had been important, and which now, sobered by defeat, was biding its time and lying in wait for a favourable opportunity to avenge itself.", "1686": "He argued that it was better to set the Romans free from any fear of foreign states, in order that they might be able to devote themselves uninterruptedly to the task of political reform.", "1687": "These are said to have been Cato's reasons for urging his countrymen to begin the third and last Punic war.", "1688": "He died as soon as the war was begun, leaving a prophecy that it would be finished by a young man who was then serving as military tribune, and who had given remarkable pi oofs of courage and generalship.", "1689": "Cato, on hearing of his exploits is said to have quoted Homer's line­ “", "1690": "He alone has solid wisdom;", "1691": "all the rest are shadows vain.", "1692": "\"This opinion Scipio soon confirmed by his actions.", "1693": "Cato left one son by his second wife, who, as has been said, was named Salonius, and one grandson, the child of his eldest son who was dead.", "1694": "Salonius died during his prætorship, but his son Marcus became consul.", "1695": "This man was the grandfather of Cato the Philosopher, who was one of the foremost men of his day in courage and ability.", "1696": "Now that we have related all the important events of each of these men's lives, it will be seen that the points in which they differ are very trifling when compared with those in which they agree.", "1697": "If, however, we are to take each of their qualities separately, as one would in com­ paring two speeches or two pictures, we observe that they both agree in having begun life in a humble station, and having won political distinction and power by sheer ability and force of character.", "1698": "It is true that Aristeides rose to power at a period when Athens was poor, and when the orators and generals whom he attacked were men whose means were little superior to his own;", "1699": "for the men of greatest incomes at that time were assessed as having five hundred bushels of wet or dry produce a year, while the next class, that of the knights, had three hundred, and the lowest, or those who could afford to keep a yoke of oxen, had only two hundred.", "1700": "Cato, on the other hand, came from an obscure village and a rustic mode of life, ,ind boldly launched himself upon the turbid sea of Roman politics, although the days of Curius, Fabricius and Atilius were long past, and Rome was not accustomed to find her magistrates and party leaders in labouring men fresh from the plough or the workshop, but in men of noble birth and great wealth, who canvassed extensively, and bribed heavily ;", "1701": "while the populace, insolent with the conscious­ ness of power, were growing ripe for a revolt against the governing class.", "1702": "It was a very different thing for Aristeides to have only Themistokles for an antagonist, a man of no birth or fortune (for it is said that he only possessed between three and five talents when he first embarked on politics) and for Cato to contend for the mastery with men like Scipio Africanus, Sergius Galba, and Titus Quintius Flamininus, with nothing to help him but his eloquent voice and his good cause.", "1703": "II.", "1704": "Furthermore, Aristeides, both at Marathon and at Platæa, acted as general with nine colleagues, while Cato was elected one of the two consuls and afterwards one of the two censors, though there were many other candidates for both offices.", "1705": "Aristeides never conspicuously distin­ guished himself, as the credit of the victory at Marathon belongs to Miltiades, and that of Salamis to Themistokles, while Herodotus tells us that Pausanias obtained the most glorious success of all at Platæa, and even the second place is disputed with Aristeides by Sophanes, Ameinias, Kallimachus, and Kynægyrus, all of whom won great glory in those battles.", "1706": "On the other hand, Cato not only when consul gained the greatest credit, both by his wise conduct, and his personal prowess in the Spanish war, but, when at Thermopylae he was acting as tribune under another person's command as consul, contributed mainly to winning the victory by his flank movement, by which he established himself in the rear of Antiochus while that prince was intent upon the enemy in his front.", "1707": "This victory, which was so manifestly due to Cato, had the important result of driving the Asiatic troops out of Greece back to their own country, and so of preparing the way for Scipio's subsequent invasion of Asia.", "1708": "Neither of them were ever defeated in battle, but in political matters Aristeides was overcome by his rival Themistokles, who drove him into exile by ostracism, while Cato held his own against all the greatest and most influential men in Rome to the end of his life without once being overthrown by them.", "1709": "He was often impeached, and always acquitted, while he frequently succeeded in his impeachments of others, using, both as a bulwark to defend himself and as a weapon to attack others, his power of speaking in public, which indeed is a quality more to be relied upon than good fortune to protect a man from suffering wrong.", "1710": "Antipater, in the account which he wrote of the philosopher Aristotle after his death, observes that besides his other qualities and accomplishments this man had the power of persuasion.", "1711": "III.", "1712": "It is generally admitted that political virtue is the highest to which a man can aspire, and of this, most think domestic virtue to be a very important part;", "1713": "for as a city is merely a collection of houses, the public virtue of the state must be increased if it contain many well-regulated households.", "1714": "Lykurgus, when he banished silver and gold from Sparta, and gave his countrymen useless iron money, did not wish to discourage good household manage­ ment among them, but he removed the dangerous seduc­ tions of wealth out of their reach, in order that they all might enjoy a sufficiency of what was useful and necessary.", "1715": "He saw, what no other legislator appears to have seen, that the real danger to a commonwealth arises from the poor and desperate rather than from the excessively rich.", "1716": "Now we have seen that Cato was as well able to manage his household as to govern the state;", "1717": "for he improved his fortune and became a teacher of household management and husbandry to others, by, collecting much useful infor­ mation on these matters.", "1718": "On the other hand, Aristeides made his poverty a reproach to justice, which by his example was made to seem a ruinous virtue which brought men to want, and was totally useless to those who practised it.", "1719": "Yet the poet Hesiod, when encouraging men to act justly and manage their household affairs well, blames idleness as the origin of injustice, and the same idea is well stated in Homer's lines :", "1720": "­ “ Work was never my delight, Nor household cares, that breed up children bright;", "1721": "But ever loved I ships with banks of oars,", "1722": "And arrows keen, and weapons for the wars,\" where we see that the same men neglect their duties at home, and gain their living by injustice and piracy abroad.", "1723": "The physicians tell us that oil is most useful, outwardly used, and most harmful when taken inwardly;", "1724": "but it is not true of the just man that he is most useful to his friends, but useless to himself.", "1725": "It seems to me tc be a blot on Aristeides' fame, if it be true that he could not even provide money for his daughters' dowry or for his own funeral expenses.", "1726": "The family of Cato for four generations, supplied Rome with prætors and consuls, for his grandchildren, and their children too, all rose to the highest offices in the state ;", "1727": "while the hopeless poverty of Aristeides, though he was the foremost man of his time in Greece, reduced some of his family to the disreput­ able profession of interpreting dreams, and forced others to live on public charity, putting it quite out of their power to emulate the glorious actions of their ancestor.", "1728": "IV.", "1729": "Some, indeed, may dispute this ;", "1730": "for it is true that poverty is no disgrace in itself, but only when it is a proof of indolence, extravagance, or folly.", "1731": "The poverty of a laborious, upright, temperate statesman combines well with his other virtues, and shows true greatness of mind :", "1732": "for a man whose attention is given to little things, can never succeed in doing great ones;", "1733": "nor can a man help others if he is in need of help himself.", "1734": "A statesman requires, not wealth, but contentment, in order that his attention may not be diverted from public affairs by his own cravings for useless luxuries.", "1735": "God alone is entirely without wants, and we approach nearest to the divine ideal when we can reduce our wants to the fewest possible.", "1736": "Just as a healthy man requires neither excess of clothing or of food, so a man's life and that of his family, if properly regulated, can be maintained at a trifling cost.", "1737": "His income, however, must exactly tally with his requirements;", "1738": "for we cannot call that man contented who earr s much, and spends little.", "1739": "He is a foolish man if he troubles himself to amass what he cannot enjoy;", "1740": "while he must be a miserable man if he is able to enjoy the use of wealth, and yet through meanness of spirit forbids himself its use.", "1741": "I would willingly put this question to Cato:", "1742": "\" If we ought to enjoy our wealth, why do you make a virtue of simplicity of living when you are a rich man ?", "1743": "If, on the other hand, it is a noble thing, as no doubt it is, to eat common bread, to drink the same wine as our servants and farm labourers do, and not to want fine clothes or comfortable houses, then Aristeides and Epameinondas, Manius Curius and Caius Fabricius were to be applauded for their neglect of the wealth, whose use they rejected.\"", "1744": "Surely it was not necessary for a man who thought turnips made a delicious meal, and who used to boil them himself while his wife baked the bread, to write so much about how to save a penny, and how a man might most quickly make a fortune.", "1745": "The great advantage of simplicity and contentment is, that it prevents our wishing for super­ fluities, or even thinking about them.", "1746": "Aristeides, when cited as a witness during the trial of Kallias, is said to have observed that those who were poor against their will, ought to be ashamed of it, but that those who, like himself, were poor from their own choice, gloried in their poverty.", "1747": "It would be absurd to suppose that the poverty of Aristeides was not voluntary, when, without doing any criminal act, he might by stripping the body of one dead Persian, or by plundering one tent, have made himself a rich man.", "1748": "But enough of this.", "1749": "V.", "1750": "As to their campaigns, those of Cato added but little to the already vast empire of Rome, while Aristeides was present at Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa, the most glorious of all Grecian victories.", "1751": "We cannot compare Antiochus with Xerxes, nor the destruction of the walls of the Spanish cities by Cato, with the tremendous slaughter of the barbarians by the Greeks, both on sea and land.", "1752": "Aristeides was present at every action of importance, although he gave up his share of glory and rewards, even as he did with gold and silver, to those who needed them more than himself.", "1753": "I cannot blame Cato for always glorifying himself and claiming the first place for himself, although he says in one of his books that it is absurd for a man either to praise or to blame himself;", "1754": "still I think that he who does not even wish for the praises of others, is a more perfect character than he who is always exalting himself.", "1755": "An indifference to popular applause does much to soften the bitterness of political controversy, while on the other hand a love of distinction often leads men to be ill-natured and spiteful to others, a fault which Aristeides entirely avoided, and to which Cato was peculiarly liable.", "1756": "Aristeides saved Athens by supporting the authority of Themistokles on several critical occasions, and even acting as his subordinate;", "1757": "while Cato by his opposition, nearly ruined Scipio's famous expedition to Carthage, in which he defeated the hitherto invincible Hannibal.", "1758": "Nor did he cease his intrigues against Scipio until by calumnious and false accusations he drove him out of Rome, and stigmatized his brother with the disgraceful charge of embezzling the public money.", "1759": "VI.", "1760": "Self-denial, upon which Cato has bestowed such lavish praise, was practised in its purest and brightest form by Aristeides, while Cato seems to have forfeited all claim to this virtue by his unsuitable and unseasonable second marriage.", "1761": "It could not be to his honour, when he was of such a great age, to marry the daughter of his own servant, a man who acted as a public clerk, and to bring her into the house to act as mother-in-law to his son, who was now himself grown up and married.", "1762": "Whether he acted thus from natural inclination, or to spite his son for his behaviour about his mistress, the marriage and the motives which led to it are equally discreditable to him.", "1763": "The sarcastic explanation of it which he gave to his SOIl is utterly untrue;", "1764": "for had he wished to beget other children as noble as his son, he ought to have married a well-born lady at once, and not to have been satisfied with a low intrigue until it was detected, and then to have chosen as his father-in-law, the man whom he could most easily influence, rather than some one whose alliance would bring him honour and advantage.", "1765": "I.", "1766": "In the city of Mantinea there was a citizen named Kleander, of one of the first families, and of great influence.", "1767": "Nevertheless he was so unfortunate as to be forced to leave his native city, and take refuge in Megalopolis, to which he was chiefly attracted by Kraugis, the father of Philopoemen, a man eminent in every respect, and an especial private friend of Kleander.", "1768": "While Kraugis lived, Kleander wanted for nothing, and after his death endeavoured to repay the debt which he owed him by devoting himself to the education of his orphan son, just as Homer tells us that Achilles was nurtured by the exile Phoenix.", "1769": "The child, who always was of a noble and commanding spirit, grew under his care into a youth of great promise.", "1770": "As he came near to manhood Ekdemus and Megalophanes, two citizens of Megalopolis, took charge of his education.", "1771": "These men had studied in the Academy with Arkesilaus, and more than any others brought the lessons of philosophy to bear upon politics and the daily affairs of life.", "1772": "They freed their own country of the despot Aristodemus by secretly contriving his assassination, drove out the despot Nikokles from Sikyon, with the help of Aratus, and, at the request of the people of Kyrene, whose state was a prey to revolution, they went to that country and restored order and respect for the laws.", "1773": "They themselves, however, reckoned their most important work to have been the education of Philopoemen, because by bringing him up in the precepts of true philosophy they made him a benefactor to all Greece.", "1774": "And truly Greece loved him exceedingly, as the last great man born of her old age, after so many great and famous men of former times.", "1775": "A Roman speaking in his praise called him the last of the Greeks, as though he thought tht.t Greece had never after him produced any son worthy of herself.", "1776": "II.", "1777": "His appearance was not repulsive, as some think ;", "1778": "for we can see the statue of him which exists at Delphi at this day.", "1779": "The mistake of his Megarian hostess seems to have arisen from his good-nature and simplicity.", "1780": "She, when she heard that the commander-in-chief of the Achaeans was coming to her house, was in a great state of excitement about the preparation of dinner, her husband happening to be away.", "1781": "Meanwhile, Philopœmen entered, dressed in a coarse cloak, and she, supposing him to be a servant sent on in advance, ordered him to help her to get things ready.", "1782": "He at once threw off his cloak and began to split up firewood.", "1783": "While he was thus engaged his friend the master of the house came in, and seeing him, said, \" What is this that you are doing, Philopœmen ?\" \" Why,\" answered he in the Doric dialect, \" I am suffering for my ugly face.\"", "1784": "Titus, also, when jesting upon his bodily shape, said, “ Philopoemen, what fine hands and legs you have;", "1785": "but you have no belly,\" as indeed he had a very small waist.", "1786": "However, the jest was directed more against his power, for though he had plenty of good infantry and cavalry he was frequently in great distress for money to pay them.", "1787": "These are the common anecdotes which are current about Philopoemen.", "1788": "III.", "1789": "His love of distinction was not entirely unmixed with feelings of rivalry and passion.", "1790": "He desired to emulate the fame of Epameinondas, but though he imitated that great man in energy, good sense, and contempt of money, yet he was unable in political struggles to maintain his calm unruffled good-nature, but was often betrayed by his fiery temper into sallies more befitting a soldier than a statesman.", "1791": "Indeed, from a child he had always been fond of war, and eagerly devoted himself to soldier-like exercises, such as fighting in complete armour and riding on horseback.", "1792": "He was thought to be a good wrestler, and was invited by his friends to contend with them in that sport, but he asked them whether the practice would not impair his efficiency as a soldier, when they answered truly that the body and the life of an athlete differs from that of a soldier in every respect, more particularly in diet and exercise.", "1793": "The athlete takes long sleep, frequent meals, regular exercise and intervals of rest, being likely to be put out of condition by the least change of his accustomed routine, while the life of a soldier makes him accustomed to all kinds of change and diversity of life, especially to enduring hunger and want of sleep.", "1794": "On learning this Philopœmen not only himself avoided wrestling and ridiculed it, but when he was in command of an army took every means in his power to bring every kind of athletic exercise into contempt, as likely to unfit the best men'is bodies for the most important struggles in battle.", "1795": "IV.", "1796": "On leaving his schoolmasters he took part in the incursion made by his fellow citizens into the Laconian territory for the purpose of plunder.", "1797": "In these raids it was his wont always to be first in the attack, and last in the retreat.", "1798": "In time of peace he would exercise his body, and make it both swift and strong, either by hunting or by tilling the ground.", "1799": "He possessed a fine estate about twenty furlongs from the city:", "1800": "to this he would walk after his morning or evening meal, and sleep there on any bed he could find, like one of the farm labourers.", "1801": "Then he would rise early, help the vine-dressers or cattle-herds to do their work, and, returning to town, take part in public business.", "1802": "The profits arising from the plunder gained in the forays he used to spend on horses, arms, and the redeeming of captives, while he endeavoured to increase his income by the skilful cultivation of his farm, con­ sidering the most just way of making money, and his strict duty to be, so to manage his fortune as to avoid the temptation of wronging others.", "1803": "He used to listen to conversation and to read treatises upon philosophy, yet not all, but only those which he thought would teach him to be virtuous.", "1804": "He also devoted much time to reading those passages of Homer which stir up and excite manly courage.", "1805": "His other reading consisted chiefly of Evangelus's treatise on military tactics, and of the history of Alexander the Great;", "1806": "but he always thought that reading, unless it led to action, was a useless waste of time.", "1807": "In his studies of tactics he used to disregard the diagrams in the boon.", "1808": "and consider what could be done in the field itself, observ­ ing the slopes and inequalities of the ground, the direction of brooks and water-courses, and the effect which they would have upon a body of troops advancing in line or in column.", "1809": "These reflections he was wont to make during his walks, and to exercise the minds of his companions by questions about them;", "1810": "for he devoted his whole mind to the study of military matters, regarding war as the widest arena for the display of virtue, utterly despising those who were not soldiers, as useless members of society.", "1811": "V.", "1812": "When he was thirty years old Kleomenes, the king of the Lacedæmonians, made a night attack upon Mega­ lopolis, forced his way through the guard on the wall and reached the market-place.", "1813": "Philopœmen came to the rescue, but was not able to dislodge the enemy, although he assaulted them with the greatest spirit.", "1814": "However, he gained time for the citizens to leave the town, while he bore the whole brunt of the attack of Kleomenes, so that at last he had great difficulty in extricating himself, as he had lost his horse and was wounded.", "1815": "The citizens of Megalopolis escaped to Messene, whither Kleomenes sent to offer them their town and territory again.", "1816": "Philopœmen, when he saw his fellow-citizens eager to embrace this offer, restrained them from accepting it by pointing out that Kleomenes did not really offer them their city back again, but meant to get the citizens as well into his power, in order to be able to hold it more securely for the future;", "1817": "because he could not remain there guarding naked walls and empty houses, but would be compelled to leave them and go his way.", "1818": "By these arguments he withheld the Megalopolitans from coming to terms, but gave Kleomenes a pretext for destroying a great part of the city, and carrying away a great booty from it.", "1819": "VI.", "1820": "When King Antigonus some time after this joined the Achaean forces in a campaign against Kleomenes, they came upon his army advantageously posted so as to command the defiles near Sellasia.", "1821": "Philopœmen was among the cavalry that day with his fellow-citizens, and next to him were posted the Illyrians, numerous and war­ like, who covered the flank of the allies.", "1822": "Their orders were to remain in reserve until they saw a red flag raised upon a pike by king Antigonus on the other wing.", "1823": "The generals of the allies attacked the Lacedæmonians with the Illyrian troops, but Eukleides, the brother of Kleomenes, perceiving that by this movement the foot were completely severed from the horse, sent the swiftest of his light-armed troops to outflank them and cut them off.", "1824": "When this was done, and the Illyrians were thrown into great disorder, Philopcemen saw that the cavalry could charge the Lacedæ­ monian light troops with great effect, and pointed this out to Antigonus's generals.", "1825": "Meeting with a scornful refusal, as his reputation was not yet sufficiently great to warrant his suggesting such a manoeuvre, he collected his own fellow-countrymen and charged with them alone.", "1826": "At the first onset he threw the light-armed troops into con­ fusion, and presently routed them with great slaughter.", "1827": "Wishing to encourage the allies and to come more quickly to blows with the retreating enemy, he dismounted, and with great difficulty, encumbered by his heavy horseman's cuirass and accoutrements, pursued over a rough piece of ground full of water-courses and precipitous rocks.", "1828": "While struggling over these obstacles he was struck through both thighs by a javelin with a.- strap attached to it, a wound which was not dangerous, though the javelin struck him with such force as to drive the iron head quite through.", "1829": "This wound for the time rendered him helpless, as it bound both his legs as if with a chain, while the strap made it hard to pull the javelin out again through the wound.", "1830": "As his friends hesitated, not knowing what to do, while the battle now at its height, excited his courage, and made him long to take part in it, he violently strained one leg forward and the other back, so as to break the javelin in the middle, after which the pieces were pulled out.", "1831": "Being thus set free, he drew his sword, ran through the first of the combatants and attacked the enemy, animating all his men and setting them on fire with emulation.", "1832": "After the victory was won Antigonus enquired of the Macedonians why the cavalry had charged without orders.", "1833": "They answered that they were forced to charge against their will by a young citizen of Megalopolis, who attacked on his own account.", "1834": "Antigonus smiled, and answered, “ That young man acted like a veteran commander.\"", "1835": "VII.", "1836": "Philopoemen, as may be supposed, gamed great glory by this action.", "1837": "Antigonus was eager to obtain his services, and offered him a command and high pay, but he excused himself, knowing that his temper would not endure to be under the orders of another man.", "1838": "Still, as he could not be idle, he sailed for Crete to serve a cam­ paign there, in order to gain experience of war.", "1839": "He spent a considerable time there, living amongst warlike, sober, and temperate men, and returned to the Achaeans with so great a reputation that they at once put him in command of the knights.", "1840": "These horsemen, he found, were in the habit of using any chance horses they could pick up when required for a campaign, while in many cases they did not serve in person, but sent substitutes.", "1841": "They were entirely without discipline or bravery, while all this was passed over unnoticed by their commanders, because the knights were the most influential men among the Achæans, and were able to promote or degrade whom they pleased.", "1842": "Philopoemen, however, could not allow this state of things to continue.", "1843": "He went round to each of the cities of the Achaean League, and by personally appealing to the young men's sense of honour, by punish­ ment where it was necessary, and by careful training, exercises, and contests among them before as many spec­ tatoris as possible, in a short time produced great efficiency and military spirit.", "1844": "He made them quick at manoeuvring in squadrons, and in wheeling round and managing their horses, which is so valuable a quality in cavalry soldiers, and taught the whole body to move with ease at the will of one man.", "1845": "Once during a severe battle with the Eleans and Ætolians on the banks of the river Larissa, Damo­ phantus, the commander of the Elean horse, rode furiously to attack Philopœmen.", "1846": "He awaited Damophantus's onset, and with his spear thrust him from his saddle.", "1847": "When he fell the Eleans at once turned and fled, to the great glory of Philopœmen, who had proved himself as brave as the youngest and as skilful as the oldest soldier, equally able to fight or to command.", "1848": "VIII.", "1849": "The Achæan League was first organised by Aratus, who formed its scattered and despicable cities into a noble and truly Greek commonwealth;", "1850": "then, as in running streams, when first a few small stones resist the flow of the water, soon much more is brought down by the stream and lodged against them until a firm ground is formed ;", "1851": "so did the Achæans, by assisting some of the neighbouring cities and freeing them from despots, and by uniting and incorporating others with themselves, endeavour to combine the whole of Peloponnesus into one single state, at a time when Greece was especially weak, having lost all cohesion, each city relying solely on itself.", "1852": "While Aratus lived they depended much on the Macedo­ nians, courting first Ptolemy, then Antigonus and Philip, who all were constantly interfering in the affairs of Greece.", "1853": "But when Philopoemen came to command they already felt themselves a match for the most powerful states, and no longer paid their court to foreign patrons.", "1854": "Aratus, who was no soldier, had effected most of his successes by suave diplomacy and personal friendship with foreign princes, as we have written in his Life :", "1855": "but Philopoemen, a brave and vigorous, and, what is more, an eminently successful commander in his first essays, greatly raised the spirit and the strength of the Achæans, by making them confident of victory under his leadership.", "1856": "IX.", "1857": "His first task was to alter the military equipment and arms of the Achæans.", "1858": "They had hitherto used light shields, too narrow to protect the body, and spears much smaller than the long Macedonian pike.", "1859": "This light armament rendered them effective as skirmishers, but unable to hold their own in close fighting.", "1860": "Their order of battle, too, was loose and without cohesion, having neither the projecting pikes nor the serried shields of the Macedonian phalanx, in consequence of which they were easily thrust aside and routed.", "1861": "Philopœmen pointed this out to them, and persuaded them to adopt the heavy shield and pike in place of their light arms, to accoutre themselves with helmet, corslet, and greaves, and to endeavour to move in a steady unbroken mass instead of in a loose irregular skirmishing order.", "1862": "When he had induced them to put on complete armour he raised their spirit by telling them that they would be unconquer­ able, while he also effected a most wholesome change in their luxurious habits of life.", "1863": "It was impossible entirely to do away with their long-standing passion for fine purple robes and tapestry, rich banquets, and furniture:", "1864": "but he directed this love of finery to useful purposes, and soon brought them all to retrench their private expenditure, and to take a pride in the splendour of their military equip­ ments.", "1865": "Their plate was sent to the crucible, and employed to gild corslets, shields, and caparisons;", "1866": "their public places were full of young men training chargers or exer­ cising themselves in arms, while the women were busy fitting plumes to helmets, and ornamenting buff coats and military cloaks.", "1867": "The sight of all this activity roused up their courage, and made them eager for battle.", "1868": "In all other cases too much care for outward show and display leads to effeminacy and luxury, because the pleasure which our senses receive from these things blunt our better judgment, but in military matters this is not so, for a splendid appearance under arms increases men's courage ;", "1869": "as Homer tells us that Achilles, when his new arms were brought to him, was at once excited by a vehement desire to make use of them.", "1870": "The youth, thus equipped, were in­ cessantly exercised and practised in their new manoeuvres, which they performed with zealous goodwill, being de­ lighted with the close formation of the phalanx, which seemed as though it could never be broken.", "1871": "They soon began to move with ease in their heavy armour, priding themselves upon its splendour, and longing to prove its value in battle against their enemies.", "1872": "The Achaeans at this time were at war with Machanidas the despot of Lacedæmon, who had immense resources at his disposal, and menaced the whole of Peloponnesus.", "1873": "As soon as news came that he had invaded Arcadia and had reached Mantinea, Philopœmen with his army marched rapidly to attack him.", "1874": "Both sides drew up their forces near the city of Mantinea, and both brought into the field not only nearly nil their own countrymen, but also large bodies of foreign mercenary troops.", "1875": "Machanidas began the battle by a charge of his mercenaries, who routed the Tarentines and other light troops of the Achaeans, but then instead of moving at once to attack and overwhelm their main body, hurried away in pursuit, leaving the Achæan phalanx standing untouched.", "1876": "Philopoemen made light of the disaster which had happened to the light troops, and, perceiving the fault which the enemy had committed in leaving their heavy infantry unprotected, so that he had an open plain over which to march against them, disre­ garded those Lacedæmonians who were pursuing his own auxiliaries, and bore straight down upon their main body, which he took in flank, without any cavalry to protect it, or any general to give it orders, as the men did not expect to be attacked, and imagined that the victory was already won when they saw Machanidas so eager in the pursuit.", "1877": "Philopœmen broke and routed them with great slaughter, four thousand men being said to have perished, and then turned to encounter Machanidas, who was returning with his mercenaries, and found his retreat cut off.", "1878": "A deep and wide watercourse here divided the two leaders, the one of whom endeavoured to pass it and escape, while the other tried to prevent this.", "1879": "They looked no longer like two generals, but the despot seemed more like some savage beast driven to bay by Philopœmen, that mighty hunter.", "1880": "At length the despot spurred his horse, a fiery animal, to attempt the leap.", "1881": "The horse gained the other bank with its fore feet, and was struggling up it, when Simias and Polyænus, the constant companions and aides-de-camp of Philopœmen, rode to attack him with levelled lances.", "1882": "Philopoemen, however, came up with Machanidas before them.", "1883": "Seeing that the despot's horse was rearing its head so as to protect its master's body, he turned his own horse a little to one side, and, seizing his lance firmly with both hands, drove it through his body and cast him from his horse.", "1884": "It is in this posture that Philopœmen is represented in the statue at Delphi, which was placed there by the Achaeans in token of their admiration of his courage and conduct on that day.", "1885": "XI.", "1886": "It is said that when the Greeks were assembled at the Nemean Games, Philopoemen, who had been elected commander-in-chief for the second time, and not long before had won his victory at Mantinea, being at leisure during the festival displayed his phalanx to the Greeks, with the troops drawn up in their serried array, and man­ œuvring with quickness and precision.", "1887": "Afterwards, while the musicians were contending for the prize in the theatre he entered it accompanied by his young soldiers in their military cloaks and purple uniform, all of them strong men in the prime of life, showing a modest respect for their general, combined with a martial bearing due to their many brave feats of arms.", "1888": "Just as they came into the theatre Pylades the musician began to recite tho ‘ Persians' of Timotheus “", "1889": "He wrought for Greece a noble work of freedom \" in a loud voice and with suitable solemnity.", "1890": "At this, all the spectators turned their eyes upon Philopoemen and broke into joyous applause, remembering the ancient glories of Greece, and feeling such confidence in him as almost to recover the ancient spirit of their nation.", "1891": "XII.", "1892": "But just as horses like their accustomed rider, and if another mounts them are scared and unmanageable, so the power of the Achæans become feeble under any other general than Philopoemen.", "1893": "When they saw him, the whole army rejoiced, and were filled with cheerful con­ fidence, well knowing that he was the only one of then generals before whom the enemy always fled, terrified by his name, as, indeed, appeared by their acts.", "1894": "For Philip king of Macedon, thinking that if Philopœmen were put out of the way, the Achaeans would become subject to himself as they were before, sent men privately to Argos to assassinate him:", "1895": "but his plot was disclosed, and he be­ came an object of universal hatred to the Greeks.", "1896": "The Boeotians too, when they were besieging Megara and were expecting shortly to take it, retreated in such hot haste that they actually left their scaling ladders planted against the walls, in consequence of a rumour, which proved a false one, that Philopœmen was coming to raise the siege and was close at hand.", "1897": "When Nabis, who became despot over the Lacedæmonians after Machanidas, by a sudden attack captured the town of Messene, Philo­ pœmen was not holding any office, but was a mere private citizen.", "1898": "He could not prevail upon Lysippus, who was commander-in-chief of the Achæans, to go to assist the Messenians, because the latter said that the city must be lost if the enemy were inside the walls.", "1899": "Hereupon Philo­ pœmen went himself to the rescue with the men of his own city, who did not delay for any formal vote to empower him to do so, but followed him because he was born to command.", "1900": "When Nabis heard of his approach he would not await his coming, but although he was in possession of the city he marched out by the opposite gate with all speed, thinking that he would be fortunate if he reached home safe, as indeed he did.", "1901": "Thus was Messene delivered.", "1902": "XIII.", "1903": "All these exploits of Philopœmen are without doubt glorious to him;", "1904": "but he was much blamed for going a second time to Crete at the request of the people of Gortyna, to act as their general, leaving his own country to be attacked by Nabis, because he avoided the war at home to gather unseasonable laurels abroad.", "1905": "Indeed, the citizens of Megalopolis were so hard pressed at that period as to be forced to live entirely within their walls, and grow corn in the very streets, as they were quite cut off from their fields by the enemy, who was encamped before the gates.", "1906": "Philopœmen, by his remaining beyond seas at this time acting as general for the Cretans, gave his enemies an opportunity of charging him with dis­ honourably shirking the war at home.", "1907": "Some, however, said that since the Achæans had chosen other men generals, Philopoemen, who had no office to fill, had a right to use his leisure in acting as general to the people of Gortyna when they begged him to do so.", "1908": "Indeed, his nature abhorred rest, and he desired his courage and generalship to be in constant action, like everything else belonging to him.", "1909": "This is clearly shown by his saying about king Ptolemy.", "1910": "When some one praised that prince for carefully training his army and exercising himself under arms every day, Philopœmen answered, “ Who can admire a king of Ptolemy's age who is still practising and not per­ forming.\"", "1911": "However, the citizens of Megalopolis were much vexed by his conduct, which they, considered to be that of a traitor, and would have banished him had they not been restrained by the whole body of the Achæans.", "1912": "They sent the general Aristænetus to Megalopolis, who, although he was politically opposed to Philopœmen, would not allow sentence of banishment to be passed against him.", "1913": "After this Philopœmen, being treated with neglect and indifference by his fellow-citizens, induced many of the outlying villages to rebel against the city, telling them to say that they were not originally made subject to it, and he himself openly took their part against his own city when the matter was referred to the general council of the Achæan league.", "1914": "But these things happened afterwards.", "1915": "At the time of which we speak he carried on war in Crete with the Gortynians, not in a simple straight­ forward manner, as one would expect a Peloponnesian, and especially an Arcadian would do, but he adopted the Cretan character, and by using all their subtle devices and ambushes against themselves, proved that such con­ trivances are but child's play when tried against a truly experienced general.", "1916": "XIV.", "1917": "Returning to Peloponnesus with a great reputation from his Cretan successes, he found Philip beaten by Titus Quintius, and Nabis at war both with the Romans and the Achæans.", "1918": "He was at once elected general to attack Nabis, and in a sea fight suffered the same misfortune as Epa­ meinondas, that is to say, he effected much less at sea than was expected of a man of his courage and reputation.", "1919": "Indeed some writers tell us that Epameinondas was un­ willing that his countrymen should taste the advantages of the sea, and fearing that, as Plato says, they might from steady soldiers be transformed into licentious wandering sailors, purposely returned from the coast of Asia Minor and the islands without having effected anything.", "1920": "Philopcemen, imagining that his knowledge of war on land would enable him to fight equally well at sea, learned by experience how greatly practice assists men's courage, and how much their strength is increased by being trained to use it.", "1921": "Not only was he worsted in a sea-fight through inexperience, but having selected an old ship, which had once been a famous vessel, but now was forty years old, she leaked so much as to endanger the lives of those on board.", "1922": "After the action, finding that the enemy despised him, as though his ships had been entirely driven from the sea, and that they were ostentatiously besieging Gythium, he sailed straightway thither and found them quite unprepared, and with their discipline relaxed in consequence of their victory.", "1923": "He landed his men at night, burned the enemy's tents, and slew many of them.", "1924": "A few days afterwards, being surprised by Nabis in a mountainous spot, while all the Achæans gave themselves up for lost, despairing of extricating themselves from such a difficult pt sition, Philopoemen, after a short survey of the country, proved that strategy is the greatest of military qualities.", "1925": "He quietly and steadily changed his front, manoeuvred his army out of its disadvantageous position, attacked the enemy, and completely routed them.", "1926": "Perceiving that the fugitives did not make for the city, but scattered them­ selves all over the country, which was hilly and wooded, full of torrents and precipices, and impassable for cavalry, he made no pursuit, but encamped before dark.", "1927": "As he conjectured that the enemy after their rout would straggle back into the city by twos and threes under cover of the darkness, he concealed many of the Achæans, armed with daggers, in the rough ground near the city.", "1928": "By this stratagem Nabis's force suffered great losses, for as they did not retreat in a body, but each man as best he could, they fell into their foemen's hands at the city gate like birds into a snare.", "1929": "XV.", "1930": "Philopœmen gained so much glory by these exploits, and was so much honoured by the Greeks wherever he ap­ peared in public, that he roused the jealousy of Flamininus, who thought that he, a consul of Rome, was worthier of respect than a mere Arcadian, while he had moreover done much more for Greece, having by one proclamation restored those liberties of which Philip and his Macedonians had deprived it.", "1931": "Flamininus put an end to the war with Nabis, who was shortly afterwards assassinated by the Ætolians.", "1932": "As this event threw Sparta into disorder, Philopœmen seized the opportunity, marched thither with an army, and partly by persuasion, partly by force, pre­ vailed upon the city to join the Achaean league.", "1933": "This wonderfully raised his fame throughout Greece, that he should have won over so famous and powerful a oily, for Sparta formed a most important member of the league.", "1934": "He also gained the good will of the Lacedæmonian nobles, who hoped that he would protect their newly-won liberty.", "1935": "They sold the house and property of Nabis, and decreed that the money, amounting to a hundred and twenty talents, should be presented to him by a deputation.", "1936": "On this occasion Philopoemen showed himself to he a man of real virtue.", "1937": "At the interview none of the Spartans liked to propose to him to receive the money, but they excused themselves, and made his own especial friend Timolaus undertake to do this.", "1938": "Timolaus, however, when he reached Megalopolis, and living in the house of Philopœmen had an opportunity of observing the noble simplicity of his character and his lofty integrity, in the familiar inter­ course of private life, dared not mention the bribe, but gave some other excuse for his visit and returned home.", "1939": "He was sent a second time, with the same result.", "1940": "On a third visit he with great hesitation broached the subject.", "1941": "Philopœmen listened to him without anger, and sent him back to the Spartans with the advice that they should not corrupt their friends, whose services they could obtain gratis, but keep their money to bribe those who en­ deavoured to countermine their city in the public assembly of the Achæan league, as, if muzzled in this way, they would cease to oppose them.", "1942": "It was better, he added, to restrain the freedom of speech of their enemies than that of their friends.", "1943": "So uncorrupt was he, and inaccessible to bribes.", "1944": "XVI.", "1945": "When Diophanes, the commander-in-chief of the Achæans, endeavoured to punish the Lacedæmonians for a change in their policy, and they by their resist­ ance threw the whole of Peloponnesus into confusion, Philopœmen tried to act as mediator, and to soothe the anger of Diophanes, pointing out to him that at a time when the Romans and king Antiochus with enormous forces were about to make Greece their battle ground, a general ought to direct all his thoughts to their movements, and to avoid any internal disturbance, willingly accepting any apologies from those who did wrong.", "1946": "But as Diophanes took no notice of him, but together with Flamininus invaded Laconia, Philopoemen, disregarding the exact letter of the law, performed a most spirited and noble action.", "1947": "He hurried to Sparta, and, though only a private man, shut its gates in the faces of the commander-in-chief of the Achæans and of the Roman consul, put an end to.", "1948": "the revolutionary movement there, and prevailed upon the city to rejoin the Achæan league.", "1949": "Some time afterwards however, we are told by Polybius that Philopœme , when commander-in-chief, having some quarrel with tlo Lace­ dæmonians, restored the exiles to the city, and put to death eighty, or, according to Aristokrates, three hundred and fifty Spartans.", "1950": "He also pulled down the walls of Sparta, and annexed a large portion of its territory to Megalopolis, while he forced all those persons who had been created citizens of Sparta under the rule of the despots to leave the city and proceed to Achæa, except three hundred.", "1951": "These, because they refused to obey him and leave Lacedæmon he sold for slaves, and with the money, as a wanton insult, built a public portico in Megalopolis.", "1952": "Moreover, in his wrath against the Lacedæmonians, he did them a most cruel wrong, for he abolished the Lycurgean system of education and forced them to educate their children like those of the Achæans, because he saw that they never would be humble-minded as long as they lived under the disipline of Lycurgus.", "1953": "Thus was the haughty city of Sparta brought so low by its misfortunes as to permit Philopœmen to cut, as it were, its very sinews, and render it tame and crushed, Afterwards, however, the citizens obtained permission from Rome to retire from the Achæan confederation, upon which they restored their original constitution as far as their great disasters per­ mitted.", "1954": "XVII.", "1955": "When the Romans were fighting king Antiochus in Greece, Philopœmen was in a private station, but, seeing Antiochus lying idly at Chalkis, wasting his time in unseasonable courtships and weddings, while his Syrian troops, in great disorder and without officers to control them, were scattered through the various Greek cities, living in riotous debauchery, he was vexed at not being elected commander in chief, and said that he envied the Romans their victory. \" I,\" said he, \" if I had been in com­ mand, would have cut off the whole of Antiochus's army in the taverns.", "1956": "\"After the defeat of Antiochus the Romans began to tighten their hold upon Greece, and to absorb the Achæan league.", "1957": "Many of the popular leaders took their side, and the growing power of Rome was fated by the divine bless­ ing before long to become absolute in Greece.", "1958": "Philopœ­ men, like a skilful pilot, struggling against a rough sea, was often compelled to yield and give way for a time, yet as he was utterly opposed to the Romans he did his best to induce the most influential men to defend the liberties of Greece.", "1959": "Aristænetus of Megapolis, a man of great influence with the Achæans, who urged them in the public assembly not to oppose or to thwart the Romans in any­ thing, was listened to by Philopœmen for some time in silence, until at length he was moved to exclaim, \"My good sir, why be in such a hurry to behold the end of Greece?\"", "1960": "When Manius the Roman consul had conquered Antiochus, he begged the Achaeans to permit the Lace­ dæmonian exiles to return.", "1961": "Titus Flamininus seconded this request, but Philopœmen opposed it;", "1962": "not because he had any quarrel with the exiles, but because he wished their restoration to be effected by himself and the Achaeans, of their own free will, not as a favour to Flamininus and the Romans.", "1963": "Afterwards, when commander-in-chief, he himself restored them.", "1964": "Thus did his high spirit make him impatient of control and authority.", "1965": "XVIII.", "1966": "When he was in his seventieth year, and eighth term of office as commander-in-chief, he might reasonably expect to finish not only his year of office, but also the rest of his life in peace;", "1967": "for just as in human bodies as their strength wastes away the violence of their diseases abates, so in the Greek states as their power failed their quarrels gradually ceased.", "1968": "However some Nemesis overtook hint, as it does a too successful athlete just at the termination of his course.", "1969": "It is said that when some persons in society were praising a man who was thought to be a good general, Philopœmen said, \" How can you think that man worth consideration, who was taken by his enemy alive.", "1970": "\"A few days after this Deinokrates of Messene, a personal enemy of Philopœmen, and one who was generally dis­ liked because of his wicked and licentious life, caused Meesene to revolt from the Achæan league, and was announced to be marching upon a village named Kolonis.", "1971": "Thilopœmen was at this time lying ill with a fever in the city of Argos, but on hearing this he proceeded at once to Megalopolis, a distance of four hundred furlongs, in one day.", "1972": "From that city he set out straightway with a body of cavalry, composed of the noblest citizens, but mostly very young men, who were proud to serve as volunteers under Philopoemen.", "1973": "They rode into the Messenian territory, met Deinokrates near the hill of Evander, and put him to flight.", "1974": "However as the Messenian frontier patrol of five hundred men suddenly came up, the defeated body rallied again, and Philopœmen, fearing to be surrounded, and wishing to be careful of the lives of his men, retired into mountainous ground, himself protecting the rear, making frequent charges, and drawing the whole attack of the enemy upon himself.", "1975": "They did not dare to encounter him personally, but clamoured and wheeled about at a distance.", "1976": "In his eagerness to save each one of his young soldiers he ventured forward so often, to cover their retreat, that at last he found himself alone in the midst of his enemies.", "1977": "None of them dared to meet him, but pelted him with stones and darts from a dis­ tance, so that lie was with difficulty able to guide his horse over the rocky and precipitous ground, and fatigued the animal greatly.", "1978": "His age was no hindrance to him, because of his habit of constant exercise, but unluckily he was weak from his sickness, and wearied by his long journey, so as to feel faint.", "1979": "His horse at length stumbling threw him to the ground.", "1980": "He fell heavily on his head, and lay speechless for some time, so that his enemies thought that he was dead, and began to turn over his body and strip it.", "1981": "But when he raised his head and opened his eyes they fell upon him in a body, tied his hands behind his back, and led him away, jeering much at a man who never even dreamed that he could have been so triumphed over by Deinokrates.", "1982": "XIX.", "1983": "The Messenians who were in the city, greatly excited at the news, assembled at the gates.", "1984": "When they saw Philopœmen dragged along and treated in a manner so unworthy of a man who had gained such glorious victories, most of them felt compassion for him, and were moved to tears as they reflected how uncertain a thing is human power.", "1985": "Thus gradually they expressed aloud their kindly feeling towards him, saying that his former benefits and the liberty which he bestowed upon them by driving out the despot Nabis, ought to be had in remem­ brance.", "1986": "There were some few, however, who in order to gain favour with Deinokrates, advised him to put Philo­ poemen to death by torture, pointing out that he was a dangerous enemy, and would be peculiarly exasperated against Deinokrates if he now were to regain his freedom after having been his captive and having been insulted by him.", "1987": "Finally they put him into what was called the Treasury, a subterranean chamber with no window or communication with the outward air, and no door even, but closed by a great stone.", "1988": "There they left him, putting the great stone over the entrance, and placing a guard of armed men round it.", "1989": "Meanwhile the Achæan horsemen rallied from their flight, and as Philopœmen was nowhere to be seen, they thought that he must have fallen, They remained for a long while, searching for him, and reproaching themselves with having obtained dishonourable safety by abandoning to the enemy their leader, who had laid down his life for them.", "1990": "Afterwards they pushed forward, inquiring every­ where for him, and at length learned that he had been captured.", "1991": "They at once sent the news to the various cities of the Achæan league, who took the matter greatly to heart, determined to demand Philopœmen publicly from the Messenians, and prepared for a campaign on his behalf.", "1992": "XX.", "1993": "While they were acting thus, Deinokrates feared that delay might save Philopoemen's life.", "1994": "Wishing there­ fore to be beforehand with the Achaeans, as soon as night came on, and the greater part of the Messenians had retired, he opened the prison and sent into it a public slave with a draught of poison, ordering him to stand by Philopœmen until he had drunk it.", "1995": "Philopœmen was lying down wrapped in his cloak, not asleep, but full of trouble and distress of mind.", "1996": "When he saw the light and the slave with the poison standing beside him, he, with great diffi­ culty on account of his weakness, raised himself into a Bitting posture.", "1997": "He then took the cup into his hand, and inquired whether he knew anything about the knights, especially about one Lykortas.", "1998": "When the slave answered, that most of them had escaped, he nodded his head, looked kindly upon him, and answered, \" You tell me good news, if we are not all unfortunate.\"", "1999": "He uttered no other word, but drank the poison and laid down again.", "2000": "In his weak condition he was unable to offer any resistance to the operations of the drug, and died immediately.", "2001": "XXI.", "2002": "When the Achæan cities heard of his death, they went into a general mourning for him.", "2003":

terms with the Achaeans.", "2004": "Doinokrates escaped his merited fate by suicide, as did those who had advised that Philopœmen should be put to death, while those who had advised that he should be tortured were themselves reserved for a death of torture by Lykortas.", "2005": "They burned his body and collected the ashes into an urn, not carelessly, but mingling a sort of triumphal pomp with his funeral procession.", "2006": "There one might see men crowned with garlands but weeping at the same time, and leading along his ene­ mies in chains.", "2007": "The urn itself, which was scarcely to be seen for the garlands and ribbons with which it was covered, was carried by Polybius, the son of the Achæan commander- in-chief, accompanied by the noblest of the Achaeans.", "2008": "The soldiers followed in complete armour, with caparisoned horses, not cast down, but yet too sad to feel any pride in their victory.", "2009": "As they passed through the towns and villages on their way the inhabitants came out as if to welcome him on his return from a successful campaign, laid their hands on his urn, and joined in the procession to Megalopolis.", "2010": "When here the old men, women, and children joined them, a wail of distress ran through the whole army for the unhappy city which was mourning for its hero, and which thought itself to have lost, by his death, the first place in Greece.", "2011": "He was buried with great honour, as we may well believe, and round his tomb the Messenian captives were stoned to death.", "2012": "Many statues were made of him, and many honours voted to him by the Greek cities, which afterwards during that unfortunate time for Greece when Corinth was destroyed, a Roman proposed tc destroy, accusing Philopœmen.", "2013": "as if he had been yet alive, of being always an enemy to the Romans.", "2014": "But after Polybius had answered this contemptible fellow, neither the consul Mummius nor his lieutenants would suffer him to deface

between honour and expedi­ ency, rightly thinking that men should reward those who benefit them, but that the brave should always be honoured by all brave men.", "2016": "Thus much have I to tell about Philopœmen.", "2017": "THOSE who wish to know what Titus Quintius Flamini.", "2018": "nus, whom we have selected as a parallel to Philopoemen, was like, may see his brazen statue in Rome, which stands beside the great statue of Apollo from Carthage, opposite to the Circus, with a Greek inscription upon it.", "2019": "His temper is said to have been warm, both in love and in anger, though he was ever moderate and placable in in­ flicting punishment, while he was never weary in con­ ferring favours, and was always eager to help those upon whom he had bestowed some benefit, preserving and pro­ tecting them as though they were the most precious of his possessions.", "2020": "Being ambitious and eager to distinguish himself, he wished to take the leading part in everything, and consequently preferred those who hoped to receive to those who were able to confer favours, because the former were his assistants and the latter his rivals in the struggle for honour.", "2021": "He received a military training, being born at a time when Rome was engaged in most important wars, and when young men learned how to act as officers not by theory but by actual service in the field.", "2022": "He first served as military tribune under the consul Marcellus in tie war with Hannibal.", "2023": "Marcellus perished in an ambuscade, but Titus was made governor of Tarentum after its recapture, and of the surrounding territory.", "2024": "In this government, he won as great a reputation for justice as for courage, so that when the Romans sent colonists to the two cities of Narnia and Cossa, he was appointed to lead them and act as founder of the colonies.", "2025": "II.", "2026": "This so elated him that he at once aspired to the consulship, passing over all the usual steps of

towns.", "2028": "When the tribunes ofthe people, Fulvius and Manius, came forward and protested against a young \"man .taking the-highest office- in the state bystorm, contrary to the laws, and being as it were uninitiated in the very elements of the constitution, the Senate referred the matter to the votes of the people, who elected him consul together with Sextus Ælius, although he was not yet thirty years old.", "2029": "In casting lots for provinces the war with Philip of Macedon fell to his share, greatly to the advantage of the Romans, because in that war they needed a general who would deal with the enemy not entirely by main force, but also win them over by per­ suasion and diplomacy.", "2030": "The kingdom of Macedonia was amply sufficient for Philip, if he only fought once with the Romans;", "2031": "but to maintain the cost of a long war, to supply his troops, and afford him necessary resources, the co-operation of Greece was essential to him.", "2032": "Unless there­ fore Greece could be detached from his alliance, the war could not be decided by a single battle.", "2033": "Greece at this time had been brought but little into contact with the Romans, who then for the first time interfered in her politics.", "2034": "Unless, therefore, the Roman general had been a man of high character, willing to act by diplomacy rather than by war, and combining affability of address with a strict sense of justice, the Greeks would have be,, n unwilling to throw off their allegiance to their former masters in order to place themselves under the new and untried dominion of Rome.", "2035": "Of these honourable traits in Titus's character many instances will be found in his acts.", "2036": "III.", "2037": "He learned that his predecessors, Sulpicius* and Publius†.",

by c( nstant attacks upon their communications and foraging parties.", "2039": "Flamininus did not wish to follow their example, and, after wasting a year at home in the enjoyment of the consular dignity, and in taking part in the politics of Rome, to set out late in the year to begin his campaign, although by this means he might have extended his command over two years, by acting as consul in the first, and carrying on the war as proconsul during the second.", "2040": "He preferred to throw the weight of his power as consul into the conduct of the war, cared not to display the insignia of his office at Rome, but obtained from the Senate the appointment of his brother Lucius to the command of the fleet which was to co-operate with him, took as the nucleus of his army three thousand of the strongest of those veterans who -under Scipio had beaten Hasdrubal in Spain and Hannibal in Africa, and safely crossed over with them into Epirus.", "2041": "Here he found Publius, with his army, watching that of Philip, which held the passes near the river Apsus, but unable to effect anything on account of the enemy being so strongly posted.", "2042": "After taking over the army from Publius, whom he super­ seded in its command, he reconnoitred the position.", "2043": "Its strength is as great as that of the vale of Tempo, although it wants the lovely meadows and groves of trees for which the latter is celebrated.", "2044": "The river Apsus runs in a deep ravine between vast and lofty mountains, like the Peneus in appearance and swiftness, and beside it, at the foot of the mountains,

was advised by some to turn Philip's flank, marching through the Dassaretid country along the Lykus, which would offer no such difficulties;", "2048": "but he feared to march far from the coast lest, like his predecessors, he should become entangled in a country which could furnish no supplies, be unable to force Philip to fight, and be obliged to retreat to the sea again from want of the means of subsistence.", "2049": "He determined to force his way through the mountains in front, and as these were held by Philip with his main body, the phalanx, his flanks being secured by archers and light armed troops, skirmishes took place between him and the Romans daily, with considerable loss on both sides, but without any result, until some of the natives of the country informed him of a path, neglected by the enemy, by which they undertook to lead his army, and on the third day at the latest to place it upon the heights.", "2050": "As a guarantee of their good faith they referred the Romans to Charops, the chief of the Epirot tribes, who was friendly to the Romans, and co-operated with them secretly, being afraid of Philip.", "2051": "Titus trusting in this man's word sent one of the military tribunes with four thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry.", "2052": "They were guided by these peasants, who were strictly guarded, and marched by night, resting by day in woods and sheltered places:", "2053": "for the moon was full.", "2054": "Titus, after he had despatched this force, rested his army, only skirmishing slightly with the enemy lest they should entertain any suspicion, until the day upon which the turning party was expected to appear on the summit of the mountain range.", "2055": "On that morning he got his whole force under arms, light and heavy armed alike, and dividing it into three parts himself led one body in column up to the attack of the narrowest part of the pass beside the river, while the Macedonians shot at him from above and disputed every inequality of the ground, while on his right and left the other detachments likewise vigorously attacked the position.", "2056": "The sun rose while they were thus engaged, and a light cloud of smoke, not distinct, but like a mountain mist, rose from the captured heights.", "2057": "It was unnoticed by the enemy, being behind their backs, but kept the Romans, while they fought, in a state of hopeful excite­ ment and suspense.", "2058": "When however it grew thicker and blacker, and rising in a cloud proved itself without doubt to be the looked-for signal, they rushed forward with a shout and drove the enemy into their innermost places of refuge, while those on the rocks above echoed their war­ like clamour.", "2059": "V.", "2060": "A headlong flight now took place, but the enemy lost only two thousand men, for the difficulties of the ground made it hard to pursue.", "2061": "The Romans, however, made themselves masters of their baggage, tents, and slaves, and marched through Epirus in such an orderly and well-disciplined fashion that, although the soldiers were far from their ships, had not had their monthly allowance of provisions served out to them, and were not often near a market, they nevertheless abstained from plundering a country which was abounding in riches.", "2062": "Indeed Titus had learned that Philip passed through Thessaly like a fugitive, driving the inhabitants of the city to fly to the mountains for refuge, burning the cities and giving all the property which could not be carried away to his soldiers as plunder.", "2063": "As Philip therefore had given up the country to the Romans, Titus besought his soldiers to march through it taking as much care of it as if it were their own.", "2064": "This good discipline was not long in bearing fruit;", "2065": "for as soon as the Romans entered Thessaly the cities surrendered themselves to Titus, while the Greeks beyond Thermopylae were excited and eager for him to come to them, and in Peloponnesus the Achaean league threw off allegiance to Philip, and agreed to wage war against him in conjunction with the Romans.", "2066": "The Opuntian Lokrians also sent for Titus and delivered themselves up to him, although they had been pressed by the Ætolians, who were allies of the Romans, to allow them to take charge of their city.", "2067": "It is said that king Pyrrhus, when from a mountain watch- tower he first saw the Roman army drawn up in regular order, said:", "2068": "—\" These barbarians have nothing barbarous in their military discipline.\"", "2069": "And in truth all those who met Titus were compelled to echo these words.", "2070": "They heard from the Macedonians that the leader of a barbarian army was coming to destroy everything and to reduce everyone to slavery:", "2071": "and then meeting a young and pleasant looking man, who was a thorough Greek in language and address, and a man of really hoble character, they were marvellously fascinated by him, and on leaving him filled their cities with his praises, saying that at length they had found a champion for the liberties of Greece.", "2072": "After he had proposed to Philip, as terms of peace, that he should withdraw his garrisons and leave Greece independent, which Philip refused to do, then even those who had previously been on the side of Philip admitted that the Romans had not come to fight against the Greeks, but to fight with the Greeks against the Macedonians.", "2073": "VI.", "2074": "The whole of Greece came to terms with him with out a struggle, Thebes being the first city to send a deputation to welcome him as he peacefully marched through Bceotia.", "2075": "It was Brachyllus who had kept the Thebans loyal to Philip, but now they desired to show their admiration and esteem for Flamininus, being, as they imagined, on terms of amity with both parties.", "2076": "Titus received them with great courtesy, and walked gently forwards with them, conversing with them and asking them questions, until his soldiers, who were marching some distance behind, came up with him.", "2077": "Then he walked into the city in the company of the Thebans, not alto­ gether to their satisfaction, although they did not like to attempt to keep him out, as he was accompanied by a good many soldiers.", "2078": "Yet, as if the town were not entirely at his mercy, he made them a speech, urging them to side with the Romans, while King Attalus spoke to the same effect, encouraging the Thebans to rally to the Roman cause.", "2079": "AttaIns, indeed, over-exerted himself in his speech, con­ sidering his great age, and in consequence of a sudden dizziness or faintness fell down in a fit.", "2080": "He was shortly afterwards conveyed by sea to Asia Minor, and died there.",

retain his office of consul, in case they should con­ tinue the war, or if they decided otherwise, to permit him to have the honour of concluding a. peace with Philip;", "2085": "for his ambitious spirit could not endure to be superseded by another commander.", "2086": "His friends succeeded in obtaining the rejection of Philip's demands, and his own continuance in office.", "2087": "As soon as he received this intelligence, he started, full of hope, to attack Philip in Thessaly, with an army of more than twenty-six thousand men, of which the Ætolians supplied six thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry.", "2088": "The army of Philip was of nearly equal numbers, and they began to march towards one another until they both drew near the city of Skotussa, where they determined to fight a decisive battle.", "2089": "When the two armies found themselves so near each other they felt no fear, as one might have expected, but each was confident of victory.", "2090": "The Romans were eager for the honour of overcoming the Macedonians, who had gained such glory under Alexander the Great;", "2091": "while the Macedonians, admitting the Romans to he very different soldiers to the Persians, swelled with pride at the thought that if they could conquer them, they would prove their king Philip to be even more invincible than Alexander himself.", "2092": "Titus also encouraged his soldiers to quit them like men, pointing out that they were about to fight in Greece, a noble theatre in which to display deeds of daring, and against worthy antagonists;", "2093": "while Philip, either by chance, or not noticing what he was doing in his haste, mounted upon a large sepulchre out­ side his camp, and from it began to make the usual speech to his men to encourage them for the coming struggle, but at length observing the evil omen was much disheartened by it, broke off in confusion, and would not fight that day.", "2094": "VIII.", "2095": "On the following morning about dawn, as the night had been warm and damp, the whole plain was covered with fog, and a thick mist poured down from the neighbouring hills;", "2096": "which rendered it impossible to dis­ tinguish any object.", "2097": "The parties which were sent out by each army to reconnoitre fell in with one another and fought near the place called Kynoskephalæ, that is, Dogs' Heads, which is so named because a number of small hills near together have something of this appearance.", "2098": "In the combat, as usually happens in such rough ground, each side alternately had the advantage, and as each gave way they were reinforced from the respective camps.", "2099": "Now the fog lifted, and the two commanders resolved upon a general engagement.", "2100": "Philip's right wing, on which the phalanx charged down-hill with all its weight, was victorious, the Rtomans being unable to stand before that hedge of spears, or break through that closely-locked array of shields.", "2101": "But on the left the Macedonians were unable to maintain their line, because of the inequalities of the ground, and Titus, seeing that his left was hopelessly routed, rode quickly to his own right, and suddenly attacked the enemy, who, because of the uneven nature of the ground, were unable to form their phalanx with its deep ranks, in which lies the peculiar strength of that order of battle, while the soldiers of which it is composed are armed in an unwieldy fashion which renders them helpless in a hand-to-hand fight.", "2102": "For the Macedonian phalanx.", "2103": "is like some huge beast of invincible strength so long as it remains one body, close locked together in serried ranks;", "2104": "but when broken up it loses even the advantage of each individual soldier's strength, because of the fashion in which they are armed, as they can only act together, not separately.", "2105": "When this body was routed some of the Romans pursued the fugitives, while others charged the victorious Macedonians in flank, soon forcing them to break up their array and fly in con­ fusion, throwing away their arms.", "2106": "There fell no less than eight thousand of them, and five thousand were taken prisoners.", "2107": "The Ætolian cavalry wore blamed for letting Philip escape, because they betook themselves to plunder­ ing the camp of the Macedonians even before the Romans ceased their pursuit, so that on their return they found that nothing had been left for them.", "2108": "IX.", "2109": "From this there arose quarrels between the Ætolians and the Romans ;", "2110": "and afterwards they exasperated Titus by taking to themselves the credit of the victory, and being the first to spread abroad that report among the Greeks so that they received all the honours due to vic­ tors, and were mentioned first in all the poems and ballads written about the battle.", "2111": "Of these, that which was most in vogue was the following :", "2112": "­ \"Unwept, unburied, on this mountain high, Stranger, Thessalians thirty thousand lie;", "2113": "They fell before Ætolia's sons in war, And Romans, brought by Titus from afar.", "2114": "Æmathia weeps their loss.", "2115": "Bold Philip too,", "2116": "Flies like a deer, and knows not what to do.", "2117": "\"This was written by Alkaeus to insult Philip, ex­ aggerating the number of the slain;", "2118": "but when it came to be repeated many times and by many men, it vexed Titus more than Philip.", "2119": "The latter indeed parodied it in the following lines.", "2120": "\" Unshaped, unpolished, stands a gibbet strong, Upon this hill to hang Alkaeus on.", "2121": "\"But Titus, who felt that the eyes of Greece were upon him, was wonderfully vexed by these incidents.", "2122": "For this reason he conducted the operations which followed without in the least degree consulting the Ætolians.", "2123": "They were angry at this neglect, and when Titus began negotiations with Philip, and received an embassy from him to treat for peace, they spread it abroad throughout Greece that Titus was being bribed by Philip into making peace, when he had it in his power to utterly cut off and destroy that power which first destroyed the independence of Greece.", "2124": "Philip himself however put an end to this suspicion, by placing himself and all his resources in the hands of Titus and the people of Rome.", "2125": "So now Titus brought the war to a close.", "2126": "He restored Philip to his kingdom of Mace­ donia, but forbade him to interfere in the affairs of Greece.", "2127": "He also imposed upon him a fine of a thousand talents, took away all but ten of his ships of war, and sent one of his two sons, Demetrius, to Rome as a hostage for the fulfil­ ment of these conditions.", "2128": "In their making terms with Philip Titus showed himself wise and provident:", "2129": "for Hannibal the Carthaginian, who was at that time an exile, was already at the court of King Antiochus, urging him to follow up his good fortune and increase his empire.", "2130": "Antiochus had already been so successful as to have gained the surname of ' the Great,' and was now aiming at universal dominion.", "2131": "lie especially intended to attack the Romans, and unless Titus had foreseen this, and granted favour­ able terms of peace, Philip would have been his ally, the two most powerful kings of the age would have been arrayed against the Romans, and a struggle no less im­ portant than that of Rome against Hannibal would have begun.", "2132": "As it was, Titus interposed this peace between the two wars, finishing the one before he began the other;", "2133": "by which means he took from one of the kings his last, and from the other his first hope.", "2134": "X.", "2135": "The ten commissioners, whom the Senate despatched to assist Titus in settling the affairs of Greece, advised him to leave it free and independent, only keeping gar­ risons in Corinth, Chalkis, and Demetrias, for safety against Antiochus.", "2136": "Upon this the Ætolians threw off all disguise, openly urged these cities to revolt, and called upon Titus to loose the chains of Greece, as Philip was wont to call these three cities.", "2137": "They asked the Greeks whether they were pleased at their present bonds, which were heavier, though smoother than before ;", "2138": "and whether they still thought Titus to be their benefactor because he had removed the fetters from the feet of Greece and fastened them round her throat.", "2139": "Titus was much grieved at these imputations, and at length by his representations induced the Senate to desist from its design of placing garrisons in these three cities, in order that the liberty which he was about to bestow upon Greece might be unclogged by any conditions.", "2140": "When the Isthmian games were being celebrated, a great number of people were assembled in the arena witnessing the gymnastic contests, as was natural now that wars had ceased throughout Greece, and the people could attend their national festivals in safety.", "2141": "Pro­ clamation was now suddenly made by the sound of a trumpet that every man should keep silence;", "2142": "and a herald coming forward into the midst of the assembly announced that the Senat9 of Rome, and Titus Quintius their consul and general, h aving overcome King Philip and the Mace­ donians, did now henceforth give liberty to the Corin­ thians, Lokrians, Phokians, Eubœans, Achæans of Phthia, Magnetos, Thessalians, and Perrhæbians, with exemption from garrisons and tribute, and permission to govern themselves by their hereditary laws.", "2143": "At first all did not clearly hear the proclamation, and there was a disorderly tumult in the assembly, as men wondered at the words, asked one another their meaning, and called upon the herald to repeat them.", "2144": "But when silence had again been obtained, and the herald, exerting his voice to the utmost, repeated the proclamation, such a shout was raised that it was heard as far as the sea coast, and all the spectators rose from their seats, caring nothing more for the games, but rushing with one accord to greet, with transports of delight, the saviour and protector of Greece.", "2145": "On this occasion was observed what is often mentioned as an example of the power of human voices ;", "2146": "some crows, which were flying over the racecourse at that moment, fell down among the people.", "2147": "The reason of this is that the air is broken and cut asunder by the vehemence and strength of the voices, so as not to have its natural power to support the birds, which fell down just as if they were flying through a place where there was no air at all;", "2148": "unless in­ deed it was the violence of the cry that struck the birds like a shot, and so caused them to fall down dead.", "2149": "It may be also that the air is driven round in whirlpools by such shouts, as we observe happens in violent disturbances of the sea.", "2150": "XI.", "2151": "As for Titus, unless he had escaped betimes when the assembly broke up and rushed towards him, it is thought that he could not have survived the pressure of so great a multitude.", "2152": "The crowd surrounded his tent, shouting and applauding until nightfall, when they dis­ persed :", "2153": "but as they went, if they met any of their kin, their friends, or fellow citizens, they kissed and embraced them for joy, and then supped and made merry together.", "2154": "We may well think that they had no other talk at the table but of the great and terrible wars which Greece had fought for her liberty, and that nevertheless she never had obtained so perfect and delightful a state of freedom as that which had been won for her by other men's labours, almost without any blood of her own being spilt.", "2155": "It is indeed rare to find bravery and wisdom combined in any man, but it is even rarer to find a perfectly just man- Agesilaus and Lysander, Nikias and Alkibiades know well how to wage war and win battles both by land and by sea, but they never could make their victories yield any honour­ able benefit to others, or true glory to themselves.", "2156": "Indeed with the exception of Marathon and Salamis, Platæa and Thermopylae, and the campaigns of Kimon on the Eury­ medon and in Cyprus, all the other battles of Greece have been fought against herself, to bring about her slavery, and every trophy has been a misfortune, and a monument of shame rather than glory, arising chiefly from the rivalry between the leading cities.", "2157": "Yet a strange nation, from which it was inconceivable that Greece should receive any benefit, with scarcely any glimmering embers, as it were, of a common origin, had nevertheless, with great risk and hard fighting, rescued Greece from her harsh tyrants and oppressors.", "2158": "XII.", "2159": "These were the thoughts which occupied men's minds:", "2160": "and the events which took place were all in con­ formity with the proclamation.", "2161": "Titus had at the same time sent Lentulus to Asia Minor to free the Bargylians, and Stertinius to Thrace to remove the garrisons of Philip from the towns and islands in that quarter, while Publius Villius set sail to treat with Antiochus about the freedom of the Greeks in his dominions.", "2162": "Titus himself proceeded to Chalkis, and thence he took ship for Magnesia, where he removed the foreign garrisons from the cities and re- established a democratic constitution in them.", "2163": "After this he was elected President of the Nemean games at Argos, where he made admirable arrangements for the conduct of the festival, and made a herald repeat his proclamation to the Greeks assembled there.", "2164": "He now made a progress through the cities of Greece, in which he established tran­ quillity and good laws, encouraged them to regard each other with good will, put an end to faction, and brought back exiles, taking no less pride in acting as counsellor and mediator to the Greeks than he did in having con­ quered the Macedonians, so that liberty seemed to be the least of the benefits which he had bestowed on the Greeks.", "2165": "It is said that when at Athens Lykurgus the orator had rescued Xenokrates the philosopher from the tax-gatherers who were taking him to prison for non-payment of the tax upon resident aliens, and had them punished for their insolent conduct towards him, Xenokrates, afterwards meeting the sons of Lykurgus, said, \" My children, I am making your father an honourable return for his kindness, he has the praises of the whole people for what he did for me.\"", "2166": "Flamininus and the Romans, however, not only ob­ tained the praise of the Greeks in return for the benefits which they had conferred upon them, but also gained the trust and confidence of all mankind by their noble acts.", "2167": "Not only cities, but even kings who had been wronged by other kings came to them for redress, so that in a short space of time, with the assistance, no doubt, of the divine favour, all the world became subject to them.", "2168": "Flamininus especially prided himself on having liberated the Greeks, and when he dedicated at Delphi silver shields and his own Roman buckler, he wrote upon them the following verses :", "2169": "-", "2170": "To you, the Twins, delighting in the chase, Great Zeus's sons, of Sparta's royal race, This offering gives the Roman Titus, he Who set the children of fair Hellas free.", "2171": "\"He also dedicated a golden wreath to Apollo, with the Inscription-", "2172": "To thee, Latona's child, this chaplet fair Doth Titus, leader of Rome's army, send;", "2173": "The crown will well beseem thy glorious hair;", "2174": "Do thou the donor from all ill defend.", "2175": "\"Indeed it was in the city of Corinth that this favour has twice been bestowed upon the Greeks, for it was in Corinth that Titus made the proclamation of which we have spoken, and Nero again, in our own time, in nearly the same manner, during the Isthmian games, declared the Greeks free and independent, except that Titus proclaimed it by means of a herald, while Nero mounted upon a platform in the market place and made the announcement himself.", "2176": "How­ ever, this took place long afterwards.", "2177": "XIII.", "2178": "Titus now began a war against that most hateful and lawless of despots, Nabis of Lacedæmon, but betrayed the confidence of the Greeks;", "2179": "for when he had the oppor­ tunity of destroying him he would not do so, but made terms with him, leaving Sparta in a shameful bondage.", "2180": "Either he was afraid that if the war went on for any length of time some new commander would be sent from Rome who would gain the credit of it, or else he was jealous of the honours which were paid to Philopoemen, who was by far the greatest warrior in Greece at that period, and who surpassed himself in acts of bravery and strategy during the campaign against Nabis.", "2181": "The homage which was paid Philopoemen in all public assemblies by the Achaeans vexed Flamininus, who felt angry that a mere Arcadian, who had gained some credit as a leader in obscure border warfare, should be treated with as much respect as the Roman consul, who was acting as the pro­ tector of all the peoples of Greece.", "2182": "The excuse which Titus himself made for terminating the war was that he saw that the despot could not be dethroned without causing great suffering to the other Spartans.", "2183": "Though the Achaeans passed many decrees in his honour he cared for none of them except one gift which they bestowed upon him, which was as follows.", "2184": "Many of the Romans who had been taken prisoners in the war with Hannibal had been sold for slaves, and were in servitude in different countries.", "2185": "In Greece there were twelve hundred of them, men who were in any case much to be pitied for their misfortune, but especially now, when as may be supposed, they met their sons, brothers, and relations, who were free Roman soldiers, while they themselves were slaves.", "2186": "Titus, though grieved at their lot, did not take them forcibly from their owners, but the Achaeans paid a ransom of five minæ for each man, collected them into one body, and just as Titus was about to set sail for home, presented them to him, so that he left the scene of his glorious labours having received an honourable reward, and one which well befitted so great and patriotic a man, besides being the most glorious ornament of his triumph :", "2187": "for these men of their own accord, like ordinary slaves who have been emancipated, shaved their beads, put on felt skull caps,* and followed in the train at his triumph.", "2188": "XIV.", "2189": "A more splendid spectacle was afforded by the spoils of war, the Greek helmets, Macedonian shields, and long sarissae, or pikes.", "2190": "used by the phalanx, which were carried along in the procession.", "2191": "There was also no incon­ siderable sum of money, for Tuditanus tell us that in this triumph there were displayed three thousand seven hundred and thirteen pounds of gold coin, forty-three thousand two hundred and seventy pounds of silver coin, and four­ teen thousand five hundred and fourteen gold coins of King Philip, besides the thousand talents which he owed.", "2192": "These, however, the Romans, at the instance of Flamininus, forgave him, and released his son who had been kept as a hostage for their payment.", "2193": "XV.", "2194": "When Antiochus entered Greece with a large naval and military force, many of the Greek states joined -him, especially the Ætolians, who eagerly espoused his cause because of their old quarrel with Rome.", "2195": "They gave out as a pretext for beginning the war, that they intended to restore freedom to the Greeks, who required nothing of sort,being free already.", "2196": "This, however, was merely said because it.", "2197": "was the most plausible excuse for their conduct, for which they could not assign any creditable reason.", "2198": "The Romans were much alarmed at the import­ ance of this insurrection.", "2199": "They sent Manius Acilius as consul and commander-in-chief to conduct the war, and despatched Titus Flamininus on a diplomatic mission to the cities of Greece.", "2200": "The mere sight of him confirmed the wavering loyalty of some of these states, while his personal influence induced many which had taken the first steps towards revolt, to return to their allegiance.", "2201": "Some few, however, were hopelessly lost to the Roman cause, having been previously won over by the Ætolians;", "2202": "yet, vexed and exasperated as he was by their conduct, he took care, after the victory had been won, that even these should not be destroyed.", "2203": "Antiochus, it is well known, was defeated at Thermopylae, and at once set sail for Asia Minor, while the consul Manius besieged some of the Ætolian strong- holds himself, and arranged for others to be taken by King Philip of Macedon.", "2204": "But when the towns in Dolopi, Magnesia, and Aperantia were being despoiled by Philip, and the consul Manius had taken Heraklea and Was besieging Naupaktus, an Ætolian fortress, Flamininus, pitying the Greeks, left Peloponnesus and sailed to the consul at Naupaktus.", "2205": "At first he reproached him with conquering Antiochus, and then allowing Philip to reap all the advantages of his victory, and with wasting time in besieging one city out of pique, while the Macedonians were adding tribes and kingdoms to their empire.", "2206": "After this, as the besieged, when they saw him, called upon him by name from the walls, and stretched out their hands to him with tears and entreaties, he made no answer to them but turned away and wept.", "2207": "Afterwards, however, he reasoned with Manius, and persuaded him to put aside his resentment, and to grant the Ætolians a truce, and time to send an embassy to Rome to arrange reasonable terms of peace.", "2208": "XVI.", "2209": "He was given most trouble of all by the petitions of the Cbalkidians to Manius for peace.", "2210": "These people were especially obnoxious to the Romans because Antiochus, at the commencement of the war, had married the daughter of a citizen of Chalkis.", "2211": "The match was both unseasonable in point of time, and unequal in respect of age, as he was an elderly man when he fell in love with the girl, who was the daughter of one Kleoptolemus, and is said to have been of exceeding beauty.", "2212": "This marriage caused the Chalkidians to become eager partizans of King Antiochus, and even to offer him their city for his headquarters during the war.", "2213": "After his defeat he retreated at once to Chalkis, and then, taking his bride, his treasure, and his friends with him, set sail for Asia.", "2214": "Manius at once marched upon Chalkis in a rage, but Flaminius accom­ panied him, and by his entreaties at length calmed and pacified him.", "2215": "The people of Chalkis, after this narrow escape, dedicated the largest and most magnificent of all their public buildings to Titus, the inscriptions on which may be read even at the present day. \"", "2216": "The people dedicate this gymnasium to Herakles and to Titus.\"", "2217": "And on the other side of the road we read \"", "2218": "The people

they sing a specially-written poem, too long for quota­ tion from which we extract the following verses:", "2221": "— \" Sing, maidens, sing, Of Rome'a good faith that keeps its oath, And gentle Titus full of truth, Our city a saviour, Titus and Apollo sing.", "2222": "”XVII.", "2223": "lIe also received honours from the Greeks at large, and that which gives reality to honours, great good­ will from all for his kindly disposition.", "2224": "For though indeed he had some slight differences with Philopoemen, and again with Diophanes when chief of the Achaean league, he was not rancorous, and never acted under the impulse of anger, but soon laid aside his displeasure.", "2225": "He was harsh to no one, but was thought by most men to be clever and witty, and the pleasantest of companions.", "2226": "When the Achaeans were endeavouring to gain for themselves the island of Zakynthus, he discouraged their enterprise by saying that if they proceeded so far from Peloponnesus they would be in the same danger as the tortoise when he stretches his head out beyond his shell.", "2227": "When Philip first met him to discuss terms of peace, and observed that Titus had come with a large suite, while he was alone, Titus answered, \" You by your own act have made yourself lonely, by having killed all your friends and relations.”", "2228": "Once at Rome Deinokrates the Messenian got drunk and danced in women's clothes, and on the next day begged Titus to assist him in his design of detaching Messenia from the Achaean league.", "2229": "Titus answered that he would consider the matter, but that he wondered that a man engaged in such important designs should sing and dance over his wine.", "2230": "When the ambassa­ dors of Antiochus were telling the Achaeans the number of the king's army and were enumerating the various forces of which it was composed under various designa­ tions, Titus remarked that when dining with his host he had been surprised at the variety of meats, and had ex­ pressed his wonder as to how he had been able to obtain so many different kinds;", "2231": "but his host informed him that it was all nothing more than pork disguised by various sauces and cooked in various ways.", "2232": "“ So now.\"", "2233": "continued he, \" men of Achaea, do not be alarmed at the power of Antiochus when you hear these catalogues of spearmen and lance-bearers and foot-guards;", "2234": "for they are all nothing more than Syrians disguised with different kind of arms.", "2235": "XVIII.", "2236": "After the pacification of Greece and the end of the war with Antiochus, Flamininus was elected censor, which is the highest office at Rome, and is as it were the goal of political life.", "2237": "His colleague was Marcellus, the son of him that was five times consul.", "2238": "They ejected from the Senate four men of no reputation, and admitted into it all the candidates who were of free birth, being forced to do so by the tribune of the people Terentius Culeo, who by his invectives against the patricians had induced the people to pass a decree to that effect.", "2239": "The two most prominent men in Rome at this time were Scipio Africanus and Marcus Cato.", "2240": "Of these Titus ap- -pointed Scipio to be President of the Senate, as being the first man in the state, but he quarrelled with Cato for the following reason.", "2241": "Titus had a brother, Lucius Flam­ ininus, who was very unlike himself in disposition, being licentious in his pleasures and careless of his reputation.", "2242": "He had a favourite whom he always took with him even when he was in command of an army or governor of a province.", "2243": "This boy once at a wine party said that he was so greatly attached to Lucius, that he left a show of gladiatoi s before he had seen a man killed, to please him.", "2244": "Lucius, delighted at this proof of affection, said, “ That is easily remedied ;", "2245": "I will gratify your wish.\"", "2246": "He ordered a condemned criminal to be brought, sent for the execu­ tioner, and bade him strike off the man's head in the banquetting chamber.", "2247": "Valerius of Antium says that Lucius did this to please a female, not a male favourite.", "2248": "But Livy says that in Cato's own speech on the subject we are told that Lucius, to gratify his favourite, slew with his own hand a Gaulish deserter who came with his wife and children to the door, and whom he had himself invited into the banquetting chamber.", "2249": "It is probable that Cato added these particulars to exaggerate the horror of the story, for Cicero the Orator, who gives the story in his book ‘On Old Age,' and many other writers, say that the man was not a desurter, but a criminal, and condemned to death.", "2250": "XIX.", "2251": "In consequence of this, Cato, when censor, removed Lucius from the Senate, although he was of consular rank, and although his degradation affected his brother as well as himself.", "2252": "Both of them now presented themselves before the people poorly clad and in tears, and appeared to be making a very reasonable demand in begging Cato to state the grounds upon which he had cast such ignominy upon an honourable family.", "2253": "Cato, however, not in the least affected by this, came forward with his colleague and publicly demanded of Titus whether he was acquainted with what happened at the banquet.", "2254": "When Titus answered that he knew nothing of it, Cato related the circumstances, challenging Lucius to contradict him if he spoke untruly.", "2255": "As Lucius remained silent, the people saw that his degradation had been deserved, and Cato retired in triumph.", "2256": "Titus, vexed at what had befallen his brother, now joined the party of Cato's enemies, objected to all purchases, lettings, and sales by the Senate of public property which had been made by Cato, and carried his point so far as to have them all declared void.", "2257": "Thus he, I cannot say justly, became the violent opponent of a legally constituted official and an excellent citizen, for the sake of a man who, though his brother, was a worth­ less character and had only met with his deserts.", "2258": "Never­ theless, on one occasion, when the Roman people were witnessing some spectacle in the theatre, the Senate, as is customary, sitting in the best place in great state, they were filled with compassion on seeing Lucius Flamininus sitting on the back benches in a mean dress, and the people became so excited that they could not restrain their cries to him to resume his former seat, until at length he did so, and was welcomed by the other consulars.", "2259": "XX.", "2260": "The ambitious character of Titus gained him much glory, while he was in the prime of life, in the wars of which we have made mention:", "2261": "for after his consulship he again served in the army as military tribune;", "2262": "but when he retired from public life, being an elderly man, he often incurred the blame of his countrymen from his desire to distinguish himself.", "2263": "For instance, his conduct in regard to Hannibal made him much disliked at Rome.", "2264": "Hannibal after his escape from Carthage, joined king Antiochus, but when Antiochus, after his defeat in Phrygia, was glad to accept terms of peace from the Romans, he again became and exile, and after many wanderings, at length settled at the court of Prusias, king of Bithynia.", "2265": "Every one at Rome knew that he was there, but no one wished to meddle with him because of his age and weakness, as he appeared to be deserted by fortune.", "2266": "However, Titus was sent to Prusias on an embassy about certain other matters, and seing Hannibal there took offence at his being alive, and would not accede to the prayers and entreaties of Prusias on behalf of his suppliant.", "2267": "There was, it seems, a certain oracle which ends with this verse:", "2268": "­ “Libyssa's earth shall cover Hannibal.\"",

Libyssa, in which Hannibal was living.", "2271": "As he mistrusted the weakness of Prusias and feared the Romans, lie had previously to this arranged seven ways of escape leading from his own room into different subterranean passages, all of which led into the open air by concealed apertures.", "2272": "When then he heard that Titus insisted upon his death he endeavoured to escape by one of these passages, but finding every outlet watched by the soldiers of Prusias he determined to die by his own hand.", "2273": "Some say that he destroyed himself by winding his cloak round his neck, and ordered a slave to place his knee in the small of his back and pull the cloak violently until he choked ;", "2274": "while some tell us that he imitated Themistokles and Midas, by drinking bull'is blood.", "2275": "Livy * says that he prepared some poison which he kept by him ready for such an emergency, and that as he was about to drink it he said :", "2276": "—“", "2277": "Let us set the

of his ancestors, who sent to bid Pyrrhus beware of poison, although he was their enemy and actually at war with them.\"XXI.", "2279": "Thus is Hannibal said to have perished.", "2280": "When the news was brought to the Senate many thought that Titus had acted officiously and cruelly in putting Hannibal to death, when he was living unharmed and helpless, merely in order to obtain the credit of having killed him.", "2281": "When they reflected upon the mildness and magnanimity of Scipio Africanus they wondered yet more, for Scipio, after vanquishing the terrible and unconquered Hannibal in Libya, did not drive him into exile, or insist upon his countrymen delivering him up.", "2282": "He actually met him on friendly terms before the battle, and when he made a treaty with him after his victory he did not bear himself unseemly or insult his rival's misfortune.", "2283": "It is related that they met again in Ephesus, and that as they walked together Hannibal took the place of honour, while Africanus walked contentedly beside him.", "2284": "Their conver­ sation turned upon great generals, and when Hannibal stated his opinion that the best of generals was Alexander, next to him Pyrrhus, and next himself, Scipio, with a quiet smile, asked him:", "2285": "“What would you have said, if I had not conquered you ?\" “ In that case, Scipio,\" answered Hannibal,\" I should not have reckoned myself third but first of generals.\"", "2286": "The people remembering this cried shame upon Titus, for having laid hands upon a man whom another had slain.-", "2287": "Some few, however, praised the deed, thinking that Hannibal, as long as he lived, was a fire which might easily be fanned into a destructive con­ flagration.", "2288": "They pointed out that even when he was in the prime of life it was not his bodily strength or personal prowess that made him so terrible to the Romans, but his intellect and skill, together with his inveterate hatred of Rome, none of which had been diminished by age, but that his natural gifts remained the same, while also fortune was wont to change, and so those who had any permanent cause of enmity with another nation were ever encouraged by hopes of success to make new attacks.", "2289": "Indeed subsequent events seemed to prove Titus right, as Aristonikus, the son of the harp-player, in his admiration for Eumenes, filled the whole of

Lucullus.", "2290": "Yet Hannibal did not fall so low as Caius Marius.", "2291": "The former was to the last the friend of a king, and spent his time in sailing in ships, riding on horseback, and in the study of how to keep a military force efficient;", "2292": "whereas the Romans, who had laughed Marius to scorn as he wan­ dered a beggar in Africa, soon licked the dust before him while he flogged and slaughtered them in Rome.", "2293": "Thus no one of our present circumstances can be said to be either important or trifling, great or small, in comparison with what is to come, but we only cease to change when we cease to exist.", "2294": "For this reason some say that Titus did not effect this of his own free will, but that he was sent with Lucius Scipio as a colleague on an embassy whose sole object was the death of Hannibal.", "2295": "Now, as after these events we know of no other acts of Titus either as a warrior or statesman, and as he died a peaceful death, it is time to begin our comparison.", "2296": "I.

possession of the country, and founded a dynasty of kings, who were named after him the sons of Pyrrhus:", "2324": "for Pyrrhus was his own nickname as a child, and he also gave the name of Pyrrhus to one of his children by his wife Lanassa, the daughter of Kleodæus, who was the son of Hyllus.", "2325": "From this period Achilles has been honoured like a god in Epirus and is called Aspetus in the dialect of the country.", "2326": "After the earliest kings, the dynasty sunk into barbarism, and ceased to attract attention from its weakness and obscurity.", "2327": "Of those of later days, Tharrhypas was the first of those who made himself famous.", "2328": "He adopted the customs and letters of Greece, and gave just laws to his country.", "2329": "Tharrhypas was the father of Alketas, who was the father of Arybas, who married Troas and by her became the father of Æakides.", "2330": "This man married Phthia the daughter of Menon of Thessaly, who had gained great distinction in the Lamian war, and who yielded in reputation to no one except to Leosthenes himself.", "2331": "By Phthia Æakides had two daughters, Deidameia and Troas, and one son, Pyrrhus.", "2332": "II.", "2333": "When the Molossians revolted, drove out their king Æakides, and invited back the children of Neoptolemus to the kingdom, the friends of Æakides were seized and put to death, but Androkleides and Angelus stole away Pyrrhus, who was still an infant and was being searched for by his enemies.", "2334": "They took with them some wet nurses for the child and some few other servants, but finding their flight impeded by them, they entrusted the child to Androkleion, Hippias, and Neander, strong and trusty young men, bid­ ding them hurry on with what speed they might, anti get to Megara, a fort belonging to the Macedonians, while they themselves, partly by entreaties and partly by fighting, managed to delay the pursuers till late in the evening.", "2335": "The enemy, after making their way through these men with some difficulty, pursued those who were carrying off Pyrrhus.", "2336": "The sun had now set, and the fugitives had begun to hope that they would soon be safe, when they were filled with despair by meeting with the river which runs past the fort, a wild torrent which they found it im­ possible to cross, as the stream was swollen with recent rains, and appeared all the more terrible because of the darkness.", "2337": "They decided that they never could convey the child and his nurses across by their own exertions, but observing several of the inhabitants standing upon the further bank they besought them to assist their passage, and they showed Pyrrhus to them, crying aloud and hold­ ing out their hands to entreat for help.", "2338": "The men could not hear what they said because of the roaring of the water, and much time was wasted in vain clamouring until one of the fugitives, perceiving this, wrote with the tongue of a brooch upon a piece of oak bark a few words explaining who the child was, and in what danger, wrap­ ped the piece of bark round a stone to steady its flight, and threw it across.", "2339": "Some say that they fastened the bark to a javelin and so hurled it across.", "2340": "When the men on the further bank read the letter, and perceived in what imminent peril the fugitives were, they cut down some trees, formed a raft, and so crossed over.", "2341": "It chanced that the first man who crossed and received Pyrrhus into his arms was named Achilles:", "2342": "the rest of the fugitives were ferried over by his companions.",

child on the ground between them.", "2346": "The king was full of thought, for he feared Kassander, the mortal enemy of Æakides, and he remained silent for a long time.", "2347": "Meanwhile Pyrrhua of his own accord crawled up to Glaukias, took hold of his cloak and then stood up at his knees, causing the king first to smile and then to feel pity for him, as he stood like a suppliant holding his knees and weeping.", "2348": "Some say that he did not embrace Glaukias, but that he laid hold of an altar and stood, putting his hands round it, so that Glaukias thought that he must be acting under some divine impulse.", "2349": "In consequence of this he at once gave Pyrrhus in charge to his wife, bidding her bring him up with her own children.", "2350": "Shortly after, when his enemies demanded that he should be given up, and Kassander even offered two hundred talents, Glaukias refused to betray him, and when he was twelve years of age he marched into Epirus with an army and restored him to the throne.", "2351": "The appearance of PyrrhuB was more calculated to strike terror into the beholder than to impress him with an idea of the dignity which becomes a king.", "2352": "He had not a number of separate teeth, but one continuous bone in his upper jaw, with only slight lines showing the divisions between the teeth.", "2353": "He was thought to be able to cure diseases of the spleen by sacrificing a white cock, and then gently pressing with his right foot in the region of the spleen of the sufferer, who lay upon his back meanwhile.", "2354": "No man was so poor or despised that Pyrrhus would not touch him for this disorder if requested to do so.", "2355": "He also received, as a reward, the cock which was sacrificed, and was much pleased with this present.",

in which all the successors of Alexander the Great took part, Pyrrhus, while yet a youth, served with the forces of Demetrius, routed those who opposed him, and gained great distinction.", "2364": "He did not desert Demetrius after his defeat, but was entrusted with the care of those cities which Demetrius possessed in Greece, and kept them faith­ ful to his cause.", "2365": "When he made a treaty with Ptolemy, Pyrrhus was sent to Egypt as a hostage, where he hunted and practised gymnastics with Ptolemy, showing great bodily strength and endurance.", "2366": "Observing that Berenike was the most powerful and intelligent of Ptolemy's wives, he paid especial court to her, and, as he knew well how to gain the favour of the powerful, though he was inclined to domineer over his inferiors, and was temperate and well-behaved, he was chosen out of many other noble youths to be the husband of Antigone, one of the daughters of Berenike, whom she bore to Philip before the married Ptolemy,V.", "2367": "His influence was greatly increased by this match, and, as Antigone proved a good wife to him and furthered his designs, he prevailed upon his friends to supply him with money and troops, and send him upon an expedition to recover his throne in Epirus.", "2368": "When he landed, many of the people of the country were willing to accept him as their king, because of their dislike to the ferocious and arbitrary rule of Neoptolemus;", "2369": "but he, fearing that if he drove out his rival he would apply to some of the kings,* made terms and friendship with him, and agreed to share the kingdom.", "2370": "As time went on, however, many en­ couraged him to attack Neoptolemus, and fomented suspicion between them.", "2371": "Pyrrhus, however, was especially exasperated by the following incidents.", "2372": "It was customary for the kings of Epirus to sacrifice to Zeus Areios in Passaron, a place in the Molossian country, and to take an oath to their subjects that they would govern according to the laws, while the people on their part swore to be faithful to the throne.", "2373": "These ceremonies were performed by both the kings, who, with their friends, afterwards conversed together, giving and receiving presents.", "2374": "Now Gelon, a trusty friend of Neoptolemus, after giving Pyrrhus a friendly welcome, presented to him two yoke of oxen for the plough.", "2375": "Myrtilus, the cupbearer, who was present, asked Pyrrhus for these oxen, and as Pyrrhus did not give them to him but to some one else, he did not conceal his annoyance, which was observed by Gelon.", "2376": "He at once invited Myrtilus to dinner and proposed to him that he should join the party of Neoptolemus and remove Pyrrhus by poison.", "2377": "Myrtilus apparently acquiesced, and accepted the offer, but told the whole intrigue to Pyrrhus, who bade him put Alexikrates, his chief cupbearer, also in communi­ cation with Get on, on the pretence that he too wished to to take part in the plot;", "2378": "for he wished as many persons as possible to know of the attempt which was about to be made.", "2379": "Thus Gelon was deceived, and in turn deceived Neoptolemus, who, imagining his plot to be on the point of success, could not restrain his delight, but let out the secret to his friends.", "2380": "On one occasion, when in his cups, he talked freely about this matter to his sister Kadmeia, not imagining that any one else heard him ;", "2381": "for there was no one present except Phænarete, the wife of Samon the king's neatherd, and she lay upon a couch with her face towards the wall, apparently asleep.", "2382": "However she heard all that passed, unsuspected, and next day went to Antigone, the wife of Pyrrhus, and told her all that she had heard N eoptolemus say to his sister.", "2383": "When Pyrrhus heard this he did not act at once;", "2384": "but when next he offered sacrifice he invited Neoptolemus to dinner and killed him, as he knew that the strongest party in Epirus was on his side, and had often urged him to rid himself of Neoptolemus and not be satisfied with a mere share of the crown, but to engage in the great designs which his genius prompted.", "2385": "These considerations, together with the suspicions which he had of Neoptolemus's treachery, induced him to be beforehand with him by putting him to death.", "2386": "VL", "2387":

aid.", "2392": "Deme­ trius was engaged in other matters and was slow to render him any assistance, but Pyrrhus offered his services, de­ manding as the price of his assistance the districts called Stymphæa and Paransea in Macedon itself, and of the Macedonian conquests Ambrakia, Akarnania, and Amphilo­ chia.", "2393": "The youth agreed to these terms, and Pyrrhus at once occupied those countries, which he secured by garrisoning their fortresses, while he began to press Antipater hard in his endeavours to gain the remainder of Macedonia for his brother.", "2394": "At this time king Lysimachus, an eager partisan of Antipater, was too much occupied with other matters to send him any material help, but, knowing that Pyrrhus would never disoblige or thwart Ptolemy in anything, sent a forged letter to him, in which it was stated to be Ptolemy's desire that he should withdraw his forces on the receipt of three hundred talents from Antipater.", "2395": "Pyrrhus, however, as soon as he opened the letter saw the deceit;", "2396": "for it did not begin with Ptolemy's usual greeting to him, “ The father to the son wishes health \" but “ King Ptolemy to king Pyrrhus wishes health.\"", "2397": "He reproached Lysimachus for his conduct, but nevertheless made a peace, which they all met to ratify by a solemn oath upon a sacrifice.", "2398": "A bull, a boar, and a ram were brought to the altar, when suddenly the ram fell down dead.", "2399": "The others laughed at this, but the soothsayer Theodotus, who was conducting the sacrifice forbad Pyrrhus to swear, saying that

bad terms with Pyrrhus, who had made incursions into Thessaly, and the usual disease of princes, grasping covetousness, had made them suspicious and quarrelsome neighbours, especially since the death of Deidameia.", "2407": "Now, however, as they both claimed Macedonia, they were brought into direct collision, and Demetrius, after making a campaign in Ætolia and leaving Pantauchus with a large force to guard his con­ quests there, himself marched against Pyrrhus.", "2408": "Pyrrhus, as soon as he heard of this, proceeded to meet him, but by a mistake in the road they passed by one another, so that Demetrius invaded Epirus and ravaged the country there, and Pyrrhus, falling in with Pantauchus, fought a battle with him.", "2409": "The struggle was a long and severe one, espe­ cially near where the generals fought, for Pantauchus, who was admitted to be the strongest and bravest of the generals of Demetrius, in the pride of his heart challenged Pyrrhus to a single combat, while Pyrrhus, who yielded to none of the kings of the age in strength and courage, and who wished to be thought a true son of Achilles by valour as well as by descent, rushed forward beyond the front ranks to meet Pantauchus.", "2410": "They fought with spears at first, and then, drawing their swords, contended hand to hand with equal skill and courage.", "2411": "Pyrrhus received one hurt, but he wounded Pantauchus in the thigh and in the throat, and overthrew him.", "2412": "Pyrrhus did not slay him, however, as he was rescued by his friends, The Epirots, elated at their king's victory, and filled with enthusiasm by his courage, bore everything before them, routed the phalanx of the Macedonians, and pursued the fugitives, of whom they slew many and took five thousand prisoners.", "2413": "VIII.", "2414": "The Macedonians who had witnessed the exploits of Pyrrhus were struck with admiration, and perhaps found some solace for their defeat in the praises they be­ stowed on the conqueror.", "2415": "He was, they said, indeed a soldier, worthy to command soldiers;", "2416": "the only king of the age in whom there could be traced any likeness to the great Alexander.", "2417":

trappings and state of royalty.*", "2419": "We can form an opinion about his knowledge and skill in military matters from the writings which he has left on these subjects.", "2420": "It is related, moreover, that Antigonus, when asked who was the greatest of generals, answered “ Pyrrhus, if he lives to be old,\" speaking only of the generals of his own time.", "2421": "Hannibal, however, considered Pyrrhus to have been the first general that ever lived for skill and resource, placing Scipio next, and himself third, as is written in the Life of Scipio.", "2422": "Indeed Pyrrhus devoted the whole of his intellect to the art of war, regarding it as the only study fit for a king, and holding all other occu­ pations to be frivolous.", "2423": "At a wine party he was once asked whether he thought Python or Kaphisias the better flute player, to which he answered that Polysperchon was the best general, as though that were the only subject on which a king should form or express an

Eagle, he answered \" I owe it to you that I am an eagle, for it is your arms that enable me to take so high a flight.\"", "2445": "Shortly afterwards, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, he suddenly invaded Macedonia, meaning merely to make a short incur­ sion, but he very nearly obtained possession of the entire kingdom, as he overran the country without opposition and marched as far as Edessa, while many of the natives assisted him and joined his army.", "2446": "The danger roused Demetrius from his sick bed, and his partisans hastily collected a considerable force and marched to attack Pyrrhus.", "2447": "As he had only come with the intention of plundering he avoided giving battle and retreated, but on his way lost a part of his army by an attack of the Macedonians.", "2448": "Demetrius, though he had thus easily driven Pyrrhus out of his kingdom, did not despise him.", "2449": "He had deter­ mined to go to war on a great scale to recover his father's throne, with a force of a hundred thousand men and five hundred ships of war ;", "2450": "and he did not wish to be thwarted in this design by Pyrrhus, or to leave him as a fierce and dangerous neighbour for Macedonia.", "2451": "Consequently, as he had no leisure to go to war with him, he wished to come to terms with him and make peace, so that he might be at liberty to attack the other kings.", "2452": "These considerations led him to conclude a truce with Pyrrhus.", "2453": "However, the great­ ness of the force at Demetrius's disposal now led him to assume such an arrogant tone that the other kings were alarmed and sent letters to Pyrrhus in which they expressed their surprise that he should overlook the magnificent opportunity which Demetrius would offer him by engag­ ing in a foreign war, and asked him whether, when he was able to drive that restless intriguer out of Macedonia, he intended not to do so, but to sit idle at home while Demetrius gained wealth and power, until at length he would have to fight for his hearth and home in Molossia, and that too when Demetrius had just deprived him of Korkyra by means of his wife.", "2454": "For Lanassa had quarrelled with Pyrrhus because he paid too much attention to his barbarian wives, had retired to Korkyra, and, as she still wished to be a queen, invited Demetrius to take possession of her person and of the island.",

work for Demetrius, who was still engaged in preparations for his campaign.", "2458": "Ptolemy sailed to Greece with a large force and induced many of the Greek cities to revolt from Demetrius, while Lysima­ chus, starting from Thrace, invaded and plundered Upper Macedonia.", "2459": "At the same time Pyrrhus marched upon the city of Berœa, truly conjecturing that Demetrius, in his haste to repel the invasion of Upper Macedonia, would leave the lower part of the country unprotected.", "2460": "That night he dreamed that he was called by Alexander the Great, and that he at once went to him, and

marched over the intervening country and took Berœa, where he fixed his head-quarters, and sent out detachments to reduce other places.", "2466": "Demetrius, when ho heard this news, and heard also the tumult of grief and in­ dignation which it excited in his camp, feared to march any closer to Lysimachus, lest if his army came near to a king who was a Macedonian, and so distinguished a man, the troops might transfer their allegiance to him.", "2467": "He there­ fore resolved to retrace his steps, and attack Pyrrhus, as being a foreigner, and an enemy of the Macedonians.", "2468": "How­ ever,

Demetrius was as much due to his own exertions as to those of Pyrrhus, and demanded a partition of Macedonia.", "2479": "To this Pyrrhus, not yet certain of the loyalty of his new subjects, was obliged to consent.", "2480": "This measure was beneficial for the moment, as it prevented their going to war;", "2481": "but soon it became apparent that the partition was a source of endless quarrels and recrimina­ tions.", "2482": "For when men are ambitious to such a degree that no seas, mountains, or wildernesses, nay not even the boundaries of Europe and Asia, will serve as barriers to their frantic desire for more territory, it is not to be expected that they will remain quiet when their frontiers touch one another, but they always are at war, from the natural jealousy of their disposition.", "2483": "The names of peace and war they use as mere symbols, as it suits their con­ venience, and they are really better men when they are openly at war than when they give the name of peace and friendship to a cessation of active wickedness.", "2484": "The truth of this was proved by Pyrrhus, who in order to prevent Demetrius from recovering from the great disaster which he had sustained, espoused the cause of Greece, and marched to Athens.", "2485": "Here he went up to the Acropolis and sacrificed to the goddess Athena.", "2486": "On descending he thanked the Athenians for their confidence in him, but advised them if they consulted their own interest never to admit any king within their walls.*", "2487": "After this he made peace with Demetrius, but shortly after he was gone to Asia, Pyrrhus, at the instigation of Lysimachus, induced the Thessalians to revolt and join him, and began to besiege the fortresses on the Greek border, both because he found the Macedonians easier to manage when they were at war than when they were idle, and also because he himself was of a nature which could not endure inaction.", "2488": "Finally however Demetrius was irretrievably ruined in Syria, and now Lysimachus, having nothing further to fear from him, at once attacked Pyrrhus.", "2489": "He fell upon him suddenly near Edessa, defeated him, and reduced the troops under him to great distress for pro­ visions.", "2490": "Next he began to corrupt the leading Mace­ donians, reproaching them with having rejected a Macedonian who had been the friend and companion of Alexander, and chosen in his stead as their master a foreigner, and one, too, of a race that had always been sub­ ject to the Macedonians.", "2491": "As many listened to these trea­ cherous insinuations, Pyrrhus became alarmed, and with­ drew with his Epirotes and the allied troops, thus losing Macedonia in the same way that he had gained it.", "2492": "So that kings have but little reason for reproaching the common people for changing sides in an emergency, for in doing so they do but imitate the kings themselves, their teachers in the art of treachery and faithlessness, who think that those tHen gain the greatest advantages who take least account of justice and honour.", "2493": "XIII.", "2494": "Pyrrhus, now that he had lost Macedonia, might have spent his days peacefully ruling his own subjects in Epirus;", "2495": "but he could not endure repose, thinking that not to trouble others and be troubled by them was a life of unbearable ennui, and, like Achilles in the Iliad, “he could not rest in indolence at home, He longed for battle, and the joys of war.", "2496": "\"As he desired some new adventures he embraced the following opportunity.", "2497": "The Romans were at war with the Tarentines;", "2498": "and as that people were not sufficiently powerful to carry on the war, and yet were not allowed by the audacious folly of their mob orators to make peace, they proposed to make Pyrrhus their leader and to invite him to be their ally in the war, because he was more at leisure than any of the other kings, and also was the best general of them all.", "2499": "Of the older and more sensible citizens some endeavoured to oppose this fatal decision, but were overwhelmed by the clamour of the war party, while the rest, observing this, ceased to attend the public assembly.", "2500": "There was one citizen of good repute, named Meton, who, on the day when the final decision was to be made, when the people were all assembled, took a withered garland and a torch, like a drunkard, and reeled into the assembly with a girl playing the flute before him.", "2501": "At this, as one may expect in a disorderly popular meeting, some applauded, and some laughed, but no one stopped him.", "2502": "They next bade the girl play, and Melon come forward and dance to the music ;", "2503": "and he made as though he would do so.", "2504": "When he had obtained silence he said “Men of Tarentum, you do well in encouraging those who wish to be merry and amuse themselves while they may.", "2505": "If you are wise you will all enjoy your freedom now, for when Pyrrhus is come to our city you will have very different things to think of, and will live very differ­ ently.\"", "2506": "By these words he made an impression on the mass of the Tarentine people, and a murmur ran through the crowd that he had spoken well.", "2507": "But those politicians who feared that if peace were made they should be delivered up to the Romans, reproached the people for allowing any one to insult them by such a disgraceful exhibition, and prevailed on them to turn Meton out of the assembly.", "2508": "Thus the vote for war was passed, and ambassadors were sent to Epirus, not from Tarentum alone, but from the other Greek cities in Italy, carrying with them presents for Pyrrhus, with instructions to tell him that they required a leader of skill and renown, and that they possessed a force of Lucanians, Messapians, Samnites and Tarentines, which amounted to twenty thousand cavalry, and three hundred and fifty thousand infantry.", "2509": "This not only excited Pyrrhus, but also made all the Epirotes eager to take part in the campaign.", "2510": "XIV.", "2511": "There was one Kineas, a Thessalian, who was thought to be a man of good sense, and who, having heard Demosthenes the orator speak, was better able than any of the speakers of his age to delight his hearers with an imitation of the eloquence of that great master of rhetoric.", "2512": "He was now in the service of Pyrrhus, and being sent about to various cities, proved the truth of the Euripidean saw, that “All can be done by words Which foemen wish to do with conquering swords.\"", "2513": "Pyrrhus at any rate used to say that more cities were won for him by Kineas with words, than he himself won by force of arms.", "2514": "This man, observing that Pyrrhus was eagerly preparing for his Italian expedition, once when he was at leisure conversed with him in the following manner.", "2515": "\" Pyrrhus,\" said he, \" the Romans are said to be good soldiers, and to rule over many warlike nations.", "2516": "Now, if heaven grants us the victory over them, what use shall we make of it ? \"\" You ask what is self-evident,\" answered Pyrrhus. \"", "2517": "If we can conquer the Romans, there is no city, Greek or barbarian, that can resist us, and we shall gain possession of the whole of Italy, a country whose size, richness, and power no one knows better than yourself.\"", "2518": "Kineas then, after waiting for a short time, said, “ 0 king, when we have taken Italy, what shall we do then ?", "2519": "”Pyrrhus, not yet seeing his drift, answered, \" Close to it Sicily invites us, a noble and populous island, and one which is very easy to conquer;", "2520": "for, my Kineas, now that Agathokles is dead, there is nothing there but revolution and faction, and the violence of party spirit.\"", "2521": "\" What you say,\" answered Kineas, \"is very probably true.", "2522": "But is this conquest of Sicily to be the extreme limit of our cam­ paign ? \" “ Heaven,\" answered Pyrrhus, alone can give us victory and success ;", "2523": "but these conquests would merely prove to us the stepping-stones to greater things.", "2524": "Who could refrain from making an attempt upon Carthage and Libya when he was so close to them, countries which were all but conquered by Agathokles when he ran away from Syracuse with only a few ships ?", "2525": "and if we were masters of these countries, none of the enemies who now give themselves such airs at our expense will dare to resist ua.\"", "2526": "“Certainly not,\" answered Kineas;", "2527": "“with such a force at our disposal we clearly could recover Macedonia, and have the whole of Greece at our feet.", "2528": "And after we have made all these conquests, what shall we do then ?", "2529": "\"", "2530": "Pyrrhus laughing answered, “We will take our ease and carouse every day, and enjoy pleasant conversation with one another.\"", "2531": "Having brought Pyrrhus to say this, Kineas asked in reply, “But what prevents our carousing and taking our ease now, since we have already at hand all those things which we propose to obtain with much blood­ shed, and great toils and perils, and after suffering much ourselves and causing much suffering to others?\"", "2532": "By talking in this manner Kineas vexed Pyrrhus, because he made him reflect on the pleasant home which he was leaving, but his reasoning had no effect in turning him from his purpose.", "2533": "XV.", "2534": "He first despatched Kineas to Tarentum with three thousand men;", "2535": "next he collected from Tarentum many horse-transports, decked vessels, and boats of all sorts, and embarked upon them twenty elephants, twenty-three thousand cavalry, twenty-two thousand infantry, and five hundred slingers.", "2536": "When all was ready he put to sea;", "2537": "and when half way across a storm burst upon him from the north, which was unusual at that season of the year.", "2538": "He himself, though his ship was carried away by the tempest, yet, by the great pains and skill of the sailors and pilots, resisted it and reached the land, with great toil to the rowers, and beyond everyone's expectation;", "2539": "for the rest of the fleet was overpowered by the gale and scattered.", "2540": "Some ships were driven off the Italian coast altogether, and forced into the Libyan and Sicilian seas, and some which could not weather the Iapygian Cape were overtaken by night, and being dashed by a violent and boisterous sea against that harbourless coast were utterly lost, except only the king's ship.", "2541": "She was so large and strongly built as to resist the waves as long as they broke upon her from the sea­ ward ;", "2542": "but when the wind changed and blew directly off the shore, the ship, which now met the waves directly with her head, was in great danger of going to pieces, while to let her drive out to sea again now that it was so rough, and the wind changed so frequently, seemed more terrible than to remain where they were.", "2543": "Pyrrhus rose and leapt into the water, and at once was eagerly followed by his friends and his bodyguard.", "2544": "The darkness of night and the violent recoil of the roaring waves made it hard for them to help him, and it was not until daybreak, when the wind abated, that he reached the land, faint and helpless in body, but with his spirit invincible in mis­ fortune.", "2545": "The Messapians, upon whose coast he had been thrown, now assembled from the neighbouring villages and offered their help, while some of the ships which had outlived the storm appeared, bringing a few horsemen, about two thousand foot, and two elephants.", "2546": "XVI.", "2547": "With these Pyrrhus marched to Tarentum;", "2548": "Kineas, as soon as he heard of his arrival, bringing out the Tarentine army to meet him.", "2549": "When he reached the city he did nothing to displease the Tarentines until his fleet returned to the coast and he had assembled the greater part of his army.", "2550": "But then, as he saw that the populace, unless ruled by a strong hand, could neither help him nor help themselves, but intended to stay idling about their baths and entertainments at home, while he fought their battles in the field, he closed the gymnasia and public walks, in which the people were wont to waste their time in empty talk about the war.", "2551": "He forbade all drink­ ing, feasting, and unseasonable revels, and forced the people to take up arms, proving himself inexorable to every one who was on the muster-roll of able-bodied citizens.", "2552": "This conduct made him much disliked, and many of the TareD tines left the city in disgust;", "2553": "for they were so unused to discipline, that they considered that not to be able to pass their lives as they chose was no better than slavery.", "2554": "When news came that Laevinus, the Roman consul, was marching to attack him with a large force, and was plundering the country of Lucania as he advanced, while Pyrrhus's allies had not yet arrived, he thought it a shameful thing to allow the enemy to proceed any farther, and marched out with his army.", "2555": "He sent before him a herald to the Roman general, informing him that he was willing to act as arbitrator in the dispute between the Romans and the Greek cities of Italy, if they chose to ter­ minate it peacefully.", "2556": "On receiving for an answer that the Romans neither wished for Pyrrhus as an arbitrator, nor feared him as an enemy, he marched forward, and en­ camped in the plain, between the city of Pandosia and Heraklea.", "2557": "Learning that the Romans were close by, and were encamping on the farther side of the river Siris * he rode up to the river to view them;", "2558": "and when he observed their even ranks, their orderly movements, and their well­ arranged camp, he was surprised, and said to the nearest of his friends:", "2559": "\" These barbarians, Megakles, have nothing

the river, the infantry at a ford, the cavalry at many points at once, so that the Greeks feared they might be surrounded, and drew back.", "2563": "Pyrrhus, per­ ceiving this, ordered his officers instantly to form the troops in order of battle and wait under arms while he himself charged with the cavalry, three thousand strong, hoping to catch the Romans in the act of crossing the river and consequently in disorder.", "2564": "When he saw many shields of the Roman infantry appearing over the river bank, and their horsemen all ranged in order, he closed up his own ranks and charged them first himself, a conspicu­ ous figure in his beautiful glittering armour, and proving by his exploits that he deserved his high reputation;", "2565": "especially as, although he fought personally, and engaged in combat with the enemy, yet he continually watched the whole battle, and handled his troops with as much facility as though he were not in the thick of the fight, appear­ ing always wherever his presence was required, and rein­ forcing those who seemed likely to give way.", "2566": "In this battle Leonnatus the Macedonian observing one of the Italians watching Pyrrhus and constantly following him about the field, said to him, \" My king, do you see that barbarian on the black horse with white feet ?", "2567": "He seems to be meditat­ ing some desperate deed.", "2568": "He is a man of spirit and courage, and he never takes his eyes off you, and takes no notice of any one else.", "2569": "Beware of that man.\"", "2570": "Pyrrhus answered, “Leonnatus, no man can avoid his fate;", "2571": "but neither that Italian nor any one else who attacks me will do so with impunity.\"", "2572": "While they were yet talking the Italian levelled his lance, and urged his horse in full career against Pyrrhus.", "2573": "He struck the king's horse with his spear, and at the same instant his own horse was struck a sidelong blow by Leonnatus.", "2574": "Both horses fell;", "2575": "Pyrrhus was saved by his friends, and the Italian perished fighting.", "2576": "He was of the nation of the Frentani, Hoplacus by name, and was the captain of a troop of horse.", "2577": "XVII.", "2578": "This incident taught Pyrrhus to be more cautious.", "2579": "He observed that his cavalry were inclined to give way, and therefore sent for his phalanx, and arrayed it against the enemy.", "2580": "Then he gave his cloak and armour to one of his companions, Megakles, and after partially disguis­ ing himself in those of his friend, led his main body to attack the Roman army.", "2581": "The Romans stoutly resisted him, and an obstinate battle took place, for it is said that the combatants alternately yielded and again pressed forward no less than seven distinct times.", "2582": "The king's exchange of armour too, though it saved his life, yet very nearly lost him the victory :", "2583": "for many attacked Megakles, and the man who first struck him down, who was named Decius, snatched up his cloak and helmet, and rode with them to Laevinus, displaying them and shouting aloud that he had slain Pyrrhus.", "2584": "The Romans, when they saw these spoils carried in triumph along their ranks, raised a joyful cry, while the Greeks were correspondingly dis­ heartened until Pyrrhus, learning what had taken place, rode along the line with his head bare, stretching out his hands to his soldiers and telling them that he was safe.", "2585": "At length he was victorious, chiefly by means of a sudden charge of his Thessalian horse on the Romans after they had been thrown into disorder by the advance of the elephants.", "2586": "The Roman horses were terrified at these animals, and long before they came near, ran away with their riders in panic.", "2587": "The slaughter was very great:", "2588": "Dionysius says that of the Romans there fell but little short of fifteen thousand, but Hieronymus reduces this to seven thousand, while on Pyrrhus's side there fell, according to Dionysius, thirteen thousand, but according to Hieronymus less than four thousand.", "2589": "These however, were the very flower of Pyrrhus's army;", "2590": "for he lost all his most trusty officers, and his most intimate personal friends.", "2591": "Still, he captured the Roman camp, which was abandoned by the enemy, induced several of their allied cities to join him, plundered a vast extent of country, and advanced within three hundred stades (less than forty English miles) of Rome itself.", "2592": "After the battle many of the Lucanians and Samnites came up;", "2593": "these allies he reproached for their dilatory movements, but was evidently well pleased at having conquered the great Roman army with no other forces but his own Epirotes and the Tarentines.", "2594": "XVIII.", "2595": "The Romans did not remove Laevinus from his office of consul, although Caius Fabricius is reported to have said that it was not the Epirotes who had conquered the Romans, but Pyrrhus who had conquered Laevinus;", "2596": "meaning that he thought that the defeat was owing not to the greater force but the superior generalship of the enemy.", "2597": "They astonished Pyrrhus by quickly filling up their ranks with fresh levies, and talking about the war in a spirit of fearless confidence.", "2598": "He decided to try whether they were disposed to make terms with him, as he perceived that to capture Rome and utterly subdue the Roman people would be a work of no small difficulty, and that it would be vain to attempt it with the force at his disposal, while after his victory he could make peace on terms which would reflect great lustre on himself.", "2599": "Kineas was sent as ambassador to conduct this negotia­ tion.", "2600": "He conversed with the leading men of Rome, and offered their wives and children presents from the king.", "2601": "No one, however, would accept them, but they all, men and women alike, replied that, if peace were publicly concluded with the king, they would then have no ob­ jection to regard him as a friend.", "2602": "And when Kineas spoke before the Senate in a winning and persuasive manner he could not make any impression upon his audience, although he announced to them that Pyrrhus would restore the prisoners he had taken without any ransom, and would assist them in subduing all Italy, while all that he asked in return was that he should be regarded as a friend, and that the people of Tarentum should not be molested.", "2603": "The common people, however, were evidently eager for peace, in consequence of their having been defeated in one great battle, and expecting that they would have to fight another against a larger force, because the Italian states would join Pyrrhus.", "2604": "At this crisis Appius Claudius, an illustrious man, but who had long since been prevented by old age and blindness from taking any active part in politics, when he heard of the proposals of Pyrrhus, and that the question of peace or war was about to be voted upon by the Senate, could no longer endure to remain at home, but caused his slaves to carry him through the Forum to the Senate House in a litter.", "2605": "When he reached the doors of the Senate House his sons and sons-in-law supported him and guided him into the house, while all the assembly observed a respectful silence.", "2606":

when I hear the disgraceful propositions with which you are tarnishing the glory of Rome.", "2610": "What has become of that boast which we were so fond of making before all man­ kind, that if Alexander the Great had invaded Italy, and had met us when we were young, and our fathers when they were in the prime of life, he would not have been reputed invincible, but would either have fled or perhaps even have fallen, and added to the glory of Rome?", "2611": "You now prove that this was mere empty vapouring, by your terror of these Chaonians and Molossians, nations who have always been a prey and a spoil to the Macedonians, and by your fear of this Pyrrhus, who used formerly to dance attendance on one of Alexander's bodyguards,* and who has now wandered hither not so much in order to assist the Greeks in Italy as to escape from his enemies at home, and promises to be our friend and protector forsooth, when the army he commands did not suffice to keep for him the least portion of that Macedonia which he once acquired.", "2612": "Do not imagine that you will get rid of this man by making a treaty with him.", "2613": "Rather you will encourage other Greek princes to invade you, for they will despise you and think you an easy prey to all men, if you let Pyrrhus go home again without paying the penalty of his outrages upon you, nay, with the power to boast that he has made Rome a laughing-stock for Tarentines and Samnites.", "2614": "\"By these words Appius roused a warlike spirit in the Romans, and they dismissed Kineas with the answer that if Pyrrhus would leave Italy they would, if he wished, discuss the question of an alliance with him, but that while he remained in arms in their country the Romans would fight him to the death, however many Laevinuses he might defeat.", "2615": "It is related that Kineas, during his mission to Rome, took great interest in observing the national life of the Romans, and fully appreciated the excellence of their political constitution, which he learned by conversing with many of the leading men of the state.", "2616": "On his return he told Pyrrhus that the Senate seemed to him like an assembly of kings, and that as to the populace, he feared that the Greeks might find in them a new Lemæan hydra;", "2617": "for- twice as many troops had been en­ rolled in the consul's army as he had before, and yet there remained many more Romans capable of bearing arms.", "2618": "XX.", "2619": "After this Caius Fabricius came to arrange terms for the exchange of prisoners;", "2620": "a man whom Kineas said the Romans especially valued for his virtue and bravery, but who was excessively poor.", "2621": "Pyrrhus, in consequence of this, entertained Fabricius privately, and made him an offer of money, not as a bribe for any act of baseness, but speaking of it as a pledge of friendship and sincerity.", "2622": "As Fabricius refused this, Pyrrhus waited till the next day, when, desirous of making an impression on him, as he had never seen an elephant, he had his largest elephant placed behind Fabricius during their conference, concealed by a curtain.", "2623": "At a given signal, the curtain was withdrawn, and the creature reached out his trunk over the head of Fabricius with a harsh and terrible cry.", "2624": "Fabricius, how­ ever, quietly turned round, and then said to Pyrrhus with a smile, “ You could not move me by your gold yesterday, nor can you with your beast to-day.\"", "2625": "At table that day they conversed upon all subjects, but chiefly about Greece and Greek philosophy.", "2626": "Kineas repeated the opinion of Epikurus and his school, about the gods, and the practice of political life, and the objects at which we should aim, how they considered pleasure to be the highest good, and held aloof from taking any active part in politics, because it spoiled and destroyed perfect happiness;", "2627": "and about how they thought that the gods lived far removed from hopes and fears, and interest in human affairs, in a placid state of eternal fruition.-", "2628": "While he was speaking in this strain Fabricius burst out:", "2629": "\" Hercules! \" cried he, \" May Pyrrhus and the Samnites continue to waste their time on these speculations, as long as they remain at war with us !”", "2630": "Pyrrhus, at this, was struck by the spirit and noble disposition of Fabricius, and longed more than ever to make Rome his friend instead of his enemy.", "2631": "He begged him to arrange terms of peace, and after they were con­ cluded to come and live with him as the first of his friends and officers.", "2632": "Fabricius is said to have quietly answered, \" That, 0 King, will not be to your advantage;", "2633": "for those who now obey you, and look up to you, if they had any experience of me, would prefer me to you for their king.\"", "2634": "Pyrrhus was not angry at this speech, but spoke to all his friends about the magnanimous conduct of Fabricius, and entrusted the prisoners to him alone, on the condition that, if the Senate refused to make peace, they should be allowed to embrace their friends, and spend the festival of the Saturnalia with them, and then be sent back to him.", "2635": "And they were sent back after the Saturnalia, for the Senate decreed that any of them who remained behind should be put to death.", "2636": "XXI.", "2637": "After this, when C. Fabricius was consul, a man came into his camp bringing a letter from King Pyrrhus's physician, in which he offered to poison the king, if he could be assured of a suitable reward for his services in thus bringing the war to an end without a blow.", "2638": "Fabricius, disgusted at the man's treachery, brought his colleague to share his views, and in haste sent off a letter to Pyrrhus, bidding him be on his guard.", "2639": "The letter ran as follows:", "2640": "\" Caius Fabricius and Quintus Æmilius, the Roman consuls, greet King Pyrrhus.", "2641": "You appear to be a bad judge both of your friends and of your enemies.", "2642": "You will perceive, by reading the enclosed letter which has been sent to us, that you are fighting against good and virtuous men, and trusting to wicked and treacherous ones.", "2643": "We do not give you this information out of any love we bear you, but for fear that we might be charged with having assassinated you and be thought to have brought the war to a close by treachery because we could not do so by manhood.", "2644": "”Pyrrhus on receiving this letter, and discovering the plot against his life, punished his physician, and, in return for the kindness of Fabricius and the Romans, delivered up their prisoners without ransom, and sent Kineas a second time to arrange terms of peace.", "2645": "How­ ever, the Romans refused to receive their prisoners back without ransom, being unwilling either to receive a favour from their enemy, or to be rewarded for having abstained from treachery towards him, but set free an equal number of Tarentines and Samnites, and sent them to him.", "2646": "As to terms of peace, they refused to entertain the question unless Pyrrhus first placed his entire armament on board the ships in which it came, and sailed back to Epirus with it.", "2647": "As it was now necessary that Pyrrhus should fight another battle, he advanced with his army to the city of Asculum, and attacked the Romans.", "2648": "Here he was forced to fight on rough ground, near the swampy banks of a river, where his elephants and cavalry were of no service, and he was forced to attack with his phalanx.", "2649": "After a drawn battle, in which many fell, night parted the com­ batants.", "2650": "Next day Pyrrhus manoeuvred so as to bring the Romans fairly into the plain, where his elephants could act upon the enemy'is line.", "2651": "He occupied the rough ground on either side, placed many archers and slingers among his elephants, and advanced with his phalanx in close order and irresistible strength.", "2652": "The Romans, who were unable on the level ground to practise the bush­ fighting and skirmishing of the previous day, were coin­ pelled to attack the phalanx in front.", "2653": "They endeavoured to force their way through that hedge of spears before the elephants could come up, and showed marvellous courage in hacking at the spears with their swords, exposing them­ selves recklessly, careless of wounds or death.", "2654": "After a long struggle, it is said that they first gave way at the point where Pyrrhus was urging on his soldiers in person, though the defeat was chiefly due to the weight and crushing charge of the elephants.", "2655": "The Romans could not find any opportunity in this sort of battle for the display of their courage, but thought it their duty to stand aside and save themselves from a useless death, just as they would have done in the case of a wave of the sea or an earthquake coming upon them.", "2656": "In the flight to their camp, which was not far off, Hieronymus says that six thousand Romans perished, and that in Pyrrhus's commentaries his loss is stated at three thousand five hundred and five.", "2657": "Dionysius, on the other hand, does not admit that there were two battles at Asculum, or that the Romans suffered a defeat, but tells us that they fought the whole of one day until sunset, and then separated, Pyrrhus being wounded in the arm by a javelin, and the Samnites having plundered his baggage.", "2658": "He also states the total loss on both sides to be above fifteen thousand.", "2659": "-The armies separated after the battle, and it is said that Pyrrhus, when congratulated on his victory by his friends, said in reply:", "2660": "“If we win one more such victory over the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.\"", "2661": "For a large part of the force which he had brought with him had perished, and very nearly all his friends and officers, and there were no more to send for at home.", "2662": "He saw, too, that his allies were becoming lukewarm, while the Romans, on the other hand, filled up the gaps with a never ceasing stream of fresh recruits, and did not lose confidence by their defeats, but seemed to gather fresh strength and determination to go on with the war.", "2663": "XXII.", "2664": "While in these difficulties he conceived fresh hopes of success, and engaged in an enterprise in another quarter, which was likely to interfere with the prosecution of his original design.", "2665": "An embassy arrived from Sicily, offering to place the cities of Agrigentum, Syracuse, and Leontini in his hands, and begging him to aid them in driving out the Carthaginians from the island, and freeing it from despots, while at the same time messengers came from Greece with the news that Ptolemy, surnamed Keraunus, or \" the thunderbolt,\" had perished, with all his army, in an engagement with the Gauls, and that now was his opportunity to offer himself to the Macedonians, who were in great need of a king.", "2666": "Pyrrhus upbraided Fortune for placing so many opportunities within his reach at the same time, and, reflecting that he could only manage one with success, for some time remained plunged in thought.", "2667": "At last, thinking that the Sicilian offer was likely to lead to greater things, as Africa was close to that island, he decided to accept it, and at once sent Kineas to prepare the cities for his arrival, as was his wont in such cases.", "2668": "He himself, meanwhile, placed a strong garrison in the city of Tarentum, much to the disgust of its citizens, who asked him either to perform what he had come thither to do, namely, to assist them in fighting against the Romans, or else to evacuate their territory, and leave their city as he found it.", "2669": "In answer to this demand he harshly bade them keep quiet, and wait till he was at leisure to attend to their affairs, and at once set sail for Sicily.", "2670": "On his arrival there he found all his hopes realised, as the cities gladly delivered themselves into his hands.", "2671": "At first he willingly acceded to their request, that he should wage war on their behalf, and with an army of thirty thousand foot, two thousand horse, and two hundred ships, he attacked the Carthaginians, totally defeated them, and overran the part of Sicily which was subject to them.", "2672": "Eryx was the strongest of their fortresses, and was strongly garrisoned.", "2673": "Pyrrhus, learning this, determined to assault it.", "2674": "When his army was ready, he came forward, in complete armour, and vowed that he would hold public games and sacrifices in honour of Herakles, if he should prove himself that day, before all the Sikeliot Greeks, to be a worthy descendant of Achilles, and to deserve to com­ mand so great a force.", "2675": "The trumpet then sounded the charge, the barbarians were driven from the walls by a shower of missiles, and the scaling ladders planted against them.", "2676": "Pyrrhus was the first man to mount the wall, and there fought singly against a host, dashing some of them over the inner, and some over the outer edge of the wall, and wielding his sword with such terrible power that he soon stood on a pile of corpses.", "2677": "He himself was quite unhurt, and terrified the enemy by his mere appearance, proving how truly Homer has told us that of all virtues courage alone- is wont to display itself in divine transports and frenzies.", "2678": "After the city was taken he made a magnificent sacrifice to the gods, and held gymnastic contests of all kinds.", "2679": "XXIII.", "2680": "He now turned his arms against the so-called Mamertines* of Messina, who troubled the Greek cities much, and had even made some of them tributary to themselves.", "2681": "They were numerous and warlike;", "2682": "indeed, in Latin, their name means the “ children of Mars.", "2683": "It Pyrrhus seized and put to death any of them whom he found exacting tribute from the Greeks, and after defeating them in a pitched battle, took many of their outlying forts.", "2684": "The Carthaginians now were inclined to come to terms with him.", "2685": "They offered, if peace were concluded, to pay him tribute, and to supply a fleet for his use.", "2686": "To these proposals Pyrrhus, dissatisfied with obtaining so little, answered that he would only make peace and friendship with them on one condition, which was that they would evacuate Sicily altogether, and regard the African sea as their frontier towards Greece.", "2687": "Elated by the great­ ness of the force at his disposal, and the success which attended his enterprises, he now aimed at the realisation of the large hopes of conquest with which he left Greece, and meditated an attack on Libya.", "2688": "He had a large fleet, but required many rowers to man it, and these he pro­ ceeded to obtain from the allied cities, not by gentle means, but by harsh, arbitrary, and despotic commands.", "2689": "Not that he was originally of a tyrannical disposition, but his character, which at first was open, trustful, and sociable, gradually altered for the worse, as he became less dependent upon public opinion and more firmly fixed upon his throne, until at length he gained the reputation of an ungrateful and suspicious despot.", "2690": "The Greek cities, though with much murmuring, sub­ mitted to this arbitrary impressment, having no other alternative;", "2691": "but Pyrrhus soon proceeded to even harsher measures.", "2692": "Thoinon and Sosistratus were the leading men in Syracuse.", "2693": "It was they who had first invited him into Sicily, and who, when he arrived there, had placed their own city in his hands and induced most of the other Greek communities to join him.", "2694": "Pyrrhus now regarded these men with suspicion, and knew not whether to take them with him or leave them behind.", "2695": "Sosistratus, terrified at the king's evident ill-will, made his escape, upon which Pyrrhus charged Thoinon with plotting against him with the other, and put him to death.", "2696": "This caused a sudden revulsion of feeling from him.", "2697": "The Greek cities began to regard him with mortal hatred, and some of them joined the Carthaginians, whilst others invited the Manier­ tines to assist them.", "2698": "And while Pyrrhus saw nothing in Sicily but disaffection and insurrection against his power, he received despatches from the Tarentines and Samnites, informing him that they were confined to the walls of their cities, and even so could barely defend themselves against the Romans, while their lands were all being laid waste, and they urgently needed help.", "2699": "This intelligence prevented his withdrawal from Sicily being regarded as a flight, but in reality he had failed in his attempt to conquer that island, and was as eager to return to Italy as a shipwrecked sailor is to reach the shore.", "2700": "It is said that as he was sailing away he looked back at Sicily and said to his friends, \" What a fair field we are leaving for the Romans and Carthaginians to fight in.\"", "2701": "This prophecy, as he expected, was soon afterwards fulfilled.", "2702": "XXIV.", "2703": "The barbarians * combined to attack him as he retreated.", "2704": "He fought a battle at sea with the Cartha­ ginian fleet during his passage to Italy, in which he lost many ships, while the Mamertines, ten thousand strong, had crossed into Italy before he could reach it, and al­ though they did not dare to fight a pitched battle, yet harassed him by attacking him when entangled in some rough ground, and threw his entire army into confusion.", "2705": "Two elephants and many of his rearguard perished.", "2706": "Pyrrhus himself was at the head of the column of march, but at once rode to the rear and restored the fight, but was in great danger from the brave and warlike Mamer­ tines.", "2707": "He received a blow upon his head from a sword, which forced him to retire a little way from the battle, and greatly elated the enemy.", "2708": "One of them, a powerful man, splendidly armed, ran forward far beyond the rest, and boastfully challenged him to come forward and fight, if he were alive.", "2709": "At this Pyrrhus was so exasperated that he broke forcibly away from the officers who tried to restrain him, and, with his face covered with blood, and a savage expression of fury on his countenance, rushed upon the barbarian, and struck him a blow on the head which showed both the strength of his arm and the ad­ mirable temper of his sword, for it clave him completely asunder, so that his body fell down in two pieces", "2710": "This checked the ardour of the barbarians, who admired and feared Pyrrhus as a superior being.", "2711": "He was able to march unopposed for the rest of the way to Tarentum, to which city he brought a force of twenty thousand in­ fantry and three thousand cavalry.", "2712": "Taking with him the best troops of the Tarentines he now marched at once to attack the Romans, who were encamped in the territory of the Samnites.", "2713": "XXV.", "2714": "The Samnites at this period were entirely ruined and broken in spirit from the numerous defeats which they had sustained at the hands of the Romans.", "2715": "Some dissatisfaction also was felt with Pyrrhus for having neglected them while he was campaigning in Sicily;", "2716": "so that not many of that nation joined him.", "2717": "Pyrrhus now divided his forces, sending one portion into Lucania to harass the other consul and prevent his coming to the assistance of his colleague, while he himself led the re­ mainder to attack Manius Curins, who was quietly en­ camped near the city of Beneventum, awaiting the arrival of the Lucanian forces.", "2718": "It is also said that his sooth­ sayers told him, that the omens were not in favour of his moving from where he was.", "2719": "Pyrrhus, eager to attack him before the other consul's army joined him, made a hurried night march with his best troops and elephants, hoping to suprise the Roman camp.", "2720": "But during the march, which was long, and through a densely-wooded country, their torches went out, the soldiers lost their way in the darkness, and got into confusion.", "2721": "Day at length appeared, and showed to the Romans Pyrrhus with his army, advancing from the heights near their camp.", "2722": "The sight caused some disorder and excitement, but as the omens were now favourable, and the emergency required prompt action, Manius Curius led out his men, attacked the first troops of Pyrrhus's army whom he met, routed them, and dismayed the whole force, so that many were slain and several elephants captured.", "2723": "This success emboldened Manius to begin a general action on the more level ground, where he defeated the enemy with one wing of his army, but on the other his troops were over­ powered by the charge of the elephants and driven back to their camp.", "2724": "Curing now called to his aid the soldiers .", "2725": "left to guard the camp, who were standing under arms along the ramparts, and were quite fresh and unwearied.", "2726": "They assailed the elephants with a shower of darts, which caused them to turn and fly, trampling down their own men in their flight.", "2727": "The Romans thus gained the victory, and at the same time the reputation of being the first military nation in the world.", "2728": "For their display of valour on this occasion led to their being thought invincible, and to their at once gaining possession of the whole of Italy, and shortly afterwards of Sicily also.", "2729": "XXVI.", "2730": "Thus did Pyrrhus fail in his Italian and Sicilian expeditions, after spending six years of constant fighting in those countries, during which he lost a great part of his force, but always, even in his defeats, preserved his reputation for invincible bravery, being thought, in warlike skill and personal strength and daring, to be by far the first prince of his age.", "2731": "Yet he always threw away the advantages which he gained, in following some chimerical scheme of further conquest, being unable to take proper measures for the present because of his eager­ ness for the future.", "2732": "On this account Antigonus likened him to a player who made many good throws with the dice, but who did not know how to use them.", "2733": "He carried back to Epirus with him eight thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry, and, having no money, began to look out for a war, by which he might support his army, Some of the Gauls now joined him, and he at once invaded Macedonia, where Antigonus, the son of I Demetrius, was now king, with the intention of plundering the country.", "2734": "Soon, however, as he took several cities, and two thousand Macedonian soldiers deserted their colours and joined him, ho began to entertain more ambitious designs, marched against Antigonus himself, and was able to surprise his army, near the issue of a defile, by a sudden attack in the rear.", "2735": "Notwithstanding the general confusion, however, a strong body of Gauls, who formed the rear-guard, with­ stood him manfully, but, after a vigorous resistance, were nearly all cut to pieces, while the elephants, whose retreat was cut off, were surrendered by their leaders.", "2736": "After gaining such an advantage as this, Pyrrhus, trusting to his good fortune, and without calculating the numbers opposed to him, advanced to attack the Macedonian phalanx, which was full of disorder and consternation at the defeat of the rear-guard.", "2737": "No attempt was made by them to strike a blow.", "2738": "Pyrrhus stretched out his hand and called the Macedonian officers by their names, and they at once went over to him, and were followed by all their men.", "2739": "Antigonus escaped to the sea-coast, where he -still retained some cities in their obedience.", "2740": "Pyrrhus, considering that his victory over the Gauls was the most glorious part of his recent success, hung the finest of their arms and spoils in the temple of Athena Itonis, with the following epigram.", "2741": "\"These spoils doth Pyrrhus the Molossian king, From the brave Gauls to thee, bright goddess, bring;", "2742": "He beat Antigonus, with all his men:", "2743": "Achilles' sons are warriors now as then.", "2744": "\"After the battle he at once recovered the cities on the seaboard.", "2745": "He took Ægæ, treated the inhabitants very harshly, and left a garrison of Celtic mercenary troops in the town.", "2746": "These Gauls, with the insatiate greed for money for which that nation is noted, proceeded to break open the sepulchres of the Macedonian kings who were buried there, in search of plunder, and wantonly scattered their bones.", "2747": "Pyrrhus seemed but little disturbed at this out­ rage, either because his affairs gave him no leisure to think about it, or because he thought it dangerous to punish his barbarian allies:", "2748": "but the Macedonians were deeply grieved by it.", "2749": "And yet, although he was far from being firmly established in his now kingdom, he was already forming new schemes of conquest.", "2750": "In raillery he called Antigonus a shameless man because he had not yet laid aside the royal purple for the dress of a private man, and he eagerly accepted the invitation of Kleonymus the Spartan to go and attack Lacedæmon.", "2751": "This Kleonymus was by birth the rightful heir to the throne, but being thought to be a violent and tyrannical person he was hated and dis­ trusted by the Spartans, who had chosen his nephew Areus to be their king.", "2752": "This was the reason of his having long borne a grudge against his countrymen, but besides this his feelings had been recently wounded by a family quarrel.", "2753": "Kleonymus, now an elderly man, had married a beauti­ ful wife of the royal blood, Chilonis, the daughter of Leotychides.", "2754": "She fell madly in love with Akrotatus, the son of Areus, a youth in the flower of his age, and the dis­ honour of Kleonymus became notorious all over Sparta.", "2755": "This private wrong, added to his previous exclusion from the throne, so enraged him, that he invited Pyrrhus to attack Sparta, which he did with an army of twenty- five thousand foot, two thousand horse, and twenty-four elephants, so that it was obvious that he did not mean to gain Sparta for Kleonymus, but to conquer the whole of Peloponnesus for himself, although he answered some Spartan envoys who waited on him at Megalopolis in specious language, stating that he had come with the intention of restoring to freedom the cities which were held in subjection by Antigonus, and actually going so far as to tell them that, if possible, he intended to send his younger sons to Sparta to be trained in the Laconian discipline, by which they would be able to surpass all the other kings of their age.", "2756": "He put off the envoys with these stories, and made them accompany his army, but on reaching the Lacedæmonian territory he at once began to plunder and lay it waste.", "2757": "When the envoys remonstrated with him for having invaded their country without a declaration of war, he answered- “ We know well that neither do you Spartans tell any one beforehand what you mean to do.\"", "2758": "One of the envoys, by name Mandrokleides, said in his broad Laconian speech, \" If you are a god, we shall not be harmed by you, for we have done no wrong;", "2759": "but if you are a man, you may meet with a stronger man than yourself.", "2760": "\"XXVII.", "2761": "After this he marched upon Lacedæmon itself.", "2762": "Kleonymus urged him to make an assault immediately on the evening of his arrival, but Pyrrhus is said to have refused to do so, for fear that his soldiers might sack and destroy the city if they took it at night, while they might easily take it in the daytime.", "2763": "Indeed the Spartans were taken by surprise, and very few were in the city, the king Areus himself being absent ir Crete on an expedi.", "2764": "turn to assist the people of Gortyna.", "2765": "And it was this weakness and absence of defenders that really proved the salvation of the city, for Pyrrhus, not expecting any resistance, pitched his camp outside the walls, while the friends and helots of Kleonymus made ready his house and decorated it, expecting that Pyrrhus would sup there with him.", "2766": "At nightfall the Lacedæmonians at first proposed to send away the women to Crete, but they refused to leave the city.", "2767": "Archidamia* even went to the senate-house with a drawn sword in her hands, and on behalf of the women of Sparta reproached the men for insulting them by supposing that they would survive the capture of their city.", "2768": "After this, they determined to dig a ditch along the side of the city nearest to Pyrrhus's camp, and to barricade the ends of it with waggons buried up to the axles in the ground, to resist the charge of the elephants.", "2769": "When this work was begun the women and girls appeared with their tunics girt up for work,t and laboured at digging the ditch together with the older men.", "2770": "They bade those who were to fight on the morrow take rest, and they themselves alone dug one-third of the entire ditch.", "2771": "The width of the ditch was six cubits, its depth four cubits, and its length eight hundred feet, as we are told by Phylarchus, though Hieronymus makes its dimensions more moderate.", "2772": "At daybreak, when the enemy began to bestir themselves, the women armed the younger men, and handed over the ditch to them, bidding them defend it, as it would be pleasant for them to con­ quer in sight of their country, and glorious to die in the arms of their mothers and wives after having fought worthily of Sparta.", "2773": "Chilonis herself had retired to her own house, and had a halter ready about her neck, in order that if the city were taken she might not fall into the hands of Kleonymus.", "2774": "XXVIII.", "2775": "Pyrrhus himself led a direct attack of his infantry against the Spartans, who were drawn up in deep order, and endeavoured to force his way through them, and to pass the ditch, which was difficult, because the newly dug earth afforded no secure footing to his soldiers.", "2776": "Meanwhile his son Ptolemy led a chosen body of two thousand Gauls and Chaonians round the end of the ditch, and endeavoured to break through the barricade of waggons.", "2777": "These stood so thick and so close together that they made it hard, not only for the assailants to cross them, but even for the Lacedæmonians to reach the point where they were menaced.", "2778": "However, as the Gauls began to pull the wheels out of the earth and to drag the waggons down towards the river, the young Akrotatus perceiving the danger, sallied out from the city at another point with three hundred men, and got round behind Ptolemy's force, from whom he was concealed by some hilly ground.", "2779": "Then he vigorously assailed the Gauls in the rear, and forced them to face about and defend them­ selves, which caused great confusion, as they were driven among the waggons and into the ditch by the Spartans until at last they were forced to retreat.", "2780": "This glorious exploit of Akrotatus was witnessed from the city walls by the old men and all the women.", "2781": "As he returned through the city to his appointed post, covered with blood and rejoicing in his victory, the Spartan women thought that he had grown taller and more handsome than before, and they envied Chilonis her lover.", "2782": "Some of the old men even followed him, shouting, \" Go home, Akrotatus, and enjoy yourself with Chilonis :", "2783": "only beget brave sons for Sparta.\"", "2784": "Where Pyrrhus fought a terrible battle took place, and many valiant deeds were wrought.", "2785": "A Spartan named Pbyllius, after greatly distinguishing himself and slaying many of the assailants, when he felt himself mor­ tally wounded, made way for his rear rank-man to

his sleep Pyrrhus dreamed a dream, that he cast thunder­ bolts upon Lacedæmon, set it all on fire, and rejoiced at the sight.", "2789": "Being awakened by his delight at this vision, he ordered his officers to hold the troops in readiness and related the dream to his friends, auguring from it that he should take the city by assault.", "2790": "They were all of them delighted at the vision, and certain that it portended success, except one Lysimachus, who said that he feared that, as places struck by thunderbolts may not be walked over, Heaven might mean to signify to Pyrrhus by this that he never should set foot in the city.", "2791": "Pyrrhus how­ ever answered that this was more empty gossip, and that they had better take their arms in their hands and remem­ ber that \"", "2792": "The best of omens is King Pyrrhus's cause. \" He rose, and at daybreak led his troops again to the assault.", "2793": "The Lacedæmonians defended themselves with a spirit and courage beyond what could be expected from their small numbers.", "2794": "The women mingled in the thick of the fight, supplying food, drink, and missile weapons wherever they were needed, and carrying away the wounded.", "2795": "The Macedonians endeavoured to fill up the ditch by flinging large quantities of wood into it, covering the arms and dead bodies which lay at the bottom.", "2796": "As the Lacedæmo­ nians were resisting this attempt, they saw Pyrrhus on horseback trying to cross the line of waggons and the ditch, and force his way into the city.", "2797": "A shout was raised by the garrison at the spot, and the women began to scream and run wildly about.", "2798": "Pyrrhus had made his way through all obstacles and was about to attack the nearest of those who disputed his passage, when his horse, struck in the body by a Cretan javelin, reared in the death-agony, and threw Pyrrhus to the ground.", "2799": "He fell on a steep bank, and his fall caused such consternation among his followers that a timely charge of the Spartans drove them hack.", "2800": "Upon this he gave orders to put a stop to the assault, for he imagined that the Lacedæmonians would soon offer terms of surrender, as they were nearly all wounded, and had lost many men.", "2801": "However, the good fortune of the city, which may have wished to test the Spartan courage to the utmost, or to prove its own power to save the city when all hope seemed lost, brought Ameinias the Phokian, one of the generals of Antigonus, with a body of mercenary troops to help the Spartans in this their darkest hour.", "2802": "Shortly after they had received this reinforcement, their king, Areus, arrived from Crete with two thousand men.", "2803": "The women now returned to their homes, not thinking it to be necessary any longer for them to take an active part in the war, while those old men too who had been forced by necessity to take up arms, were relieved by the new comers, who took their places in the line of battle against the enemy.", "2804": "XXX.", "2805": "These reinforcements piqued Pyrrhus into making several more attempts to take the city, in which however he was repulsed and wounded.", "2806": "He now retired, and began to plunder the country, professing his intention to winter there.", "2807": "But no man can resist his destiny.", "2808": "There were in Argos two parties, one headed by Aristeas, and the other by Aristippus.", "2809": "The latter was favoured by Antigonns, which induced Aristeas to invite Pyrrhus to Argos.", "2810": "He was ever willing to embark on a new enterprise, because he regarded his successes merely as stepping-stones to greater things, and hoped to retrieve his failures by new and more daring exploits;", "2811": "so that he was rendered equally restless by victory or defeat.", "2812": "Accordingly he set off at once for Argos.", "2813": "Areus occupied the most difficult of the passes on the road with an ambuscade, and attacked the Gauls and Molossians who formed the rear-guard.", "2814": "Pyrrhus had been warned by his soothsayers that the livers of the victims wanted one lobe, which portended the loss of one of his relatives, but at this crisis the disorder and confusion into which his army was thrown by the ambush made him forget the omen, and order his son Ptolemy to take his guards and go to the help \"f the rearguard, while he him­ self hurried his main body on through the defile.", "2815": "When Ptolemy came up a fierce battle took place.", "2816": "The flower of the Lacedæmonian army, led by Eualkus, engaged with the troops immediately around Ptolemy, and while they fought, a Cretan named Oryssus, a native of Aptera, run­ ning forward on the flank, struck the young main, who was fighting bravely, with a javelin, and killed him.", "2817": "His fall caused his troops to retreat, and they were hard pressed by the Lacedæmonians, who were so excited by their victory that they were carried by their ardour far into the plain, where their retreat was cut off by Pyrrhus's infantry.", "2818": "Pyrrhus himself, who had just heard of the death of his son, in an agony of grief now ordered the Molossian cavalry to charge them.", "2819": "He was the first to ride among the Lacedæmonians, and terribly avenged his son by cutting them down.", "2820": "Pyrrhus in battle was always a terrific figure, whom none dared to resist, but on this occasion he sur­ passed himself in courage and fury.", "2821": "At length he rode up to Eualkus, who avoided his charge, and aimed a blow at him with his sword which just missed Pyrrhus's bridle hand, but cut through his reins.", "2822": "Pyrrhus ran him through with his spear at the same moment, but fell from his horse, and, fighting henceforth on foot, slew all the chosen band commanded by Eualkus.", "2823": "This was a severe loss to Sparta, incurred as it was unnecessarily, after the war was really over, from the desire of their generals to distinguish themselves.", "2824": "XXXI.", "2825": "Pyrrhus celebrated his son's obsequies with splendid games.-", "2826": "His grief was partly satiated by the revenge which he had taken upon the enemy, and he now marched towards Argos.", "2827": "Hearing that Antigonus was encamped upon one of the heights near the city, he himself pitched his camp at Nauplia.", "2828": "On the next day he sent a herald to Antigonus with an insulting message, challenging him to come down upon the level ground and fight.", "2829": "Antigonus answered that he should fight only when he chose, but that if Pyrrhus was weary of his life, he could find many other ways to die.", "2830": "Ambassadors from Argos also came to each of them, begging them to with­ draw their forces, and allow the city to remain indepen­ dent and friendly to both.", "2831": "Antigonus accepted this offer, and handed over his son to the Argives as a hostage, while Pyrrhus agreed to retire, but, as he gave no pledge, was viewed with greater suspicion than before.", "2832": "A strange portent also happened to Pyrrhus, for the heads of the oxen which had been sacrificed, when lying apart from their bodies, were observed to put out their tongues and lap their own gore;", "2833": "and in the city the priestess of Apollo Lykius rushed about in frenzy, crying out that she saw the whole city full of slaughtered corpses, and an eagle coming to the fight and then disappearing.", "2834": "XXXII.", "2835": "During the following night, which was very dark, Pyrrhus marched his troops up to the walls, found the gate called Diamperes opened to him by Aristeas, and was able to march his Gaulish troops into the city and seize the market-place unobserved :", "2836": "but the elephants could not pass through the gate until their towers were taken off their backs.", "2837": "The removal of these towers, in the darkness, and the replacing them when the elephants had passed through the gate, caused an amount of delay and confusion which at length roused the slumbering inhabi­ tants ;", "2838": "they ran together to the place called \" the Shield,\" and the other places of strength in the city, and sent messengers to call Antigonus to their aid.", "2839": "He at once marched up close to the city, and remained there with a reserve, but sent his son and several cf his officers with a large part of his forces to assist the Argives within their city walls.", "2840": "Areus the king of Sparta also arrived, with a thousand Cretans and the swiftest footed of the Spartans.", "2841": "All these troops now at once attacked the Gauls and threw them into great disorder.", "2842": "As Pyrrhus, however, marched in bv the street called Kylarabis, his soldiers raised a warlike shout:", "2843": "and he, noticing that the shout was echoed by the Gauls in the market-place in an un­ decided, faint-hearted fashion, at once guessed that they were being hard pressed.", "2844": "He instantly pressed the horse­ men with him to charge, which they did with great difficulty, as the horses kept falling into the watercourses with which the whole city is intersected.", "2845": "The night was spent in wild tumult and skirmishing in the narrow lanes, both parties being unable to recognize or obey their leaders, and eagerly awaiting the dawn.", "2846": "The first rays of light showed Pyrrhus the whole open square called \" the Shield \" full of enemies, while he was even more disturbed by the sight of a brazen statue in the market-place, repre­ senting a wolf and a bull about to attack one another;", "2847": "for he remembered an oracle which had long before foretold that he must die when he should see a wolf fighting with a bull.", "2848": "The Argives say that this statue comme­ morates the legend that Danaus when he first landed in the country at Pyramia, near Thyrea, was marching towards Argos when he saw a wolf fighting with a bull.", "2849": "Danaus decided that the wolf must represent himself, because he was a stranger, and was come to attack the people of the country, like it;", "2850": "and he stopped and watched the fight.", "2851": "When the wolf gained the day, he offered prayer to Apollo Lykius, made his attempt upon the throne of Argos, and was successful, as Gelanor, who was then king, was forced into exile by a revolution.", "2852": "This is the account which the Argives give of these statues.", "2853": "XXXIII.", "2854": "This sight, and the failure of his plans, dis­ heartened Pyrrhus, and he began to think of retreating.", "2855": "As the gates were narrow, he sent to his son Helenus, who had been left with a large force without the city, ordering him to break down a part of the wall, and pro­ tect the fugitives, if they were pressed by the enemy.", "2856": "But in the hurry and confusion the messenger did not clearly explain his orders, and by some mistake the young Helenus took all the remaining elephants and the best troops, and marched through the gate with them to help his father.", "2857": "Pyrrhus was already beginning to retire.", "2858": "As long as he fought in the market-place, where there was ample room, he effected his retreat in good order, and kept off the assailants by occasional movements in advance.", "2859": "But when his troops began to march down the narrow street leading to the gate, they were met face to face by the reinforcement coming to their assistance.", "2860": "At this crisis some of the soldiers refused to obey Pyrrhus's order to retreat, while others who were willing enough to do so could not stem the tide of men marching in from the gate.", "2861": "At the gate itself too the largest of the elephants had fallen sideways and lay there bellowing, blocking up the way for those who were trying to pass out, while one of the elephants of the reinforcing party, called the Conqueror,\" was looking for his master, who had fallen off his back mortally wounded.", "2862": "Charging violently back against the surging tide of fugitives, the faithful beast trampled down friends and foes alike until he found his master's body, when he seized it with his trunk and carried it upon his tusks;", "2863": "and then, turning round in a frenzy of gi ief, overturned and crushed every one whom he met.", "2864": "As the men were thus crowded together, no one could do anything to help himself, but the whole mass surged backwards and forwards in one solid body.", "2865": "The enemy who attacked them behind did them but little hurt;", "2866": "they suffered chiefly from one another, because when a man had once drawn his sword or couched his lance he could not put it up again, and it pierced whoever might happen to be forced against it.", "2867": "XXXIV.", "2868": "Pyrrhus, seeing the danger with which he was menaced on every side, took off the royal diadem from his helmet, and gave it to one of his companions.", "2869": "He himself, trusting to the fact of his being on horseback, now charged into the mass of assailants, and was struck through his cuirass by one of them with a spear.", "2870": "The wound was not a dangerous or important one, and Pyrrhus at once turned to attack the man from whom he had received it.", "2871": "He was an Argive, not of noble birth, but the son of a poor old woman, who, like the rest, was looking on at the battle from the roof of her house.", "2872": "As soon as she saw Pyrrhus attacking her son, in an ecstasy of fear and rage she took up a tile and hurled it at Pyrrhus.", "2873": "It struck him on the helmet, bruising the spine at the back of his neck, and he fell from his horse, blinded by the stroke, at the side of the sacred enclosure of Likymnius.", "2874": "Few recognized him, but one Zopyrus, who was in the service of Antigonus, and two or three others, seized him just as he was beginning to recover his senses, and dragged him into an archway near at hand.", "2875": "When Zopyrus drew an Illyrian sword to cut off his head Pyrrhus looked so fiercely at him that he was terrified, and bungled in his work, but at length managed to sever his head from his body.", "2876": "By this time most men bad learned what had happened, and Halkyoneus, running up, asked to see the head, that he might identify it.", "2877": "When he obtained this he rode off with it to his father, and finding him sitting amongst his friends, he threw it down at his feet.", "2878": "Antigonus when he recognized it chased his son out of his presence, striking him with his staff, and calling him accursed and barbarous, and then covered his own face with his mantle and wept, remem­ bering how in his own family his grandfather Antigonus and his father Demetrius had experienced similar reverses of fortune.", "2879": "He had the body and head of Pyrrhus decently arranged on a funeral pyre and burned.", "2880": "Halky­ oneus, meeting Helenus in poor and threadbare clothes, embraced him kindly, and led him to Antigonus, who said to him, \" This meeting, my boy, is better than the other;", "2881": "but still you do not do right in not removing these clothes, which rather seem to disgrace us who are, as it appears, the victors.\"", "2882": "He treated Helenus with great kindness, and sent him back to his kingdom of Epirus loaded with presents, and also showed great favour towards the friends of Pyrrhus, who, together with all his army and war material, had fallen into his hands.", "2883": "I.", "2884": "I CANNOT mention any third name- of Caius Marine, any more than of Quintus Sertorius, who held Spain, or of Lucius Mummius, who took Corinth;", "2885": "for the name Achaicus was given to Mummius in c mmemoration of this event, just as the name Africans was given to bcipio, and Macedonicus to Metellus.", "2886": "Tris seems to Posei­ donius to be the strongest refutation of the opinion of those who suppose that the third name was the proper individual name among the Romans, such as Camillus, and Marcellus, and Cato ;", "2887": "for he argues, if this were so, those who had only the two names would be really without a name.", "2888": "But Poseidonius does not perceive that by this argument he on his side makes the women to be without names:", "2889": "for no woman ever has the first of the three names, which first, however, Poseidonius supposes to be the name which marked individuals among the Romans ;", "2890": "and of the other two names, he supposes the one to be common and to belong to all of one kin, such as the Pompeii and the Manlii and the Cornelii, just as the Greeks might speak of the Herakleidæ and the Pelopidæ;", "2891": "but the other name he supposes to be an appellation given as a distinctive name, either with reference to a man's disposition or his actions, or some character and peculiarity of his person, such as Macrinus and Torquatus and Sulla, which may be compared with the Greek Mnemon or Grypus or Kallinikus.", "2892": "However, in such matters as these the diversity in usage allows a variety of conjectures.", "2893": "II.", "2894": "With respect to the personal appearance of Marius, I saw a stone statue * of him at Ravenna in Gaul, which was perfectly in accordance with what is said of the roughness and harshness of his character.", "2895": "He was naturally of a courageous and warlike turn, and had more of the discipline of the camp than of the state, and accordingly his temper was ungovernable when he was in the possession of power.", "2896": "It is stated that he never studied Greek literature, and never availed himself of the Greek language for any serious purpose, for he said it was ridiculous to study a literature the teachers of which were the slaves of others;", "2897": "and after his second triumph, when he exhibited Greek plays * on the occasion of the dedication of a certain temple, though he came to the theatre, he only sat down for a moment and then went away.", "2898": "Xenokrates the philosopher was considered to be rather of a morose temper, and Plato was in the habit of frequently saying to him, \" My good Xenokrates, sacrifice to the Graces:", "2899": "' in like manner, if Marins could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Grecian Muses and Graces, he would never have brought a most illustrious military and civil career to a most unseemly conclusion;", "2900": "through passion and unreasonable love of power and insatiable desire of self-aggrandizement driven to terminate his course in an old age of cruelty and ferocity.", "2901": "Let this, however, be judged of by the facts as they will presently appear.", "2902": "III.", "2903": "Marius was the son of obscure parents, who gained their living by the labour of their hands, and were poor.", "2904": "His father's name was Marius;", "2905": "his mother'is name was Fulcinia.", "2906": "It was late before he saw Rome and became acquainted with the habits of the city, up to which time he lived at Cirrhæato, † a village in the territory of Arpinum, where his mode of life was rude, when con­ trasted with the polite and artificial fashions of a city, but temperate and in accordance with the old Roman discipline.", "2907": "He first served against the Celtiberians when Scipio Africanus was besieging Numantia, and he attracted the notice of his commander by his superiority in courage over all the other young soldiers, and by the readine s with which he adapted himself to the change in living which Scipio introduced among the troops, who had been corrupted by luxurious habits and extravagance.", "2908": "He is said also to have killed one of the enemy in single combat in the presence of the general.", "2909": "Accordingly Marius re­ ceived from Scipio various honourable distinctions;", "2910": "and on one occasion, after supper, when the conversation was about generals, and one of the company, either because he really felt a difficulty or merely wished to flatter Scipio, asked him where the Roman people would find such another leader and protector when he was gone, Scipio with his hand gently touched the shoulder of Marius, who was reclining next to him, and said, \" Perhaps here.\"", "2911": "So full of promise was the youth Or Marius, and so discerning was the judgment of Scipio.", "2912": "IV.", "2913": "Now it is said that Marius, mainly encouraged by these words, which he viewed as a divine intimation, entered on a political career, and obtained the tribune­ ship, in which he was assisted by Cæcilius Metellus,* of whose house the family of Marius had long been an adherent.", "2914": "During his tribuneship Marius proposed a law on the mode of voting, which apparently tended to deprive the nobles of their power in the Judicia:", "2915": "the measure was opposed by Cotta, the consul, who persuaded the Senate to resist the proposed law, and to summon Marius to account for his conduct.", "2916": "The decree proposed by Cotta was drawn up, and Marius appeared before the Senate;", "2917": "but so far from being disconcerted, as a young man might naturally be, who without any advantages had just stepped into public life, he already assumed the tone which his subsequent exploits authorized, and threatened to carry off Cotta to prison if he did not rescind the decree.", "2918": "Upon Cotta turning to Metellus and asking his opinion, Metellus arose and supported the consul;", "2919": "but Marius, sending for the officer who was outside of the house, ordered him to carry off Metellus himself to prison.", "2920": "Metellus ap­ pealed to the rest of the tribunes without effect, and the Senate yielded and abandoned the decree.", "2921": "Marius now triumphantly came before the popular assembly and got his law ratified, having proved himself to be a man unassailable by fear, not to be diverted from his purpose by any motive of personal respect, and a formidable opponent to the Senate by his measures which were adapted to win the public favour.", "2922": "But he soon gave people reason to change their opinion;", "2923": "for he most resolutely opposed a measure for the distribution of corn among the citizens, and succeeding in his opposi­ tion, he established himself in equal credit with both parties, as a man who would do nothing to please either, if it were contrary to the public interest.", "2924": "V.", "2925": "After the tribuneship he was a candidate for the greater ædileship.", "2926": "Now there are two classes of ædile- ships :", "2927": "one, which derives its name (curule *) from the seats with curved feet on which the ædiles sit when they discharge their functions;", "2928": "the other, the inferior, is called the plebeian ædileship.", "2929": "When they have chosen the higher ædiles, they then take the vote again for the election of the others.", "2930": "Now as Marius was manifestly losing in the votes for the curule ædileship, he forthwith changed about and became a candidate for the other ædileship.", "2931": "But this was viewed as an audacious and arrogant attempt, and he failed in his election ;", "2932": "but though he thus met with two repulses in one day, which never happened to any man before, he did not abate one tittle of his pretensions, for no long time after he was a candidate for a preetorship,* in which he narrowly missed a failure, being the last of all who were declared to be elected, and he was prosecuted for bribery.†", "2933": "What gave rise to most suspicion was the fact that a slave of Cassius Sabaco t was seen within the septa mingled with the voters;", "2934": "for Sabaco was one of the most intimate friends of Marius.", "2935": "Accordingly Sabaco was cited before the judices;", "2936": "he explained the circumstance by saying that the heat had made him very thirsty, and he called for a cup of cold water, which his slave brought to him within the septa, and left it as soon as he had drunk the water.", "2937": "Sabaco was ejected from the Senate by the next censors, and people were of opinion that he deserved it, either because he had given false testimony or for his intemperance.", "2938": "Caius Herennius also was summoned as a witness against Marius, but he declared that it was contrary to established usage to give testimony against a client * and that patrons (for this is the name that the Romans give to protectors) were legally excused from this duty, and that the parents of Marius, and Marius him­ self, originally were clients of his house.", "2939": "Though the judices accepted the excuse as valid, Marius himself con­ tradicted Herennius, and maintained that for the moment when he was declared to be elected to a magistracy, he became divested of the relation of client;", "2940": "which was not exactly true, for it is not every magistracy which re­ leases a man who has obtained it, and his family, from the necessity of having a patron, but only those magistra­ cies to which the law assigns the curule seat.", "2941": "However, on the first days of the trial it went hard with Marius, and the judices were strongly against him ;", "2942": "yet on the last day, contrary to all expectation, he was acquitted, the votes being equal.", "2943": "VI.", "2944": "During his prætorship Marius got only a moderate degree of credit.", "2945": "But on the expiration of his office he obtained by lot the further province of Iberia (Spain).", "2946": "and it is said that during his command he cleared all the robber * establishments out of his government, which was still an uncivilised country in its habits and in a savage state, as the Iberians had not yet ceased to consider robbery as no dishonourable occupation.", "2947": "Though Marius had now embarked in a public career, he had neither wealth nor eloquence, by means of which those who then held the chief power were used to manage the people.", "2948": "But the resoluteness of his character, and his enduring perseverance in toil, and his plain manner of living, got him the popular favour, and he increased in estimation and influence, so as to form a matrimonial alliance with the illustrious house of the Cæsars,* with Julia, whose nephew Cæsar afterwards became the greatest of the Romans and in some degree imitated his relation Marius, as I have told in the Life of Cæsar.", "2949": "There is evidence both of the temperance of Marius and also of his endurance, which was proved by his behaviour about a surgical operation.", "2950": "Both his legs, it is said, had become varicose,t and as .he disliked this deformity, he resolved to put himself in the surgeon's hands.", "2951": "Accordingly he presented to the surgeon one of his legs without allowing himself to be bound ;", "2952": "and without making a single move­ ment or uttering a single groan, with steady countenance and in silence he endured excessive pain during the opera­ tion.", "2953": "But when the surgeon was going to take the other leg, Marius refused to present it, saying that he perceived the cure was not worth the pain.", "2954": "VII.", "2955": "When Cæcilius Metellus‡ was appointed consul with the command of the war against Jugurtha, he took Marius with him to Libya in the capacity of legatus.§", "2956": "Here Marius signalised himself by great exploits and brilliant success in battle, but he did not, like the rest, seek to increase the glory of Metellus and to direct all his efforts for the advantage of his general, but disdaining to be called a legatus of Metellus, and considering that fortune had offered him a most favourable opportunity and a wide theatre for action, he displayed his courage on every occasion.", "2957": "Though the war was accompanied with many hardships, he shrunk not from danger however great, and he thought nothing too mean to be neglected, but in prudent measures and careful foresight he surpassed all the officers of his own rank, and he vied with the soldiers in hard living and endurance, and thus gained their affections.", "2958": "For certainly there is nothing which reconciles a man so readily to toil as to see another voluntarily sharing it with him, for thus the compulsion seems to be taken away;", "2959": "and the most agreeable sight to a Roman soldier is to see his general in his presence eating common bread or sleeping on a coarse mat, or taking a hand in any trench-work and fortification.", "2960": "Soldiers do not so much admire a general who shares with them the honour and the spoil, as one who participates in their toils and dangers ;", "2961": "and they love a general who will take a part in their labours more than one who indulges their licence.", "2962": "By such conduct as this, and by gaining the affection of the soldiers, Marius soon filled Libya and Rome with his fame and his glory, for the soldiers wrote to their friends at home and told them there would be no end to the war with the barbarian, no deliverance from it, if they did not elect Marius consul.", "2963": "VIII.", "2964": "These proceedings evidently caused great annoy­ ance to Metellus;", "2965": "but the affair of Turpillius* vexed him most of all.", "2966": "The family of Turpillius for several genera­ tions had been connected with that of Metellus by friendly relations, and Turpillius was then serving in the army at the head of a body of engineers.", "2967": "It happened that he was commissioned to take charge of Vaga, which was a large city.", "2968": "Trusting for his security to the forbearance with which he treated the inhabitants, and his kind and friendly intercourse with them, he was thrown off his guard and fell into the hands of his enemies, who admitted Jugurtha into the city.", "2969": "Turpillius, however, was not injured, and the citizens obtained his release and sent him away.", "2970": "He was accordingly charged with treason, and Marius, who was present at the trial as an assessor, was violent against him and excited most of the rest, so that Metellus was unwillingly compelled to pronounce sentence of death against the man.", "2971": "Shortly after it appeared that the charge was false, and everybody except Marius sym pathised with Metellus, who was grieved at what had taken place;", "2972": "but Marius exultingly claimed the merit of the condemnation, and was shameless enough to go about saying that he had fixed on Metellus a dæmon which would avenge the death of the man whom it was his duty to protect.", "2973": "This brought Metellus and Marius to open enmity;", "2974": "and it is reported that on one occasion when Marius was present, Metellus said in an insulting way, \" You, forsooth, my good fellow, intend to leave us and make the voyage to Rome, to offer yourself for the con­ sulship ;", "2975": "and you won't be content to be the colleague of this son of mine.\"", "2976": "Now the son of Metellus* was at that time a very young man.", "2977": "Marius however was still im­ portunate to obtain leave of absence ;", "2978": "and Metellus, after devising various pretexts for delay, at last allowed him to go, when there were only twelve days left before the consuls would be declared.", "2979": "Marius accomplished the long journey from the camp to Utica, on the coast, in two days and one night, and offered sacrifice before he set sail.", "2980": "It is said that the priest told him that the deity gave prognostications of success beyond all measure and all expectation, and accordingly Marius set sail with high hopes.", "2981": "In four days he crossed the sea with a favourable wind, and was most joyfully received by the people, and being introduced to the popular assembly by one of the tribunes, he began by violent abuse of Metellus, and ended with asking for the consulship and promising that he would either kill Jugurtha or take him alive.", "2982": "IX.", "2983": "Being declared consul by a great majority, he imme­ diately set about levying soldiers in a way contrary to law and usage, by enrolling a great number of the poorer sort and of slaves, though former generals had never admitted men of this kind into the army, but had given arms, as they would anything else that was a badge of honour, only to those who had the due qualification, inas­ much as every soldier was thus considered to pledge his property to the State.", "2984": "It was not this however which made Marius most odious, but his insolent and arrogant expressions, which gave offence to the nobles, for he publicly said that he considered his acquisition of the consulship a trophy gained over the effeminacy of the noble and the rich, and that what he could proudly show to the people was his own wounds, not the monuments of the dead or the likenesses* of others.", "2985": "And he would often speak of the generals who had been defeated in Libya, mentioning by name Bestial and Albinus, men of illustrious descent indeed, but unskilled in military matters, and f or want of experience unsuccessful;", "2986": "and he would ask his hearers whether they did not think that the ancestors of Bestia and Albinus would rather have left descendants like himself, for they also had gained an honourable fame, not by noble birth, but by their virtues and their illus­ trious deeds.", "2987": "This was not said as a mere empty boast, nor simply because he wished to make himself odious to the nobles;", "2988": "but the people, who were delighted to hear the Senate abused, and always measured the greatness of a man's designs by the bigness of his words, encouraged him and urged him on not to spare the nobles if he wished to please the many.X.", "2989": "When Marina had crossed over to Libya, Metellus, giving way to his jealousy, and vexed to see the crown and the triumph, when he had already completed the war and it only remained to seize the person of Jugurtha, taken from him by another, a man too who had raised himself to power by ingratitude to his benefactor, would not stay to meet Marius, but privately left the country, and Rutilius, one of his legati, gave up the army to the new consul.", "2990": "But at last retribution for his conduct overtook Marius;", "2991": "for he was deprived of the glory of his victories by Sulla, just in the same way as he had deprived Metellus of his credit:", "2992": "and how this happened I will state briefly, since the particular circumstances are told more at length in the Life of Sulla.", "2993": "Bocchus, who was king of the barbarians in the interior, and the father-in-law of Jugurtha, showed no great disposition to help him in his wars, because of the faithlessness of Jugurtha, and also because he feared the increase of his power.", "2994": "But when Jugurtha, who was now a fugitive from place to place, made Bocchus his last resource and took refuge with him, Bocchus received his son-in-law more from a regard to decency, as he was a suppliant, than from any goodwill, and kept him in his hands;", "2995": "and while he openly interceded with Marius on behalf of Jugurtha, and wrote to say that he would not surrender him and assumed a high tone, he secretly enter.", "2996": "tained treacherous designs against Jugurtha, and sent for Lucius Sulla, who was the Quæstor of Marius, and had done some service to Bocchus during the campaign.", "2997": "Sulla confidently went to Bocchus, but the barbarian, who had changed his intentions and repented of his design, for several days wavered in his plan, hesitating whether he should deliver up Jugurtha or keep Sulla a prisoner:", "2998": "at last, however, ho determined to carry into effect his cri­ ginal design, and surrendered Jugurtha into the hands of Bulla.", "2999": "Thus was sown the seed of that irreconcilable and violent animosity between Marius and Sulla which nearly destroyed Rome:", "3000": "many claimed the credit of this transac­ tion for Sulla on account of their dislike of Marius, and Sulla himself had a seal-ring made, which he used to wear, on which there was a representation of the surrender of Jugurtha by Bocchus.", "3001": "By constantly wearing this ring Sulla irritated Marius, who was an ambitious and quarrel­ some man, and could endure no partner in his glory.", "3002": "But the enemies of Marius gave SuHa most encouragement by attributing to Metellus the credit of the first and best part of the war, and that of the latter part and the conclusion to Sulla, their object being to lower Marius in public esti­ mation and to withdraw the people from their exclusive attachment to him.", "3003": "XI.", "3004": "But this envy and hatred and these calumnies against Marius were dissipated and removed by the danger which threatened Italy from the west, as soon as the State saw that she needed a great commander and had to look about for a pilot whose skill should save her from such a torrent of foes;", "3005": "for no one would allow any of the men of noble birth or wealthy families to offer themselves at the Comi­ tia, and Marius, in his absence from Rome, was declared consul.", "3006": "It happened that the Romans had just received intelligence of the capture of Jugurtha when the reports about the Cimbri* and Teutones surprised them, and though the rumours as to the numbers and strength of the invaders were at first disbelieved, it afterwards appeared that they fell short of the truth.", "3007": "Three hundred thousand armed fighting men were advancing, bringing with them a much larger number of women and children, in quest of land to support so mighty a multitude and of cities to dwell in, after the example of the Cellar before them, who took the best part of Italy from the Tyrrheni and kept it.", "3008": "As these invaders had no intercourse with other nations, and had traversed an extensive tract of country, it could not be ascertained who they were or where they issued from to descend upon Gaul and Italy like a cloud.", "3009": "The most probable conjecture was that they were Germanic nations belonging to those who extended as far as the northern ocean ;", "3010": "and this opinion was founded on their great stature, their blue eyes, and on the fact that the Germans designate robbers by the name of Cimbri.", "3011": "Others thought that Celtica extended in a wide and extensive tract from the external sea and the subarctic regions to the rising sun and the Lake Maeotis,* where it bordered on Pontic Scythia;", "3012": "and it was from this region, as they supposed, where the tribes are mingled, that these invaders came, and that they did not advance in one expedition nor yet uninterruptedly, but that every spring they moved forwards, fighting their way, till in the course of time they traversed the whole continent.", "3013": "Accordingly while the barbarians had several names according to their respective tribes, they designated the whole body by the name of Celtoscythians.", "3014": "But others say that the Cimmerians, with whom the ancient Greeks were first acquainted, were no large portion of the whole nation, but merely a tribef or faction that was driven out by the Scythians and passed into Asia from the Lake Mæotis, under the command of Lygdamis:", "3015": "they further say that the chief part of the Scythian nation and the most warlike part lived at the very verge of the continent, on the coast of the external sea, in a tract shaded, woody, and totally sunless, owing to the extent and closeness of the forests, which reach into the interior as far as the Hercynii‡;", "3016": "and with respect to the heavens, their position was in that region where the poles, having a great eleva­ tion owing to the inclination of the parallels, appears to be only a short distance from the spectator's zenith, and the days and nights are of equal length and share the year between them, which furnished Homer* with the occasion for his story of Ulysses visiting the ghosts.", "3017": "From these parts then some supposed that these barbarians came against Italy, who were originally Cimmerii, but then not inappropriately called Cimbri.", "3018": "But all this is rather founded on conjecture than on sure historical evidence.", "3019": "As to the numbers of the invaders, they are stated by many authorities as above rather than below the amount that has been mentioned.", "3020": "But their courage and daring made them irresistible, and in battle they rushed forward with the rapidity and violence of fire, so that no nations could stand their attack, but all the people that came in their way became their prey and booty, and many powerful Roman armiest with their commanders, which were sta­ tioned to protect Gaul north of the Alps, perished inglo­ riously;", "3021": "and indeed these armies by their unsuccessful resistance mainly contributed to direct the course of the enemy against Rome.", "3022": "For when they had defeated those who opposed them and got abundance of booty, they do­ termined not to settle themselves permanently anywhere till they had destroyed Rome and ravaged Italy.XII.", "3023": "Hearing this news from many quarters, the Romans called Marius to the command;", "3024": "and he was elected consul the second time, though it was contrary to a positive law for a man in his absence, and without a certain interval of time, to be elected again, but the people would not listen to those who made any opposition to the election.", "3025": "For they considered that this would not be the first time that the law had given way to convenience, and that the present was as good an occasion for such an irregularity as the election of Scipio * as consul at a time when they were under no apprehension about the ruin of Rome, but merely wished to destroy Carthage.", "3026": "Accordingly these reasons prevailed, and Marius, after crossing the sea with his army to Rome, received the consulship, and celebrated his triumph on the calends of January, which with the Romans is the beginning of the year, and ex­ hibited to them a sight they never expected to see, Jugurtha in chains;", "3027": "for no one had ever ventured to hope that the Romans could conquer their enemies while he was alive;", "3028": "so dexterous was Jugurtha in turning all events to the best advantage, and so much courage did he combine with great cunning.", "3029": "But it is said that being led in the triumph made him lose his senses.", "3030": "After the triumph he was thrown into prison, and while some were tearing his clothes from his body, others who were anxious to secure his golden ear-rings pulled them off and the lobe of the ear with them;", "3031": "in this plight being thrust down naked into a deep hole, in his frenzy, with a grinning laugh, he cried out, 0 Hercules, how cold your bath is!", "3032": "After struggling with famine for six days and to the last moment clinging to the wish to preserve his life, he paid the penalty due to his monstrous crimes.", "3033": "It is said that there were carried in the triumphal procession three thousand and seven pounds of gold, of silver uncoined five thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, and in coined money two hundred and eighty-seven thousand drachmas.", "3034": "After the procession Marius assembled the Senate in the Capitol, and either through inadvertence or vulgar exulta­ tion at his good fortune he entered the place of meeting in his triumphal dress.", "3035": "But observing that the Senate took offence at this, he went out, and putting on the ordinary robe with the purple border, he returned to the assembly.", "3036": "XIII.", "3037": "On his expedition to meet the Cimbri, Marius con­ tinually exercised his forces in various ways in running and in forced marches;", "3038": "he also compelled every man to carry all his baggage and to prepare his own food, in consequence of which men who were fond of toil, and promptly and silently did what they were ordered, were called Marian mules.", "3039": "Some, however, think that this name had a different origin;", "3040": "as follows :", "3041": "-When Scipio was blockading Numantia, he wished to inspect not only the arms and the horses, but also the mules and waggons, in order to see in what kind of order and condition the soldiers kept them.", "3042": "Marius accordingly produced his horse, which he had kept in excellent condition with his own hand, and also a mule, which for good appearance, docility, and strength far surpassed all the rest.", "3043": "The general was much pleased with the beasts of Marius and often spoke about them, which gave rise to the scoff­ ing epithet of Marian mule, when the subject of com­ mendation was a persevering, enduring, and labour-loving man.", "3044": "XIV.", "3045": "Marius was favoured by a singular piece of good fortune;", "3046": "for there was a reflux in the course of the barbarians, and the torrent flowed towards Iberia before it turned to Italy, which gave Marius time to discipline the bodies of his men and to confirm their courage;", "3047": "and what was most of all, it gave the soldiers an opportunity of knowing what kind of a man their general was.", "3048": "For the first impression created by his sternness and by his inexorable severity in punishing, was changed into an opinion of the justice and utility of his discipline when they had been trained to avoid all cause of offence and all breach of order;", "3049": "and the violence of his temper, the harshness of his voice, and ferocious expression of his countenance, when the soldiers became familiarised with them, appeared no longer formidable to them, but only terrific to their enemies.", "3050": "But his strict justice in-all matters that came before him for judgment pleased the soldiers most of all;", "3051": "and of this the following instance is mentioned.", "3052": "Caius Lusius, who was a nephew of Marius, and was an officer in the army, was in other respects a man of no bad character, but fond of beautiful youths.", "3053": "This Caius conceived a passion for one of the young men who served under him, by name Trebonius, and had often ineffectually attempted to seduce him.", "3054": "At last Caius one night sent a servant with orders to bring Trebonius;", "3055": "the young man came, for he could not refuse to obey the summons, and was introduced into the tent;", "3056": "but when Caius attempted to use violence towards him, he drew his sword and killed him.", "3057": "Marius was not present when this happened, but on his arrival he brought Trebonius to trial.", "3058": "There were many to join in supporting the accusation, and not one to speak in his favour, but Trebonius boldly came forward and told the whole story;", "3059": "and he produced witnesses who proved that he had often resisted the importunities of Lusius, and that though great offers had been made, he had never prostituted himself;", "3060": "on which Marius, admir­ ing his conduct, ordered a crown to be brought, such as was conferred for noble deeds according to an old Roman fashion, and he took it and put it on the head of Trebonius as a fit reward for so noble an act at a time when good examples were much needed.", "3061": "The news of this, reaching Rome, contributed in no small degree to the consulship being conferred on Marius for the third time;", "3062": "the barba­ rians also were expected about the spring of the year, and the Romans did not wish to try the issue of a battle with them under any other commander.", "3063": "However, the bar­ barians did not come so soon as they were expected, and the period of the consulship of Marius again expired.", "3064": "As the Comitia were at hand, and his colleague had died, Marius came to Rome, leaving Manius Aquilius in the command of the army.", "3065": "There were many candidates of great merit for the consulship, but Lucius Saturninus, one of the tribunes, who had most influence with the people, was gained over by Marius;", "3066": "and in his harangues he advised them to elect Marius consul.", "3067": "Marius indeed affected to decline the honour, and begged to be excused;", "3068": "he said he did not wish for it;", "3069": "on which Saturninus called him a traitor to his country for refusing the command at so critical a time.", "3070": "Now though it was apparent that Saturninus was playing a part at the bidding of Marius, and in such a way that nobody was deceived, still the many seeing that the circumstances required a man of his energy and good fortune, voted for the fourth consulship of Marius, and gave him for colleague Catulus Lutatius, a man who was esteemed by the nobility and not disliked by the people.", "3071": "XV. Marius, hearing that the enemy was near, quickly crossed the Alps, and established a fortified camp near the river Rhodanus* (Rhône), which he supplied with abundance of stores, that he might not be compelled against his judgment to fight a battle for want of pro­ visions.", "3072": "The conveyance of the necessary stores for the army, which hitherto was tedious and expensive on the side of the sea, he rendered easy and expeditious.", "3073": "The mouths of the Rhodanus, owing to the action of the waves, received a great quantity of mud and sand, mixed with large masses of clay, which were formed into banks by the force of the water, and the entrance of the river was thus made difficult and laborious and shallow for the vessels that brought supplies.", "3074": "As the army had nothing to do, Marius brought the soldiers here and commenced a great cut, into which he diverted a large part of the river, and, by making the new channel terminate at a convenient point on the coast, he gave it a deep outlet which had water enough for large vessels, and was smooth and safe against wind and wave.", "3075": "This cut still bears the name of Marius.", "3076": "The barbarians had now divided themselves into two bodies, and it fell to the lot of the Cimbri to march through the country of the Norici,* over the high land against Catulus, and to force that passage:", "3077": "the Teutones and Ambrones were to march through the Ligurian country along the sea to meet Marius.", "3078": "Now on the part of the Cimbri there was some loss of time and delay;", "3079": "but the Teutones and Ambrones set out forth­ with, and speedily traversing the space which separated them from the Romans, they made their appearance in numbers countless, hideous in aspect, and in language and the cries they uttered unlike any other people.", "3080": "They covered a large part of the plain, where they pitched their tents and challenged Marius to battle.XVL Marius cared not for all this, but he kept his soldiers within their entrenchments and severely rebuked those who made a display of their courage, calling such as through passion were eager to break out and fight, traitors to their country;", "3081": "he said it was not triumphs or trophies which should now be the object of their ambition, but how they should ward off so great a cloud and tempest of war, and secure the safety of Italy.", "3082": "This was the way in which he addressed the commanders in particular and the officers.", "3083": "The soldiers he used to station on the rampart in turns, and bid them look at the enemy, and thus he accustomed them to the aspect of the barbarians and their strange and savage shouts, and to make themselves acquainted with their armour and movements, so that in course of time what appeared formidable to their imagination would become familiar by being often seen.", "3084": "For it was the opinion of Marius that mere strangeness adds many imaginary dangers to real danger;", "3085": "but that through familiarity even real dangers lose their terrors.", "3086": "Now the daily sight of the enemy not only took away somewhat of the first alarm, but the threats of the barbarians and their intolerable arrogance roused the courage of the Roman soldiers and inflamed their passions, for the enemy plundered and devastated all the country around, and often attacked the ramparts with much insolence and temerity, so that the words and indignant expressions of the soldiers were repeated to Marius.", "3087": "The soldiers asked, \" If Marius had discovered any cowardice in them, that he kept them from battle, like women under lock and key ?", "3088": "Why should we not, like free men, ask him whether he is waiting for others to fight for Italy, and intends to employ us always as labourers when there may be occasion to dig canals, to clear out mud, and to divert the course of rivers ?", "3089": "It was for this, as it seems, that he disciplined us in so many toils;", "3090": "and these are the exploits of his consulship, which he will exhibit to the citizens when he returns to Rome.", "3091": "Does he fear the fate of Carbo and Cæpio, who were defeated by the enemy ?", "3092": "But they were far inferior to Marius in reputation and merit, and they were at the head of much inferior armies.", "3093": "And it is better to do some­ thing, even if we perish like them, than to Bit here and see the lands of our allies plundered.", "3094": "\"", "3095": "XVII.", "3096": "Marius, who was pleased to hear such expressions as these, pacified the soldiers by saying that he did not distrust them, but was waiting for the time and the place of victory pursuant to certain oracles.", "3097": "And in fact he carried about with him in a litter, with great tokens of respect, a Syrian woman named Martha,* who was said to possess the gift of divination, and he sacrificed pursuant to her directions.", "3098": "This woman had formerly applied to the Senate, and offered to foretell future events, but her proposal was rejected.", "3099": "Having got access to the women, she allowed them to make trial of her skill;", "3100": "and especially on one occasion, when she sat at the feet of the wife of Marius, she was successful in foretelling what gladiators would win, and this led to her being sent to Marius, who was much struck with her skill.", "3101": "She generally accompanied the army in a litter, and assisted at the sacrifices in a double purple robe fastened with a clasp, and carrying a spear wreathed with ribands and chaplets.", "3102": "This exhibition made many doubt whether Marius produced the woman in public because he really believed in her, or whether he merely pretended to do so, and played a part in the matter.", "3103": "But the affair of the vultures, which Alexander * of Myndus has related, is certainly wonderful.", "3104": "Two vul­ tures were always seen hovering about the army before a victory, and accompanying it;", "3105": "they were known by brass rings round their necks, for the soldiers had caught the birds, and after putting on the rings had let them go.", "3106": "Ever after this time as the soldiers recognised the birds, they saluted them;", "3107": "and whenever the birds appeared on the occasion of the army moving, the soldiers re­ joiced, as they were confident of success.", "3108": "Though there were many signs about this time, all of them were of an ordinary kind, except what was reported from Ameria and Tuder, two towns of Italy, where at night there was the appearance in the heavens of fiery spears and shields, which at first moved about in various directions, and then closed together, exhibiting the attitudes and movements of men in battle;", "3109": "at last part gave way, and the rest pressed on in pursuit, and all moved away to the west.", "3110": "It happened that about the same time Batakes, the priest of the Great Mother, came from Pessinus,t and reported that the goddess from her shrine had declared to him that victory and the advantage in war would be on the side of the Romans.", "3111": "The Senate accepted the announcement and voted a temple to be built to the goddess in com­ memoration of the anticipated victory;", "3112": "but when Batakes presented himself to the popular assembly with the inten­ tion of making the same report there, Aulus Pompeius, one of the tribunes, stopped him, calling him an impostor, and contumeliously driving him from the Rostra ;", "3113": "which however contributed to gain most credit for the man's assertions.", "3114": "For on the separation of the assembly, Aulus had no sooner returned to his house than he was seized with so violent a fever that he died within seven days;", "3115": "and the matter was notorious all through Rome and the subject of much talk.", "3116": "XVIII.", "3117": "Now Marius keeping quiet, the Tentones at­ tempted to storm his camp, but as many of them were struck by the missiles from the rampart and some lost their lives, they resolved to march forward with the expecta­ tion of safely crossing the Alps.", "3118": "Accordingly taking their baggage, they passed by the Roman camp.", "3119": "Then indeed some notion could be formed of their numbers by the length of their line and the time which they took to march by;", "3120": "for it is said that they continued to move past the encampment of Marius for six days without inter­ ruption.", "3121": "As they passed along, they asked the Romans with a laugh, if they had any message to send to their wives, for they should soon be with them.", "3122": "When the barbarians had marched by and advanced some distance, Marius also broke up his camp and followed close after them, always halting near the enemy, but carefully fortifying his camp and making his position strong in front, so that he could pass the night in safety.", "3123": "Thus advancing, the two armies came to the Aquae Sextiæ,* from which a short march would bring them into the region of the Alps.", "3124": "Accordingly Marius prepared for battle here, and he selected a position which was strong enough, but ill-supplied with water, with a view, as it is said, of thereby exciting his soldiers to come to an engage­ ment.", "3125": "However this may be, when some of them were complaining and saying they should suffer from thirst, he pointed to a stream which ran near the barbarian camp, and said they might get drink from there, but the price was blood.", "3126": "Why then, they replied, don't you forthwith lead us against the enemy, while our blood is still moist ?", "3127": "Marius calmly replied, “ We must first secure our camp.", "3128": "\"XIX.", "3129": "The soldiers obeyed unwillingly.", "3130": "In the mean­ time the camp servants, having no water for themselves or their beasts, went down in a body to the river, some with axes and hatchets, and others taking swords and spears, together with their pitchers, resolving to have water, even if they fought for it.", "3131": "At first-a few only of the enemy engaged with them, for the main body of the army were eating after bathing, and some were still bathing.", "3132": "For a spring of warm water bursts from the ground here, and the Romans surprised some of the bar­ barians who were enjoying themselves and making merry in this pleasant place.", "3133": "The shouts brought more of the barbarians to the spot, and Marius had great difficulty in checking his men any longer, as they were afraid they should lose their slaves, and the bravest part of the enemy, who had formerly defeated the Romans under Manlius and Cæpio (these were the Ambrones, who were above thirty thousand in number), had sprung up and were running to their arms, Though full of food and excited and inflamed with wine, they did not advance in disorderly or frantic haste, nor utter confused shouts, but striking their arms to a certain measure, and advancing all in regular line, they often called out their name Ambrones, either to encourage one another or to terrify the Romans by this announcement.", "3134": "The Ligurians,* who were the first of the Italic people to go down to battle with them, hearing their shouts, and understanding what they said, responded by calling out their old national name, which was the same, for the Ligurians also call themselves Ambrones when they refer to their origin.", "3135": "Thus the shouts were continual on both sides before they came to close quarters, and as the respective commanders joined in the shouts, and at first vied with one another which should call out loudest, the cries stimulated and roused the courage of the men.", "3136": "Now the Ambrones were sepa­ rated by the stream, for they could not all cross and get into order of battle before the Ligurians, who advanced at a run, fell on the first ranks and began the battle ;", "3137": "and the Romans coming up to support the Ligurians, and rush­ ing on the barbarians from higher ground, broke their ranks and put them to flight.", "3138": "Most of the Ambrones were cut down in the stream, where they were crowded upon one another, and the river.", "3139": "was filled with blood and dead bodies;", "3140": "and those who made their way across, not venturing to face about, were smitten by the Romans till they reached their camp and the waggons in their flight.", "3141": "There the women meeting them with swords and axes, with horrid furious yells, attempted to drive back both the fugitives and their pursuers, the fugitives as traitors and the pursuers as their enemies, mingling among the combatants, and with their bare hands tearing from the Romans their shields, laying hold of their swords, and enduring wounds and gashes till they fell, in spirit unvanquished.", "3142": "In this manner, it is said that the battle on the river was brought about rather from accident than any design on the part of the commander.", "3143": "XX.", "3144": "After destroying many of the Ambrones, the Ro­ mans retreated and night came on;", "3145": "yet this great success was not followed, as is usual on such occasions, by pæans of victory, and drinking in the tents, and merriment over supper, and what is sweetest of all to men who have won a victory, gentle sleep, but the Romans spent that night of all others in fear and alarm.", "3146": "For their camp had nei­ ther palisade nor rampart, and there were still left many thousands of the enemy, and all night long they heard the lamentation of the Ambrones who had escaped and joined the rest of the barbarians, and it was not like the weeping and groaning of men, but a howl resembling that of wild beasts;", "3147": "and a bellowing mingled with threats and cries of sorrow proceeding from such mighty numbers, re-echoed from the surrounding mountains and the banks of the river.", "3148": "A frightful noise filled the whole plain, and the Romans were alarmed, and even Marius himself was dis­ turbed, expecting a disorderly and confused battle in the night.", "3149": "However, the enemy made no attack either on that night or the following day, but they were occupied in arranging their forces and making preparations.", "3150": "In the meantime, as the position of the enemy was backed by sloping hills and deep ravines shaded with trees, Marius sent there Claudius Marcellus, with three thousand heavy- armed soldiers, with instructions to lie concealed in ambush, and to appear on the rear of the barbarians when the battle was begun.", "3151": "The rest of the army, who supped in good time and got a night's rest, he drew up at daybreak in front of the camp, and ordered the cavalry to advance into the plain.", "3152": "The Teutones, observing this, would not wait for the Romans to come down and fight with them on fair ground, but with all speed and in passion they took to their arms and advanced up the hill.", "3153": "Marius sent his officers to every part of the army, with orders to the soldiers to stand firm in their ranks till the enemy came within the reach of their spears, which they were to discharge, and then to draw their swords, and drive against the bar­ barians with their shields;", "3154": "for as the ground was unfavour­ able to the enemy, their blows would have no force, and their line no strength, owing to the unevenness of the surface, which would render their footing unstable and wavering.", "3155": "The advice which he gave to his soldiers he showed that he was the first to put in practice;", "3156": "for in all martial training Marius was inferior to none, and in courage he left all far behind him.", "3157": "XXI.", "3158": "The Romans accordingly awaiting the enemy's attack, and coming to close quarters with them, checked their advance up the hill, and the barbarians, being hard pressed, gradually retreated to the plain, and while those in the van were rallying on the level ground, there was a shout and confusion in the rear.", "3159": "For Marcellus had not let the critical moment pass by, but when the shouts rose above the hills, bidding his men spring from their ambush at a rapid pace and with loud shouts he fell on the enemy's rear and began to cut them down.", "3160": "Those in the rear communicating the alarm to those in front of them, put the whole army into confusion, and after sustaining this double attack for no long time, they broke their ranks and fled.", "3161": "In the pursuit the Romans took prisoners and killed to the number of above one hundred thousand :", "3162": "* they also took their tents, waggons, and property, all which, with the exception of what was pilfered, was given to Marius, by the unanimous voice of the soldiers.", "3163": "But though he received so magnificent a present, it was thought that he got nothing at all proportioned to his services, considering the magnitude of the danger.", "3164": "Some authorities do not agree with the statement as to the gift of the spoil, nor yet about the number of the slain.", "3165": "However, they say that the people of Massalia* made fences round their vine­ yards with the bones, and that the soil, after the bodies had rotted and the winter rains had fallen, was so ferti­ lised and saturated with the putrefied matter which sank down into it, that it produced a most unusual crop in the next season, and so confirmed the opinion of Archilochust that the land is fattened by human bodies.", "3166": "They say that extraordinary rains generally follow great battles, whether it is that some divine power purifies the ground, and drenches it with waters from heaven, or that the blood and putrefaction send up a moist and heavy vapour which con­ denses the atmosphere, which is lightly moved and readily changed to the greatest degree from the smallest cause.", "3167": "XXII.", "3168": "After the battle, Marius caused to be collected the arms and spoils of the barbarians which were con­ spicuous for ornament, and unbroken, and suited to make a show in his triumphal procession :", "3169": "all the rest he piled up in a great heap, for the celebration of a splendid religious festival.", "3170": "The soldiers were already standing by in their armour, with chaplets on their heads, and Marius having put on the robe with the purple border, and fastened it up about him in the Roman fashion, had taken a burning torch, and holding it up to heaven with both his hands, was going to set fire t to the heap, when some friends were seen riding quickly towards him, which caused a deep silence and general expectation.", "3171": "When the horsemen were near, they leaped down and greeted Marius with the news that he was elected consul for the fifth time, and they delivered him letters to this effect.", "3172": "This cause of great rejoicing being added to the celebra­ tion of the victory, the army transported with delight sent forth one universal shout, accompanied with the noise and clatter of their arms, and the officers crowned Marius afresh with a wreath of bay, on which he set fire to the heap, and completed the ceremony.", "3173": "XXIII.", "3174": "But that power which permits no great good fortune to give a pleasure untempered and pure, and diversifies human life with a mixture of evil and of good -be it Fortune * or Nemesis, or the necessary nature of things-in a few days brought to Marius intelligence about his companion in command, Catulus, involving Rome again in alarm and tempest, like a cloud which overcasts a clear and serene sky.", "3175": "For Catulus, whose commission was to oppose the Cimbri, determined to give up the defence of the passes of the Alps, for fear that he might weaken his force if he were obliged to divide it too much.", "3176": "Accordingly he forthwith descended into the plains of Italy, and placing the river Atiso t (Adige) in his front, strongly fortified a position on each side of the river, to hinder the enemy from crossing it;", "3177": "and he also threw a bridge over the river, in order that he might be enabled to support those on the farther side, if the bar­ barians should make their way through the passes and attack the forts.", "3178": "The enemy had so much contempt for the Romans and such confidence, that, with the view rather of displaying their strength and courage than because it was necessary, they endured the snow-storms without any covering, and made their way through the snow and ice to the summits of the mountains, when, placing their broad shields under them, they slid down the slippery precipices over the huge rocks.", "3179": "When they had encamped near the river, and examined the ford, they began to dam up the stream, and tearing up the neigh­ bouring hills, like the giants of old, they carried whole trees with their roots, fragments of rock, and mounds of earth into the river, and stopped its course ;", "3180": "they also let heavy weights float down the stream, which drove against the piles that supported the bridge and shook it by the violence of the blows;", "3181": "all which so terrified the Romans, that most of them deserted the large encampment and took to flight.", "3182": "Then Catulus, like a good and perfect general, showed that he valued the reputation of his countrymen more than his own.", "3183": "Not being able to induce his soldiers to stand, and seeing that they were making off in alarm, he ordered the eagle * to be moved, and running to those who were first in the retreat, he put himself at their head, wishing the disgrace to fall on himself and not on his country, and that the army should not appear to be flying, but to be following their general in his retreat.", "3184": "The barbarians attacked and took the fort on the farther side of the Atiso, though the Roman soldiers defended it with the utmost bravery and in a manner worthy of their country.", "3185": "Admiring their courage, the barbarians let them go on conditions which were sworn to upon the brazen bull, which was taken after the battle, and, it is said, was conveyed to the house of Catulus as the first spoils of the victory.", "3186": "The country being now undefended, the barbarians scoured it in every direction and laid it waste.", "3187": "XXIV.", "3188": "After this Marius was called to Rome.", "3189": "On his arrival it was generally expected that he would celebrate his triumph, and the Senate had without any hesitation voted him one ;", "3190": "but he refused it, either because he did not wish to deprive his soldiers and his companions in arms of the honour that was due to them, or because he wished to give the people confidence in the present emer­ gency by intrusting to the Fortune of the State the glory of his first victory, with the confident hope that she would return it to him ennobled by a second.", "3191": "Having said what was suitable to the occasion, he set out to join Catulus, whom he encouraged, and at the same time he summoned his soldiers from Gaul.", "3192": "On the arrival of the troops, Marius crossed the Eridanus (Po), and endeavoured to keep the barbarians from that part of Italy which lay south of the river.", "3193": "The Cimbri declined a battle, because, as they said, they were waiting for the Teutones, and wondered they were so long in coming;", "3194": "but it is doubt­ ful whether they were still really ignorant of their destruction or merely pretended not to believe it.", "3195": "How­ ever, they handled most cruelly those who brought the report of the defeat;", "3196": "and they sent to Marius to demand land for themselves and their brethren, and a sufficient number of cities for their abode.", "3197": "On Marius asking the ambassadors of the Cimbri whom they meant by their brethren, and being told they were the Teutones, all the Romans who were present burst out in a laugh, but Marius, with a sneer, replied, \" Don't trouble yourself about your brethren:", "3198": "they have land, and they shall have it for ever, for we have given it to them.\"", "3199": "The ambas­ sadors, who understood his irony, fell to abusing him, and threatened that the Cimbri would forthwith have their revenge, and the Teutones too, as soon as they should arrive. \"", "3200": "They are here already,\" said Marius ;", "3201": "\" and it won't be right for you to go before you have embraced your brethren.\"", "3202": "Saying this he ordered the kings of the Teutones to be produced in their chains;", "3203": "for they were taken in the Alps in their flight by the Sequani.*XXV.", "3204": "On this being reported to the Cimbri, they forthwith advanced against Marius, who however kept quiet and remained in his camp.", "3205": "It is said that it was on the occasion of this engagement that Marius introduced the alteration in the spears..", "3206": "Before this time that part of the wooden shaft which was let into the iron was fastened with two iron nails;", "3207": "Marius kept one of the nails as it was, but he had the other taken out and a wooden peg, which would be easily broken, put in its place;", "3208": "the design being that the spear when it had struck the enemy's shield should not remain straight, for when the wooden nail broke, the iron head would bend, and the spear, owing to the twist in the metal part, would still hold to the shield, and so drag along the ground.", "3209": "Now Boeorix, the king of the Cimbri, with a very few men about him, riding up to the camp, challenged Marius to fix a day and place, and to come out and settle the claim to the country by a battle.", "3210": "Marius replied, that the Romans never took advice of their enemies as to fighting;", "3211": "however, he would gratify the Cimbri in this matter, and accordingly they agreed on the third day from the present, and the battle-field was to be the plain of Vercellæ,† which was suited for the Roman cavalry, and would give the Cimbri full room for their numbers.", "3212": "When the appointed day came, the Romans prepared for battle with the enemy.", "3213": "Catulust had twenty-two thou­ sand three hundred men, and Marius thirty-two thousand, which were distributed on each flank of Catulus, who occupied the centre, as Bulla § has recorded, who was in the battle.", "3214": "Bulla also says, that Marina expected that the line would be engaged chiefly at the extremities and on the wings, and with the view of appropriating the victory to his own soldiers, and that Catulus might have no part in the contest, and not come to close quarters with the enemy, he took advantage of the hollow front of the centre, which usually results when the line is extended, and accordingly divided and placed his forces as already stated.", "3215": "Some writers say that Catulus himself also made a statement to the like effect, in his apology about the battle, and accused Marius of want of good faith to him.", "3216": "The infantry of the Cimbri marched slowly from their fortified posts in a square, each side of which was thirty stadia:", "3217": "the cavalry, fifteen thousand in number, advanced in splendid style, wearing helmets which resembled in form the open mouths of frightful beasts and strange- shaped heads, surmounted by lofty crests of feathers, which made them appear taller;", "3218": "they had also breastplates of iron and white glittering shields.", "3219": "Their practice was to discharge two darts,* and then closing with the enemy, to use their large heavy swords.", "3220": "XXVI.", "3221": "On this occasion the enemy's cavalry did not advance straight against the Romans, but deviating to the right they attempted to draw the Romans little by little in that direction, with the view of attacking them when they had got them between themselves and their infantry, which was on the left.", "3222": "The Roman generals perceived the manoeuvre, but they could not stop their soldiers, for there was a cry from some one that the enemy was flying, and immediately the whole army rushed to the pursuit.", "3223": "In the meantime the barbarian infantry advanced like a huge sea in motion.", "3224": "Then Marius, washing his hands and rais­ ing them to heaven, vowed a hecatomb to the gods;", "3225": "and Catulus also in like manner raising his hands, vowed to consecrate t the fortune of that day.", "3226": "It is said that when Marius had sacrificed and had inspected the victims, he cried out with a loud voice, \" Mine is the Victory.\"", "3227": "When the attack had commenced, an incident happened to Marius which may be considered as a divine retribution, as Sulla says.", "3228": "An immense cloud of dust being raised, as was natural, and having covered the two armies, it happened that Marius, rushing to the pursuit with his men after him, missed the enemy, and being carried beyond their line, was for some time in the plain without knowing where he was;", "3229": "but it happened that the bar­ barians closed with Catulus, and the struggle was with him and his soldiers chiefly, among whom Bulla says that :", "3230": "he himself fought:", "3231": "he adds, that the heat aided the Romans, and the sun, which shone full in the face of the Cimbri.", "3232": "For the barbarians were well inured to cold, having been brought up in forests, as already observed, and a cool country, but they were unnerved with the heat, which made them sweat violently and breathe hard, and put their shields before their faces, for the battle took place after the summer solstice, and, according to the Roman reckoning, three days before the new moon of the month now called Augustus,* but then Sextilis.", "3233": "The dust also which covered their enemies helped to encourage the Romans;", "3234": "for they did not see their number at a dis­ tance, but running forward they engaged severally man to man with the enemy, without having been alarmed by the sight of them.", "3235": "And so well were the bodies of the Romans inured to toil and exertion, that not one of them was seen to sweat or pant, though the heat was excessive and they came to the shock of battle running at full speed, as Catulus is said to have reported to the honour of his soldiers.", "3236": "XXVII.", "3237": "Now the greater part of the enemy and their best soldiers were cut to pieces in their ranks, for in order to prevent the line from being broken the soldiers of the first rank were fastened together by long chains which were passed through their belts.", "3238": "The fugitives were driven back to their encampments, when a most tragic scene was exhibited.", "3239": "The women standing on the waggons clothed in black massacred the fugitives, some their husbands, and others their brothers and fathers, and then strangling their infants they threw them under the wheels and the feet of the beasts of burden, and killed themselves.", "3240": "It is said that one woman hung herself from the end of the pole of a waggon with her children fastened to her feet by cords;", "3241": "and that the men, not finding any trees near, tied themselves to the horns of the oxen and some to their feet, and then goading the animals to make them plunge about, were dragged and trampled till they died.", "3242": "But though so many perished in this manner, above sixty thousand were taken prisoners, and the number of those who fell was said to be twice as many.", "3243": "Now all the valuable property became the booty of the soldiers of Marius, but the military spoils and standards and trumpets, it is said, were carried to the tent of Catulus;", "3244": "and Catulus relied chiefly on this as a proof that the victory was gained by his men.", "3245": "A dispute having arisen among the soldiers, as might be expected, some ambassadors from Parma * who were present were chosen to act as arbitrators, and the soldiers of Catulus leading them among the dead bodies of the enemy, pointed out that the barbarians were pierced by their spears, which were recognised by the marks on them, for Catulus had taken care to have his name cut on the shafts.", "3246": "Not­ withstanding this, the whole credit was given to Marius, both on account of the previous victory and his superior rank.t", "3247": "And what was most of all, the people gave him the title of the third founder ‡ of Rome, considering that the danger which he had averted was not less than that of the Gallic invasion, and in their rejoicings with their wives and children at home they coupled Marius with the gods in the religious ceremonies that preceded the banquet and in their libations, and they thought that he alone ought to celebrate both triumphs.", "3248": "Marius, however, did not triumph alone, but Catulus shared the honour, for Marius wished to show that he was not elated by his victories:", "3249": "there was another reason also;", "3250": "he was afraid of the soldiers, who were prepared not to let Marius triumph, if Catulus were deprived of the honour.", "3251": "XXVIII.", "3252": "Though Marius was now discharging his fifth consulship, he was more anxious to obtain a sixth than others are about the first;", "3253": "and he endeavoured to gain favour by courting the people and giving way to the many in order to please them, wherein he went further than was consistent with the state and dignity of the office, and further than suited his own temper, for he wished to show himself very compliant and a man of the people, when in fact his character was altogether different.", "3254": "Now it is said that in all civil matters and amid the noise of the popular assemblies Marius was entirely devoid of courage, which arose from his excessive love of applause;", "3255": "and the undaunted spirit and firmness which he showed in battle failed him before the people, where he was disconcerted by the most ordinary expressions of praise or censure.", "3256": "However, the following story is told of him:", "3257": "Marius had presented with the citizenship a thousand of the people of Camerinum, who had particularly distinguished themselves in the war;", "3258": "this was considered to be an illegal proceeding, and being charged with it by several persons in public, he replied that he could not hear the law for the din of arms.", "3259": "Still it is well known that he was discomposed and alarmed by the shouts in the popular assemblies.", "3260": "In military matters, it is true, he received great deference and had much influence, because his services were wanted;", "3261": "but in civil business he was cut off from attain­ ing the first distinction, and accordingly there was nothing left for him but to gain the affection and favour of the many;", "3262": "and in order to become the first man at Rome, he sacrificed all claim to be considered the best.", "3263": "The con­ sequence was, that he was at variance with all the aris­ tocratical party, but he feared Metellus most, who had experienced his ingratitude, and, as a man of sterling worth, was the natural enemy of those who attempted to insinuate themselves into the popular favour by dishonour­ able means, and who had no other object than to flatter the people.", "3264": "Accordingly Marius formed a design to eject Mctellus from the city;", "3265": "and for this purpose he allied himself with Glaucia and Saturninus,* who were daring men, and had at their command a rabble of needy and noisy fellows, and he made them his tools in introducing his measures.", "3266": "He also stirred up the soldiers, and by mixing them with the people in the assemblies he over­ powered Metellus with his faction.", "3267": "Rutilius, † who is a lover of truth and an honest man, though he was a personal enemy of Marius, relates in his history, that by giving large sums of money to the tribes and buying their votes Marius kept Metellus out, and that Valerius Flaccus was rather the servant than the colleague of Marius in his sixth consulship.", "3268": "However, the people, never conferred the office of consul so often on any man except Corvinus Valerius;", "3269": "t though it is said that forty-five years elapsed between the first and last consulship of Corvinus, while Marius after his first consulship enjoyed the remaining five in uninterrupted succession.", "3270": "XXIX.", "3271": "It was in his last consulship that Marius got most odium, from his participating in many of the violent measures of Saturninus.", "3272": "One of them was the assassi­ nation of Nonius,* whom Saturninus murdered because he was a rival candidate for the tribuneship.", "3273": "Saturninus, being made a tribune, introduced a measure about the land, to which t was added a clause that the Senate should come forward and swear that they would abide by what ever the people should vote, and would make no opposi.", "3274": "tion.", "3275": "In the Senate Marius made a show of opposing this clause in the proposed law, and he said that he would not take the oath, nor did he think that any man in his senses would, for if the law was not a bad one, it was an insult for the Senate to be compelled to make such concession, instead of giving their consent voluntarily.", "3276": "What he said, however, was not his real mind, but his object was to involve Metellus in a difficulty which he could not evade.", "3277": "For Marius, who considered falsehood to be a part of virtue and skill, had no intention to observe what he had promised to the Senate;", "3278": "but as he knew that Metellus was a man of his word, and considered truth, as Pindar calls it, the foundation of great virtue, he wished to entrap Metellus into a refusal before the Senate, and as he would consequently decline taking the oath, he designed in this way to make him odious to the people for ever:", "3279": "and it fell out so.", "3280": "Upon Metellus declaring that he would never take the oath, the Senate separated;", "3281": "but a few days after, Saturninus summoned the Senators to the Rostra, and urged them to take the oath.", "3282": "When Marius came forward there was profound silence, and all eyes were turned upon him to see what he would do.", "3283": "Marius, however, forgetting all his bold expres­ sions before the Senate, said his neck was not broad enough for him to be the first to give his opinion on so weighty a matter all at once, and that he would take the oath and obey the law, if it was a law;", "3284": "which condition he cunningly added as a cloak to his shame.", "3285": "The people, delighted at Marius taking the oath, clapped their hands and applauded, but the nobility were much dejected and hated Marius for his tergiversation.", "3286": "However, all the senators took the oath in order, through fear of the people, till it came to the turn of Metellus, and though his friends urged and entreated him to take the oath and so to avoid the severe penalties which the law of Saturninus enacted against those who refused, he would not swerve from his purpose or take the oath, but adhering firmly to his principles and prepared to submit to any penalty rather than do a mean thing, he left the Forum, saying to those about him, that to do a wrong thing was mean, to act honourably when there was no danger was in any man's power, but that it was the characteristic of a good man to do what was right, even when it was accompanied with risk.", "3287": "Upon th:", "3288": "s Saturninus put it to the vote that the consuls should proclaim Metellus to be excluded from fire,. water, and house;", "3289": "and the most worthless part of the populace was ready to put him to death.", "3290": "Now all the men of honourable feeling, sympathising with Metellus, crowded round him, but Metellus would not allow any commotion to be raised on his account, and he quitted the city like a wise and prudent man, saying, “ Either matters will mend and the people will change their minds, when I shall be invited to return, or if things stay as they are, it is best to be out of the way.\"", "3291": "What testimonies of affection and respect Metellus received in his exile, and how he spent his time at Rhodes in philosophical studies, will be better told in his Life.", "3292": "XXX.", "3293": "Now Marius did not perceive what incurable mischief he had done, for in return for the services of Saturninus t he was obliged to wink at his audacious and violent measures, and to remain quiet while Saturninus was evidently aiming at the supreme power and the subversion of the constitution by force of arms and blood­ shed.", "3294": "Between his fear of the disapprobation of the nobles and his wish to retain the favour of the people, Marius was reduced to an act of extreme meanness and duplicity.", "3295": "The first men in the State came to him by night and urged him to act against Saturninus, whom Marius, however, received by another door without their knowledge;", "3296": "and pretending to both parties that he was troubled with a looseness, he went backwards and forwards in the house between the nobles and Saturninus, running first to one and then to the other, and endeavouring to rouse and irritate them mutually.", "3297": "However, when the Senate and the Equites began to combine and express their in­ dignation, he drew out the soldiers into the Forum, and driving the party of Saturninus to the Capitol, he com­ pelted them to submit for fear of dying of thirst, by cutting off the pipes that supplied them with water.", "3298": "The partisans of Saturninus in despair called out to Marius and surrendered on the Public Faith, as the Romans term it.", "3299": "Marius did all he could to save their lives, but without effect, for as soon as they came down to the Forum they were massacred.", "3300": "These events made him odious both to the nobles and the people, and when the time for electing censors came, contrary to all expectation he did not offer himself as a candidate, but allowed men of inferior rank to be elected, fearing he might be rejected.", "3301": "He, however, alleged as an excuse, though it was not true, that he did not wish to make himself many enemies by a rigid scrutiny into their lives and morals.", "3302": "XXXI.", "3303": "A measure being proposed for recalling Me* tellus from exile, Marius did all he could to stop it toth by word and deed, but finding his opposition useless, he at last desisted.", "3304": "The people received the proposed measure well, and Marius, who could not endure to see the return of Metellus, set sail for Cappadocia and Galatia, pre­ tending that he wished to make the sacrifices he had vowed to the Great Mother, but in reality having quite a different object in view, which the people never sus­ pected.", "3305": "Marius was naturally ill suited for times of peace and for taking a part in civil affairs, as he had attained his position merely by arms, and now thinking that he was gradually losing his influence and reputation by doing nothing and remaining quiet, he looked out for an oppor­ tunity of again being actively employed.", "3306": "He hoped to be able to stir up the kings of Asia and to rouse and stimu­ late Mithridates,t who was supposed to be ready to go to war, in which case he expected to be appointed to take the command against him, and so to fill the city with new triumphs, and his house with Pontic spoils and the wealth of the king.", "3307": "Accordingly, though Mithridates paid him all attention and honour, Marius could not be bent from his purpose or induced to give way :", "3308": "his only answer was, “ King, either try to conquer the Romans or obey their orders in silence ;", "3309": "” an expression which startled the king;", "3310": "who had often heard the language of the Romans, but then for the first time heard their bold speech.", "3311": "XXXII.", "3312": "On his return to Rome he built a house near the Forum, either, as he gave out, because he did not wish those who paid their respects to him to have the trouble of coming a great distance, or because he thought the distance was the reason why a greater number of persons did not visit his door than that of other persons.", "3313": "The reason, however, was not this ;", "3314": "but as Marius was inferior to others in affability of manners and political usefulness, he was neglected, just like an instrument of war in time of peace.", "3315": "As for others, he cared less for their superior popularity, but he was grievously annoyed at Sulla, who had risen to power through the dislike which the nobles bore to Marius, and who made his quarrels with Marius the foundation of his political conduct.", "3316": "But when Bocchus, the Numidian, on receiving the title of ‛ Ally of the Romans,' erected in the Capitol Victories bearing trophies, and by the side of them placed gilded figures representing Jugartha surrendered by him to Bulla, Marius was trans­ ported with passion and jealousy at Sulla thus appropriat­ ing to himself all the credit of this affair, and he was making ready forcibly to throw down the figures.", "3317": "Sulla prepared to oppose him, and a civil commotion was just on the point of breaking out, when it was stopped by the Social- war, which suddenly burst upon the State.", "3318": "In this war the most warlike and populous of the Italian nations combined against Rome, and came very near to overthrowing her supremacy, for they were not only well provided with munitions of war and hardy soldiers, but they had commanders who displayed admirable courage and skill, which made them a match for the Romans.", "3319": "XXXIII.", "3320": "This war, which was diversified by many reverses and a great variety of fortune, took from Marius as much reputation and influence as it gave to Sulla.", "3321": "For Marius appeared slow in his plans, and on all occasions rather over-cautious and tardy;", "3322": "whether it was that age.", "3323": "had quenched his wonted vigour and fire, for he was now in his sixty-sixth year, or, as he alleged himself, his nerves were diseased and his body was incapable of supporting fatigue, and yet from a feeling of honour he endured the hardships of the campaign beyond his powers.", "3324": "Not­ withstanding this he won a great battle, in which he slaughtered six thousand of the enemy, and he never allowed them the opportunity of getting any advantage, but when he was intrenched in his camp he submitted to be insulted by them and was never irritated by any challenge to give them battle.", "3325": "It is recorded that Publius Silo,.", "3326": "who had the highest reputation and influence of any man on the side of the enemy, addressed him to this effect:", "3327": "\" If you are a great general, Marius, come down and fight;", "3328": "\" to which Marius replied, \" Nay, do you, if you are a great general, compel me to fight against my will.\"", "3329": "And again, on another occasion when the enemy presented a favourable opportunity for attacking them, but the Romans lacked courage, and both sides retired, he summoned his soldiers together, and said, “ I don't know whether to call the enemy or you greater cowards;", "3330": "for they could not see your back, nor you their nape.\"", "3331": "At last, however, he gave up the command, on the ground that his weakness rendered him unable to endure the fatigue of the campaign.", "3332": "XXXIV.", "3333": "The Italians had now given in, and many persons at Rome were intriguing for the command in the Mithridatic war with the assistance of the demagogues;", "3334": "but, contrary to all expectation, the tribune Sulpicius,t a most audacious fellow, brought forward Marius and proposed him as proconsul with power to prosecute the war against Mithridates.", "3335": "The people indeed were divided, some being for Marius and others in favour of Sulla;", "3336": "and they bade Marius go to the warm baths of Baiæ * and look after his health, inasmuch as he was worn out with old age and defluxions, as he admitted himself.", "3337": "Marius had in the neighbourhood of Misenum a sumptuous house, furnished with luxuries and accommodation too delicately for a man who had served in so many wars and campaigns.", "3338": "It is said that Cornelia bought this house for seventy-five thousand |;", "3339": "and that no long time after it was purchased by Lucius Lucullus for two millions five hundred thousand;", "3340": "so quickly did extravagant expenditure spring up and so great was the increase of luxury.", "3341": "But Marius, moved thereto by boyish emulation, throwing off his old age and his infirmities, went daily to the Campus Martius, where he took his exercises with the young men, and showed that he was still active in arms and sat firm in all the movements of horsemanship, though he was not of a compact form in his old age, but very fat and heavy.", "3342": "Some were pleased at his being thus occupied, and they came down to the Campus to see and admire his emulation and his exercises ;", "3343": "but the wiser part lamented to witness his greediness after gain and distinction, and they pitied a man who, having risen from poverty to enormous wealth, and to the highest station from a low degree, knew not when to put bounds to his good fortune, and was not satisfied with being an object of admiration and quietly enjoying what he had, but as if he was in want of every­ thing, after his triumphs and his honours was setting out to Cappadocia and the Euxine to oppose himself in his old age to Archelaus and Neoptolemus, the satraps of Mithridates.", "3344": "The reasons which Marius alleged against all this in justification of himself appeared ridiculous;", "3345": "he said that he wished to serve in the campaign in order to teach his son military discipline.", "3346": "XXXV.", "3347": "The disease that had long been rankling in the State at last broke out, when Marius had found in the audacity of Sulpicius * a most suitable instrument to effect the public ruin;", "3348": "for Sulpicius admired and emulated Saturninus in everything, except that he charged him with timidity and want of promptitude in his measures.", "3349": "But there was no lack of promptitude on the part of Sulpicius, who kept six hundred of the Equestrian class about him as a kind of body-guard and called them an Opposition Senate.", "3350": "He also attacked with a body of armed men the consuls while they were holding a public meeting;", "3351": "one of the consuls made his escape from the Forum, but Sulpicius seized his son and butchered him.", "3352": "Sulla, the other consul, being pursued, made his escape into the house of Marius, where nobody would have expected him to go, and thus avoided his pursuers who ran past;", "3353": "and it is said that he was let out in safety by Marius by another door and so got to the camp.", "3354": "But Sulla in his Memoirs says that he did not fly for refuge to Marius, but with­ drew there to consult with him about the matters which Sulpicius was attempting to make him assent to against his will by surrounding him with bare swords and driving him on towards the house of Marius, and that finally he went from the house of Marius to the Rostra, and removed, as they required him to do, the Justitium.", "3355": "This being accomplished, Sulpicius, who had now gained a victory, got the command conferred on Marius by the votes of the assembly, and Marius, who was prepared to set out, sent two tribunes to receive the army of Bulla.", "3356": "But Bulla encouraging his soldiers, who were thirty-five thousand men well armed, led them to Rome.", "3357": "The soldiers fell on the tribunes whom Marius had sent, and murdered them.", "3358": "Marius also put to death many of the friends of Bulla in Rome, and proclaimed freedom to the slaves * if they would join him;", "3359": "but it is said that only three slaves accepted the offer.", "3360": "He made but a feeble resistance to Bulla on his entering the city, and was soon compelled to fly.", "3361": "On quitting Rome he was separated from his partisans, owing to its being dark, and he fled to Solonium,† one of his farms.", "3362": "He sent his son Marius t to get provisions from the estates of his father-in-law Mucius, which were not far off, and himself went to Ostia,§ where Numerius, one of his friends, had provided a vessel for him, and without waiting for his son he set sail with his stepson Granius.", "3363": "The young man arrived at the estates of Mucius, but he was surprised by the approach of day while he was getting something together and packing it up, and thus did not altogether escape the vigilance of his enemies, for some cavalry came to the spot, suspecting that Marius might be there.", "3364": "The overseer of the farm, seeing them approach, hid Marius in a waggon loaded with beans, and yoking the oxen to it, he met the horsemen on his road to the city with the waggon.", "3365": "Marius was thus conveyed to the house of his wife, where he got what he wanted, and by night made his way to the sea, and embarking in a vessel bound for Libya, arrived there in safety.", "3366": "XXXVI.", "3367": "The elder Marius was carried along the coast of Italy by a favourable wind, but as he was afraid of one Geminius, a powerful man in Terracina, and an enemy of his, he ordered the sailors to keep clear of that place.", "3368": "The sailors were willing to do as he wished, but the wind veer­ ing round and blowing from the sea with a great swell, they were afraid that the vessel could not stand the beat­ ing of the waves, and as Marius also was much troubled with sickness, they made for land, and with great diffi­ culty got to the coast near Circeii.*", "3369": "As the storm in­ creased and they wanted provisions, they landed from the vessel and wandered about without any definite object, but as happens in cases of great difficulty, seeking merely to escape from the present evil as worst of all, and putting their hopes on the chances of fortune;", "3370": "for the land was their enemy, and the sea also, and they feared to fall in with men, and feared also not to fall in with men, because they were in want of provisions.", "3371": "After some time they met with a few herdsmen, who had nothing to give them in their need, but they recognised Marius and advised him to get out of the way as quickly as he could, for a number of horsemen had just been seen there riding about in quest of him.", "3372": "Thus surrounded by every diffi­ culty and his attendants fainting for want of food, he turned from the road, and plunging into a deep forest, passed the night in great suffering.", "3373": "The next day, com­ pelled by hunger and wishing to make use of his remain­ ing strength before he was completely exhausted, he went along the shore, encouraging his followers, and entreating them not to abandon the last hope, for which he reserved himself on the faith of an old prediction.", "3374": "For when he was quite a youth and living in the country, he caught in his garment an eagle's nest as it was falling down, with seven young ones in it;", "3375": "which his parents wondering at, consulted the soothsayers, who told them that their son would become the most illustrious of men, and that it was the will of fate that he should receive the supreme command and magistracy seven times.", "3376": "Some affirm that this really happened to Marius ;", "3377": "but others say that those who were with Marius at this time and in the rest of his flight heard the story from him, and believing it, recorded an event which is altogether fabulous.", "3378": "For an eagle has not more than two young ones at a time, and they say that Musaeus * was mistaken when he wrote of the eagle thus :", "3379": "-", "3380": "Lays three, two hatches, and one tends with care.", "3381": "But that Marius frequently during his flight, and when he was in the extremes!", "3382": "difficulties, said that he should - survive to enjoy a seventh consulship, is universally admitted.", "3383": "XXXVII.", "3384": "They were now about twenty stadia from Minturnæ,† an Italian city, when they saw at a distance a troop of horse riding towards them, and as it chanced two merchant vessels sailing along the coast.", "3385": "Running down to the sea as fast as they could and as their strength would allow, and throwing themselves into the water, they swam to the vessels.", "3386": "Granius having got into one of the vessels, passed over to the island of Ænaria,* which is off that coast.", "3387": "But Marius, who was heavy and unwieldy, was with difficulty held above the water by two slaves and placed in the other vessel, the horsemen being now close to them and calling from the shore to the sailors either to bring the vessel to land or to throw Marius overboard, and to set sail wherever they pleased.", "3388": "But as Marius entreated them with tears in his eyes, those who had the command of the vessel, after changing their minds as to what they should do as often as was possible in so short a time, at last told the horsemen that they would not surrender Marius.", "3389": "The horsemen rode off in anger, and the sailors again changing their minds, came to land, and casting anchor at the mouth of the Liris, which spreads out like a lake, they advised Marius to disembark and take some food on land and to rest himself from his fatigues till a wind should rise:", "3390": "they added, that it was the usual time for the sea-breeze to decline, and for a fresh breeze to spring up from the marshes.", "3391": "Marius did as they advised, and the sailors carried him out of the vessel and laid him on the grass, little expecting what was to follow.", "3392": "The sailors imme­ diately embarking again and raising the anchor, sailed off as fast as they could, not thinking it honourable to surrender Marius or safe to protect him.", "3393": "In this situation, deserted by everybody, he lay for some time silent on the shore, and at last recovering himself with difficulty, he walked on with much pain on account of there being no path.", "3394": "After passing through deep swamps and ditches full of water and mud, he came to the hut of an old man who worked in the marshes, and falling down at his feet, he entreated him to save and help a man, who, if he escaped from the present dangers, would reward him beyond all his hopes.", "3395": "The man, who either knew Marius of old or saw something in the expression of his countenance which indicated superior rank, said that his hut was sufficient to shelter him if that was all he wanted, but if he was wandering about to avoid his enemies, he could conceal him in a place which was more retired.", "3396": "Upon Marius entreating him to do so, the old man took him to the marsh, and bidding him lie down in a hole near the river he covered Marius with reeds and other light things of the kind, which were well adapted to hide him without pressing too heavily.", "3397": "XXXVIII.", "3398": "After a short time a sound and noise from the hut reached the ears of Marius.", "3399": "Geminius of Terracina had sent a number of men in pursuit of him, some of whom had chanced to come there, and were terrifying the old man and rating him for having harboured and concealed an enemy of the Romans.", "3400": "Marius, rising from his hiding- place and stripping off his clothes, threw himself into the thick and muddy water of the marsh;", "3401": "and this was the cause of his not escaping the search of his pursuers, who dragged him out covered with mud, and leading him naked to Minturnæ, gave him up to the magistrates.", "3402": "Now instructions- had been already sent to every city, requiring the authorities to search for Marius, and to put him to death when he was taken.", "3403": "However, the magis­ trates thought it best to deliberate on the matter first, and in the meantime they lodged Marius in the house of a woman named Fannia,t who was supposed not to be.", "3404": "kindly disposed towards him on account of an old grudge.", "3405": "Fannia had a husband whose name was Tinnius, and on separating from him she claimed her portion, which was considerable.", "3406": "The husband charged her with adultery, and Marius, who was then in his sixth consulship, presided as judge.", "3407": "But on the trial it appeared that Fannia had been a loose woman, and that her husband, though he knew it, took her to wife, and lived with her a long time;", "3408": "accordingly, Marius being disgusted with both of them, decreed that the man should return the woman's portion, but he imposed on the woman, as a mark of infamy, a penalty of four copper coins.*", "3409": "Fannia, however, did not on this occasion exhibit the feeling of a woman who had been wronged, but when she saw Marius, far from show­ ing any resentment for the past, she did all that she could for him under the circumstances, and encouraged him.", "3410": "Marius thanked her, and said that he had good hopes, for a favourable omen had occurred to him, which was some­ thing of this sort:", "3411": "-", "3412": "When they were leading him along, and he was near the house of Fannia, the doors being opened, an ass ran out to drink from a spring which was flowing hard by:", "3413": "the ass, looking at Marius in the face with a bold and cheerful air, at first stood opposite him, and then making a loud braying, sprang past him frisk­ ing with joy.", "3414": "From this, Marius drew a conclusion, as he said that the deity indicated that his safety would come through the sea rather than through the land, for the ass did not betake himself to dry food, but turned from him to the water.", "3415": "Having said this to Fannia, he went to rest alone, bidding her close the door of the apartment.", "3416": "XXXIX.", "3417": "The magistrates - and council of Minturnæ, after deliberating, resolved that there ought to be no delay, and that they should put Marius to death.", "3418": "As none of the citizens would undertake to do it, a Gallic or Cimbrian horse-soldier, for the story is told both ways, took a sword and entered the apartment.", "3419": "Now that part of the room in which Marius happened to be lying was not very well lighted, but was in shade, and it is said that the eyes of Marius appeared to the soldier to dart a strong flame, and a loud voice issued from the gloom, \" Man, do you dare to kill Caius Marius ?\"", "3420": "The barbarian immediately took to flight, and throwing the sword down, rushed through the door, calling out, “I cannot kill Caius Marius.\"", "3421": "This caused a general consternation, which was succeeded by compassion and change of opinion, and self-reproach for having come to so illegal and ungrateful a resolution concerning a man who had saved Italy, and whom it would be a disgrace not to assist.", "3422": "\"", "3423": "Let him go, then,\" it was said, \" where he pleases, as an exile, and suffer in some other place whatever fate has reserved for him.", "3424": "And let us pray that the gods visit us not with their anger for ejecting Marius from our city in poverty and rags.\"", "3425": "Moved by such considerations, all in a body entered the room where Marius was, and getting round him, began to conduct him to the sea.", "3426": "Though every man was eager to furnish something or other, and all were busying themselves, there was a loss of time.", "3427": "The grove of Marica, as it is called, obstructed the passage to the sea, for it was an object of great veneration, and it was a strict rule to carry nothing out of it that had ever been carried in;", "3428": "and now, if they went all round it, there would of necessity be delay:", "3429": "but this difficulty was settled by one of the older men at last calling out, that no road was inaccessible or impassable by which Marius was saved;", "3430": "and he was the first to take some of the things that they were conveying to the ship and to pass through the place.", "3431": "XL.", "3432": "Everything was soon got ready through these zealous exertions, and a ship was supplied for Marius by one Belæus, who afterwards caused a painting to be made representing these events, and dedicated it in the temple.", "3433": "Marius embarking, was carried along by the wind, and by chance was taken to the island Ænaria, where he found Granius and the rest of his friends, and set sail with them for Libya.", "3434": "As their water failed, they were compelled to touch at Erycina in Sicily.", "3435": "Now the Roman quæstor, who happened to be about these parts on the look-out, was very nearly taking Marius when he landed;", "3436": "and he killed about sixteen of the men who were sent to get water.", "3437": "Marius, hastily embarking and crossing the sea to the island of Meninx,* there learnt for the first time that his son had escaped with Cethegus, and that they were going to Iampsas (Hiempsal), king of the Numidians, to ask aid of him.", "3438": "This news encouraged him a little, and he was emboldened to move from the island to the neighbourhood of Carthage.", "3439": "At this time the governor of Libya was Sextilius, a Roman, who had neither received injury nor favour from Marius, and it was expected that he would help him, at least as far as feelings of com­ passion move a man.", "3440": "But no sooner had Marius landed with a few of his party, than an officer met him, and standing right in front of him said, \" The Governor Sextilius forbids.", "3441": "you, Marius, to set foot on Libya, and he says that if you do, he will support the decree of the Senate by treating you as an enemy.\"", "3442": "On hearing this, grief and indignation deprived Marius of utterance, and he was a long time silent, looking fixedly at the officer.", "3443": "Upon the officer asking Marius what he had to say, what reply he had for the governor, he answered with a deep groan, “Tell him you have seen Caius Marius a fugitive sitting on the ruins of Carthage \":", "3444": "a reply in which he not un­ aptly compared the fate of that city and his own changed fortunes.", "3445": "In the meantime, Tampsas, the king of the Numidians, being unresolved which way to act, treated young Marius and his companions with respect, but still detained them on some new pretext whenever they wished to leave;", "3446": "and it was evident that he had no fair object in view in thus deferring their departure.", "3447": "However, an incident happened of no uncommon kind, which brought about their deliverance.", "3448": "The younger Marius was hand­ some, and one of the king's concubines was grieved to see him in a condition unbefitting his station;", "3449": "and this feeling of compassion was a beginning and motive towards love.", "3450": "At first, however, Marius rejected the woman's pro­ posals, but seeing that there were no other means of escape, and that her conduct proceeded from more serious motives than mere passion, he accepted her proffered favours, and with her aid stole away with his friends and made his escape to his father.", "3451": "After embracing one an­ other, they went along the shore, where they saw some scorpions fighting, which Marius considered to be a bad omen.", "3452": "Accordingly they forthwith embarked in a fishing boat, and passed over to the island Cercina, which was no great distance from the mainland;", "3453": "and it happened that they had only just set sail, when some horsemen despatched by the king were seen riding to the spot where they embarked.", "3454": "Marius thus escaped a danger equal to any that ever threatened him.", "3455": "XLI.", "3456": "News reached Rome that Bulla was encoun­ tering the generals of Mithridates in Boeotia, while the consuls were quarrelling and taking up arms.", "3457": "A battle was fought, in which Octavius * got the victory and ejected Cinna, who was attempting to govern by violent means, and he put in Cinna's place as consul Cornelius Merula ;", "3458": "but Cinna collected troops in Italy and made war against Octavius.", "3459": "On hearing this, Marius determined to set sail immediately, which he did with some Moorish cavalry that he took from Africa, and some few Italians who had fled there, but the number of both together did not exceed a thousand.", "3460": "Coming to shore at Telamo* in Tyrrhenia, and landing there, Marius proclaimed freedom to the slaves;", "3461": "and as the freemen who were employed in agriculture there, and in pasturing cattle, flocked to the sea, attracted by his fame, Marius persuaded the most vigorous of them to join him, and in a few days he had collected a con­ siderable force and manned forty ships.", "3462": "Knowing that Octavius was an honourable man and wished to direct the administration in the justest way, but that Cinna was disliked by Sulla and opposed to the existing constitution, he determined to join him with his force.", "3463": "Accordingly he sent to Ciuna and proffered to obey him as consul in everything.", "3464": "Cinna accepted the proposal, and naming Marius proconsul, sent him fasces and the other insigna of the office.", "3465": "Marius, however, observing that such things were not suited to his fortunes, clad in a mean dress, with his hair uncut from the day that he had been an exile, and now above seventy years of age, advanced with slow steps, wishing to make himself an object of compassion;", "3466": "but there was mingled with his abject mien more than his usual terrific expression of countenance, and through his downcast looks he showed that his passion, so far from being humbled, was infuriated by his reverses of fortune.", "3467": "XLIL", "3468": "As soon as he had embraced Cinna and greeted the soldiers, Marius commenced active operations and gave a great turn to affairs.", "3469": "First of all, by attacking the corn­ vessels * with his ships and plundering the merchants, he made himself master of the supplies.", "3470": "He next sailed to the maritime cities, which he took;", "3471": "and, finally, Ostia being treacherously surrendered to him, he made plunder of the property that he found there and put to death many of the people, and by blocking up the river he completely cut off his enemies from all supplies by sea.", "3472": "He now moved on with his army towards Rome and occupied the Janiculus.", "3473": "Octavius damaged his own cause, not so much from want of skill as through his scrupulous observance of the law, to which he unwisely sacrificed the public interests;", "3474": "for though many persons advised him to invite the slaves to join him by promising their freedom, he refused to make them members of the State from which he was endeavouring to exclude Marius in obedience to the law.", "3475": "On the arrival at Rome of Metellus,† the son of Metellus who had commanded in Libya, and had been banished from the city through the intrigues of Marius, the soldiers deserted Octavius and came to Metellus, entreating him to take the command and save the city;", "3476": "they said, if they had an experienced and active com­ mander, they would fight well and get the victory.", "3477": "But Metellus expressed great dissatisfaction at their conduct, and bade them go to the consul, upon which they passed over to the enemy.", "3478": "Metellus also in despair left the city.", "3479": "But Octavius was persuaded by Chaldæans * and certain diviners and interpreters of the Sibylline books to stay in Rome by the assurance that all would turn out well.", "3480": "Octavius, who in all other matters had as solid a judgment as any Roman, and most carefully maintained the consular dignity free from all undue influence according to the usage of his country and the laws, as if they were unchangeable rules, nevertheless showed great weakness in keeping company with impostors and diviners, rather than with men versed in political and military matters.", "3481": "Now Octavius was dragged down from the Rostra before Marius entered the city, by some persons who where sent forward, and murdered;", "3482": "and it is said that a Chaldæan writing was found in his bosom after he was killed.", "3483": "It seemed to be a very inexplicable circumstance, that of two illustrious commanders, Marius owed his success to not disregarding divination, and Octavius thereby lost his life.", "3484": "XLIII.", "3485": "Matters being in this state, the Senate met and sent a deputation to Cinna and Marius to invite them into the city and to entreat them to spare the citizens.", "3486": "Cinna, as consul, sitting on his chair of office, gave audience to the commissioners and returned a kind answer:", "3487": "Marius stood by the consul's chair without speaking a word, but indicating by the unchanging heaviness of his brow and his gloomy look that he intended to fill Rome with slaughter.", "3488": "After the audience was over, they marched to the city.", "3489": "Cinna entered accompanied by his guards, but Marius halting at the gates angrily affected to have some scruples about entering.", "3490": "He said he was an exile and was excluded from his country by a law, and if anybody wanted to have him in the city, they must go to the vote again and undo the vote by which he was banished, just as if he were a man who respected the laws and were returning from exile to a free state.", "3491": "Accordingly he summoned the people to the Forum, but before three or four of the tribes had voted, throwing off the mask and setting aside all the talk about being legally recalled, he entered with some guards selected from the slaves who had flocked to him, and who were called Bardiæi.", "3492": "These fellows killed many persons by his express orders and many on the mere signal of his nod ;", "3493": "and at last meeting with Ancharius, a senator who had filled the office of prætor, they struck him down with their daggers in the presence of Marius, when they saw that Marius did not salute him.", "3494": "After this whenever he did not salute a man or return his salute, this was a signal for them to massacre him forthwith in the streets, in consequence of which even the friends of Marius were filled with consternation and horror when they approached him.", "3495": "The slaughter was now great, and Cinna's appetite was dulled and he was satisfied with blood;", "3496": "but Marius daily went on with his passion at the highest pitch and thirst­ ing for vengeance, through the whole list of those whom suspected in any degree.", "3497": "And every road and every city was filled with the pursuers, hunting out those who attempted to escape and conceal themselves, and the ties of hospitality and friendship were proved to be no security in misfortune, for they were very few who did not betray those who sought refuge with them.", "3498": "This rendered the conduct of the slaves of Cornutus the more worthy of praise and admiration, for they concealed their master at home, and hanging up by the neck the dead body of some obscure person, and putting a gold ring on his finger, they showed him to the guards of Marius, and then wrapping up the body as if it were their master's, they interred it.", "3499": "The device went unsuspected, and Cornutus being thus secreted by his slaves, made his escape to Gaul.", "3500": "XLIV.", "3501": "The orator Marcus Antonius found a faithful friend, but still he did not escape.", "3502": "This man, though poor, and of the lower class, received in his house one of the most illustrious of the Romans, and wishing to enter­ tain him as well as he could, he sent a slave to one of the neighbouring wine-shops to get some wine.", "3503": "As the slave was more curious than usual in tasting it, and told the man to give him some better wine, the merchant asked what could be the reason that he did not buy the new wine, as usual, and the ordinary wine, but wanted some of good quality and high price.", "3504": "The slave replied in his simplicity, as he was speaking to an old acquaintance, that his master was entertaining Marcus Antonius, who was concealed at his house.", "3505": "The wine-dealer, a faithless and unprincipled wretch, as soon as the slave left him, hurried off to Marius, who was at supper, and having gained admission, told him that he would betray Marcus Antonius to him.", "3506": "On hearing this, Marius is said to have uttered a loud shout and to have clapped his hands with delight;", "3507": "and he was near getting up and going to the place himself, but his friends stopped him, and he de­ spatched Annius with some soldiers, with orders to bring him the head of Antonius immediately.", "3508": "On reaching the house, Annius waited at the door, and the soldiers mount­ ing the stairs entered the room, but on seeing Antonius, every man began to urge some of his companions and push him forward to do the deed instead of himself.", "3509": "And so powerful were the charm and persuasion of his eloquence, when Antonius began to speak and pray for his life, that not a man of them could venture to lay hands on him or look him in the face, but they all bent their heads down and shed tears.", "3510": "As this caused some delay, Annius went upstairs, where he saw Antonius speaking and the soldiers deplored his fate (De Oratore, iii. 3), had the same ill-luck from the hands of Antonius the Triumvir.", "3511": "M. Antonius the orator filled many high posts, and was consul B.C. 99.", "3512": "But his title to remembrance is his great oratorical skill.", "3513": "Cicero says that Antonius and his con­ temporary Lucius Licinius Crassus were the first Romans who equalled the great orators of Greece.", "3514": "The judicious remarks of Antonius on the conduct of a cause are preserved by Cicero (De Oratore, ii. 72 ). Antonius left no writings.", "3515": "(See “ Antonius, Marcus,\" in Biog. Diet. of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.) awed and completely softened by his eloquence;", "3516": "on which he abused them, and running up to Antonius, cut off his head with his own hand.", "3517": "The friends of Catulus Lutatius, who had been joint consul with Marius and with him had triumphed over the Cimbri, interceded for him with Marius, and begged for his life;", "3518": "but the only answer they got was, \" He must die \" and accordingly Catulus shut him­ self up in a room, and lighting a quantity of charcoal, suffocated himself.", "3519": "Headless trunks thrown into the streets and trampled underfoot excited no feeling of com­ passion, but only a universal shudder and alarm.", "3520": "But the people were most provoked by the licence of the Bar­ diæi, who murdered fathers of families in their houses, defiled their children, and violated their wives;", "3521": "and they went on plundering and committing violence, till Cinna and Sertorius combining, attacked them when they were asleep in the camp, and transfixed them with spears.", "3522": "XLV.", "3523": "In the meantime, as if the wind was beginning to turn, reports reached Rome from all quarters that Sulla had finished the war with Mithridates, and recovered the provinces, and was sailing against the city with a large force.", "3524": "This intelligence caused a brief cessation and pause to unspeakable calamities, for Marius and his faction were in expectation of the immediate arrival of their enemies.", "3525": "Now being elected consul- for the seventh time, on the very Calends of January, which is the begin­ ning of the year, Marius caused one Sextus Lucinus f to be thrown down the Tarpeian rock, which appeared to be a presage of the great misfortunes that were again to befal the partisans of Marius and the State.", "3526": "But Marius was now worn out with labour, and, as it were, drowned with cares, and cowed in his spirit;", "3527": "and the experience of past dangers and toil made him tremble at the thoughts of a new war, and fresh struggles and alarms, and he could not sustain himself when he reflected that now he would have to hazard a contest, not with Octavius or Merula at the head of a tumultuous crowd and seditious rabble, but that Sulla was advancing—Sulla, who had once driven him from Rome, and had now confined Mithridates within the limits of his kingdom of Pontus.", "3528": "With his mind crushed by such reflections, and placing before his eyes his long wanderings and escapes and dangers in his flight by sea and by land, he fell into a state of deep despair, and was troubled with nightly alarms and terrific dreams in which he thought he heard a voice continually calling out, \"Dreadful is the lion's lair Though he is no longer there.-", "3529": "As he greatly dreaded wakeful nights, he gave himself up to drinking and intoxication at unseasonable hours and to a degree unsuited to his age, in order to procure sleep, as if he could thus elude his cares.", "3530": "At last when a man arrived with news from the sea, fresh terrors seized him, partly from fear of the future and partly from feeling the burden and the weariness of the present state of affairs;", "3531": "and while he was in this condition, a slight disturbance sufficed to bring on a kind of pleurisy, as the philosopher Poseidonius * relates, who also says that he had an inter­ view and talked with him on the subject of his embassy, while Marius was sick.", "3532": "But one Caius Piso,t an historian, says that Marius, while walking about with some friends after supper, fell to talking of the incidents of his life, begin­ ning with his boyhood, and after enumerating his many vicissitudes of fortine, he said that no man of sense ought to trust fortune after such reverses;", "3533": "upon which he took leave of his friends, and keeping his bed for seven successive days, thus died.", "3534": "Some say that his ambitious character was most completely disclosed during his illness by his falling into the extravagant delusion that he was conduct­ ing the war against Mithridates, and he would then put his body into all kinds of attitudes and movements, as he used to do in battle, and accompany them with loud shouts and frequent cheers.", "3535": "So strong and unconquerable a desire to be engaged in that war had his ambitious and jealous character instilled into him;", "3536": "and therefore, though he had lived to be seventy years of age, and was the first Roman who had been seven times consul and had made himself a family, and wealth enough for several kings, he still bewailed his fortune, and complained of dying before he had attained the fulness and completion of his desires.", "3537": "XLVI.", "3538": "Now Plato, being at the point of death, feli­ citated himself on his daemon * and his fortune, first that he was born a human being, then that he was a Greek, and neither a barbarian nor an irrational animal;", "3539": "and besides all this, that his birth had fallen on the time when Socrates lived.", "3540": "And indeed it is said that Antipater t of Tarsus, in like manner, just before his death, when recapitulating the happiness that he had enjoyed, did not forget his prosperous voyage from Rome to Athens, inas­ much as he considered every gift of favourable fortune as a thing to be thankful for, and preserved it to the last in his memory, which is to man the best storehouse of good things.", "3541": "But those who have no memory and no sense, let the things that happen ooze away imperceptibly in the course of time;", "3542": "and consequently, as they hold nothing and keep nothing, being always empty of all goodness, but full of expectation, they look to the future and throw away the present.", "3543": "And yet fortune may hinder the future, but the present cannot be taken from a man;", "3544": "nevertheless, such men reject that which fortune now gives, as something foreign, and dream of that which is uncertain :", "3545": "and it is natural that they should;", "3546": "for before reason and education have enabled them to put a founda­ tion and basement under external goods, they get and they heap them together, and are never able to fill the insatiate appetite of their soul.", "3547": "Now Marius * died, having held for seventeen days his seventh consulship.", "3548": "And immediately there were great rejoicings in Rome, and good hope that there was a release from a cruel tyranny;", "3549": "but in a few days men found that they had exchanged an old master for a young one who was in the fulness of his vigour;", "3550": "such cruelty and severity did the son of Marius exhibit in putting to death the noblest and best citizens.", "3551": "He

their hair in sign of mourning, the Spartans on the other hand, in pride at their victory let their hair grow long;", "3560": "nor was it because the Bacchiadæ, when they fled from Corinth to Sparta had their hair cut short, and looked mean and despicable that made the Spartans, themselves eager to let their hair grow long;", "3561": "but the fashion was enjoined by Lykurgus.", "3562": "It is

permitted to young men in Sparta;", "3567": "for they wish their children, from their very birth, to dread reproach and to be eager for praise, and he who is not stirred by these passions is regarded with contempt as a sluggish fellow without ambition.", "3568": "Lysander retained throughout life the emulous desire for fame which had been instilled into him by his early train­ ing;", "3569": "but,

were concerned.", "3570": "Aris­ totle, when he observes that the temperaments of great men are prone to melancholy, instances Sokrates, Plato, and Herakles, and observes also that Lysander, when advanced in life, became inclined to melancholy.", "3571": "What is especially to be noted in his character is, that while he himself lived in honourable poverty, and never received a bribe from any one, that he nevertheless brought wealth and the desire for wealth into his native country, and took away from it its old boast of being superior to money;", "3572": "for after the war with Athens he

I ask you to add an obolus to the pay of the sailors, so that they may receive four obols a day instead of three.\"", "3592": "Cyrus, pleased with his warlike spirit, presented him with ten thousand darics,* with which money he paid the extra obolus to the sailors, and so improved the equipment of his fleet, that in a short time he all but emptied the enemy is ships;", "3593": "for their sailors deserted in crowds to the best paymaster, and those who remained behind were so disheartened and mutinous, that they gave their officers continual trouble.", "3594": "Yet even after he had thus weakened his enemy's forces Lysander dared not venture on a battle, knowing Alkibiadee to be a brilliant general, and that his fleet was still the more numerous, while his many victories by sea and land made him feared at this period as invincible.", "3595": "V.", "3596": "When, however, Alkibiades sailed from Samos to Phokeea he left his pilot Antiochus in command of the fleet.", "3597": "This man, wishing in a foolhardy spirit to insult Lysander, sailed into the harbour of Ephesus with two triremes, and arrogantly passed along the beach where the Lacedæmonian fleet lay drawn up, with loud laughter and noise.", "3598": "Lysander, enraged at this, at first only launched a few triremes to pursue him, but when he saw the Athe­ nians coming to his assistance he manned his whole fleet, and brought on a general action.", "3599": "Lysander was vic­ torious, took fifteen triremes, and erected a trophy.", "3600": "Upon this the Athenian people were greatly incensed against Alkibiades, and removed him from his command;", "3601": "and he, being insulted and ill-treated by the soldiery at Samoa, withdrew from the Athenian camp to the Chersonesus.", "3602": "This battle, though not in itself remarkable, yet became so because of the misfortunes which it brought upon Alkibiades.", "3603": "Lysander now invited to Ephesus all the bravest and most distinguished Greeks from the cities on the Ionic coast, and thus laid the foundation of all those oligarchies and revolutionary governments which were afterwards established there, by encouraging them to form political clubs, End devote themselves energetically to carrying on the war, because in the event of success they would not only conquer the Athenians, but also would be able to put down all democratic government, and establish them­ selves as absolute rulers in their respective cities.", "3604": "He proved the truth of his professions to these people by his acts, as he promoted those whom he personally knew, and those with whom he was connected by the ties of hospi­ tality, to important posts and commands, aiding and abet­ ting their most unscrupulous and unjust acts, so that all men began to look up to him and to be eager to win his favour, imagining that if he remained in power, their most extravagant wishes would be gratified.", "3605": "For this reason they were dissatisfied with Kallikratidas, when he took command of the fleet as Lysander's successor, and even after he had proved himself to be as brave and honest as a man could be, they still disliked his truthful, straight­ forward, Dorian manners.", "3606": "Yet they could not but admire his virtue, as men admire some antique heroic statue, although they regretted Lysander's ready zeal for the interest of his friends so much that some of them actually wept when he sailed away.", "3607": "VI.", "3608": "Lysander made this class of persons yet more irritated against Kallikratidas by sending back to Sardis the balance of the money which he had received from Cyrus for the fleet, bidding the sailors ask Kallikratidas for pay, and see how he would manage to maintain the men.", "3609": "And when he finally left Ephesus, he endeavoured to force Kallikratidas to admit that he had handed over to him a fleet which was mistress of the seas.", "3610": "Kallikra­ tidas, however, wishing to expose his vainglorious boasts, answered:", "3611": "\"If so, sail from hence, passing Samos on your left, and hand over the fleet to me at Miletus;", "3612": "for we need not fear the Athenians at Samos, if our fleet is mistress of the seas.\"", "3613": "To this Lysander answered that it was not he, but Kallikratidas who was in command, and at once sailed away to Peloponnesus, leaving Kallikratidas in great perplexity;", "3614": "for he had brought no money with him from his own country, and he could not endure to wring money out of the distressed Greek cities on the coast.", "3615": "There remained only one course open to him:", "3616": "to go to the satraps of the king of Persia, and ask them for money, as Lysander had done.", "3617": "Kallikratidas was the worst man in the world for such a task, being high-spirited and generous, and thinking it less dishonourable for Greeks to be defeated by other Greeks than for them to court and flatter barbarians who had nothing to recommend them but their riches.", "3618": "Forced by want of money, however, he made a journey into Lydia, and at once went to the house of Cyrus, where he ordered the servants to say that the admiral Kallikratidas was come, and wished to confer with him.", "3619": "They answered, \"Stranger, Cyrus is not at leisure;", "3620": "he is drinking.\"", "3621": "To this Kallikratidas with the greatest coolness replied:", "3622": "“Very well;", "3623": "I will wait until he has finished his draught.\"", "3624": "At this answer the Persians took him for a boor, and laughed at him, so that he went away;", "3625": "and, after presenting himself a second time and being again denied admittance, returned to Ephesus in a rage, invoking curses upon those who had first been cor­ rupted by the barbarians, and who had taught them to behave so insolently because of their riches, and vowing in the presence of his friends that as soon as he reached Sparta, he would do all in his power to make peace between the Greek states, in order that they might be feared by the barbarians, and might no longer be obliged to beg the Persians to help them to destroy one another.", "3626": "VII.", "3627": "But Kallikratidas, whose ideas were so noble and worthy of a Spartan, being as brave, honourable, and just a man as ever lived, perished shortly afterwards in the sea-fight at Arginusæ.", "3628": "Upon this, as the Lacedæmonian cause was going to ruin, the allied cities sent an embassy to Sparta, begging for Lysander to be again given the chief command, and promising that they would carry on the war with much greater vigour if he were their leader.", "3629": "Cyrus also sent letters to the same effect.", "3630": "Now as the Spartan law forbids the same man being twice appointed admiral, the Lacedæmonians, wishing to please their allies, gave the chief command nominally to one Arakus, but sent Lysander with him, with the title of secretary, but really with full power and authority.", "3631": "He was very welcome to the chief men in the various cities, who imagined that by his means they would be able to obtain much greater power, and to put down democracy throughout Asia;", "3632": "but those who loved plain and honourable dealing in a general thought that Lysander, when compared with Kallikratidas, appeared to be a crafty, deceitful man, conducting the war chiefly by subtilty and stratagem, using honourable means when it was his interest to do so, at other times acting simply on the rules of expediency, and not holding truth to be in itself superior to falsehood, but measuring the value of the one and the other by the profit which was to be obtained from them.", "3633": "He indeed laughed at those who said that the race of Herakles ought not to make wars by stratagem, saying, “Where the lion's skin will not protect us, we must sew the fox's skin to it.\"VIII.", "3634": "All this is borne out by what he is said to have done at Miletus.", "3635": "Here his friends and connections, to whom he had promised that he would put down the demo­ era tic constitution and drive their enemies out of the city, changed their minds, and made up their quarrel with their political opponents.", "3636": "At this reconciliation Lysander publicly expressed great satisfaction and even seemed anxious to promote a good understanding, but in private he railed at them and urged them to attack the popular party.", "3637": "But as soon as he heard of an outbreak having taken place, he at once marched into the city, addressed the insurgents roughly, and sent them away in custody, harshly treated, as if he meant to inflict some signal punish­ ment upon them, while he bade those of the popular faction take courage, and not to expect any ill-treatment while he was present.", "3638": "By this artifice he prevailed upon the chief men of the democratic party not to leave the city, but to remain and perish in it;", "3639": "as indeed they did, for every one who trusted to his word was put to death.", "3640": "Moreover, Androkleides relates a story which shows Lysander's extreme laxity with regard to oaths.", "3641": "He is said to have remarked, that \"", "3642": "We cheat boys with dice, and men with oaths!\"", "3643": "In this he imitated Polykrates, the despot of Samos—an unworthy model for a Spartan general.", "3644": "Nor was it like a Spartan to treat the gods as badly as he treated his enemies, or even worse-for the man who overreaches his enemy by breaking his oath admits that he fears his enemy, but despises his god.", "3645": "IX.", "3646": "Cyrus now sent for Lysander to Sardis, and gave him a supply of money, with promise of more.", "3647": "Nay, he was so zealous to show his attachment to Lysander that he declared, if his father would not furnish him with funds, that he would expend all his own property, and if other resources failed, that he would break up the gold and silver throne on which he was sitting.", "3648": "Finally, when he went away to Media to see his father, he empowered Lysander to receive the tribute from the subject cities, and placed the whole of his government in his hands.", "3649": "He embraced Lysander, begged him not to fight the Athenians by sea until he returned from court, promised that he would return with many ships from Phœnicia and Cilicia, and so departed.", "3650": "Lysander was not able to fight the Athenians on equal terms, but yet he could not remain quiet with so large a number of ships.", "3651": "He accordingly put out to sea, induced several of the islands to revolt from Athens, and overran Ægina and Salamis.", "3652": "At length he landed in Attica, where he met Agis, who came down from Dekeleia to see him, and showed the land army what his naval foroe was, boasting that he could sail whither he pleased, and was master of the seas.", "3653": "However, when he discovered that the Athenians were in pursuit he fled precipitately back to Asia Minor.", "3654": "Finding the Hellespont unguarded, he attacked the city of Lampsakus by sea, while Thorax, who had arrived at the same place with the land forces, attacked it on that side.", "3655": "He took the city by storm, and gave it up to his soldiers to plunder.", "3656": "Meanwhile, the Athenian fleet of a hundred and eighty triremes had just touched at Elaius in the Chersonese, but, hearing that Lampsakus was lost, proceeded to Sestos.", "3657": "Having taken in provisions at that place, they sailed to the “Goat's Rivers,\" opposite to Lampsakus, where the enemy's fleet still lay.", "3658": "One of the Athenian generals on this occasion was that Philokles who once induced the people to pass a decree that all prisoners of war should have their right thumbs cut off, so that they might not be able to hold a spear, but yet might work at the oar.", "3659": "X. Hereupon both parties rested, expecting a sea-fight on the morrow.", "3660": "Lysander, however, had other intentions, but notwithstanding ordered the sailors to man their ships at day-break, as if he intended to fight, and to remain quietly at their posts waiting for orders;", "3661": "and the land force was similarly drawn up by the sea-side.", "3662": "When the sun rose, the Athenian fleet rowed straight up to the Lacedæmonians, and offered battle, but Lysander, although his ships were fully manned, and had their prows pointing towards the enemy, would not let them engage, but sent small boats to the first line of his ships with orders not to move, but remain quietly in their places without any noise or attempt to attack.", "3663": "Though the Athenians retired towards evening, he would not let his men land before two or three triremes which he had sent to reconnoitre, returned with the intelligence that the enemy had dis­ embarked.", "3664": "The same manoeuvres took place on the next day, and also on the third and fourth days, so that the Athenians began to be very bold, and to despise their enemy, who seemed not to dare to attack them.", "3665": "At this time Alkibiades, who was living in his own forts in the Chersonese, rode over to the Athenian camp and blamed the generals for having in the first place encamped in a bad position, on an exposed sea-beach without any harbour, and pointed out their mistake in having to fetch all their provisions from Sestos, which was so far off, whereas they ought to have proceeded to the harbour and city of Sestos, where they would also be farther away from a watchful enemy, commanded by one general only, and so well disciplined as to be able to carry out his orders with great rapidity.", "3666": "These representations of Alkibiades were not listened to by the Athenian generals, one of whom, Tydeus, insolently replied that it was they, not he, who were in command.", "3667": "XI.", "3668": "As besides this Alkibiades had some suspicions of treachery among them, he rode away.", "3669": "On the fifth day however, when the Athenians, after their customary offer of battle, had returned as usual, in a careless and negligent manner, Lysander sent out some ships to reconnoitre, with orders to row back again with all speed as soon as they saw the Athenians disembark, and when they reached the middle of the straits to hoist a brazen shield over their bows as a signal for advance.", "3670": "He himself sailed from ship to ship, addressing the steersmen and captains of each,.", "3671": "urging them to be in their place with their full complement both of rowers and fighting-men on deck, and at the signal to row strongly and cheerfully against the enemy.", "3672": "When the shield was raised, and the signal given by trumpet from the flag-ship, the fleet put to sea, while the land force marched rapidly along the shore towards the promontory.", "3673": "The straits here are only fifteen furlongs wide, a distance which was soon passed by the zeal of the Lacedæmonian rowers.", "3674": "Konon was the first of the Athenian generals who perceived the fleet approaching.", "3675": "He at once called out to the men to embark, and in his agony of distress at the disaster, ordered, implored, and forced them into their ships.", "3676": "But all his zeal was useless, scattered as the crews were;", "3677": "for as soon as they disem­ barked they at once, not expecting any attack, began some to purchase food in the market, some to stroll about, while some went to sleep in their tents, and some began to cook, without the least mistrust of that which befel them, through the ignorance and inexperience of their leaders.", "3678": "As by this lime the enemy were close upon them, with loud cries and noise of oars, Konon with eight ships made his way safely through the enemy, and escaped to the court of Evagoras, king of Cyprus.", "3679": "As to the rest of the ships, the Peloponnesians took some of them empty, and sank the others as the sailors endeavoured to get on board of them.", "3680": "Of these men, many perished near their ships, as they ran to them in disorderly crowds, without arms, while others who fled away on land were killed by the enemy, who landed and went in pursuit of them.", "3681": "Besides these, three thousand men, including the generals, were taken prisoners.", "3682": "Lysander also captured the entire fleet, with the exception of the sacred trireme called the Paralus, and the eight ships which escaped with Konon.", "3683": "After plundering the camp, and taking all the captured ships in tow, he sailed back to Lampsakus with triumphal music of flutes and paeans of victory, having won a great victory with little labour, and in a short time brought to a close the longest and most uncertain war ever known in his times.", "3684": "There had been innumerable battles, and frequent changes of fortune, in which more generals had perished than in all the previous wars in Greece, and yet all was brought to a close by the wisdom and conduct of one man:", "3685": "which thing caused some to attribute this victory to the interposition of the gods.", "3686": "XII.", "3687": "Some affirmed, that when Lysander's ship sailed out of the harbour of Lampsakus to attack the enemy, they saw the Dioskuri, like two stars, shining over the rudders.-", "3688": "Some also say that the fall of the great stone was an omen of this disaster:", "3689": "for the common belief is that a vast stone fell down from Heaven into the Goat's Rivers, which stone is even now to be seen, and is wor­ shipped by the people of the Chersonese.", "3690": "We are told that Anaxagoras foretold that in case of any slip or dis­ turbance of the bodies which are fixed in the heavens, they would all fall down.", "3691": "The stars also, he said, are not in their original position, but being heavy bodies formed of stone, they shine by the resistance and friction of the atmosphere, while they are driven along by the violence of the circular motion by which they were originally prevented from falling, when cold and heavy bodies were separated from the general universe.", "3692": "There is a more credible theory on this subject, that shooting- stars are not a rush of aerial fire which is put out as soon as it is kindled, nor yet a blaze caused by a quantity of air being suddenly allowed to rush upwards, but that they are heavenly bodies, which from some failure in their rotatory power, fall from their orbit and descend, not often into inhabited portions of the earth, but for the most part into the sea, whereby they escape notice.", "3693": "This theory of Anaxagoras is confirmed by Daimachus in his treatise on Piety, where he states that for seventy-five days before the stone fell a fiery body of great size like a burning cloud, was observed in the heavens.", "3694": "It did not remain at rest, but moved in various directions by short jerks, so that by its violent swaying about many fiery particles were broken off, and flashed like shooting-stars.", "3695": "When, however, it sank to the earth, the inhabitants, after their first feeling of terror and astonishment were passed, collected together, and found no traces of fire, but merely a stone lying on the ground, which although a large one, bore no comparison to that fiery mass.", "3696": "It is evident that this tale of Daimachus can only find credit with indulgent readers:", "3697": "but if it be true, it signally con­ futes those who argue that the stone was wrenched by the force of a whirlwind from some high cliff, carried up high into the air, and then let fall whenever the violence of the tempest abated.", "3698": "Unless, indeed, that which was seen for so many days was really fire, which, when quenched, produced such a violent rushing and motion in the air as tore the stone from its place.", "3699": "A more exact enquiry into these matters, however, belongs to another subject.", "3700": "XIII.", "3701": "Now Lysander, after the three thousand Athenians whom be had taken prisoners had been condemned to death by the council, called for Philokles their general, and asked him what punishment he thought that he deserved for having advised his fellow-countrymen to treat Greeks in such a cruel manner.-", "3702": "Philokles, not in the least cast down by his misfortunes, bade him not to raise questions which no one could decide, but, since he was victor, to do what he would himself have suffered if vanquished.", "3703": "He then bathed, put on a splendid dress, and led his country­ men to execution, according to the account given by Theo­ phrastus.", "3704": "After this Lysander sailed to the various cities in the neighbourhood, and compelled all the Athenians whom he met to betake themselves to Athens, giving out that he would spare no one, but put to death all whom he found without the city.", "3705": "His object in acting thus was to produce famine in Athens as speedily as possible, that the city might not give him the trouble of a long siege.", "3706": "He now destroyed the democratics and popular constitutions in all the Greek cities which had been subject to Athens, placing a Lacedæmonian in each as harmost or governor, with a council of ten archons under him, composed of men selected from the political clubs which he had established.", "3707": "He proceeded leisurely along, effecting these changes alike in the cities which had been hostile to him and in those which had fought on his side, as though he were preparing for himself a Greece in which he would take the first place.", "3708": "He did not choose his archons by their birth, or their wealth, but favoured his own friends and political ad­ herents, to whom he gave irresponsible power;", "3709": "while by being present at several executions, and driving the opponents of his friends into exile, he gave the Greeks a very unpleasant idea of what they were to expect from the empire of Lacedæmon.", "3710": "The comic poet Theopompus therefore appears to talk at random when he compares the Lacedæmonians to tavern-keepers, because they at first poured out for the Greeks a most sweet draught of liberty and afterwards made it bitter;", "3711": "whereas in truth the taste of their rule was bitter from the beginning, as Lysander would not allow the people to have any voice in the government, and placed all the power in each city in the hands of the most daring and ambitious men of the oligarchical party.", "3712": "XIV.", "3713": "After spending a short time in arranging these matters and having sent messengers to Laconia to announce that he was coming thither with a fleet of two hundred ships, he joined the Spartan kings, Agis and Pausanias, in Attica, and expected that the city of Athens would soon fall into his hands.", "3714": "Finding, however, that the Athenians made an obstinate defence, he crossed over to Asia again with the fleet.", "3715": "Here he overthrew the existing constitutions and established governments of ten in all the cities alike, putting many citizens to death, and driving many into exile.", "3716": "He drove out all the inhabi­ tants from the island of Samos in a body, and handed over the cities in that island to those who had previously been banished.", "3717": "He also took Sestos from the Athenians, and would not allow the people of Sestos to live there, but gave the city and territory over to those who had acted as steersmen and masters on board of his ships.", "3718": "This indeed was the first of his acts which was cancelled by the Lacedæmonians, who restored Sestos to its inhabitants.", "3719": "Yet his proceedings were viewed with satisfaction by the Greeks, when he restored the Æginetans, who had for a long time been banished from their island, and also refounded Melos and Skione, the Athenians being driven away and forced to give up the cities.", "3720": "By this time he learned that the people of Athens were nearly starved out, and consequently sailed to Peiræus and received the submission of the city, which was obliged to accept whatever terms of capitulation he chose to offer.", "3721": "I have indeed heard Lacedæmonians say that Lysander wrote to the Ephors, saying \" Athens is taken;", "3722": "\" and that they wrote to Lysander in answer, \" To have taken it is enough.\"", "3723": "But this tale is merely invented for effect.", "3724": "The real decree of the Ephors ran as follows:", "3725": "—“ This is the decision of the Lacedæmonian government.", "3726": "Throw down the walls of Peiraeus and the Long Walls.", "3727": "Withdraw from all other cities and occupy your own land, and then you may have peace, if you wish for it, allowing likewise your exiles to return.", "3728": "With regard to the number of the ships, whatever be judged necessary by those on the spot, that do.", "3729": "\"The Athenians accepted these terms, by the advice of Theramenes the son of Hagnon :", "3730": "and on this occasion it is said that when he was asked by Kleomenes, one of the younger orators, how he dared to act and speak against what Themistokles had done, by giving upto the Lace­ dæmonians those walls which Themistokles had built in spite of them, he answered, \"My boy, I am doing nothing contrary to Themistokles;", "3731": "for these same walls he built up to save his countrymen, and we will throw them down to save them.", "3732": "Indeed, if walls made a city prosperous, then ought Sparta, which has none, to be the most miserable of all.", "3733": "\"XV. Now Lysander, after taking all the fleet of the Athenians except twelve ships, and having taken possession of their walls, began to take measures for the subversion of their political constitution, on the sixteenth day of the month Munychion, the same day on which they had defeated the Persians in the sea-fight at Salamis.", "3734": "As they were greatly grieved at this, and were loth to obey him, he sent word to the people that the city had broken the terms of its capitulation, because their walls were stand­ ing although the time within which they ought to have been destroyed had elapsed.", "3735": "He therefore would make an entirely new decision about their fate, because they had broken the treaty.", "3736": "Some writers say that he actually consulted the allies about the advisability of selling the whole population for slaves, in which debate the Theban Erianthus proposed to destroy the city and make the site of it a sheep walk.", "3737": "Afterwards, however, when the generals were drinking together a Phokian sang the first song in the Elektra of Euripides, which begins with the words­ “Elektra, Agamemnon's child, I reach thy habitation wild.\"", "3738": "At this their hearts were touched, and it appeared to them to be a shameful deed to destroy so famous a city, and one which had produced such great men.", "3739": "After this, as the Athenians agreed to everything that Lysander proposed, he sent for a number of flute-players out of the city, collected all those in his camp, and destroyed the walls and burned the ships to the sound of music, while the allies crowned themselves with flowers and danced around, as though on that day their freedom began.", "3740": "Lysander now at once subverted the constitution, estab­ lishing thirty archons in the city, and ten in Peiræus, placing also a garrison in the Acropolis under the command of Kallibius, who acted as harmost, or governor.", "3741": "This man once was about to strike Autolykus the athlete, in whose house Xenophon has laid the scene of his \" Symposium,” with his staff, when Autolykus tripped him and threw him down.", "3742": "Lysander did not sympathise with his fall, but even reproached him, saying that he did not know how to govern free men.", "3743": "However, the Thirty, to please Kallibius, shortly afterwards put Autolykus to death.", "3744": "XVI.", "3745": "After these transactions Lysander set sail for Thrace, but sent home to Sparta all the money for which he had no immediate occasion, and all the presents and crowns * which he had received, in charge of Gylippus, who had held a command in Sicily during the war there.", "3746": "His wealth was very great, as many naturally had bestowed rich presents on one who had such great power as to be in some sort dictator of Greece.", "3747": "Gylippus is said to have cut open the seam at the bottom of each bag of money, taken a great deal of it out, and then to have sewn it up again, not knowing that there was a written note in each bag stating the amount which it contained.", "3748": "When he reached Sparta he hid the money which he had stolen under the tiles of his roof, and handed the bags over to the Ephors with the seals unbroken.", "3749": "When the bags were opened and the money counted, the amount was found not to agree with the written notes, and the Ephors were much perplexed at this until a servant of Gylippus explained the cause of it in a riddle, telling them that under his tiles roosted many owls.", "3750": "For, it seems, most of the money current at that period bore the Athenian device of the owl, in consequence of the extent of the Athenian empire.", "3751": "Gylippus, having sullied the glory of his great achieve­ ments by this mean and sordid action, left Sparta in disgrace.", "3752": "Yet the wisest Spartans, fearing the power of the money for this very reason, that it was the chief men in the state who would be tempted by it, reproached Lysander for bringing it, and implored the Ephors to convey solemnly all the gold and silver coin away out of the country, as being so much “imported ruin.\"", "3753": "On this the Ephors invited discussion upon the subject.", "3754": "Theo­ pompus tells us that it was Skiraphidas, but Ephorus says that it was Phlogidas who advised the Spartans not to receive the gold and silver coinage into their country, but to continue to use that which their fathers had used.", "3755": "This was iron money, which had first been dipped in vinegar when red hot, so that it could not be worked, as its being quenched in this manner rendered it brittle and useless, while it was also heavy, difficult to transport from place to place, and a great quantity of it represented but a small value.", "3756": "It appears probable that all money was originally of this kind, and that men used instead of coin small spits * of iron or copper.", "3757": "For this reason we still call small coins obols, and we call six obols a drachma, meaning that this is the number of them which can be grasped by the hand.", "3758": "XVII.", "3759": "The motion for sending away the money was opposed by Lysander's friends, who were eager to keep it in the state;", "3760": "so that it was at last decided that for public purposes this money might be used, but that if any private person were found in possession of it, he should be put to death:", "3761": "as if Lykurgus had been afraid of money itself, and not of the covetousness produced by it, which they did not repress by forbidding private men to own money so much as they encouraged it by permitting the state to own it, conferring thereby a certain dignity upon it over and above its real value.", "3762": "It was not possible for men who saw that the state valued silver and gold to despise it as useless, or to think that what was thus prized by the whole body of the citizens could be of no concern to individuals.", "3763": "On the contrary, it is plain that national customs much sooner impress themselves on the lives and manners of individuals, than do the faults and vices of individuals affect the national character.", "3764": "When the whole becomes corrupt the parts necessarily become corrupt with it;", "3765": "but the corruption of some of the parts does not necessarily extend to the whole, being checked and overpowered by those parts which remain healthy.", "3766": "Thus the Spartans made the law and the fear of death guard the houses of their citizens so that money could not enter them, but they did not guard their minds against the seductions of money, nay, even encouraged them to admire it, by proclaiming that it was a great and im­ portant matter that the commonwealth should be rich.", "3767": "However, I have discussed the conduct of the Lacedæ­ monians in this respect in another book.", "3768": "KVIII.", "3769": "From the proceeds of the plunder which he had taken Lysander set up a brazen statue of himself and of each of the admirals * at Delphi, and also offered up golden stars to the Dioskuri, which stars disappeared just before the battle of Leuktra.", "3770": "Besides this, in the treasury of Brasidas and the Akanthians there used to be a trireme made of gold and ivory, two cubits long, which was sent to him by Cyrus as a present on the occasion of his victory.", "3771": "Anaxandrides of Delphi also tells us that Lysander de­ posited there a talent of silver, fifty-two minæ, and eleven of the coins called staters, which does not agree with the accounts given by other writers of his poverty.", "3772": "At this time Lysander was more powerful than any Greek had ever been before, and displayed an amount of pride and arrogance beyond even what his power war­ ranted.", "3773": "He was the first Greek, we are told by Douris in his history, to whom cities erected altars and offered sacrifice as though he were a god, and he was the first in whose honour paeans were sung, one of which is recorded as having begun as follows :", "3774": "“The praise of our fair Græcia's king That cornes from Sparta, let us sing, Io pæan.”", "3775": "Nay, the Samians decreed that their festival, called Heræs in honour of Hera, should be called Lysandreia.", "3776": "He always kept the poet Chœrilus in his train, that be might celebrate his actions in verse, and when Antilochus wrote some stanzas in his praise he was so pleased that he filled his hat with silver and gave it to him.", "3777": "Antimachus of Kolophon and one Nikeratus of Heraklea each wrote a poem on his deeds, and competed before him for a prize, at the Lysandreia.", "3778": "He gave the crown of victory to Nikeratus, which so enraged Antimachus that he suppressed his poem.", "3779": "Plato, who was a young man at that time, and admired the poetry of Antimachus, consoled him for his defeat by point­ ing out to him that the illiterate are as much to be pitied for their ignorance as the blind are for their loss of sight.", "3780": "When, however, the harper Aristonous, who had six times won the victory at the Pythian games, to show his regard to Lysander, told him that if he won the prize again he intended to have his name proclaimed by the herald as Lysander's servant, Lysander said, “Does he mean to proclaim himself my slave ?", "3781": "\"XIX.", "3782": "This ambition of Lysander was only a burden to the great, and to those of equal rank with himself.", "3783": "TInt as none dared to thwart him, his pride and insolence of temper became intolerable.", "3784": "He proceeded to ex­ travagant lengths both when he rewarded and when he punished, bestowing absolute government over important cities upon his friends, while he was satisfied with nothing short of the death of an enemy, and regarded banishment as too mild a sentence.", "3785": "Indeed, when subsequently to this he feared lest the chiefs of the popular party at Miletus might escape, and also wished to tempt those who had concealed themselves to leave their hiding-place, he swore that he would not harm them ;", "3786": "and when they, trusting to his word, came forward and gave themselves up, he delivered them over to the aristocratical party to be put to death, to the number of not less than eight hundred men.", "3787": "In all the other cities, too, an indis­ criminate massacre of the popular party took place, as Lysander not only put to death his own personal enemies, but also those persons against whom any of his friends in each city might happen to have a grudge.", "3788": "Wherefore Eteokles the Lacedæmonian was thought to have spoken well, when he said that “Greece could net have borne two Lysanders.\"", "3789": "We are told by Theophrastus that Archestratus made the same remark about Alkibiades :", "3790": "although in his case it was insolence, luxury and self-will which gave so much offence, whereas Lysander's harsh, merciless disposition was what made his power so hateful and terrible.", "3791": "At first the Lacedæmonians paid no attention to com­ plaints brought against him;", "3792": "but when Pharnabazus, who had been wronged by Lysander's depredations on his country, sent an embassy to Sparta to demand justice, the Ephors were much enraged.", "3793": "They put to death Thorax, one of his friends, whom they found in possession of silver coin, and they sent a skytale to him bidding him appear before them.", "3794": "I will now explain what a skytale was.", "3795": "When the Ephors sent out any one as general or admiral of their forces, they used to prepare two round sticks of wood of exactly the same length and thickness, corre­ sponding with one another at the ends.", "3796": "One of these they kept themselves, and the other they gave to the person sent out.", "3797": "These sticks they call sky tales.", "3798": "Now when they desire to transmit some secret of importance to him, they wrap a long narrow strip of paper * like a strap round the skytale which is in their possession, leaving no intervals, but completely covering the stick along its whole length with the paper.", "3799": "When this has been done they write upon the paper while it is upon the stick, and after writing they unwind the paper and send it to the general without the stick.", "3800": "When he receives it, it is entirely illegible, as the letters have no connection, but he winds it round the stick in his possession so that the folds correspond to one another, and then the whole message can be read.", "3801": "The paper is called skytale as well as the stick, as a thing measured is called by the name of the measure.", "3802": "XX.", "3803": "Lysander, when this skytale reached him at the Hellespont, was much troubled, and as he especially feared the accusations of Pharnabazus, he hastened to confer with him, with a view to settling their dispute.", "3804": "When they met, Lysander begged him to write a second letter to the Spartan government, stating that he had not received any wrong, and that he had no charge to bring against him.", "3805": "It was, however, a case of \"diamond cut diamond,\" as the proverb has it, for Pharnabazus, while he ostensibly promised to do everything that Lysander wished, and to send publicly a letter dictated by him, had by him another privately-written despatch, and when the seals were about to be affixed, as the two letters looked exactly alike, he substituted the privately-written one for that which Lysander had seen.", "3806": "When then Lysander reached Lacedæmon, and proceeded, as it customary, to the senate- house, he handed over to the Ephors this letter of Pharna­ bazus, with the conviction that thereby he was quashing the most important of all the charges against himself;", "3807": "for Pharnabazus was much loved by the Lacedæmonians, because he had taken their part in the war more zealously than any other Persian satrap.", "3808": "When, however, the Ephors showed him the letter, and he perceived that ‘ ‘ Others besides Odysseus * can contrive,\" he retired in great confusion, and a few days afterwards, on meeting with the Ephors, informed them that he must go and pay a sacrifice to Ammon'f which he had vowed before winning his victories.", "3809": "Some historians tell us that this was true, and that when he was besieging Aphytæ, a city in Thrace, the god Ammon appeared to him in a dream ;", "3810": "in consequence of which he raised the siege, imagining this to be the will of the god, ordered the inhabitants to sacrifice to Ammon, and himself made preparations for proceeding at once to Libya to propitiate the god.", "3811": "Most persons, however, imagined that this was a mere pretence, but that really he feared the Ephors, and was unable to endure the harsh discipline of life at Sparta, and therefore wished to travel abroad, just as a horse longs for liberty when he has been brought back out of wide pastures to his stable and his accustomed work.", "3812": "As to the cause which Ephorus gives for these travels of his, I will mention that presently.", "3813": "XXI.", "3814": "After having with great difficulty obtained permission from the Ephors, he set sail.", "3815": "Now as soon as he left the country, the two kings, perceiving that by means of his device of governing the cities of Greece by aristocratic clubs devoted to his interest he was virtually master of the whole country, determined to restore the popular party to power and to turn out Lysander's friends.", "3816": "When however this movement was set on foot, and when first of all the Athenians starting from Phyle attacked the Thirty and overpowered them, Lysander returned in haste, and prevailed upon the Lacedæmonians to assist the cause of oligarchy and put down these popular risings.", "3817": "They decided that the first government which they would aid should be that of the Thirty, at Athens ;", "3818": "and they proposed to send them a hundred talents for the expenses of the war, and Lysander himself as their general.", "3819": "But the two kings, envying his power, and fearing that he would take Athens a second time, determined that one of them­ selves should proceed thither in his stead.", "3820": "Pausanias accordingly went to Athens, nominally to assist the Thirty against the people, but really to put an end to the war, for fear that Lysander by means of his friends might a second time become master of Athens.", "3821": "This he easily effected;", "3822": "and by reconciling all classes of Athenians to one another and putting an end to the revolution, he made it impossible for Lysander to win fresh laurels.", "3823": "But when shortly afterwards the Athenians again revolted he was much blamed for having allowed the popular party to gather strength and break out of bounds, after it had once been securely bridled by an oligarchy, while Lysander on the contrary gained the credit of having, in every city, arranged matters not with a view to theatrical effect, but to the solid advantage of Sparta.", "3824": "XXII.", "3825": "He was bold in his speech, and overbearing to those who opposed him.", "3826": "When the Argives had a dispute with the Lacedæmonians about their frontier, and seemed to have justice on their side, Lysander drew his sword, saying, “ He that is master of this is in possession of the best argument about frontier lines.\"", "3827": "When some Megarian in a public meeting used considerable freedom of speech towards him, he answered, “ My friend, your words require a city.", "3828": "to back them.\"", "3829": "He asked the Bœotians, who wished to remain neutral, whether he should pass through their country with spears held upright or levelled.", "3830": "On the occasion of the revolt of Corinth, when he brought up the Lacedæmonians to assault their walls, he observed that they seemed un­ willing to attack.", "3831": "At this moment a hare was seen to leap across the ditch, upon which he said, \" Are you not ashamed to fear such enemies as these, who are so lazy as to allow hares to sleep upon their walls ?\"", "3832": "When king Agis died, leaving a brother, Agesilaus, and a son Leoty­ chides who was supposed to be his, Lysander, who was attached to Agesilaus, prevailed upon him to lay claim to the crown as being a genuine descendant of Herakles.", "3833": "For Leotychides laboured under the imputation of being the son of Alkibiades, who carried on an intrigue with Timæa the wife of Agis, when he was living in Sparta as an exile.", "3834": "It is said that Agis, after making a cal­ culation about the time of his wife's pregnancy treated Leotychides with neglect and openly denied that he was his father.", "3835": "When however he was brought to Heræa during his last illness, and was at the point of death, he was induced by the entreaties of the youth and his friends to declare in the presence of many witnesses that Leotychides was his legitimate son, and died begging them to testify this fact to the Lacedæmonians.", "3836": "They did indeed so testify in favour of Leotychides ;", "3837": "and although Agesilaus was a man of great distinction, and had the powerful assistance of Lysander, yet his claims to the crown were seriously damaged by one Diopeithes, a man deep read in oracular lore, who quoted the following prophecy in reference to the lameness of Agesilaus:", "3838": "\"Proud Sparta, resting on two equal feet, Beware lest lameness on thy kings alight;", "3839": "Lest wars unnumbered toss thee to and fro, And thou thyself be ruined in the fight.", "3840": "\"But when many were persuaded by this oracle and looked to Leotychides as the true heir, Lysander said that they did not rightly understand it;", "3841": "for what it meant was, he argued, not that the god forbade a lame man to i eign, but that the kingdom would be lame of one foot if base-born men should share the crown with those who were of the true race of Herakles.", "3842": "By this argument and his own great personal influence he prevailed, and Agesilaus became king of Sparta.", "3843": "XXIII.", "3844": "Lysander now at once began to urge him to make a campaign in Asia, holding out to him hopes of conquering the Persians and making himself the greatest man in the world.", "3845": "He also wrote to his friends in Asia, bidding them ask the Lacedæmonians to send them Age­ silaus to act as their commander in chief in the war with the Persians.", "3846": "They obeyed, and sent an embassy to demand him:", "3847": "which was as great an honour to Agesilaus as his being made king, and which, like the other, he owed to Lysander alone.", "3848": "However, ambitious natures, though in other respects fit for great commands, often fail in important enterprises through jealousy of their rivals;", "3849": "for they make those men their opponents who would otherwise have been their assistants in obtaining success.", "3850": "On this occasion Agesilaus took Lysander with him, as the chief of his board of thirty counsellors, and treated him as his greatest friend;", "3851": "but when they reached Asia, the people there would not pay their court to Agesilaus, whom they did not know, while all Lysander's friends flocked round him to renew their former intimacy, and all those who feared him assiduously courted his favour.", "3852": "Thus, as in a play we often see that a messenger or servant engrosses all the interest of the spectators and really acts the leading part, while he who wears the crown and bears the sceptre is hardly heard to speak, so now it was the counsellor who obtained all the honours due to a com­ mander in chief, while the king had merely the title without any influence whatever.", "3853": "It was necessary, no doubt, that this excessive power of Lysander should be curtailed, and he himself forced to take the second place:", "3854": "but yet to disgrace and ruin a friend and one from whom he had received great benefits, would have been unworthy of Agesilaus.", "3855": "Consequently at first he did not entrust him with the conduct of matters of importance, and did not give him any separate command.", "3856": "In the next place, he invariably disobliged, and refused the applications, of any persons on whose behalf he understood Lysander to be interested, and thus gradually undermined his power.", "3857": "When however after many failures Lysander perceived that his interest on his friends' behalf was a drawback rather than an advantage to them, he ceased from urging their claims, and moreover begged them not to pay their court to him, but to attach themselves to the king, and to those who were able to promote and reward their followers.", "3858": "Most of them on hearing this no longer troubled him on matters of business, but continued on the most friendly terms with him, and angered Agesilaus more than ever by the manner in which they flocked round him in public places and walks, showing thereby their dislike to the king.", "3859": "Agesilaus now bestowed the govern­ ment of cities and the conduct of important expeditions upon various obscure soldiers, but appointed Lysander his carver, and then in an insulting manner told the lonians to go and pay their court to his carver.", "3860": "At this Lysander determined to have an interview with him, and there took place a short and truly Laconian dialogue between them.", "3861": "Lysander said, “", "3862": "You know well, Agesilaus, how to humble your friends.\"", "3863": "\"Yes,\" answered he, \" if they desire to be greater than I am:", "3864": "but those who increase my power have a right to share it.\"", "3865": "“ Perhaps,\" said Lysander, “ you have spoken better than I have acted;", "3866": "however, if it be only on account of the multitude whose eyes are upon us, I beg you to appoint me to some post in which I may be of more use to you, and cause you less annoyance than at present.", "3867": "\"XXIV.", "3868": "Upon this he was sent on a special mission to the Hellespont, where although he was at enmity with Agesilaus, he did not neglect his duty, but, finding that the Persian Spithridates, a man of noble birth and com­ manding a considerable force, was on bad terms with Pharnabazus, he induced him to revolt, and brought him back with him to Agesilaus.", "3869": "After this Lysander was given no further share in the conduct of the war, and after some time sailed back to Sparta in disgrace, full of rage against Agesilaus, and hating the whole Spartan constitution more than ever.", "3870": "He now determined without any further delay to put in practice the revolutionary plans which he had so long meditated.", "3871": "These were as follows :", "3872": "—", "3873": "When the descendants of Herakles, after asso­ ciating with the Dorians, returned to Peloponnesus, their race grew and flourished at Sparta.", "3874": "Yet it was not every family of the descendants of Herakles, but only the children of Eurypon and Agis who had a right to the throne, while the others gained no advantage from their noble birth, as all honours in the state were given according to merit.", "3875": "Now Lysander, being a descendant of Herakles, after he had gained great glory by his achievements and obtained many friends and immense influence, could not endure that the state should reap such groat advantages from his success, and yet continue to bo ruled by men of no better family than himself.", "3876": "He meditated, therefore, the abolition of the exclusive right to the throne possessed by these two families, and throw­ ing it open to all the descendants of Herakles, or even, according to some historians, to all Spartans alike, in order that the crown might not belong to the descendants of IIerakles, but to those who were judged to be like Herakles in glory, which had raised Herakles himself to a place among the gods themselves.", "3877": "If the throne were disposed of in this manner he imagined that no Spartan would be chosen king before himself.", "3878": "XXV.", "3879": "First then he proposed to endeavour to win over his countrymen to his views by his own powers of persua­ sion, and with this object studied an oration written for him by Kleon of Halikarnassus.", "3880": "Soon, however, he per­ ceived that so new and important a scheme of reform would require more violent means to carry it into effect, and, just as in plays supernatural machinery is resorted to where ordinary human means would fail to produce the wished-for termination, even so did Lysander invent oracular responses and prophecies and bring them to bear on the minds of his countrymen, feeling that he would gain but little by pronouncing Kleon's oration, unless the Spartans had previously, by superstition and religious terrors, been brought into a state of feeling suitable for its reception.", "3881": "Ephorus relates in his history that Lysander endeavoured by means of one Pherekles to bribe the priestess at Delphi, and afterwards those of Dodona;", "3882": "and that, as this attempt failed, he himself went to the oracle of Ammon and had an interview with the priests there, to whom he offered a large sum of money.", "3883": "They also indignantly refused to aid his schemes, and sent an embassy to Sparta to charge him with having attempted to corrupt them.", "3884": "He was tried and acquitted, upon which the Libyans, as they were leaving the country, said :", "3885": "—“", "3886": "We at any rate, 0 Spartans, will give more righteous judgments when you come to dwell amongst us \"-for there is an ancient oracle which says that the Lacedæmonians shall some day settle in Libya.", "3887": "Now as to the whole framework of Lysander's plot, which was of no ordinary kind, and did not take its rise from accidental circumstances, but consisted, like a mathematical demon­ stration, of many complicated intrigues all tending to one fixed point, I will give a short abstract of it extracted from the works of Ephorus, who was both an historian and a philosopher.", "3888": "XXVI.", "3889": "There was a woman in Pontus who gave out that she was pregnant by Apollo.", "3890": "As might be expected, many disbelieved in hor pretensions, but many more believed in them, so that when a male child was born of her, it was cared for and educated at the charge of many eminent persons.", "3891": "The child, for some reason or other, was given the name of Silenus.", "3892": "Lysander, starting with these materials, constructed the rest of the story out of his own imagination.", "3893": "He was assisted in his scheme by many persons of the highest respectability, who unsuspiciously propagated the fable about the birth of the child:", "3894": "and who also procured another mysterious story from Delphi, which they carefully spread abroad at Sparta, to the effect that some oracles of vast antiquity are guarded by the priests at Delphi, in writings which it is not lawful to read ;", "3895": "nor may any one examine them or look upon them, until in the fulness of time one born of Apollo shall come, and after clearly proving his birth to the guardians of these writings, shall take the tablets which contain them.", "3896": "This having been previously arranged, Silenus's part was to go and demand the oracles as Apollo's child, while those of the priests who were in the plot were to make inquiries and examine carefully into his birth, and at length were to appear convinced of the truth of the story, and show the writings to him, as being really the child of Apollo.", "3897": "He was to read aloud in the presence of many persons all the oracles contained in the tablets, especially one which said that it would be better for the Spartans to choose their kings from the best of the citizens.", "3898": "Silenus was nearly grown up, and the time to make the attempt had almost arrived, when the wholo plot was ruined by the cowardice of one of the principal conspirators, whose heart failed him when the moment for action arrived.", "3899": "None of these particulars, however, were discovered till after Lysander's death.", "3900": "XXVII.", "3901": "Before Agesilaus returned from Asia Lysan­ der perished in a Bœotian war in which he had become involved, or rather had involved Greece;", "3902": "for various accounts are given of it, some laying the blame upon him, some upon the Thebans, and some upon both.", "3903": "It was urged against the Thebans that they overturned the altar at Aulis and scattered the sacrifice,.", "3904": "and also that Andro­ kleides and Amphitheus, having been bribed by Persia to induce all the Greek states to attack the Lacedæmonians, had invaded the Phokian territory and laid it waste.", "3905": "On the other hand Lysander is said to have been angry that the Thebans alone should claim their right to a tenth part of the plunder obtained in the war, though the other allies made no such demand, and that they should have expressed indignation at Lysander's sending such large sums of money to Sparta.", "3906": "He was especially wroth with them for having afforded the Athenians the means of freeing themselves from the domination of the Thirty, which he had himself established, and which the Lacedæmonians had \"endeavoured to support by decreeing that all exiled Athenians of the popular party might be brought back to Athens from whatever place they might be found in, and that those who protected them against being furcibly brought back should be treated as outlaws.", "3907": "In answer to this the Thebans passed a decree worthy of themselves and deserving of comparison with the great acts of Herakles and Dionysus, the benefactors of mankind.", "3908": "Its provisions were, that every city and every house in Bœotia should be open to those Athenians who required shelter, that whoever did not assist an Athenian exile against any one who tried to force him away should be fined a talent, and that if any marched under arms through Bœotia tc attack the despots at Athens, no Theban should either see or hear them.", "3909": "Not only did they make this kindly and truly Hellenic decree, but they also acted up to the spirit of it;", "3910": "for when Thrasybulus and his party seized Phyle, they started from Thebes, supplied with arms and necessaries by the Thebans, who also assisted them to keep their enterprise secret and to begin it successfully.", "3911": "These were the charges brought against the Thebans by Lysander.XXVIII.", "3912": "His naturally harsh temper was now soured by age, and he urged on the Ephors into declaring war against the Thebans, and appointing him their general to carry it on.", "3913": "Subsequently, however, they sent the king, Pausanias, with an army, to co-operate with him.", "3914": "Pausanias marched in a circuitous course over Mount Kithæron, meaning to invade Bœotia on that side, while Lysander with a large force came to meet him through Phokis.", "3915": "He took the city of Orchomenus, which voluntarily came over to his side, and he took Lebadeia by storm and plundered it.", "3916": "He now sent a letter to Pausanias bidding him march through the territory of Platæa and join him at Haliartus, promising that at day break he would be before the walls of Haliartus.", "3917": "The messenger who carried this letter fell into the hands of the enemy, and the letter was taken to Thebes.", "3918": "Here­ upon the Thebans entrusted their city to the care cf the Athenians, who had come to their aid, and themselves started early in the evening, reached Haliartus a little before Lysander, and threw a body of troops into the town.", "3919": "Lysander, on discovering this, at first determined to halt his army on a hill in the neighbourhood and await the arrival of Pausanias :", "3920": "but as the day went on ho could remain quiet no longer, but got his men under arms, harangued the allied troops, and led them in a close column down the road directly towards the city.", "3921": "Upon this those of the Thebans who had remained outside the walls, leaving the city on their left hand, marched to attack the extreme rear of the Lacedæmonians, near the fountain which is called Kissousa,* in which there is a legend that Dionysus was washed by his nurses after his birth;", "3922": "for the water is wine-coloured and clear, and very sweet-tasted.", "3923": "Round the fountain is a grove of the Cretan Storax-tress,† which the people of Haliartus point to as a proof of Rhadamanthus having lived there.", "3924": "They also show his tomb, which they call Alea.", "3925": "The sepulchre of Alkmena too is close by:", "3926": "for the story goes that she married Rhadamanthus here after the death of Amphitryon.", "3927": "Meanwhile the Thebans in the city, together with the citizens of Haliartus themselves, remained quiet until Lysander and the first ranks of the enemy came close to the walls, and then suddenly opening the gates they charged and slew him together with his soothsayer and some few more:", "3928": "for most of them fled quickly back to the main body.", "3929": "However as the Thebans did not desist but pressed on, the whole mass took to flight and escaped to the neighbouring hills with a loss of about one thousand men.", "3930": "Three hundred of the Thebans also fell in an attack which they made on the enemy in rough and difficult ground.", "3931": "These men had been accused of favouring the Lacedæmonians, and it was to wipe out this unjust imputation before the eyes of their fellow citizens that they showed themselves so reckless of their lives.", "3932": "XXIX.", "3933": "When Pausanias heard of this disaster, he was marching from Platæa towards Thespiae.", "3934": "He at once put his troops in array and proceeded to Haliartus.", "3935": "Here likewise arrived Thrasybulus from Thebes, with an Athenian force.", "3936": "On his arrival, Pausanias proposed to apply for permission to carry away the dead.", "3937": "This proposal greatly shocked the older Spartans, who could not refrain from going to the king and imploring him not to receive back Lysander'a corpse by a truce * which was in itself a confession of defeat, but to let them fight for his body and either bury it as victors, or else to share their general's fate as became them.", "3938": "However, in spite of these representations, Pausanias, perceiving that it would be no easy task to overcome the Thebans, flushed as they were with the victory of the day before, and that, as Lysander's body lay close under the walls of the town, it would be almost impossible, even if they were victorious, to recover it otherwise than by treaty, sent a herald, obtained the necessary truce, and led away his forces.", "3939": "As soon as the Spartans crossed the Bœotian frontier they buried the body of Lysander in the territory of the friendly and allied city of Panope, in Phokis, where at the present day his monument stands by the side of the road from Chæronea to Delphi.†", "3940": "It is said that while the army was encamped there one of the Phokians, while describing the battle to another who had not been present, said that the enemy fell upon them just after Lysander had crossed the Hoplites.t", "3941": "A Spartan who was present was surprised at this word, and enquired of Lysander's friend, what he meant by the Hoplites, for he did not understand it.", "3942": "“ It was where,\" answered he, \" the enemy overthrew our front ranks ;", "3943": "for they call the stream which runs past the city the Hoplites.\"", "3944": "On hearing these words the Spartan burst into tears, and exclaimed, “ How impossible is it for a man to escape his fate :", "3945": "” -for it seems Lysander had received an oracular warning in these words:", "3946": "\"I warn thee, shun Hoplites roaring track, And th᾽ earth-born snake that stings behind thy back.\"", "3947": "Some say that the Hoplites does not run by Haliartus, but that it is the name of a torrent which joins the river Philarus near Koronea, which used to be called the Hoplias, and is now called Isomantus.", "3948": "The man who killed Lysander was a citizen of Haliartus named Neo­ chorus, who bore a snake as the device upon his shield, which it is supposed was alluded to by the oracle.", "3949": "We are also told that during the Peloponnesian war the Thebans received an oracle from Apollo Ismenius, referring immediately to the battle of Delium, and also to this battle at Haliartus, which took place thirty years after­ wards.", "3950": "It ran as follows:", "3951": "Beware the boundary, when you hunt", "3952": "The wolf with spears;", "3953": "And shun the Orchalian hill, the fox's haunt, For endless years.\"", "3954": "The boundary alludes to the country near Delium, which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia, and the Orchalian hill, which is now called Fox-hill, lies in the territory of Haliartus, on the side nearest Mount Helikon.", "3955": "XXX.", "3956": "The death of Lysander, as related above, grieved the Spartans so much that they impeached their king on a capital charge, and he, fearing the result of the trial, fled to Tegea, where he spent the remainder of his life in the sanctuary of Athena as a suppliant of the goddess.", "3957": "Moreover the poverty of Lysander, which was discovered after his death, made his virtue more splendid, for al­ though he had handled great sums of money, and pos­ sessed immense power;", "3958": "though his favour had been courted by wealthy cities, and even by the great king of Persia himself, yet Theopompus tells us that he did not in the least degree improve his family estate :", "3959": "an account which we may the more readily believe, as it is told us by a historian who is more prone to censure than to admiration.", "3960": "In later times we learn from the historian Ephorus that some dispute arose between the allied cities which ren­ dered it necessary to examine Lysander's papers, and that Agesilaus went to his house for this purpose.", "3961": "Here he found the scroll upon which was written the speech about altering the constitution, advising the Spartans to abolish the hereditary right to the throne enjoyed by the old royal families of Eurypon and Agis, and to throw it open to the best of the citizens without restriction.", "3962": "Agesilaus was eager to publish this speech abroad, and show his fellow-countrymen what sort of a man Lysander had really been;", "3963": "but Lakratides, a wise man, who was at that timo chief of the board of Ephors, restrained him, pointing out that it would be wrong to disturb Lysander in his grave, and that it would be better that so clever and insidious a composition should be buried with him.", "3964": "Among other honours which were paid to Lysander after death, the Spartans fined the suitors of his daughters, because when after his death his poverty was discovered, they refused to marry them, thus showing that they had paid their court to him when they believed him to be rich, and neglected him when his poverty proved him to have been just and honourable.", "3965": "It appears that in Sparta there were actions at law against men who did not marry, or who married too late in life or unbecomingly:", "3966": "under which last head came those who tried to marry into rich families, instead of marrying persons of good birth and their own friends.", "3967": "This is what we have fo nd to tell about the life of Lysander.", "3968": "I. LUCIUS CORNELIUS SULLA,* by birth, belonged to the Patricians, whom we may consider as corresponding to the Eupatridæ.", "3969": "Among his ancestors is enumerated Rufinus,† who became consul;", "3970": "but is less noted for attaining this honour than for the infamy which befell him.", "3971": "He was de­ tected in possessing above ten pounds' weight of silver plate, which amount the law did not permit, and he was ejected from the Senate.", "3972": "His immediate descendants continued in a mean condition, and Sulla himself was brought up with no great paternal property.", "3973": "When he was a young man he lived in lodgings, for which he paid some moderate sum, which he was afterwards reproached with, when ho was prospering beyond his deserts, as some thought.", "3974": "It was after the Libyan expedition, when he was assuming airs of importance and a haughty tone, that a man of high rank and character said to him, How can you be an honest man who are now so rich, and yet your father left you nothing ?", "3975": "For though the Romans no longer remained true to their former integrity and purity of morals, but had declined from the old standard, and let in luxury and expense among them, they still considered it equally a matter of reproach for a man to have wasted the property that he once had, and not to remain as poor as his ancestors.", "3976": "Subsequently when Sulla was in the possession of power and was putting many to death, a man of the class of Libertini, who was suspected of concealing a proscribed person, and for this offence was going to be thrown down the Tarpeian rock, reproached Sulla with the fact that they had lived together for some time in one house;", "3977": "that he had paid two thousand sestertii for his lodgings, which were in the upper part of the house, and Sulla three thou­ sand for the lower rooms ;", "3978": "and, consequently, that between their fortunes there was only the difference of a thousand sestertii, which is equivalent to two hundred and fifty Attic drachmae.", "3979": "This is what is recorded of Sulla's early condition.", "3980": "II.", "3981": "As for his person, we may judge of it by his statues, except his eyes and complexion.", "3982": "His eyes were an un­ commonly pure and piercing blue, which the colour of his face rendered still more terrific, being spotted with rough red blotches, interspersed with the white;", "3983": "from which circumstance, it is said, he got his name bulla, which had reference to his complexion;", "3984": "and one of the Athenian satirists * in derision made the following verse in allusion to it:", "3985": "“ Sulla is a mulberry besprinkled with meal.", "3986": "\"It is not out of place to avail ourselves of such traits of a man who is said to have had so strong a natural love of buffoonery, that when he was still young and of no repute, he spent his time and indulged himself among mimi † and jesters ;", "3987": "and when he was at the head of the state, he daily got together from the scena and the theatre the lewdest persons, with whom he would drink and enter into a contest of coarse witticisms, in which he had no regard to his age, and, besides degrading the dignity of his office, he neglected many matters that required atten­ tion.", "3988": "It was not Sulla's habit when he was at table to trouble himself about anything serious, but though he was energetic and rather morose at other times, he underwent a complete change as soon as he went into company and was seated at an entertainment, for he was then exceedingly complaisant to singers of mimi and dancers, and easy of access and affable.", "3989": "This habit of relaxation seems to have produced in him the vice of being exceedingly addicted to women and that passion for enjoyment which stuck to him to his old age.", "3990": "In his youth he was for a long time attached to one Metrobius,* an actor.", "3991": "The following incident also happened to him :", "3992": "—", "3993": "He formed an attachment to a woman named Nicopolis, who was of mean condition, but rich, and from long familiarity and the favour which he found on account of his youth, he came to be considered as a lover, and when the woman died she left him her heir.", "3994": "He also succeeded to the inheritance of his step-mother, who loved him as her own son ;", "3995": "and in this way he acquired a moderate fortune.", "3996": "III.", "3997": "On being appointed Quæstor to Marius in his first consulship, he sailed with him to Libya, to prosecute the war against Jugurtha.†", "3998": "In this campaign he showed himself a man of merit, and by availing himself of a favourable opportunity he made a friend of Bocchus, king of the Numidians.", "3999": "Some ambassadors of Bocchus who had escaped from Numidian robbers were hospitably received by Sulla, and sent back with presents and a safe conduct.", "4000": "Now Bocchus happened for some time to have disliked his son-in-law Jugurtha, whom he was also afraid of;", "4001": "and as Jugurtha had been defeated by the Romans and had fled to Bocchus, he formed a design to make him his prisoner and deliver him to his enemies;", "4002": "but as he wished Sulla to be the agent rather than himself, he invited Sulla to come and see him.", "4003": "Bulla communicated the message to Marius, and, taking a few soldiers with him, ventured on the hazardous enterprise of putting himself in the hands of a barbarian who never kept his faith even with his friends, and this for the purpose of having another man betrayed to him.", "4004": "Bocchus, having got both of them in his power, was under the necessity of being treacherous to one of them, and after great fluctuations in his resolution, he finally carried into effect his original perfidious design, and surrendered Jugurtha to Sulla.", "4005": "Marius enjoyed the triumph for the capture of Jugurtha, but the honour of the success was given to Sulla through dislike of Marius, which caused Marius some uneasiness;", "4006": "for Bulla was naturally of an arrogant disposition, and as this was the first occasion on which he had been raised from a mean condition and obscurity to be of some note among his fellow-citizens, and had tasted the sweets of distinction, he carried his pride so far as to have a seal-ring cut, on which the occurrence was represented, and he wore it constantly.", "4007": "The subject represented was Bocchus surrendering and Sulla receiving the surrender of Jugurtha.", "4008": "IV.", "4009": "Though Marius was annoyed at this, yet as he still thought Sulla beneath his jealousy, he employed him in his campaigns-in his second consulship in the capacity of legate, and in his third consulship as tribune;", "4010": "* and by his instrumentality Marius effected many important objects.", "4011": "In his capacity of legate Sulla took Copillius, king of the Tectosages ;", "4012": "f and when he was a tribune he persuaded the powerful and populous nation of the Marsi‡ to become friends and allies to Rome.", "4013": "But now perceiving that Marius was jealous of him, and was no longer willing to give him the opportunity of distinguish­ ing himself, but opposed his further rise, Sulla attached himself to Catulus, the colleague of Marius, who was an honest man, but inactive as a soldier.", "4014": "Sulla being entrusted by Catulus with all matters of the greatest moment, thus attained both influence and reputation.", "4015": "In his military operations he reduced a large part of the Alpine barbarians;", "4016": "and on one occasion, w hen there was a scarcity of provisions in the camp, he undertook to supply the want, which he did so effectually that the soldiers of Catulus had not only abundance for themselves, but were enabled to relieve the army of Marius.", "4017": "This, as Bulla himself says, greatly annoyed Marius.", "4018": "Now this enmity, so slight and childish in its foundation and origin, was continued through civil war and the inve­ terate animosity of faction, till it resulted in tht establish­ ment of a tyranny and the complete overthrow of the constitution;", "4019": "which shows that Euripides * was a wise man and well acquainted with the diseases incident to states, when he warned against ambition, as the most dangerous and the worst of daemons to those who are governed by her.", "4020": "V.", "4021": "Sulla now thought that his military reputation entitled him to aspire to a political career, and accordingly as soon as the campaign was ended he began to seek the favour of the people, and became a candidate for the prætor­ ship ;", "4022": "but he was disappointed in his expectations.", "4023": "He at­ tributed his failure to the populace, for he says that they knew he was a friend of Bocchus, and if he filled the office of ædile before that of prætor, they expected to have brilliant hunting exhibitions and fights of Libyan † wild beasts, and that therefore they elected others to the prætorship, with the view of forcing him to serve as ædile.", "4024": "But that Sulla does not state the real cause of his failure appears evident from what followed.", "4025": "In the next year he obtained the prætorship, having gained the votes of the people, partly by solicitation and partly by bribery.", "4026": "It was in allusion to this, and during his prætorship when he was threatening Cæsar* to use his own authority against him, that Cæsar replied with a laugh, You are right in con­ sidering your authority as your own, for you bought it.", "4027": "After the expiration of his prætorship he was sent to Cappadocia, for the purpose, as it was given out, of restoring Ariobarzanest to his power, but in reality to check Mithridates,t who was very active and was acquir­ ing new territory and dominion as extensive as what he already had.", "4028": "Sulla took with him no large force of his own, but meeting with zealous co-operation on the part of the allies, he slaughtered a great number of the Cappa­ docians.", "4029": "and on another occasion a still greater number of Armenians who had come to the relief of the Cappadocians, drove out Gordius, and declared Ariobarzanes king.", "4030": "While he was staying near the Euphrates, the Parthian general Orobazus, a commander of King Arsaces,§ had an inter­ view with him, which was the first occasion on which the two nations met;", "4031": "and this also may be considered as one of the very fortunate events in Sulla's successful career, that he was the first Roman to whom the Parthians ad­ dressed themselves in their request for an alliance and friendship with Rome.", "4032": "Sulla is said to have had three chairs placed, one for Ariobarzanes, another for Orobazus, and a third for himself, on which he took his seat between the two, while the business was transacted.", "4033": "The king of the Parthians is said to have put Orobazus to death for submitting to this indignity ;", "4034": "as to Sulla, some commended him for his haughty treatment of the barbarians, while others blamed him for his arrogance and ill-timed pride.", "4035": "It is said there was a man among the attendants of Orobazus, a Chaldæan,* who examined the countenance of Sulla and observed the movements of his mind and body, not as an idle spectator, but studying his character according to the principles of his art, and he declared that of necessity that man must become the first of men, and he wondered that he could endure not to be the first already.", "4036": "On his return to Rome Censorinust instituted proceedings against Sulla on the charge of having received large sums of money, contrary to express law, from a king who was a friend and ally of the Romans.", "4037": "Censorinus did not bring the matter to a trial, but gave up the prose­ cution.", "4038": "VI.", "4039": "His quarrel with Marius was kindled anew by fresh matter supplied by the ostentation of King Bocchus, who, with the view of flattering the Roman people and pleasing Sulla, dedicated in the Capitol some figures bearing trophies, and by the side of them placed a gilded figure of Jugurtha being surrendered by himself to Sulla.", "4040": "Marius was highly incensed and attempted to take the figures down, while others were ready to support Sulla, and the city was all but in a flame through the two factions, when the Social War which had long smouldered burst forth in a blaze upon Rome and stopped the civil discord.", "4041": "In this most serious war, which was attended with many varia­ tions of fortune, and brought on the Romans the greatest misery and the most formidable dangers, Marius by his inability to accomplish anything of importance showed that military excellence requires bodily vigour and strength:", "4042": "but Sulla by his great exploits obtained among his own citizens the reputation of a great commander, among his friends the reputation of the very greatest, and among his enemies too the reputation of the most fortunate of generals.", "4043": "Sulla did not behave like Timotheus* the son of Konon, whose success was attributed by his enemies to fortune, and they had paintings made in which he was represented asleep while Fortune was throwing a net over the cities, all which he took in a very boorish way, and got into a passion with his enemies, as if they were thus attempting to deprive him of the honour due to his exploits;", "4044": "and on one occasion, returning from a successful expedition, he said to the people, \" Well, Fortune has had no share in this campaign, at least, Athenians.\"", "4045": "Now, as the story goes, Fortune † showed her spite to Timotheus in return for his arrogance, and he never did anything great afterwards, but failing in all his undertakings and becoming odious to the people, he was at last banished from the city.", "4046": "But Bulla by gladly accepting such felicitations on his prosperity and such admiration, and even contributing to strengthen these notions and to invest them with somewhat of a sacred character, made all his exploits depend on Fortune;", "4047": "whether it was that he did this for the sake of display, or because he really had such opinions of the deity.", "4048": "Indeed he has recorded in his memoirs, that the actions which he resolved upon without deliberation, and on the spur of the moment, turned out more successfully than those which appeared to have been best considered.", "4049": "And again, from the passage in which he says that he was made more for fortune than for war, he appears to attribute more to fortune than to his merit, and to consider himself com­ pletely as the creature of the daemon ;", "4050": "* nay, he cites as a proof of good fortune due to the favour of the gods his harmony with Metellus, a mail of the same rank with himself, and his father-in-law, for he expected that Metellus would cause him a good deal of trouble, whereas be was a most accommodating colleague..", "4051": "Further, in his memoirs which he dedicated to Lucullus, he advises him to think nothing so safe as what the dæmon enjoins during the night.", "4052": "When he was leaving the city with his troops for the Social War, as he tells us in his memoirs, a great chasm opened in the earth near Laverna, † from which a quantity of fire burst forth, and a bright Same rose like a column to the skies.", "4053": "The diviners said that a brave man, of an appearance different from and superior to ordinary men, would obtain the command and relieve the city from its present troubles.", "4054": "bulla says this man was himself, for the golden colour of his hair was a pecu­ liarity in his personal appearance, and that he had no diffidence about bearing testimony to his own merits after so many illustrious exploits.", "4055": "So much as to his religious opinions.", "4056": "As to the other parts of his character, he was irregular and inconsistent:", "4057": "he would take away much, and give more;", "4058": "he would confer honours without any good reason, and do a grievous wrong with just as little reason;", "4059": "he courted those whose assistance he wanted, and behaved with arrogance to those who wanted his aid;", "4060": "so that one could not tell whether he had naturally more haughtiness or subserviency.", "4061": "For as to his inconsistency in punishing, sometimes inflicting death for the slightest matters, and at others quietly bearing the greatest wrongs, his ready reconciliations with his deadly enemies, and his prosecution of slight and trifling offences with death and confiscation of property-all this may be explained on the supposition that he was naturally of a violent and vindictive temper, but sometimes moderated his passion upon calculations of interest.", "4062": "During this Social War his soldiers killed with sticks and stones a man of Praetorian rank, who was his legatus, Albinus * by name, an outrage which Sulla overlooked, and made no inquiry about:", "4063": "he went so far as to say, with apparent serious­ ness, that the soldiers would bestir themselves the more in the war and make amends for their fault by their courage.", "4064": "As to any blame that was imputed to him, he cared not for it;", "4065": "but having already formed the design of overthrowing the power of Marius and of getting himself appointed to the command against Mithridates, as the Social War was now considered at an end, he endeavoured to ingratiate himself with his army.", "4066": "On coming to Rome he was elected consul with Quintus Pompeius † for his colleague, being now fifty years of age, and he formed a distinguished matrimonial alliance with Cæcilia,* the daughter of Metellus,t the chief Pontifex.", "4067": "This gave occasion to the populace to assail him with satirical songs;", "4068": "and many of the highest class were displeased at the marriage, as if they did not think him worthy of such a wife, whom they had judged to be worthy of the consulship, as Titus Livius‡ remarks.", "4069": "Cæcilia was not the only wife that Sulla had.", "4070": "When he was a very young man he married Ilia, who bore him a daughter ;", "4071": "his second wife was Aelia;", "4072": "and his third wife was Clœlia, whom lie divorced on the ground of barrenness, yet in a manner honourable to the lady, with an ample testimony to her virtues and with presents.", "4073": "But as he married Metella a few days after, it was believed that his alleged ground of divorce was merely a pretext.", "4074": "However, he always paid great respect to Metella, which induced the Romans, when they wished to recall from exile the partisans of Marius, and Sulla refused his assent, to apply to Metella to inter­ cede for them.", "4075": "After the capture of Athens also, it was supposed that he treated the citizens with more severity, because they had cast aspersions upon Metella from their walls.", "4076": "But of this hereafter.", "4077": "VII.", "4078": "Sulla looked on the consulship as only a small matter compared with what he expected to attain :", "4079": "the great object of his desires was the command in the war against Mithridates.", "4080": "But he had a rival in Marius, who was moved by an insane love of distinction and by ambi­ tion, passions which never grow old in a man, for though he was now unwieldy and had done no service in the late campaigns by reason of his age, he still longed for the command in a distant war beyond the seas.", "4081": "While Bulla was with the army completing some matters that still remained to be finished, Marius kept at home and hatched that most pestilent faction which did more mischief to Rome than all her wars;", "4082": "and indeed the deity * showed by signs what was coming.", "4083": "Fire spontaneously blazed from the wooden shafts which supported the military standards, and was quenched with difficulty;", "4084": "and three crows brought their young into the public road, and aftei devouring them, carried the fragments back to their nest.", "4085": "The mice in a temple gnawed the gold which was kept there, and the keeper of the temple caught one of the mice, a female, in a trap, which produced in the trap five young ones, and devoured three of them.", "4086": "But what was chief of all, from a cloudless and clear sky there came the sound of a trumpet, so shrill and mournful, that by reason of the greatness thereof men were beside themselves and crouched for fear.", "4087": "The Tusoan seers interpreted this to portend the commencement of a new period, and a general change.", "4088": "They say that there are in all eight periods, which differ in mode of life and habits altogether from one another, and to each period is assigned by the deity a cer­ tain number of years determined by the revolution of a great year.", "4089": "When a period is completed, the commencement of another is indicated by some wondrous sign on the earth or from the heavens, so as to make it immediately evident to those who attend to such matters and have studied them, that men are now adopting other habits and modes of life, and are less or more an object of care to the gods than the men of former periods.", "4090": "They say, in the change from one period to another there are great alterations, and that the art of the seer at one time is held in high repute, and is successful in its predictions, when the deity gives clear and manifest signs, but that in the course of another period the art falls into a low condition, being for the most part conjectural, and attempting to know the future by equivocal and misty signs.", "4091": "Now this is what the Tuscan wise men said, who are supposed to know more of such things than anybody else.", "4092": "While the senate was coin.", "4093": "municating on these omens with the seers, in the temple of Bellona,* a sparrow flew in before the whole body with a grasshopper in his mouth, part of which he dropped, and the rest he carried off with him out of the place.", "4094": "From this the interpreters of omens apprehended faction and divisions between the landholders on the one side and the city folk and the merchant class on the other, for the latter were loud and noisy like a grasshopper, but the owners of land kept quiet on their estates.", "4095": "VIII.", "4096": "Now Marius contrived to gain over the tribune Sulpicius,t a man without rival in any kind of villainy, and so one need not inquire whom he surpassed in wicked­ ness, but only wherein he surpassed himself.", "4097": "For in him were combined cruelty, audacity, and rapaciousness, without any consideration of shame or of any crime, inasmuch as he sold the Roman citizenship to libertini‡ and resident aliens, and publicly received the money at a table in the Forum.", "4098": "He maintained three thousand men armed with daggers, and also a number of young men of the equestrian class always about him, and ready for anything, whom he called the Opposition Senate.", "4099": "He caused a law to be passed that no Senator should contract debt § to the amount of more than two thousand drachmae, and yet at his death he left behind him a debt § of three millions.", "4100": "This man being let loose upon the people by Marius, and putting everything into a state of confusion by violence and force of arms, framed various pernicious laws, and among them that which gave to Marius the command in the Mithridatic war.", "4101": "The consuls accordingly declared a cessation* of all public business;", "4102": "but while they were holding a meeting of the people near the temple of Castor and Pollux, Sulpicius with his rabble attacked them, and among many others massacred the youthful son of Pompeius in the Forum;", "4103": "Pompeius only escaped by hiding himself.", "4104": "Sulla was pursued into the house of Marius, from which he was compelled to come out and repeal the edict for the cessation of public business;", "4105": "and it was for this reason that Sulpicius, though he de­ prived Pompeius of his office, did not take the consul­ ship from Sulla, but, merely transferred the command of the Mithridatic war to Marius, and sent some tribunes forthwith to Nola to take the army and lead it to Marius.", "4106": "IX.", "4107": "But Bulla made his escape to the camp before the tribunes arrived, and the soldiers hearing of what had passed, stoned them to death;", "4108": "upon which the partisans of Marius murdered the friends of Sulla who were in the city, and seized their property.", "4109": "This caused many persons to betake themselves to flight, some going to the city from the camp, and others from the camp to the city.", "4110": "The Senate was not its own master, but was compelled to obey the orders of Marius and Sulpicius;", "4111": "and on hearing that Bulla was marching upon Rome, they sent to him two of the prætors, Brutus and Servilius, to forbid him to advance any further.", "4112": "The prætors, who assumed a bold tone before Sulla, narrowly escaped being murdered ;", "4113": "as it was, the soldiers broke their fasces, stripped them of their senatorial dress, and sent them back with every insult.", "4114": "It caused dejection in the city to see the praetors return without their insignia of office, and to hear them report that the commotion could not be checked, and was past all remedy.", "4115": "Now the partisans of Marius were making their prepara­ tions, while Bulla with his colleague and six complete legions was moving from Nola;", "4116": "he saw that the army was ready to march right to the city, but he had some hesitation himself, and feared the risk.", "4117": "†However upon Bulla making a sacrifice, the seer Postumius, after in­ specting the signs, stretched out his hands to Sulla and urged him to put him in chains and keep him a prisoner till the battle took place, declaring that if everything did Dot speedily turn out well, he was ready to be put to death.", "4118": "It is said also that Sulla in his sleep had a vision of the goddess, whose worship the Romans had learned from the Cappadocians, whatever her name maybe, Selene,* Athena, or Enyo.", "4119": "Sulla dreamed that the goddess stood by him and put a thunderbolt into his hand, and as she named each of his enemies bade him dart the bolt at them, which he did;", "4120": "and his enemies were struck to the ground and destroyed.", "4121": "Being encouraged by the dream, which he communicated to his colleague, at daybreak Sulla led his forces against Rome.", "4122": "When he was near Picinæ t he was met by a deputation which entreated him not to march forthwith against the city, for all justice would be done pursuant to a resolution of the Senate.", "4123": "Sulla con­ sented to encamp there, and ordered the officers to measure out the ground for the encampment, according to the usual practice, and the deputation went away trusting to his promise.", "4124": "But as soon as they were gone, Sulla sent Lucius Bacillus and Caius Mummius, who seized the gate and that part of the walls which surrounds the Esquiline hill, and Sulla set out to join them with all speed.", "4125": "Bacillus and his soldiers broke into the city and attempted to gain possession of it, but the people in large numbers, being unarmed, mounted the house-tops, and by pelting the soldiers with tiles and stones stopped their further progress, and drove them back to the wall.", "4126": "In the mean time Sulla had come up, and seeing how matters stood, he called out that the houses must be fired, and taking a flaming torch, he was the first to advance:", "4127": "he also ordered the bowmen to shoot fire brands, and to aim at the roofs;", "4128": "In which he acted without any rational consideration, giving way to passion, and surrendering the direction of his enterprize to revenge, for he saw before him only his enemies, and without thought or pity for his friends and kinsmen, would force his way into Rome with the help of flames, which know no distinction between the guilty and the innocent.", "4129": "While this was going on, Marius, who had been driven as far as the temple of Earth,.", "4130": "invited the slaves to join him by offer­ ing them their freedom, but being overpowered by his enemies who pressed on him, he left the city.", "4131": "X. Sulla assembled the Senate, who condemned t to death Marius and a few others, among whom was the tribune Sulpicius.", "4132": "Sulpicius was put to death, being betrayed by a slave, to whom Sulla gave his freedom, and then ordered him to be thrown down the Tarpeian rock :", "4133": "he set a price on the head of Marius, which was neither a generous nor a politic measure, as Marius had shortly before let Sulla off safe when Sulla put himself into his power by going to the house of Marius.", "4134": "Now if Marius had not let Sulla go, but had given him up to Sulpicius to be put to death, he might have secured the supreme power;", "4135": "but he spared Bulla;", "4136": "and yet a few days after, when Sulla had the same opportunity, Marius did not obtain from him a like return.", "4137": "The conduct of Sulla offended the Senate, though they durst not show it;", "4138": "but the dislike of the people and their dissatisfaction were made apparent to him by their acts.", "4139": "They contemp­ tuously rejected Nonius, the son of Sulla's sister, and Servius, who were candidates for offices, and elected those whose elevation they thought would be most disagreeable to Sulla.", "4140": "But Bulla pretended to be pleased at this, and to view it as a proof that the people, by doing what they liked, were really indebted to him for their liberty;", "4141": "and for the purpose of diminishing his general unpopularity he managed the election of Lucius Cinna,* who was of the opposite faction, to the consulship, having first bound him by solemn imprecations and oaths to favour his measures.", "4142": "Cinna ascended the Capitol with a stone in his hand and took the oath ;", "4143": "then pronouncing an impre­ cation on himself, that, if he did not keep faithful to Bulla, he might be cast out of the city as the stone from his hand, he hurled it to the ground in the presence of a large number of persons.", "4144": "But as soon as Cinna had received the consulship, he attempted to disturb the present settlement of a Hairs, and prepared to institute a process against Sulla, and induced Virginius, one of the tribunes, to be the accuser;", "4145": "but Sulla,† without caring for him or the court, set out with his army against Mithridates.", "4146": "XI.", "4147": "It is said that about the time when Sulla was conducting his armament from Italy, many omens occurred to Mithridates, who was staying in Pergamum, and that a Victory, bearing a crown, which the people of Pergamum were letting down upon him by some machinery from above, was broken in pieces just as it was touching his head, and the crown falling upon the theatre, came to the ground and was destroyed, which made the spectators shudder and greatly dispirited Mithridates, though his affairs were then going on favourably beyond all expecta­ tion.", "4148": "For he had taken Asia‡ from the Romans, and Bithynia and Cappadocia from their kings, and had fixed himself at Pergamum, where he was distributing wealth and provinces and kingdoms among his friends;", "4149": "one of liis sons also held without any opposition the ancient dominions in Pontus, and the Bosporus * as far as the uninhabited regions beyond the Mæotis ;", "4150": "Ariarathes t occupied Thrace and Macedonia with a large army;", "4151": "and his generals with their forces were subduing other places.", "4152": "Archelaus, ‡ the greatest of his generals, was master of all the sea with his navy, and was subjugating the Cyclades § and all the other islands east of Malea, and had already taken Eubœa, while with his army, advancing from Athens as his starting-point, he was gaining over all the nations of Greece as far north as Thessaly, and had only sustained a slight check near Chæroneia.", "4153": "For there he was met by Bruttius Sura,* a legatus of Sentius, prætor of Macedonia, and a man of signal courage and prudence.", "4154": "Archelaus was sweeping through Boeotia like a torrent, when he was vigorously opposed by Sura, who, after fighting three battles near Chæroneia, repulsed him and drove him back to the coast.", "4155": "On receiving orders from Lucius Lucullus † to make room for Sulla, who was coming, and to allow him to carry on the war, for which he had received his commission, Sura immediately left Bœotia.", "4156": "and went back to Sentius, though he had suc­ ceeded beyond his expectations, and Greece was well disposed to change sides on account of his great merit.", "4157": "However, these exploits of Bruttius were very brilliant.", "4158": "XII.", "4159": "Now all the rest of the Grecian cities immediately sent deputations to Sulla and invited him to enter;", "4160": "but against Athens, which was compelled by the tyrant Aristion ‡ to be on the king's side, he directed all his energies;", "4161": "he also hemmed in and blockaded the Peiræus,* employing every variety of engine and every mode of attack.", "4162": "If he had waited a short time, he might have taken the Upper City without danger, for through want of provisions it was reduced by famine to extreme necessity;", "4163": "but anxious to return to Rome, and fearing a new revolution there, at great risk fighting many battles and at great cost he urged on the war, wherein, besides the rest of the expenditure, the labour about the military engines required ten thousand pair of mules to be daily employed on this service.", "4164": "As wood began to fail, owing to many of the works being destroyed by their own weight, and burnt by the incessant fires thrown by the enemy, Sulla laid his hands on the several groves and levelled the trees in the Academia,† which was the best wooded of the suburbs, and those in the Lycæum.", "4165": "And as he wanted money also for the war, he violated the sacred depositaries of Greece, sending for the finest and most costly of the offerings dedicated in Epidaurus ‡and Olympia.", "4166": "He wrote also to the Amphiktyons * to Delphi, saying that it would be better for the treasures of the god to be brought to him, for he would either have them in safer keeping, or, if he used them, he would replace them;", "4167": "and he sent one of his friends, Kaphis, a Phokian, td receive all the things after they were first weighed.", "4168": "Kaphis went to Delphi, but he was afraid to touch the sacred things, and in the presence of the Amphiktyons he deeply lamented the task that was imposed on him.", "4169": "Upon some of them saying that they heard the lute in the shrine send forth a sound, Kaphis either believing what they said or wishing to inspire Sulla with some religious fear, sent him this information.", "4170": "But Sulla replied in a scoffing tone, he wondered Kaphis did not understand that such music was a sign of pleasure and not of anger, and he bade him take courage and seize the property, as the deity was quite willing, and in fact offered it.", "4171": "Now all the things were secretly sent off unobserved by most of the Greeks;", "4172": "but the silver jar, one of the royal presents which still remained, could not be carried away by the beasts of burden owing to its weight and size, and the Amphiktyons were accordingly obliged to cut it in pieces;", "4173": "and this led them to reflect that Titus Flamininus,* and Manius Acilius, and also Æmilius Paulus—Acilius, who drove Antiochus out of Greece;", "4174": "and the two others, who totally defeated the kings of Macedonia—not only re­ frained from touching the Greek temples, but even gave them presents and showed them great honour and respect.", "4175": "These generals, however, were legally appointed to com­ mand troops consisting of well-disciplined soldiers, who had been taught to obey their leaders without a murmur:", "4176": "and the commanders themselves were men of kingly souls, and moderate in their living and satisfied with a small fixed expenditure, and they thought it baser to attempt to win the soldiers' favour than to fear their enemies.", "4177": "But the generals at this time, as they acquired their rank by violence and not by merit, and had more occasion to employ arms against one another than against the enemies of Rome, were compelled to act the demagogue while they were in command;", "4178": "and by purchasing the services of the soldiers by the money which they expended to gratify them, they made the Roman state a thing for bargain and sale, and themselves the slaves of the vilest wretches in order that they might domineer over honest men.", "4179": "This is what drove Marius into exile, and then brought him back to oppose Sulla;", "4180": "this made Cinna the murderer of Octavius,t and Fimbria t the murderer of Flaccus.", "4181": "And Sulla mainly laid the foundation of all this by his profusion and expenditure upon his own soldiers, the object of which was to corrupt and gain over to his side the soldiers of other commanders;", "4182": "so that his attempts to seduce the troops of others and the extra­ vagance by which his own soldiers were corrupted, made money always necessary to him;", "4183": "and most particularly during the siege of Athens.", "4184": "XIII.", "4185": "Now Sulla was seized with a violent and irre­ sistible desire to take Athens, whether it was that he was ambitious to contend against a city which retained only the shadow of its former glory, or that he was moved by passion to revenge the scoffs and jeers with which the tyrant Aristion irritated him and his wife Metella, by continually taunting them from the wall and insulting them.", "4186": "This Aristion was a compound of lewdness and cruelty, who combined in himself all the worst of the vices and passions of Mithridates, and now had brought as it were a mortal disease in its last extremities upon a city which had come safe out of so many wars and escaped from so many tyrannies and civil commotions.", "4187": "For now when a medimnus* of wheat was selling for a thousand drachmae in the Upper City, and men were obliged to oat the parthenium t that grew about the Acropolis, and shoes and oil-flasks, he was drinking all day long and amusing himself with revels and pyrrhic dances, and making jokes at the enemy:", "4188": "he let the sacred light of the goddess go out for want of oil;", "4189": "when the hierophant sent to ask for the twelfth part of a medimnus of wheat, he sent her as much pepper;", "4190": "and when the members of the Senate and the priests entreated him to have pity on the city and come to terms with Bulla, he dispersed them by ordering the archers to fire on them.", "4191": "At last being persuaded with great difficulty, he sent two or three of his boon com­ panions to treat of peace;", "4192": "but instead of making any reasonable proposals, the men began to make a pompous harangue about Theseus and Eumolpus, and the Persian wars, on which Sulla said, “ Be gone, my good fellows, with your fine talk.", "4193": "I was not sent to Athens by the Romans to learn a lesson, but to compel rebels to submit.", "4194": "\"XIV.", "4195": "In the mean time, as the story goes, some soldiers in the Keramicus* overheard certain old men talking to one another, and abusing the tyrant for not guarding the approach to the wall about the Heptachalkum, which was the only part, they said, where it was practicable and easy for the enemy to get over ;", "4196": "and the soldiers reported to Sulla what they heard.", "4197": "Sulla did not neglect the in­ telligence, but he went to the spot by night, and seeing that it was practicable, he set about the thing forthwith.", "4198": "He says in his Memoirs that the first man who mounted the wall was Marcus Teius,† who, finding a soldier in his way, struck him a violent blow on the helmet, which broke his sword ;", "4199": "still Marcus did not retreat, but kept his ground.", "4200": "The city then was taken from this quarter, as the old Athenians said it might be.", "4201": "Sulla having destroyed and levelled that part of the wall which lies between the Peiræic and the Sacred‡ Gate, about midnight entered the city, striking terror with the sound of trumpets and horns, and the shouts and cries of the soldiers, who had his full licence to plunder and kill, and made their way through the streets with naked swords.", "4202": "The slain were not counted, but the number is even now measured by the space over which the blood flowed.", "4203": "For besides those who were slaughtered in the other parts of the city, the blood of those who fell about the Agora* covered all the Keramicus within Dipylum :", "4204": "many say that it even flowed through the gates and deluged the suburbs.", "4205": "But though the number of those who perished by the sword was so great, as many killed themselves for sorrow and regret at the overthrow of their native city.", "4206": "For all the most honest citizens were driven to despair, expecting in Bulla neither humanity nor moderation.", "4207": "But, however, when Meidias and Kalliphon, who were exiles, fell down at his knees with entreaties, and the Senators who were in his army urged him to save the city, being now sated with ven­ geance and passing some encomiums upon the ancient Athenians, he said he would pardon the many for the sake of the few, and the living for the sake of the dead.", "4208": "Sulla states in his Memoirs, that he took Athens on the Calends of March,† which day nearly coincides with the new moon of Anthesterion, in which month it happens that the Athenians perform many ceremonies in com­ memoration of the great damage and loss occasioned by the heavy rain, for they suppose that the deluge happened pretty nearly about that time.", "4209": "When the city was taken the tyrant retreated to the Acropolis, where he was besieged by Curio, who was commissioned for this purpose :", "4210": "after he had held out for some time, Aristion was com­ pelled to surrender for want of water;", "4211": "his surrender was immediately followed by a token from the deity, for on the very day and hour on which Curio took the tyrant from the Acropolis, the clouds gathered in the clear sky, and a violent shower descended which filled the Acropolis with water.", "4212": "Sulla soon took the Peiræus also, and burnt the greater part of it, including the arsenal of Philo,* which was a wonderful work.", "4213": "XV.", "4214": "In the mean time Taxiles, the general of Mithridates, coming down from Thrace and Macedonia with one hundred thousand foot, ten thousand horse, and ninety scythe-bearing four-horse chariots, summoned Archelaus, who was still lying with his ships near Munychia,t and was neither inclined to give up the sea nor ready to engage with the Romans:", "4215": "his plan was to protract the war and to cut off the supplies of the enemy.", "4216": "But Sulla was as quick as Archelaus, and moved into Boeotia from a niggardly region, which even in time of peace could not have maintained his troops.", "4217": "Most people thought that he had made a false calculation in leaving Attica, which is a rough country and ill adapted for the movements of cavalry, to throw himself into the cham­ paign and open tracts of Bœotia, when he knew that the strength of the barbarians lay in their chariots and cavalry.", "4218": "But in his flight from famine and scarcity, as I have already observed, he was compelled to seek the hazard of a battle.", "4219": "Besides, he was alarmed for Hortensius,‡ a skilful general and a man ambitious of distinction, who was conducting a force from Thessaly to Sulla, and had to pass through the straits where the enemy was waiting for him.", "4220": "For all these reasons Sulla moved into Boeotia.", "4221": "But Kaphis, who was from my town, evading the bar­ barians by taking a different route from what they expected, led Hortensius over Parnassus, close by Tithora, which was not at that time so large a city as it is now, but only a fort on a steep rock scarped all round, to which place in time of old the Phokians who fled from Xerxes escaped with their property and were there in safety.", "4222": "Hortensius having encamped there during the day repelled the attacks of the enemy, and at night descending to Patronis, through a difficult path joined Bulla, who met him with his forces.", "4223": "XVI.", "4224": "Having united their forces, Sulla and Hortensius occupied an elevation rising out of the midst of the plains of Elateia,* which was fertile and extensive, and had water at its base :", "4225": "it is called Philobœotus, and its natural qualities and position are most highly commended by Sulla.", "4226": "When they were encamped, the weakness of the Roman force was apparent to the enemy;", "4227": "for the cavalry did not exceed fifteen hundred, and the infantry was below fifteen thousand.", "4228": "Accordingly the rest of the generals, against the wish of Archelaus, drew out their forces in order of battle, and filled the plain with horses, chariots, shields, and bucklers ;", "4229": "and the heavens could not contain the shouts and cries of so many nations putting them­ selves in battle array.", "4230": "At the same time the pomp and costly splendour of the troops were not without effect nor their use in causing alarm;", "4231": "but the glittering of the arms, which were curiously ornamented with gold and silver, and the colour of the Median and Scythian dresses mingled with the brightness of the brass and steel, pro­ duced a firelike and formidable appearance as the masses moved like waves and changed their places, so that tho Romans hid themselves behind their ramparts, and Sulla, being unable by any words to remove their fear, and not choosing to urge men to a battle who were disposed to run away, kept quiet and had to endure the insulting boasts and ridicule of the barbarians.", "4232": "But this turned out most favourable to the Romans;", "4233": "for the enemy despising them, neglected to preserve discipline, and indeed, owing to the number of commanders, the army was not generally inclined to obey orders;", "4234": "a few kept to their post within their ramparts, but the greater part, tempted by the hope of booty and plunder, were dispersed many days' journey from the camp.", "4235": "It is said that they destroyed the city of Panopeus, and plundered Lebadeia, and robbed the oracular shrine without any order from a general.", "4236": "Sulla, who could not endure to see the cities destroyed before his eyes and was greatly irritated, no longer allowed his soldiers to be inactive, but leading them to the Kephisus, he compelled them to divert the stream from its course and to dig ditches, allowing no man any cessation and punishing most severely all who gave in, his object being to tire his soldiers with labour and to induce them to seek danger as a release from it.", "4237": "And it happened as he wished.", "4238": "For on the third day of this labour, as Sulla was passing by, they entreated him with loud shouts to lead them against the enemy.", "4239": "He replied, that they said this not because they wished to fight, but because they disliked labour;", "4240": "but if they really were disposed to fight, he bade them move forthwith with their arms to yonder place, pointing cut to them what was formerly the Acropolis of the Parapotamii,* but the city was then destroyed and there remained only a rocky precipitous hill, separated from Mount Hedylium by the space occupied by the river Assus, which falling into the Kephisus at the base of the Hedylium and thus becoming a more rapid stream, makes the Acropolis a safe place for encampment.", "4241": "Bulla also wished to seize the height, as he saw the Chalkaspides * of the enemy pressing on towards it, and as his soldiers exerted themselves vigorously, he succeeded in occupying the place.", "4242": "Arch a- laus, being repelled from this point, advanced towards Chæroneia, upon which the men of Chæroneia who were in Sulla's army entreating him not to let their city fall into the hands of the enemy, he sent Gabinius,† a tribune, with one legion, and permitted the men of Chæroneia to go also, who, though they had the best intention, could not reach the place before Gabinius:", "4243": "so brave a man he was, and more active in bringing aid than even those who prayed for it.", "4244": "Juba ‡ says it was not Gabinius who was sent, but Ericius.", "4245": "However this may be, our city § had a narrow escape.", "4246": "XVII.", "4247": "From Lebadeia || and the oracle of Trophonius favourable omens and predictions of victory were sent to the Romans, about which the people of the country have a good deal to say.", "4248": "But Sulla, in the tenth book of his Memoirs, writes, that Quintus Titius, a man of some note among those who had mercantile affairs in Greece, came to him immediately after the victory in Chæroneia, to report that Trophonius foretold a second battle and victory there in a short time.", "4249": "After Titius, a soldier in his army, named Salvenius, brought an answer from the god, as to what would be the result of affairs in Italy.", "4250": "Both reported the same as to the vision ¶ of the god:", "4251": "they said, that in beauty and stature he was like the Olympian Jupiter.", "4252": "After crossing the Assus and advancing to the foot of Hedylium, Sulla encamped near Archelaus, who bad thrown up a strong intrenchment between Mounts Akontium and Hedylium, at a place called the Assia.", "4253": "The spot on which he encamped is called Archelaus from his name up to the present day.", "4254": "After the interval of one day Bulla left Murena * with one legion and two cohorts, to annoy the enemy if he should attempt to form in order of battle ;", "4255": "he himself sacrificed on the banks of the Kephisus, and the victims being favourable, he advanced towards Chæroneia with the object of again effecting a junction with the forces there, and examining the place called Thurium, which was occupied by the enemy.", "4256": "This is a rough summit and a conical-shaped hill, named Orthopagus;", "4257": "and under it is the stream of the Morius and a temple of the Thurian Apollo.", "4258": "The deity has this name from Thuro, the mother of Chæron, who is said to have been the founder of Chæroneia.", "4259": "Some say that the cow which was given by the Pythian Apollo as a guide to Kadmus,† appeared there, and that the place was so called from her ;", "4260": "for the Phœnicians call the cow Thor.", "4261": "As Bulla was approaching Chaeroneia, the tribune who was stationed in the city led out the soldiers under arms, and met him with a chaplet of bay.", "4262": "No sooner had Sulla received the chaplet, and after saluting the soldiers, encouraged them to the approaching battle, than two Chæroneians (Homoloichus and Anaxidamos) presented themselves to him and under­ took to drive the enemy from Thurium if he would give them a few soldiers.", "4263": "They said there was a path unknown to the barbarians, leading from the place called Petrachus by the Museum ‡ to the highest point of Thurium, and that by taking this direction they could, without difficulty, fall on the enemy and either roll stones down upon them from above or drive them into the plain.", "4264": "As Gabinius bore testimony to the courage and fidelity of the men, Bulla bade them make the attempt;", "4265": "and in the mean time he formed his line and distributed his cavalry on each flank, himself taking the right and giving Murena the command on the left.", "4266": "The legati Galba * and Hortensius, with some reserved cohorts in the rear, occupied the neighbouring heights, to prevent the army from being attacked on the flank, for it was observed that the enemy were placing a strong body of cavalry and light infantry on their wings, with the view of adapting that part of their battle to ready and easy manoeuvres, their design being to extend their line and to surround the Romans.", "4267": "XVIII.", "4268": "In the mean time the Chæroneians, whom Bulla had placed under the command of Ericius, went round Thurium without being perceived, and all at once showed themselves to the enemy, who immediately falling into great confusion, took to flight and sustained considerable loss, but chiefly from themselves;", "4269": "for as they did not stand their ground, but ran down the hill, they got entangled among their own spears and shoved one another down the rocks, while the Chæroneians pressing upon them from above, wounded them in the parts which were unprotected;", "4270": "and there fell of the enemy to the number of three thousand.", "4271": "Part of those who got safe to the foot of the hill, being met by Murena, whose troops were already in order of battle, had their retreat cut off and were destroyed:", "4272": "the rest forced their way to the army of Archelaus, and, falling upon the line in disorder, caused a general alarm and confusion, and some loss of time to the generals;", "4273": "and this did them no small harm, for Bulla promptly led his forces against the enemy while they were still in disorder, and by quickly traversing the interval between the two lines, deprived the scythe- bearing chariots t of all opportunity of being effective.", "4274": "The efficacy of the chariots depends mainly on the space they traverse, by which they acquire velocity and mo­ mentum;", "4275": "but when the space is small their attack is ineffectual and feeble, just like missiles that have not been propelled with due force.", "4276": "Now this happened to the barbarians.", "4277": "The first chariots were driven on without any vigour, and came feebly against the ranks of the Romans, who easily pushed them aside, and, clapping their hands and laughing, called for more, as the people do in the horse-races of the Circus.-", "4278": "Upon this the infantry joined battle;", "4279": "the barbarians pushed forward their long spears and endeavoured by locking their shields to maintain their ranks in line :", "4280": "the Romans hurled their javelins, and then drawing their swords, endeavoured to beat aside the spears, that they might forthwith close with the enemy;", "4281": "for they were irritated at seeing drawn up in front of the enemy fifteen thousand slaves, whom the king's generals had invited from the cities by a proclamation of freedom, and enrolled among the hoplitæ.†", "4282": "A Roman centurion is said to have remarked, that slaves had only freedom of speech at the Saturnalia,‡ so far as he knew.", "4283": "Now, owing to the depth of the ranks of these slaves and their close order, it was some time before they could be made to give way before the heavy-armed Roman soldiers, and they also fought with more courage than one expects from a slave;", "4284": "but the missiles from the slings and the light javelins which were showered upon them unsparingly by the Romans in the rear, at last made them turn and put them into complete confusion.", "4285": "XIX.", "4286": "While Archelaus was extending his right wing, in order to surround the Romans, Hortensius made his cohorts advance at a run, with the intention of taking the enemy in the flank;", "4287": "but as Archelaus suddenly wheeled round with his two thousand horsemen, Hor­ tensius was overpowered by numbers and retreated towards the mountain region, being gradually separated from the main bcdy of the army and in danger of being completely hemmed in by the barbarians.", "4288": "Sulla, who was on the right wing, which was not yet engaged in the action, hearing of the danger of Hortensius, hastened to relieve him.", "4289": "Archelaus conjecturing from the dust raised by Sulla's troops how the matter was, left Hortensius, and wheeling round moved towards the position which Sulla had quitted (the right), expecting to find the soldiers there without their general, and to defeat them.", "4290": "At the same time Taxiles led the Chalkaspides against Murena;", "4291": "and no w the shouts being raised from both armies and re-echoed by the mountains, Sulla halted and hesitated to which quarter he should move.", "4292": "Having determined to maintain his own original position, he sent Hortensius with four cohorts to support Murena, and ordering the fifth to follow him, he hurried to the right wing, which unaided was bravely resisting Archelaus;", "4293": "but as soon as Sulla appeared, the Romans completely broke the line of Archelaus, and pursued the barbarians in disorderly flight to the river and Mount Akontium.", "4294": "However, Sulla did not leave Murena alone in his danger­ ous position, but hastened to help him.", "4295": "Seeing, however, that the Romans were victorious here also, he joined in the pursuit.", "4296": "Now many of the barbarians were cut down in the plain, but the greatest number were destroyed in the attempt to regain their entrenchments, and only ten thousand out of so large a host made their escape to Chalkis.*", "4297": "Sulla says in his Memoirs, that he missed only fourteen of his own soldiers, and that ten of them showed themselves in the evening;", "4298": "in commemoration of which he inscribed on the trophies, Mars and Victory, and Venus, to signify that he had gained the victory no less through good fortune than skill and courage.", "4299": "One of these trophies, which commemorates the victory in the plain, stands where the soldiers of Archelaus first gave ground in the flight to the Molus:", "4300": "* the other is placed on the summit of Thurium, to commemorate the surprise of the barbarians, with a Greek inscription in honour of the courage of Homoloichus and Anaxidamus.", "4301": "Bulla cele­ brated the festival for the victory in Thebes at the foun­ tain of Œdipus, where he erected a stage.", "4302": "The judges were Greeks invited from the other cities of Greece;", "4303": "for Sulla could not be reconciled to the Thebans;", "4304": "and he took from them half of their lands, which he dedicated to the Pythian Apollo and Olympian Jupiter;", "4305": "and from the revenue of these lands he ordered the sums of money which he had taken from them to be repaid to the deities.", "4306": "XX.", "4307": "After the battle Bulla received intelligence that Flaccus,† who belonged to the opposite faction, was chosen consul, and was crossing the Ionian t sea with a force which was said to be designed against Mithridates, but was in fact directed against himself;", "4308": "and accordingly he advanced towards Thessalia to meet Flaccus.", "4309": "He had advanced to the neighbourhood of Meliteia,§ when reports from all sides reached him that the country in his rear was raVaged by another army of Mithridates as numerous as that which he had dispersed.", "4310": "Dorylaus had landed at Chalkis with a large navy, on board of which he brought eighty thousand men of the best trained and disciplined troops of Mithridates, and he immediately advanced into Bœotia and occupied the country, being eager to draw Sulla to an engagement, and paying no regard to Archelaus, who dissuaded him from fighting :", "4311": "he even said publicly that so many thousands could never have been de­ stroyed if there had not been treachery.", "4312": "However, Sulla, who quickly returned to Bœotia, showed Dorylaus that Archelaus was a prudent man and had formed a very just estimate of the courage of the Romans;", "4313": "for after a slight skirmish with Sulla near Tilphossium,* Dorylaus was himself the first among those who were not for deciding the matter by a battle, but thought it best to prolong the war till the Romans should be exhausted by want of supplies.", "4314": "However, Archelaus was somewhat encouraged by the position of their encampment near Orchomenus, which was very favourable for battle to an army which had the superiority in cavalry;", "4315": "for of all the plains in Bœotia noted for their beauty and extent, this, which commences at the city of Orchomenus, is the only one which spreads without interruption and without any trees, and it reaches to the marshes in which the river Melas t is lost.", "4316": "The Melas rises close to Orchomenus, and is the only river of Greece that is a copious and navigable stream at its source;", "4317": "it also increases like the Nile about the summer solstice, and the same plants grow on its banks;", "4318": "but they produce no fruit and do not attain any large size.", "4319": "Its course however is short, for the larger part of the water is soon lost in obscure marshes overgrown with shrubs:", "4320": "a small part joins the Kephisus somewhere about the point where the lake is said to produce the reed that is adapted for making musical pipes.", "4321": "XXI.", "4322": "The two armies being encamped near one another, Archelaus kept quiet, but Sulla began to dig trenches on both sides with the view, if possible, of cutting off the enemy from the hard ground and those parts which were favourable to cavalry and driving them into the marshes.", "4323": "However, the barbarians would not endure this, and as soon as their generals allowed them to attack the Romans, they rushed forward with so much vigour and force, that not only were the men dispersed who were working at the trenches, brut the greater part of the Roman troops that were drawn up for their protection were involved in the fight.", "4324": "Upon this Sulla leapt down from his horse, and snatching up a standard, made his way through the fugitives towards the enemy, crying, out, “ For my part, Romans, it is fit I should die hero;", "4325": "as for you, when you are asked where you deserted your Imperator, remember to say it was in Orchomenus.\"", "4326": "These words made the soldiers rally, and two cohorts came to their support from the right wing, which Sulla led against the enemy and put them to flight.", "4327": "He then led his soldiers back a short distance, and after allowing them to take some food, he began again to work at the trenches which were designed to enclose the enemy's camp", "4328": "The barbarians made another attack in better order than before;", "4329": "in which Diogenes, the son of the wife of Archelaus, fell fighting bravely on the right wing;", "4330": "and the bowmen being hard pressed by the Romans and having no means of retreat, took their arrows altogether in their hands, and using them like swords, struck at the Romans, but, at last they were driven back to their camp, where they spent a wretched night owing to their wounds and great losses.", "4331": "As soon as day dawned Bulla again led his soldiers up to the enemy's encampment and again commenced working at the ditches.", "4332": "The enemy came out in a great force, but Sulla put them to flight, and as no one stood his ground after they were thrown into disorder, Sulla stormed the camp.", "4333": "The swamps and the lake were filled with the blood and bodies of those who fell, and even to the present day many barbarian bows, helmets, and pieces of iron cuirasses and swords are found buried in the marshes, though it is near two hundred * years since the battle.", "4334": "Such, according to the historians, was the battle about Chæroneia and near Orcho­ menus.", "4335": "XXII.", "4336": "Cinna and Carbo * were now conducting them­ selves towards the chief men at Rome in an illegal and violent manner, and many flying from their tyranny re­ sorted to the camp of Sulla as a harbour of refuge, so that in a short time a kind of Senate was formed about him.", "4337": "Metella also, who had with difficulty escaped with her children, came and reported that his house and farms were burnt by his enemies, and she entreated him to go to the assistance of his friends at Rome.", "4338": "Sulla was per­ plexed what to do:", "4339": "he could not endure the thoughts of neglecting his country in her present oppressed condition, nor did he see how he could leave so great an undertaking as the Mithridatic war imperfect.", "4340": "In the meantime there came to him a merchant of Delos,f named Archelaus, who secretly brought from Archelaus, the king'is general, hopes of peace and certain proposals.", "4341": "Bulla was so well pleased that he was eager for an interview with Archelaus, and they met at Delium on the sea-coast, where the temple of Apollo is.", "4342": "Archelaus, who began the conference, urged Sulla to give up Asia and the Pontus, and to sail to Rome to prosecute the war against his enemies, and he offered him money, ships, and troops on behalf of the king.", "4343": "Sulla in reply advised Archelaus not to trouble himself any further about Mithridates, but to assume the kingly title himself and to become an ally of Rome, and to give up the ships of Mithridates.", "4344": "As Archelaus professed his detestation of such treachery, Sulla said, “ You then, Archelaus, who are a Cappadocian, and the slave of a barbarian king, or, if you please, his friend—you refuse to do a base deed for so splendid a reward, and yet venture to talk about treachery to me who am a Roman general, and am Sulla, as if you were not that Archelaus who fled from Chæroneia with a few men out of your one hundred and twenty thousand, and were hid for two day a in the marshes- of Orchomenus, and left Bœotia with all the roads made impassable by the heaps of dead ? \"", "4345": "Upon this Archelaus changed his tone, and humbling himself, en­ treated Sulla to give up the war and to come to terms with Mithridates.", "4346": "Bulla accepted the proposal, and peace was made on the following terms:", "4347": "—Mithridates was to give up Asia† and Paphlagonia, and to surrender Bithynia to Nikomedes, and Cappadocia to Ariobarzanes, to pay down to the Romans two thousand talents, and to give them seventy ships fitted with brass and completely equipped;", "4348": "Sulla was to confirm Mithridates in the rest of his possessions and to recognise him as an ally of the Romans.", "4349": "XXIII.", "4350": "These terms being settled, Sulla retraced his steps and marched through Thessaly and Macedonia to the Hellespont in company with Archelaus, whom he treated with great respect.", "4351": "Archelaus fell dangerously ill at Larissa, on which Sulla stopped his march and paid as much attention to him as if he had been one of his own officers and fellow-generals.", "4352": "This gave rise to some sus­ picion that the battle of Chæroneia was not fairly fought, which was strengthened by the fact that Sulla restored all the friends of Mithridates whom he had taken pri- Boners, except Aristion‡ the tyrant, who was an enemy of Archelaus, and whom he caused to be poisoned:", "4353": "but the most convincing proof of all was Sulla's giving the Cappa­ docian ten thousand plethra of land in Eubœa, and the title of friend and ally of the Romans.", "4354": "However, Bulla makes his apology about these matters in his Memoirs.", "4355": "Ambassadors from Mithridates now arrived, and were ready to accede to all the terms agreed on, except that the king would not consent to give up Paphlagonia, and as to the ships he dissented altogether;", "4356": "on which Bulla in a passion exclaimed, \" What say ye ?", "4357": "Mithlidates claims to keep Paphlagonia, and refuses to abide by the agreement about the ships;", "4358": "I thought he would have been thankful if I left him his right hand, which has destroyed so many Romans.", "4359": "However, he will soon speak another language when I have crossed over to Asia.", "4360": "At present let him stay in Pergamum and there direct the conduct of a campaign which he has not seen.\"", "4361": "The ambassadors were so much alarmed that they said nothing, but Archelaus implored Bulla and tried to soften his anger, clinging to his hands with tears in his eyes.", "4362": "At last he prevailed on Sulla to let him go to Mithridates, and he promised to effect a peace on Sulla's own terms, or to kill himself.", "4363": "Sulla accordingly sent Archelaus to Mithridates, and in the mean time he invaded Mædike,* and having ravaged the greater part of it, returned to Macedonia, and found Archelaus at Philippic who reported that all was favour­ able, but that Mithridates much wished to have an inter­ view with him.", "4364": "Mithridates was mainly induced to this by the circumstance that Fimbria, after murdering the consul Flaccus, who belonged to the opposite faction, and de­ feating the generals of Mithridates, was advancing against the king himself.", "4365": "It was fear of Fimbria that made Mithridates more inclined to make a friend of Sulla.", "4366": "XXIV.", "4367": "Accordingly they met at Dardaǹus t in the Troad:", "4368": "Mithridates had there two hundred rowing-ships, twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers, six thousand horse­ men, and many of his scythe-bearing chariots:", "4369": "Sulla had four cohorts and two hundred horsemen.", "4370": "Mithridates advanced to meet Bulla and held out his hand, on which Sulla asked him if he would put an end to the war on the terms agreed to by Archelaus.", "4371": "As the king made no reply, Sulla said, “Well, those who sue must speak first;", "4372": "conquerors may remain silent.\"", "4373": "Mithridates began an apology, in which he partly imputed the origin of the war to the deities, and partly threw the blame on the Romans;", "4374": "but Bulla cut him short by saying, that he had long ago been told, and now he knew by his own experience, that Mithridates was a most skilful speaker, inasmuch as he had no difficulty in finding words to justify acts which were so base and so contrary to all right.", "4375": "Bulla went on to recapitulate all that Mithridates had done, reproaching him in bitter terms, and he then asked him again, if he would abide by the agreement of Archelaus.", "4376": "Mithridates said that he would ;", "4377": "on which Sulla embraced him, threw his arms round him and kissed him;", "4378": "he then brought forward the kings Ariobarzanes and Kikomedes, and recon­ ciled Mithridates to them.", "4379": "After surrendering to Bulla seventy ships and five hundred bowmen, Mithridates sailed off to the Pontus.", "4380": "Sulla perceived that his soldiers were dissatisfied at the settlement of the war :", "4381": "they thought it a shame that the greatest enemy of the Romans, who had contrived the massacre of one hundred and fifty thousand Romans in Asia in one day, should be seen sailing off with the wealth and the spoils of Asia, which he had been plundering and levying contributions on for four years;", "4382": "Sulla apologised to the soldiers by saying that he should not be able to oppose both Fimbria and Mithridates, if they were united against him.", "4383": "XXV.", "4384": "From Dardanus Sulla marched against Fimbria, who was encamped near Thyateira,* and halting there, began to throw up his intrenchments.", "4385": "Fimbria'is men coming out of their camp in their jackets embraced the soldiers of Sulla, and began to assist them zealously in their works.", "4386": "Fimbria seeing that his soldiers had de­ serted him, and fearing Sulla’s unforgiving temper, committed suicide in the camp.", "4387": "Bulla now levied a contribution on Asia to the amount of twenty thousand talents:", "4388": "and he reduced individuals to beggary by the violence and exactions which he permitted to the soldiers who were quartered in their houses.", "4389": "He issued an order that the master of a house should daily supply the soldier who was quartered on him with four tetradrachmæ, and with dinner for himself and as many of his friends as he chose to invite;", "4390": "a centurion was to receive fifty drachma daily, and to be supplied with two garments, one to wear in the house and the other when he went abroad.", "4391": "XXVI.", "4392": "Sulla set sail from Ephesus with all his ships, and on the third day anchored in the Peiræus.", "4393": "After being initiated into the Eleusinian * mysteries, he appro­ priated to himself the library of Apellikon † of Teos, which contained most of the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus.", "4394": "The works of these two philosophers were not then well known to people in general.", "4395": "It is said that when the library was brought to Rome, Tyrannic the grammarian arranged most cf the books, and that Andronikus of Rhodes having procured copies from Tyrannic, published them, and made the tables which are now in use.", "4396": "It appears that the older Peripatetics were indeed well-instructed men, and devoted to letters, but they did not possess many of the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus, nor yet correct copies, owing to the circumstances that the books came into the hands of the heirs of Neleus of Skepsis, to whom Theophrastus be­ queathed them, and that they were ignorant persons, who never troubled themselves about such matters.", "4397": "While Bulla was staying at Athens, he was seized with a numb­ ness in his feet, accompanied with a feeling of heaviness, which Strabo* calls “a stammering of gout.\"", "4398": "Accord­ ingly he crossed the sea to Ædepsus,†where he used the warm springs, at the same time indulging in relaxation .and spending all his time in the company of actors.", "4399": "As he was walking about on the sea-shore, some fishermen presented him with some very fine fish;", "4400": "Sulla was much pleased with the present, but on hearing that the men belonged to Halææ,* he said, What, is there an Halæan still alive?", "4401": "For it happened, that while pursuing his enemies after the victory at Orchomenus, he destroyed at once three Bœotian cities, Anthedon, Larymna, and Halææ.", "4402": "The men were struck speechless with fear, but Sulla with a smile bade them go away in good heart, for the intercessors they had brought were no mean ones, and not to be despised.", "4403": "Upon this the Halæans say they took courage and again occupied their city.", "4404": "XXVII.", "4405": "Sulla went through Thessaly and Macedonia to the sea-coast, where he made preparations to cross from Dyrrachium t to Brundisium with twelve hundred ships.", "4406": "Near to Dyrrachium is Apollonia, and near to Apollonia is the Nymphæum,‡ a sacred spot, where perpetual streams of fire rise in various places out of a green grassy valley.", "4407": "It is said that a sleeping satyr was caught there, such a one as sculptors and painters represent, and was brought to Sulla and questioned by many interpreters as to who he was;", "4408": "but he spoke with difficulty, and what he did utter was unintelligible, and something like a compound of the neighing of a horse and the bleating of a goat;", "4409": "upon which Sulla, who was startled at the monster, ordered him to be removed.", "4410": "Sulla was now about to take his soldiers over the sea, but he feared that when they landed in Italy they would disperse to their several cities;", "4411": "however, the soldiers voluntarily took an oath to abide by him, and not to do any damage in Italy from set design;", "4412": "seeing also that he required much money, they all contributed something from what they had, each according to his means.", "4413": "However, Sulla would not receive the contribution, but after commending their zeal and encouraging them he proceeded to cross the sea, as he expresses it in his Memoirs, to oppose fifteen hostile com­ manders at the head of four hundred and fifty cohorts.-", "4414": "The deity gave him sure prognostics of success;", "4415": "for upon his sacrificing immediately on landing in Italy near Tarentum, the liver of the animal was found to have on it the figure of a crown t of bay with two ribands attached to it.", "4416": "A short time also before he crossed the sea, two large he-goats were seen in Campania near Mount Hephæus, in the daytime, fighting, and in all respects acting like men engaged in a contest.", "4417": "But it was only a vision, and it gradually rose up from the ground and dispersed in the air in various directions like dark phantoms, and finally disappeared.", "4418": "No long time after, in this very spot, when the younger Marius and the consul Norbanus‡ came upon him at the head of a large force, Sulla, without having time to form his battle or to dispose his companies, but merely availing himself of the spirit that animated all his men, and their impetuous courage, put to flight his opponents, and shut Norbanus up in Capua with the loss of seven thousand of his soldiers.", "4419": "It was this success, as some say, which prevented his soldiers from dispersing to their several cities, and encouraged them to stay with Sulla and to despise their opponents, though many times more numerous than themselves.", "4420": "At Silvium,* as Sulla says, a slave of one Pontius, moved by a divine impulse, met him and declared that he brought from Bellona assurance of superiority in war and victory, but that if he did not make haste the Capitol would be burnt;", "4421": "and this is said to have happened on the very day which the man foretold, being the day before the Nones of Quintilis, which we now call July.", "4422": "Further, Marcus Lucullus, one of Sulla's commanders, was opposed at Fidentia† with sixteen cohorts to fifty of the enemy, and though he had confidence in the spirit of his men, he was discouraged because a greater part of them were unarmed.", "4423": "While he was considering and hesitating what to do, a gentle breeze blowing from the adjoining plain, which was covered with grass, carried many of the flowers to the army of Lucullus, and spontaneously strewed them about, so that they rested and fell on the men’s shields and helmets, which seemed to their opponents to be crowned with chaplets.", "4424": "Thus encouraged, the soldiers of Lucullus engaged, and gained a victory, with the loss to the opposite party of eighteen thousand men and their camp.", "4425": "This Lucullus was the brother of the Lucullus who after­ wards defeated Mithridates and Tigranes.", "4426": "XXVIII.", "4427": "Sulla, perceiving that he was still surrounded by many hostile camps and large forces, treacherously invited Scipio‡ one of the consuls, to come to terms.", "4428": "Scipio accepted the proposal, which was followed by many meetings and conferences, but Sulla continually threw impediments and pretexts in the way of a final agree­ ment, and in the mean time he corrupted Scipio's soldiers by means of his own men, who were as practised in all kinds of deceit and fraud as their commander.", "4429": "Going within the intrenchments of Scipio and mingling with his soldiers, they gained over some by giving them money, others by promises, and the rest by flattery and persuasion.", "4430": "At last Sulla with twenty cohorts approached the camp of Scipio, and his soldiers saluted those of Scipio, who returned the salute and came over to them.", "4431": "Scipio, thus deserted, was taken prisoner in his tent, but set at liberty;", "4432": "and Sulla with the twenty cohorts, like so many tame birds, having entrapped forty of the enemy, led them all back to his camp.", "4433": "On this occasion, it is said, Carbo observed that he had to contend in bulla both with a lion and a fox, but the fox gave him most trouble.", "4434": "After this, in the neighbourhood of Signia,* Marius at the head of eighty-four cohorts challenged Sulla to battle;", "4435": "and Sulla was very ready for the contest on that day, for he happened to have had a vision in his sleep of this sort :", "4436": "-He dreamed that the elder Marius, who had long been dead, was advising his son to beware of the following day, as it would bring him heavy misfortune.", "4437": "This was the reason that Sulla was eager to fight, and he sent for Dolabella, ‡ who was en­ camped at some distance.", "4438": "But as the enemy occupied the roads and cut off the communications, the soldiers of Sulla were wearied with fighting and working at the roads at the same time;", "4439": "and it happened that much rain also fell, and added to the fatigue of their labour.", "4440": "Upon this, the centurions coming up to Bulla, begged him to defer the battle, and pointed out to him that the soldiers were exhausted by fatigue and were lying on the ground with their shields under them.", "4441": "Bulla consented unwill­ ingly, and gave orders for the army to halt there;", "4442": "but while they were beginning to throw up their rampart and dig their trenches, Marius advanced against them confidently at the head of his troops, expecting to disperse them in their state of disorder and confusion.", "4443": "Now the dæmon made good the words that Sulla heard in his dream ;", "4444": "for his soldiers, transported with indignation and stopping their work.", "4445": "fixed their spears in the ground close to the trenches, and drawing their swords with a loud shout, were forthwith at close quarters with the enemy.", "4446": "The soldiers of Marius did not stand their ground long, and there was a great slaughter of them in their flight.", "4447": "Marius, who fled to Præneste,* found the gates closed, but a rope being let down from the walls, he fastened himself to it, and was drawn up into the city.", "4448": "Some historians say, and Fenestellat among them, that Marius saw nothing of the battle, but that being exhausted by want of sleep and fatigue he lay down on the ground in the shade, and as soon as the signal was given for battle, fell asleep, and that he was roused with difficulty when the flight began.", "4449": "Sulla says that he lost only twenty-three men in this battle, and that he killed of the enemy twenty thousand, and took eight thousand alive.", "4450": "He was equally successful everywhere else through his generals Pompeius,‡ Crassus, Metellus, Servilius;", "4451": "for without sustaining any but the most trifling loss, they destroyed the great armies of their opponents, and at last Carbo,* who was the main support of the opposite party, stole away from his troops by night and sailed to Libya.", "4452": "XXIX.", "4453": "In the last struggle, however, like a fresh combatant attacking an exhausted athlete, Telesinus the Samnite was very near tripping up Sulla and laying him prostrate at the gates of Rome.", "4454": "Telesinus was hastening with Lamponius the Lucanian and a strong force to Præneste, in order to rescue Marius, who was besieged;", "4455": "but finding that Sulla in his front and Pompeius in his rear were coming against him, and that he could neither advance nor retreat, like a brave and experienced man he broke up his encampment by night and marched with all his force against Rome.", "4456": "And indeed he was very near surprising the city, which was unguarded;", "4457": "however, halting about ten stadia from the Colline gate, he passed the night there, full of confidence and elated with hope, as he had got the advantage over so many great generals.", "4458": "At daybreak the most distinguished young men came out on horseback to oppose him, but many of them fell, and among them Claudius Appius,‡ a man of noble rank and good character.", "4459": "This naturally caused confusion in the city, and there were women shrieking and people hurrying in all directions, in expectation that the city was going to be stormed, when Balbus appeared first, coming at full speed from Sulla with seven hundred horsemen.", "4460": "Balbus just halted long enough to allow his men to dry the sweat from their horses:", "4461": "then bridling them again, they advanced quickly and engaged with the enemy.", "4462": "In the mean time Sulla also appeared, and ordering the advanced ranks to take some refreshment, he began to put them in order of battle.", "4463": "Dolabella and Torquatus earnestly en­ treated him to pause, and not to put all to the hazard with his exhausted soldiers;", "4464": "they said, the contest was not with Carbo and Marius, but with Samnites and Lucanians, the most deadly and warlike enemies of Rome:", "4465": "but Sulla, without paying any regard to them, ordered the trumpets to sound the charge, though it was now about the tenth hour.", "4466": "The battle began, and was fiercer than any that was fought in this campaign.", "4467": "The right wing, where Crassus commanded, was completely successful;", "4468": "but the left was hard pressed, and in a dangerous plight, when Sulla came to its support mounted on a very spirited and fleet white horse, by which he was easily distinguished from the rest, and two of the enemy's soldiers, fixing their javelins, prepared to aim at him, Sulla did not see them, but his groom whipped the horse, which just carried his rider so far out of the reach of the spears that they passed close to the horse's tail, and stuck in the ground.", "4469": "It is said that Bulla always carried about with him in his bosom, in battle, a small golden figure of Apollo, which he got from Delphi, and that he then kissed it, and said, “0 Pythian Apollo, after raising the fortunate Bulla Cornelius in so many contests to glory and renown, wilt thou throw him prostrate hero, at the gates of his native city, and so bring him to perish most ignobly with his fellow-citizens?”", "4470": "After this address to the god it is said that Sulla entreated some, and threatened and laid hold of others ;", "4471": "but at last, the left wing being completely broken, he was mingled with the fugitives and made his escape to the camp with the loss of many of his friends and men of note.", "4472": "Not a few of the citizens also, who had come to see the fight, were killed and trampled down, so that it was thought all was over with the city, and the blockade of Marius was all but raised, for many of the fugitives made their way to Praeneste, and urged Ofella Lucretius,* who had been appointed to conduct the siege, to break up his quarters with speed, as Sulla was killed, and Rome in the possession of the enemy.", "4473": "XXX.", "4474": "It was now far on in the night when men came to Sulla's camp from Crassus to get something to eat for him and his soldiers, for after putting the enemy to flight they had pursued them to Antemnæ,† and there encamped.", "4475": "U pon this intelligence, and that most of the enemy were killed, Sulla came to Antemnæ at daybreak.", "4476": "Here three thousand soldiers sent to him to propose to surrender, and Bulla promised them their lives if they would punish the rest of his enemies before they joined him.", "4477": "Trusting to his promise, these men attacked their comrades, and a great number on both sides were cut to pieces.", "4478": "However, Bulla got together the soldiers who had offered to sur­ render and those who had survived the massacre, to the number of six thousand, in the Circus,‡ and at the same time he summoned the Senate to the temple of Bellona.", "4479": "As soon as he began to speak, the men who were appointed to do the work began to cut down the six thousand men.", "4480": "A cry naturally arose from so many men being butchered in a narrow space, and the Senators were startled;", "4481": "but Sulla preserving the same unmoved expression of coun­ tenance, bade them attend to what he was saying, and not trouble themselves about what was going on outside;", "4482": "it was only some villains who were being punished by his orders.", "4483": "This made even the dullest Roman see that there was merely an exchange of tyrants, not a total change.", "4484": "Now Marius was always cruel, and he grew more so, and the possession of power did not change his disposition.", "4485": "But Sulla at first used his fortune with moderation and like a citizen of a free state, and he got the reputation of being a leader who, though attached to the aristocratical party, still regarded the interests of the people;", "4486": "besides this, he was from his youth fond of mirth, and so soft to pity as to be easily moved to tears.", "4487": "It was not without reason, then, that his subsequent conduct fixed on the possession of great power the imputation that it does not let men's tempers abide by their original habits, but makes them violent, vain, and inhuman.", "4488": "Now whether fortune really produces an alteration and change in a man's natural disposition, or whether, when he gets to power, his bad qualities hitherto concealed are merely unveiled, is a matter that belongs to another subject than the present.", "4489": "XXXI.", "4490": "Sulla now began to make blood flow, and he filled the city with deaths without number or limit;", "4491": "many persons were murdered on grounds of private enmity, who had never had anything to do with Sulla, but he consented to their death to please his adherents.", "4492": "At last a young man, Caius Metellus, had the boldness to ask Sulla in the Senate-house, when there would be an end to these miseries, and how far he would proceed before they could hope to see them stop.", "4493": "“", "4494": "We are not deprecating,\" he said, “ your vengeance against those whom you have determined to put out of the way, but we entreat you to relieve from uncertainty those whom you have determined to spare.\"", "4495": "Sulla replied, that he had not yet determined whom he would spare.", "4496": "\"Tell us then,\" said Metellus, \"whom you intend to punish.\"", "4497": "Bulla said that he would.", "4498": "Some say that it was not Metellus, but Afidius,* one of Sulla's flatterers, who made use of the last expression.", "4499": "Bulla immediately proscribed eighty persons without communicating with any magis­ trate.", "4500": "As this caused a general murmur, he let one day pass, and then proscribed two hundred and twenty more, and again on the third day as many.", "4501": "In an harangue to the people, he said, with reference to these measures, that he had proscribed all he could think of, and as to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.", "4502": "It was part of the proscription † that every man who received and protected a proscribed person should be put to death for his humanity;", "4503": "and there was no exception for brothers, children, or parents.", "4504": "The reward for killing a proscribed person was two talents, whether it was a slave who killed his master or a son who killed his father.", "4505": "But what was considered most unjust of all, he affixed infamy on the sons and grandsons of the proscribed and confiscated their property.", "4506": "The proscriptions were not confined to Rome;", "4507": "they extended to every city of Italy:", "4508": "neither temple nor hospitable hearth nor father's house was free from murder, but husbands were butchered in the arms of their wives, and children in the embrace of their mothers.", "4509": "The number of those who were massacred through revenge and hatred was nothing compared with those who were murdered for their property.", "4510": "It occurred even to the assassins to observe that the ruin of such a one was due to his large house, another man owed his death to his orchard, and another again to his warm baths.", "4511": "Quintus Aurelius, a man who never meddled with public affairs, and though he was no further concerned about all these calamities except so far as he sympathised with the sufferings of others, happened to come to the Forum and there he rea the names of the proscribed.", "4512": "Finding his own name among them, he exclaimed, Alas !", "4513": "wretch that I am;", "4514": "'tis my farm at Alba that is my persecutor.", "4515": "He had not gone far before he was murdered by some one who was in search of him.", "4516": "XXXII.", "4517": "In the mean time Marius killed himself to avoid being taken.", "4518": "Sulla now went to Præneste,* and he began by examining the case of each individual before he punished him ;", "4519": "but having no time for this inquiry, he had all the people brought to one spot, to the number of twelve thousand, and ordered them to be massacred, with the exception of one man, an old friend of his, whom he offered to pardon.", "4520": "But the man nobly de­ clared he would never owe his safety to the destroyer of his country, and mingling with the rest of the citizens he was cut down together with them.", "4521": "The affair of Lucius Catilina t was perhaps the most monstrous of all.", "4522": "Lucius had murdered his brother before the termination of the war, and he asked Sulla to proscribe him among the rest as if he were still alive;", "4523": "which was done.", "4524": "To show his gratitude, Catilina killed one Marcus Marius, ‡ who belonged to the opposite faction, and after bringing his head to Sulla, who was then sitting in the Forum, he went to the temple of Apollo, which was close by, and washed his hands in the sacred font.", "4525": "§XXXIII.", "4526": "Besides the massacres, there were other things to cause dissatisfaction.", "4527": "Sulla had himself proclaimed Dictator,.", "4528": "and thus revived this office after an interval of one hundred and twenty years.", "4529": "An act of indemnity was also passed for all that he had done;", "4530": "for the future it was enacted that he should have power of life and death, and should confiscate property, distribute lands, found colonies, destroy them, take away kingdoms and give them to whom he pleased.", "4531": "The sales of confiscated property were con­ ducted by him from his tribunal in such an arrogant and tyrannical manner, that his mode of dealing with the produce of the sales was more intolerable than the seizure of the property :", "4532": "he gave away to handsome women, players on the lyre, mimi and worthless libertini, the lands of whole nations and the revenues of cities ;", "4533": "to some men he gave wives, who were compelled to marry against their will.", "4534": "Wishing to form an alliance with Pompeius Magnus, he made him put away his wife;", "4535": "and he took ,Emilia, who was the daughter of Scaurus and of his own wife Metella, from her husband Manius Glabrio,t though she was then with child, and married her to Pompeius.", "4536": "Æmilia died in the house of Pompeius in childbirth.", "4537": "Lucretius 0 fella, t who had taken Præneste, became a candidate for the consulship, and canvassed for it.", "4538": "Sulla at first attempted to stop him ;", "4539": "but on Lucretius entering the Forum supported by a large party, Sulla sent one of his centurions to kill Lucretius, himself the while sitting on his tribunal in the temple of Castor and Pollux, and looking down upon the murder.", "4540": "The bystanders seized the centurion and brought him before the tribunal;", "4541": "but Sulla bidding them stop their noise, declared that he had ordered the centurion to kill Lucretius, and they must let him go.XXXIV.", "4542": "The triumph - of Sulla was magnificent for the splendour and rarity of the regal spoils;", "4543": "but the exiles formed a greater ornament to it and a noble spectacle.", "4544": "The most illustrious and wealthy of the citizens followed in the procession with chaplets on their heads, calling Bulla their saviour and father, inasmuch as through him they were restored to their country, their children, and their wives.", "4545": "When the triumph was over, Bulla before the assembled people gave an account of all the events of his life, mentioning with equal particularity his good fortune and his great deeds, and in conclusion he bade them salute him by the name of Eutyches,t for this is the nearest word to express the Latin Felix :", "4546": "and when he wrote to Greeks or had any business to transact with them, he called him­ self Epaphroditus.", "4547": "In our country also, on the trophies of Sulla, there is the inscription:", "4548": "Lucius Cornelius Bulla Epaphroditus.", "4549": "As Metella bore him twins, Sulla named the male Faustus, and the female Fausta:", "4550": "for the Romans apply the name Faustus to what is fortunate and gladsome.", "4551": "Sulla indeed trusted so far to his good fortune rather than to his acts, that, though he had put many persons to death, and had made so many innovations and changes in the state, he laid down the dictatorship,* and allowed the people to have the full control of the consular elections, without going near them, and all the while walking about in the Forum, and exposing himself to any one who might choose to call him to account, just like a private person.", "4552": "Contrary to Sulla's wish, a bold man, and an enemy of his, was likely to be elected consul, Marcus Lepidus,* not for his own merits, but because the people wished to please Pompeius, who was earnest in his support and canvassed for him.", "4553": "Sulla seeing Pompeius going home well pleased with his victory, called him to him and said:", "4554": "What a fine piece of policy is this of yours, young man, for Lepidus to be proclaimed consul before Catulus, the most violent in preference to the most honourable of men", "4555": "It is, however, time for you not to be asleep, as you have strengi honed your rival against yourself.", "4556": "Sulla said this in a kind of prophetic tone, for Lepidus soon broke out in great excesses, and was at war with Pompeius.", "4557": "XXXV.", "4558": "Bulla made an offering of the tenth part of his substance to Hercules, and feasted the people magnifi­ cently :", "4559": "so much greater indeed was the preparation than what was required, that a great quantity of provisions was daily thrown into the river, and wine was drunk forty years old, and even older.", "4560": "In the midst of the entertain­ ment, which lasted several days, Metella died.", "4561": "As the priests would not allow Sulla to go to her, or his house to be polluted by a dead body, Sulla sent Metella a writing of divorce, and ordered her, while still alive, to be removed from his house to another.", "4562": "So far he observed the custom strictly through superstition;", "4563": "but the Jaw which limited the cost of funerals, though he had proposed it himself, he violated by sparing no expense.", "4564": "He also violated his own laws for diminishing the cost of entertainments, endea­ vouring to forget his grief in extravagant drinking and feasting, and in the company of buffoons.", "4565": "A few months after his wife's death there was a show of gladiators.", "4566": "As there was yet no distinction of places,.", "4567": "but men and women sat promiscuously in the theatre, it chanced that a woman seated herself near Bulla who was very handsome and of good family;", "4568": "she was a daughter of Messala, and sister of the orator Hortensius:", "4569": "her name was Valeria,t and she had latelp separated from her husband.", "4570": "This woman, going behind Sulla, placed her hand upon him, and pulling a thread out of his dress, returned to her place.", "4571": "As Sulla looked on her with some surprise, she said, No mischief, Imperator;", "4572": "‡ I also wish to have a bit of your good fortune.", "4573": "Sulla was not displeased at her words, and it was soon plain that he had conceived a passion for the woman;", "4574": "for he privately sent to ask her name, and made himself acquainted with her family and her mode of life.", "4575": "After this there were interchanges of glances, and frequent side-looks, and giving and return­ ing of smiles, and, finally, treaties and arrangements about marriage, all which on her part perhaps deserved no censure;", "4576": "but as to Bulla, however chaste and reputable the woman might be that he married, it was no reputable or decent matter that induced him to it, for he was caught like a young man by mere looks and wanton airs, the nature of which is to excite the most depraved and impure feelings.", "4577": "XXXVI.", "4578": "Though Sulla married Valeria he still asso­ ciated with actresses and female lute-players and dancers, spending his time with them on beds, and drinking from an early hour of the day.", "4579": "These were the names of the persons who at this time enjoyed most of his favour:", "4580": "- Roscius.", "4581": "the comedian, Sorix the chief mimus, and Metrobius who played women's parts t in men's dress, and to whom, though Metrobius was now growing old, Sulla all along continued strongly attached, and never attempted to conceal it.", "4582": "By this mode of life he aggravated his disease, which was slight in its origin, and for some time he was not aware that all his viscera were full of diseased matter.", "4583": "The flesh, being corrupted by the disease, was changed into vermin,‡ and though many persons were engaged day and night in taking the vermin away, what was got rid of was nothing compared with what came, for all his clothes, and the bath and the water, and his food, were filled with the matter that flowed from him, and with the vermin ;", "4584": "such was the violence of the disorder.", "4585": "Though he went into the water several times a day and drenched his body and cleansed it from filth, it was of no avail, for the disease went on too quickly, and the quantity of vermin defied all attempts to clear it away.", "4586": "Among those in very remote times who are said to have died of the lousy disease was Akastus the son of Pelias ;", "4587": "and in more recent times, Alkman the lyric poet, Phere­ kydes the theologian, Kallisthenes of Olynthus, while he was in prison, and Mucius the lawyer.", "4588": "And if one may mention those who have got a name, not for any good that they did, but in other ways, Eunus the runaway slave, who began the Servile war in Sicily, is said to have died of this disease, after he was captured and carried to Rome.", "4589": "XXXVII.", "4590": "Bulla foresaw his end, and even in a manner wrote about it, for he finished the twenty-second book of his Memoirs only two days before his death.", "4591": "He there says, that the Chaldæans foretold him that it was his fate to die, after a happy life, at the very height of his pro­ sperity ;", "4592": "he says also that his son, who had died a short time before Metella, appeared to him in a dream, in a mean dress, and standing by him, entreated his father to rest from his troubles and to go with him to join his mother Metella, and live with her in ease and quiet.", "4593": "Yet he did not give up attending to public matters.", "4594": "Ten days before his death he restored tranquillity among the people of Dicæarchia,* who were in a state of civil commotion, and he drew up for them a constitution;", "4595": "and only one day before his death, hearing that the chief magistrate Granius was a public defaulter and refused to pay the debt, wait­ ing for Sulla's death, Sulla sent for the man to his chamber, and surrounding him with his slaves ordered.", "4596": "him to be strangled;", "4597": "but with his shouting and efforts he burst an imposthume and vomited a quantity of blood.", "4598": "Upon this his strength failed him and he got through the night with difficulty.", "4599": "He left two infant children by Metella;", "4600": "Valeria, after his death, brought forth a daughter, whom they called Postuma,* for this is the name that the Romans give to children who are born after their father'is death.", "4601": "XXXVIII.", "4602": "Now many flocked to Lepidus and combined with him to prevent the body of Sulla from receiving the usual interment.", "4603": "But Pompeius, though he had ground of complaint against Sulla, for he was the only friend whom Bulla had passed over in his will,.", "4604": "turning some from their purpose by his influence and entreaties, and others by threats, had the body conveyed to Rome, and secured it a safe and honourable interment.", "4605": "It is said that the women contributed so great a quantity of aromatics for Sulla's funeral, t that without including what was con­ veyed in two hundred and ten litters, there was enough to make a large figure of Sulla, and also to make a lictor out of costly frankincense and cinnamon.", "4606": "The day was cloudy in the morning, and as rain was expected they did not bring the body out till the ninth hour.", "4607": "However, a strong wind came down on the funeral pile and raised a great flame, and they had just time to collect the ashes as the pile was sinking and the fire going out, when a heavy rain poured down and lasted till night;", "4608": "so Sulla's good fortune seemed to follow him to his funeral, and to stay with him to the last.", "4609": "His monument is in the Campus Martius.", "4610": "The inscription, which they say he wrote and left behind him, says in substance, that none of his friends ever did him a kindness, and none of his enemies ever did him a wrong, without being fully repaid.", "4611": "Now that we have completed the second of these men's lives, let us proceed to compare them with one another.", "4612": "Both rose to greatness by their own exertions, though it was the peculiar glory of Lysander that all his commands were bestowed upon him by his countrymen of their own free will and by their deliberate choice, and that he never opposed their wishes or acted in opposition to the laws of his country.", "4613": "Now,­ \"In revolutions, villains rise to fame,\" and at Rome, at the period of which we are treating, the people were utterly corrupt and degraded, and frequently changed their masters.", "4614": "We need not wonder at Sulla's becoming supreme in Rome when such men as Glaucia and Saturninus drove the Metelli into exile, when the sons of consuls were butchered in the senate-house, when silver and gold purchased soldiers and arms, and laws were enacted by men who silenced their opponents by fire and the sword.", "4615": "I cannot blame a man who rises to power at such a time as this, but I cannot regard it as any proof of his being the best man in the state, if the state itself be in such a condition of disorder.", "4616": "Now Lysander was sent out to undertake the most important commands at a time when Sparta was well and orderly governed;", "4617": "and proved himself the greatest of all the foremost men of his age, the best man of the best regulated state.", "4618": "For this reason Lysander, though he often laid down his office, was always re-elected by his countrymen, for the renown of his abilities naturally pointed him out as the attest man to command:", "4619": "whereas Sulla, after being once elected to les 1 an army, remained the chief man in Rome for ten years, calling himself sometimes consul and sometimes dictator, but always remaining a mere military despot.", "4620": "II.", "4621": "We have related an attempt of Lysander to subvert the constitution of Sparta;", "4622": "but he proceeded by a much more moderate and law-abiding means than Sulla, for he meant to gain his point by persuasion, not by armed force;", "4623": "and besides this he did not intend to destroy the constitu­ tion utterly, but merely to reform the succession to the throne.", "4624": "And it does not seem contrary to justice, that he who is best among his peers should govern a city, which ruled in Greece by virtue, not by nobility of blood.", "4625": "A huntsman tries to obtain a good hound, and a horse­ man a good horse, but does not trouble himself with their offspring, for the offspring of his horse might turn out to be a mule.", "4626": "Just so in politics, the important point is, what sort of man a ruler is, not from what family he is descended.", "4627": "Even the Spartans in some cases dethroned their kings, because they were not king-like but worthless men.", "4628": "If then vice be disgraceful even in the nobly born, it follows that virtue does not depend upon birth, but is honoured for itself.", "4629": "The crimes of Lysander were committed for, those of Sulla against, his friends.", "4630": "Indeed, what Lysander did wrong was done chiefly on behalf of his friends, as, in order to establish them securely in their various despotic governments, he caused many of their political opponents to be pat to death.", "4631": "Sulla, on the other hand, reduced the army of Pompeius and the fleet which he himself had given to Dolabella to command, merely to gratify his private spite.", "4632": "When Lucretius Ofella sued for the consul­ ship as the reward of many great exploits, he ordered him to be put to death before his face, and thus made all men fear and hate him by his barbarous treatment of his most intimate friends.", "4633": "III.", "4634": "Their several esteem for pleasure and for riches prove still more clearly that Lysander was born to com­ mand men;", "4635": "Sulla to tyrannize over them.", "4636": "The former, although he rose to such an unparalleled height of power never was betrayed by it into any acts of insolent caprice, and there never was a man to whom the well-known proverb was less applicable, Bulla, on the other hand, did not allow his poverty when young or his years when old to hinder him in the pursuit of pleasure, but he enacted laws to regulate the marriages and morals of his countrymen, and indulged his own amorous propensities in spite of them, as we read in Sallust's history.", "4637": "In consequence of his vices, Rome was so drained of money that he was driven to the expedient of allowing the allied cities to purchase their independence by payment, and that, too, although he was daily proscribing the richest men and selling their property by public auction.", "4638": "Yet he wasted money without limit upon his courtiers.", "4639": "What bounds can we imagine he would set to his generosity when in his cups, seeing that once, when a great estate was being sold by public auction, he ordered the auctioneer to knock it down to a friend of his own for a mere nominal sum, and when some one else made a higher bid, and the auctioneer called out the additional sum offered, Bulla flew into a passion and exclaimed:", "4640": "\" My friends, I am very hardly used if I may not dispose of my own plunder as I please.\"", "4641": "Now Lysander sent home to his country­ men even what he had himself received as presents to­ gether with the rest of the spoils.", "4642": "Yet I do not approve of him for so doing:", "4643": "for he did as much harm to Sparta by bestowing that money upon it as Sulla did harm to Rome by the money which he took from it:", "4644": "but I mention it as proving how little he cared for money.", "4645": "Each acted strangely towards his fellow-countrymen.", "4646": "Sulla regu­ lated and improved the morals of Rome, although he himself was wasteful and licentious.", "4647": "Lysander filled his countrymen with the passions from which he himself was free.", "4648": "Thus the former was worse than the laws which he himself enacted, while the latter rendered his countrymen worse than himself, as he taught the Spartans to covet what he had learned to despise.", "4649": "So much for their politi­ cal conduct.", "4650": "IV.", "4651": "In warlike exploits, in brilliancy of generalship, in the number of victories he won, and the greatness of the dangers which he encountered, Bulla is immeasurably the greater.", "4652": "Lysander did indeed twice conquer in a sea- fight, and I will even allow him the credit of having taken Athens ;", "4653": "no difficult matter, no doubt, but one which brought him great glory because of its being so famous a city.", "4654": "In Boeotia and before Haliartus he was perhaps un­ lucky, yet his conduct in not waiting for the arrival of the great force under Pausanias, which was at Plataea, close by, seems like bad generalship.", "4655": "He would not stay till the main body arrived, but rashly assaulted the city, and fell by an unknown hand in an insignificant skir­ mish.", "4656": "He did not meet his death facing overwhelming odds, like Kleombrotus at Leuktra, nor yet in the act of rallying his broken forces, or of consummating his victory, as did Cyrus and Epameinondas.", "4657": "All these died as became generals and kings;", "4658": "but Lysander ingloriously flung away his life like any common light infantry soldier, and proved the wisdom of the ancient Spartans, who always avoided the attack of fortified places, where the bravest may fall by the hand of the most worthless man, or even by that of a woman or a child, as Achilles is said to have been slain by Paris at the gates of Troy.", "4659": "Turning now to bulla, it is not easy to enumerate all the pitched battles he won, the thousands of enemies that he overthrew.", "4660": "He twice took Rome itself by storm, and at Athens he took Peiraeus, not by famine like Lysander, but after a gigan­ tic struggle, at the end of which he drove Archelaus into the sea.", "4661": "It is important also to consider who were the generals to whom they were opposed.", "4662": "It must have been mere child's-play to Lysander to defeat Antiochus, the pilot of Alkibiades, and to outwit Philokles, the Athenian mob­ orator, “ A knave, whose tongue was sharper than his sword,\" for they were both of them men whom Mithri dates would not have thought a match for one of his grooms, or Marius for one of his lictors.", "4663": "Not to mention the rest of the potentates, consuls, prætors and tribunes with whom Sulla had to contend, what Roman was more to be dreaded than Marius?", "4664": "What king more powerful than Mithri­ dates ?", "4665": "Who was there in Italy more warlike than Lam­ ponius and Pontius Telesinus?", "4666": "Yet Sulla drove Marius into exile, crushed the power of Mithridates, and put Lamponius and Pontius to death.", "4667": "V.", "4668": "What, however, to my mind incontestably proved Bulla to have been the greater man of the two, is that, whereas Lysander was always loyally assisted by his countrymen in all his enterprises, Sulla, during his cam­ paign in Boeotia, was a mere exile.", "4669": "His enemies were all­ powerful at Rome.", "4670": "They had driven his wife to seek safety in flight, had pulled down his house, and mur­ dered his friends.", "4671": "Yet he fought in his country's cause against overwhelming numbers, and gained the victory.", "4672": "Afterwards, when Mithridates offered to join him and furnish him with the means of overcoming his private enemies, he showed no sign of weakness, and would not even speak to him or give him his hand until he heard him solemnly renounce all claim to Asia Minor, engage to deliver up his fleet, and to restore Bithynia and Cappa­ docia to their native sovereigns.", "4673": "Never did Sulla act in a more noble and high-minded manner.", "4674": "He preferred his country's good to his own private advantage, and, like a well-bred hound, never relaxed his hold till his enemy gave in, and then began to turn his attention to redress­ ing his own private wrongs.", "4675": "Perhaps their treatment of Athens gives us some insight into their respective characters.", "4676": "Although that city sided with Mithridates and fought to maintain his empire, yet when Sulla had taken it he made it free and independent.", "4677": "Lysander, on the other hand, felt no pity for Athens when she fell from her glorious position as the leading state in Greece, but put an end to her free constitution and esta­ blished the cruel and lawless government of the Thirty.", "4678": "We may now conclude our review of their respective lives by observing that while Sulla performed greater achievements, Lysander committed fewer crimes:", "4679": "and that while we assign the palm for moderation and self- denial to the latter, that for courage and generalship must be bestowed upon the former.", "4680": "PERIPOLTAS, the soothsayer, after he had brought back King Opheltas and the people under him to Bœotia, left a family which remained in high repute for many genera­ tions, and chiefly settled in Chæronea, which was the first city which they conquered when they drove out the bar­ barians.", "4681": "As the men of this race were all brave and war­ like, they were almost reduced to extinction in the wars with the Persians, and in later times with the Gauls during their invasion of Greece, so that there remained but one male of the family, a youth of the name of Damon, who was surnamed Peripoltas, and who far surpassed all the youth of his time in beauty and spirit, although he was uneducated and harsh-tempered.", "4682": "The commander of a detachment of Roman soldiers who were quartered during the winter in Chæronea conceived a criminal passion for Damon, who was then a mere lad, and as he could not effect his purpose by fair means it was evident that he would not hesitate to use force, as our city was then much decayed, and was despised, being so small and poor.", "4683": "Damon, alarmed and irritated at the man's be­ haviour, formed a conspiracy with a few young men of his own age, not many, for secrecy's sake, but consisting of sixteen in all.", "4684": "These men smeared their faces with soot, excited themselves by strong drink, and assaulted the Roman officer just at daybreak, while he was offer­ ing sacrifice in the market-place.", "4685": "They killed him and several of his attendants, and then made their escape out of the city.", "4686": "During the confusion which followed, the senate of the city of Chæronea assembled and condemned the conspirators to death-a decree which was intended to excuse the city to the Romans for what had happened.", "4687": "But that evening, when the chief magistrates, as is their custom, were dining together, Damon and his party broke into the senate-house, murdered them all, and again escaped out of the city.", "4688": "It chanced that at this time Lucius Lucullus was passing near Chæronea with an armed force.", "4689": "He halted his troops, and, after investigating the circumstances, declared that the city was not to blame, but had been the injured party.", "4690": "As for Damon, who was living by brigandage and plunder of the country, and who threatened to attack the city itself, the citizens sent an embassy to him, and passed a decree guaranteeing his safety if he would return.", "4691": "When he returned they ap­ pointed him president of the gymnasium, and afterwards, while he was being anointed in the public baths, they murdered him there.", "4692": "Our ancestors tell us that as ghosts used to appear in that place, and groans were heard there, the doors of the bath-room were built up;", "4693": "and even at the present day those who live near the spot imagine that shadowy forms are to be seen, and confused cries heard.", "4694": "Those of his family who survive (for there are some descendants of Damon) live chiefly in Phokis, near the city of Steiris.", "4695": "They call themselves Asbolomeni, which in the Æolian dialect means \"sooty-faced,\" in memory of Damon having smeared his face with soot when he committed his crimes.", "4696": "II.", "4697": "Now the city of Orchomenus, which is next to that of Chæronea, was at variance with it, and hired a Roman informer, who indicted the city for the murder of those persons killed by Damon, just as if it were a man.", "4698": "The trial was appointed to take place before the praetor of Macedonia, for at that time the Romans did not appoint praetors of Greece.", "4699": "When in court the representatives of Chæronea appealed to Lucullus to testify to their innocence, and he, when applied to by the praetor, wrote a letter telling the entire truth of the story, which obtained an acquittal for the people of Chæronea.", "4700": "Thus narrowly did the city escape utter destruction.", "4701": "The citizens showed their gratitude to Lucullus by erecting a marble statue to him in the market-place, beside that of Dionysus;", "4702": "and although I live at a much later period, yet I think it my duty to show my gratitude to him also, as I too have benefited by his intercession.", "4703": "I intend therefore to describe his achievements in my Parallel Lives, and thus raise a much more glorious monument to his memory by describing his real disposition and character, than any statue can be, which merely records his faece and form.", "4704": "It will be sufficient for me if I show that his memory is held in grateful remembrance, for he himself would be the first to refuse to be rewarded for the true testimony which he bore to us by a fictitious narrative of his exploits.", "4705": "We think it right that portrait painters when engaged in painting a handsome face should neither omit nor ex­ aggerate its defects;", "4706": "for the former method wonld destroy the likeness and the latter the beauty of the picture.", "4707": "In like manner, as it is hard, or rather impossible, to find a man whose life is entirely free from blame, it becomes our duty to relate their noble actions with minute exacti­ tude, regarding them as illustrative of true character, whilst, whenever either a man's personal feelings or political exigencies may have led him to commit mistakes and crimes, we must regard his conduct more as a tem­ porary lapse from virtue than as disclosing any innate wickedness of disposition, and we must not dwell with needless emphasis on his failings, if only to save our common human nature from the reproach of being unable to produce a man of unalloyed goodness and virtue.", "4708": "III.", "4709": "It appears to me that the life of Lucullus furnishes a good parallel to that of Kimon.", "4710": "Both were soldiers, and distinguished themselves against the barbarians;", "4711": "both were moderate politicians and afforded their country­ men a brief period of repose from the violence of party strife, and both of them won famous victories.", "4712": "No Greek before Kimon, and no Roman before Lucullus, waged war at such a distance from home, if we except the legends of Herakles and Dionysus, and the vague accounts which we have received by tradition of the travels and exploits of Perseus in Ethiopia, Media, and Armenia, and of the expedition of Jason to recover the Golden Fleece.", "4713": "Another point in which they agree is the incomplete nature of the success which they obtained, for they both inflicted severe losses on their enemies, but neither co n- pletely crushed them.", "4714": "Moreover we find in each of them the same generous hospitality, and the same luxurious splendour of living.", "4715": "Their other points of resemblance the reader may easily discover for himself by a comparison of their respective lives.", "4716": "IV.", "4717": "Kimon was the son of Miltiades by his wife Hegasipyle, a lady of Thracian descent, being the daughter of King Olorus, as we learn from the poems addressed to Kimon himself by Archelaus and Melan­ thins.", "4718": "Thucydides the historian also was connected with Kimon's family, as the name of Olorus had descended to his father,.", "4719": "who also inherited gold mines in Thrace from his ancestors there.", "4720": "Thucydides is said to have died at Skapte Hyle, a small town in Thrace, near the gold mines", "4721": "His remains were conveyed to Athens and deposited in the cemetery belonging to the family of Kimon, where his tomb is now to be seen, next to that of Elpinike, Kimon's sister.", "4722": "However, Thucydides belonged to the township of Halimus, and the family of Miltiades to that of Lakia.", "4723": "Miltiades was condemned by the Athenians to pay a fine of fifty talents, and being unable to do so, died in prison, leaving Kimon and his sister Elpinike, who were then quite young children.", "4724": "Kimon passed the earlier part of his life in obscurity, and was not regarded favourably by the Athenians, who thought that he was disorderly and given to wine, and altogether resembled his grand­ father Kimon, who was called Koalemus because of his stupidity.", "4725": "Stesimbrotus of Thasos, who was a contemporary of Kimon, tells us that he never was taught music or any of the other usual accomplishments of a Greek gentleman, and that he had none of the smartness and readiness of speech so common at Athens, but that he was of a noble, truthful nature, and more like a Dorian of the Pelo­ ponnesus than an Athenian, “ Rough, unpretending, but a friend in need,\" as Euripides says of Herakles, which line we may well apply to Kimon according to the account of him given by Stesimbrotus.", "4726": "While he was still young he was accused of incest with his sister.", "4727": "Indeed Elpinike is not recorded as having been a respectable woman in other respects, as she carried on an intrigue with Polygnotus the painter;", "4728": "and therefore it is said that when he painted the colonnade which was then called the Poisianakteum, which is now called the Painted Porch, he introduced the portrait of Elpinike as Laodike, one of the Trojan ladies.", "4729": "Poly­ gnotus was a man of noble birth, and he did not execute his paintings for money, but gratis, from his wish to do honour to his city.", "4730": "This we learn from the historians and from the poet Melanthius, who wrote— “ With deeds of heroes old, He made our city gay, In market-place and porch, Himself the cost did pay.”", "4731": "Some historians tell us that Elpinike was openly married to Kimon and lived as his wife, because she was too poor to obtain a husband worthy of her noble birth, but that at length Kallias, one of the richest men in Athens, fell in love with her, and offered to pay off the fine which had been imposed upon her father, by which means he won her consent, and Kimon gave her away to Kallias as his wife.", "4732": "Kimon indeed seems to have been of an amorous temperament, for Asterie, a lady of Salamis, and one Mnestra are mentioned by the poet Melanthius, in some playful verses he wrote upon Kimon, as being beloved by him;", "4733": "and we know that he was passionately fond of Iso­ dike, the daughter of Euryptolemus the son of Megakles, who was his lawful wife, and that he was terribly afflicted by her death, to judge by the elegiac poem which was written to console him, of which Panætius the philosopher very reasonably conjectures Archelaus to have been the author.", "4734": "V.", "4735": "All the rest that we know of Kimon is to his honour.", "4736": "He was as brave as Miltiades, as clever as Themistokles, and more straightforward than either.", "4737": "Nor was he in­ ferior to either of them in military skill, while he far surpassed them in political sagacity, even when he was quite a young man, and without any experience of war.", "4738": "For instance, when Themistokles, at the time of the Persian invasion, urged the Athenians to abandon their city and territory, and resist the enemy at Salamis, on board of their fleet, while the greater part of the citizens were struck with astonishment at so daring a proposal, Kimon was seen with a cheerful countenance walking through the Kerameikus with his friends, carrying in his hand his horse's bridle, which he was going to offer up to the goddess Athena in the Acropolis, in token that at that crisis the city did not need horsemen so much as sailors.", "4739": "He hung up the bridle as a votive offering in the temple, and, taking down one of the shields which hung there, walked with it down towards the sea, thereby causing many of his countrymen to take courage and recover their spirits.", "4740": "He was not an ill-looking man, as Ion the poet' says, but tall, and with a thick curly head of hair.", "4741": "As he proved himself a brave man in action he quickly became popular and renowned in Athens, and many flocked round him, urging him to emulate the glories won by his father at Marathon.", "4742": "The people gladly welcomed him on his first entrance into political life, for they were weary of Themistokles, and were well pleased to bestow the highest honours in the state upon one whose simple and unaffected goodness of heart had made him a universal favourite.", "4743": "He was greatly indebted for his success to the support given him by Aristeides, who early perceived his good qualities, and endeavoured to set him up as an opponent to the rash projects and crooked policy of Themistokles.", "4744": "VI.", "4745": "When, after the repulse of the Persian invasion, Kimon was sent as general of the Athenian forces to operate against the enemy in Asia, acting under the orders of Pausanias, as the Athenians had not then acquit ed their supremacy at sea, the troops whom he commanded were distinguished by the splendour of their dress and arms, and the exactness of their discipline.", "4746": "Pausanias at this time was carrying on a treasonable correspondence with the king of Persia, and treated the allied Greek troops with harshness and wanton insolence, the offspring of unlimited power.", "4747": "Kimon, on the other hand, punished offenders leniently, treated all alike with kindness and condescension, and became in all but name the chief of the Greek forces in Asia, a position which he gained, not by force of arms, but by amiability of character.", "4748": "Most of the allies transferred their allegiance to Kimon and Aristeides, through disgust at the cruelty and arrogance of Pausanias.", "4749": "There is a tradition that Pausanias when at Byzantium became enamoured of Kleonike, the daughter of one of the leading citizens there.", "4750": "He demanded that she should be brought to his chamber, and her wretched parents dared not disobey the tyrant's order.", "4751": "From feelings of modesty Kleonike entreated the attendants at the door of his bed­ chamber to extinguish all the lights, and she then silently in the darkness approached the bed where Pausanias lay asleep.", "4752": "But she stumbled and overset the lamp.-", "4753": "He, awakened by the noise, snatched up his dagger, and imagining that some enemy was coming to assassinate him, stabbed the girl with it, wounding her mortally.", "4754": "It is said that after this her spirit would never let Pausanias rest, but nightly appeared to him, angrily reciting the verse— “ Go, meet thy doom;", "4755": "pride leadeth men to sin.", "4756": "\"The conduct of Pausanias in this matter so enraged the allied Greeks that, under Kimon's command, they besieged him in Byzantium, which they took by assault.", "4757": "He, how­ ever, escaped, and, it is said, fled for refuge to the oracle of the dead at Heraklea, where he called up the soul of Kleo- Dike and besought her to pardon him.", "4758": "She appeared, and told him that if he went to Sparta he would soon be relieved of all his troubles, an enigmatical sentence alluding, it is supposed, to his approaching death there.", "4759": "VII.", "4760": "Kimon, who was now commander-in-chief, sailed to Thrace, as he heard that the Persians, led by certain nobles nearly related to Xerxes Limself, had captured the city of Eion on the river Strymon, and were making war upon the neighbouring Greek cities.", "4761": "His first act on landing was to defeat the Persians, and shut them up in the city.", "4762": "H e next drove away the Thracian tribes beyond the Strymon, who supplied the garrison with provisions, and by carefully watching the country round he reduced the city to such straits that Boutes, the Persian general perceiving that escape was impossible, set it on fire, and himself with his friends and property perished in the flames.", "4763": "When Kimon took the city he found nothing in it of any value, as everything had been destroyed in the fire together with the Persian garrison;", "4764": "but as the country was beautiful and fertile, he made it an Athenian colony.", "4765": "Three stone statues of Hermes at Athens were now set up by a decree of the people, on the first of which is written :", "4766": "­ “Brave men were they, who, by the Strymen fair, First taught the haughty Persians to despair;", "4767": "\" and on the second­ “", "4768": "Their mighty chiefs to thank and praise, The Athenians do these columns raise;", "4769": "That generations yet to come, May fight as well for hearth and home;", "4770": "\" and on the third­ “ Mnestheus from Athena led onr hosts of yore, With Agamemnon, to the Trojan shore;", "4771": "Than whom no chief knew better to array, The mail-clad Greeks, when mustering for the fray:", "4772": "Thus Homer sung;", "4773": "and Athens now, as then, Doth bear away the palm for ruling men.\"", "4774": "VIII.", "4775": "These verses, although Kimon's name is nowhere mentioned in them, appeared to the men of that time ex­ cessively adulatory.", "4776": "Neither Themistokles nor Miltiades had ever been so honoured.", "4777": "When Miltiades demanded the honour of an olive crown, Sophanes of Dekeleia rose up in the public assembly and said,—“Miltiades, when you have fought and conquered the barbarians alone, you may ask to be honoured alone, but not before \"— a harsh speech, but one which perfectly expressed the feeling of the people.", "4778": "Why, then, were the Athenians so charmed with Kimon's exploit?", "4779": "The reason probably was because their other commanders had merely defended them from attack, while under him they had been able themselves to attack the enemy, und had moreover won territory near Eion, and founded the colony of Amphipolis.", "4780": "Kimon also led a colony to Skyros, which island was taken by Kimon on the following pretext.", "4781": "The original inhabitants were Dolopes,* who were bad farmers, and lived chiefly by piracy.", "4782": "Emboldened by success they even began to plunder the strangers who came into their ports, and at last robbed and imprisoned some Thessalian merchants whose ships were anchored at Ktesium.", "4783": "The merchants escaped from prison, and laid a complaint against the people of Skyros before the Am­ phiktyonic council.", "4784": "The people refused to pay the fine imposed by the council, and said that it ought to be paid by those alone who had shared the plunder.", "4785": "These men, in terror for their ill-gotten gains, at once opened a corre­ spondence with Kimon, and offered to betray the islan 1 into his hands if he would appear before it with an Athenian fleet.", "4786": "Thus Kimon was enabled to make him­ self master of Skyros, where he expelled the Dolopes and put an end to their piracies;", "4787": "after which, as he learned that in ancient times the hero Theseus, the son of Ægeus, after he had been driven out of Athens, took refuge at Skyros, and was murdered there by Lykomedes, who feared him, he endeavoured to discover where he was buried.", "4788": "Indeed there was an oracle which commanded the Athenians to bring back the bones of Theseus to their city and pay them fitting honours, but they knew not where they lay, as the people of Skyros did not admit that they possessed them, and refused to allow the Athe­ nians to search for them.", "4789": "Great interest was now mani­ fested in the search, and after his sepulchre † had with great difficulty been discovered, Kimon placed the remains of the hero on board of his own ship and brought them back to Athens, from which they had been absent four hundred years.", "4790": "This act made him very popular with the people of Athens, one mark of which is to be found in his decision in the case of the rival tragic poets.", "4791": "When Bophokles produced his first play, being then very young, Aphepsion,* the archon, seeing that party feeling ran high among the spectators, would not cast lots to decide who were to be the judges, but when Kimon with the other nine generals, his colleagues, entered to make the usual libation to the god, he refused to allow them to depart, but put them on their oath, and forced them to sit as judges, they being ten in number, one from each of the ten tribes.", "4792": "The excitement of the contest was much in­ creased by the high position of the judges.", "4793": "The prize was adjudged to Sophokles, and it is said that Æschylus was so grieved and enraged at his failure that he shortly after­ wards left Athens and retired to Sicily, where he died, and was buried near the city of Gela.", "4794": "IX.", "4795": "Ion tells us that when quite a boy he came from Chios to Athens, and met Kimon at supper in the house of Laomedon.", "4796": "After supper he was asked to sing, and he sang well.", "4797": "The guests all praised him, and said that he was a cleverer man than Themistokles;", "4798": "for Themistokles was wont to say that he did not know how to sing or to play the harp, but that he knew how to make a state rich and great.", "4799": "Afterwards the conversation turned upon Kimon's exploits, and each mentioned what he thought the most important.", "4800": "Hereupon Kimon himself described what he considered to be the cleverest thing he had ever done.", "4801": "After the capture of Sestos and Byzantium by the Athenians and their allies, there were a great number of Persians taken prisoners, whom the allies desired Kimon to divide amongst them.", "4802": "He placed the prisoners on one side, and all their clothes and jewellery on the other, and offered the allies their choice between the two.", "4803": "They complained that he had made an unequal division, but he bade them take whichever they pleased, assuring them that the Athenians would willingly take whichever part they rejected.", "4804": "By the advice of Herophytus of Samos, who urged them to take the property of the Persians, rather than the Persians themselves, the allies took the clothes and jewels.", "4805": "At this Kimon was thought to have made a most ridiculous division of the spoil, as the allies went swaggering about with gold bracelets, armlets, and necklaces, dressed in Median rol es of rich purple, while the Athenians possessed only the naked bodies of men who were very unfit for labour.", "4806": "Shortly afterwards, how­ ever, the friends and relations of the captives came down to the Athenian camp from Phrygia and Lydia, and ran­ somed each of them for great sums of money, so that Kimon was able to give his fleet four months’ pay, and also to remit a large sum to Athens, out of the money paid for their ransom.X.", "4807": "The money which Kimon had honourably gained in the war he spent yet more honourably upon his country­ men.", "4808": "He took down the fences round his fields, that both strangers and needy Athenians might help themselves to his crops and fruit.", "4809": "He provided daily a plain but plenti­ ful table, at which any poor Athenian was welcome to dine, so that he might live at his ease, and be able to devote all his attention to public matters.", "4810": "Aristotle tells us that it was not for all the Athenians, but only for the Lakiadæ, or members of his own township, that he kept this public table.", "4811": "He used to be attended by young men dressed in rich cloaks, who, if he met any elderly citizen poorly clothed, would exchange cloaks with the old man;", "4812": "and this was thought to be a very noble act.", "4813": "The same young men carried pockets full of small change and would silently put money into the hands of the better class of poor in the market-place.", "4814": "All this is alluded to by Kratinus, the comic poet, in the following passage from his play of the Archilochi:", "4815": "“ I too, Metrobius, hoped to end My days with him, my noblest friend, Kimon, of all the Greeks the best, And, richly feasting, sink to rest.", "4816": "But now he's gone, and I remain unblest.\"", "4817": "Moreover, Gorgias of Leontini says that Kimon acquired wealth in order to use it, and used it so as to gain honour:", "4818": "while Kritias, who was one of the Thirty, in his poems wishes to be “ Rich as the Skopads, and as Kimon great, And like Agesilaus fortunate.", "4819": "\"", "4820": "Indeed,", "4821": "Lichas the Spartan became renowned through­ out Greece for nothing except having entertained all the strangers who were present at the festival of the Gymno­ pædia:", "4822": "while the profuse hospitality of Kimon, both to strangers and his own countrymen, far surpassed even the old Athenian traditions of the heroes of olden days;", "4823": "for though the city justly boasts that they taught the rest of the Greeks to sow corn, to discover springs of water, and to kindle fire, yet Kimon, by keeping open house for all his countrymen, and allowing them to share his crops in the country, and permitting his friends to partake of all the fruits of the earth with him in their season, seemed really to have brought back the golden age.", "4824": "If any scurrilous tongues hinted that it was merely to gain popularity and to curry favour with the people that.", "4825": "he did these things, their slanders were silenced at once b yKimon's personal tastes and habits, which were entirely aristocratic and Spartan.", "4826": "He joined Aristeides in opposing Themistokles when the latter courted the mob to an unseemly extent, opposed Ephialtes when, to please the populace, he dis­ solved the senate of the Areopagus, and, at a time when all other men except Aristeides and Ephialtes were gorged with the plunder of the public treasury, kept his own hands clean, and always maintained the reputation of an incorruptible and impartial statesman.", "4827": "It is related that one Rhuesakes, a Persian, who had revolted from the king, came to Athens with a large sum of money, and being much pestered by the mercenary politicians there, took refuge in the house of Kimon, where he placed two bowls beside the door-posts, one of which he filled with gold, and the other with silver darics.*", "4828": "Kimon smiled at this, and inquired whether he wished him to be his friend, or his hired agent;", "4829": "and when the Persian answered that he wished him to be a friend, he said, \" Then take this money away;", "4830": "for if I am your friend I shall be able to ask you for it when I want it.\"XI.", "4831": "When the allies of Athens, though they continued to pay their contribution towards the war against Persia, refused to furnish men and ships for it, and would not go on military expeditions any longer, because they were tired of war and wished to cultivate their fields and live in peace, now that the Persians no longer threatened them, the other Athenian generals endeavoured to force them into performing their duties, and by taking legal proceedings against the defaulters and imposing fines upon them, made the Athenian empire very much disliked.", "4832": "Kimon, on the other hand, never forced any one to serve, but took an equivalent in money from those who were unwilling to serve in person, and took their ships without crews, per­ mitting them to stay at home and enjoy repose, and by their luxury and folly convert themselves into farmers and merchants, losing all their ancient warlike spirit and skill, while by exercising many of the Athenians in turn in campaigns and military expeditions, he rendered them the masters of the allies by means of the very money which they themselves supplied.", "4833": "The allies very naturally began to fear and to look up to men who were always at sea, and accustomed to the use of arms, living as soldiers on the profits of their own unwarlike leisure, and thus by degrees, instead of independent allies, they sank into the position of tributaries and subjects.", "4834": "XII.", "4835": "Moreover, no one contributed so powerfully as Kimon to the humbling of the king of Persia;", "4836": "for Kimon would not relax his pursuit of him when he retreated from Greece, but hung on the rear of the barbarian army and would not allow them any breathing-time for rallying their forces.", "4837": "He sacked several cities and laid waste their territory, and induced many others to join the Greeks, so that he drove the Persians entirely out of Asia Minor, from Ionia to Pamphylia.", "4838": "Learning that the Persian leaders with a large army and fleet were lying in wait for him in Pamphylia, and wishing to rid the seas of them as far as the Chelidoniæ, or Swallow Islands, he set sail from Knidus and the Triopian Cape with a fleet of two hundred triremes, whose crews had been excellently trained to speed and swiftness of manoeuvring by Themistokles, while he had himself improved their build by giving them a greater width and extent of upper deck, so that they might afford standing-room for a greater number of fighting men.", "4839": "On reaching the city of Phaselis, as the inhabitants, although of Greek origin, refused him admittance, and preferred to remain faithful to Persia, he ravaged their territory and assaulted the fortifications.", "4840": "However, the Chians who were serving in Kimon's army, as their city had always been on friendly terms with the people of Phaselis, con­ trived to pacify his anger, and by shooting arrows into the town with letters wrapped round them, conveyed intelli­ gence of this to the inhabitants.", "4841": "Finally, they agreed to pay the sum of ten talents, and to join the campaign against the Persians.", "4842": "We are told by the historian Epho­ rus that the Persian fleet was commanded by Tithraustes, and the land army by Pherendates.", "4843": "Kallisthenes, how­ ever, says that the supreme command was entrusted to Ariomandes, the son of Gobryas, who kept the fleet idle near the river Eurymedon, not wishing to risk an engage­ ment with the Greeks, but waiting for the arrival of a reinforcement of eighty Phoenician ships from Cyprus.", "4844": "Kimon, wishing to anticipate this accession of strength, put to sea, determined to force the enemy to fight.", "4845": "The Persian fleet at first, to avoid an engagement, retired into the river Eurymedon, but as the Athenians advanced they came out again and ranged themselves in order of battle.", "4846": "Their fleet, according to the historian Phanodemus, con­ sisted of six hundred ships, but, according to Ephorus, of three hundred and fifty.", "4847": "Yet this great armament offered no effective resistance, but turned and fled almost as soon as the Athenians attacked.", "4848": "Such as were able ran their ships ashore and took refuge with the land army, which was drawn up in battle array close by, while the rest were destroyed, crews and all, by the Athenians.", "4849": "The number of the Persian ships is proved to have been very great, by the fact that, although many escaped, and many were sunk, yet the Athenians captured two hundred prizes.", "4850": "XIII.", "4851": "The land forces now moved down to the beach, and it appeared to Kimon that it would be a hazardous undertaking to effect a landing, and to lead his tired men to attack fresh troops, who also had an immense superiority over them in numbers.", "4852": "Yet as he saw that the Greeks were excited by their victory, and were eager to join battle with the Persian army, he disembarked his heavy-armed troops, who, warm as they were from the sea-fight, raised a loud shout, and charged the enemy at a run.", "4853": "The Persian army met them front to front, and an obstinate battle took place, in which many distinguished Athenians fell.", "4854": "At length the Persians were defeated with great slaughter, and the Athenians gained an immense booty from the plunder of the tents and the bodies of the slain.", "4855": "Kimon, having thus, like a well-trained athlete at the games, carried off two victories in one day, surpassing that of Salamis by sea, and that of Platæa by land, proceeded to improve his success by attacking the Phoenician ships also.", "4856": "Hearing that they were at Hydrum, he sailed thither in haste, before any news had reached the Phoeni­ cians about the defeat of their main body, so that they were in anxious suspense, and on the approach of the Athenians were seized with a sudden panic.", "4857": "All their ships were destroyed, and nearly all their crews perished with them.", "4858": "This blow so humbled the pride of the king of Persia, that he afterwards signed that famous treaty in which he engaged not to approach nearer to the Greek seas than a horseman could ride in one day, and not to allow a single one of his ships of war to appear between the Kyanean * and Chelidonian Islands.", "4859": "Yet the historian Kallisthenes tells us that the Persians never made a treaty to this effect, but that they acted thus in consequence of the terror which Kimon had inspired by his victory;", "4860": "and that they removed so far from Greece, that Perikles with fifty ships, and Ephialtes with only thirty, sailed far beyond the Chelidonian Islands and never met with any Persian vessels.", "4861": "However, in the collection of Athenian decrees made by Kraterus, there is a copy of the articles of this treaty, which he mentions as though it really existed.", "4862": "It is said that on this occasion the Athenians erected an altar to Peace, and paid great honours to Kallias, who negotiated the treaty.", "4863": "So much money was raised by the sale of the captives and spoils taken in the war, that besides what was reserved for other occasions, the Athenians were able to build the wall on the south side of the Acropolis from the treasure gained in this campaign.", "4864": "We are also told that at this time the founda­ tions of the Long Walls were laid.", "4865": "These walls, which were also called the Legs, were finished afterwards, but the foundations, which had to be carried over marshy places, were securely laid, the marsh being filled up with chalk and large stones, entirely at Kimon's expense.", "4866": "He also was the first to adorn the city with those shady public walks which shortly afterwards became so popular with the Athenians, for he planted rows of plane-trees in the market-place, and transformed the Academy from a dry and barren wilderness into a well-watered grove, full of tastefully-kept paths and pleasant walks under the shade of fine trees.", "4867": "XIV.", "4868": "As some of the Persians, despising Kimon, who had set out from Athens with a very small fleet, refused to leave the Chersonese, and invited the Thracian tribes of the interior to assist them in maintaining their position, he attacked them with four ships only, took thirteen of the enemy's, drove out the Persians, defeated the Thracian s, and reconquered the Chersonese for Athens.", "4869": "After this he defeated in a sea-fight the people of Thasos, who had revolted from Athens, captured thirty-three of their ships, took their city by storm, and annexed to Athens the district of the mainland containing the gold mines, which had belonged to the Thasians.", "4870": "From Thasos he might easily have invaded Macedonia and inflicted great damage upon that country, but he refrained from doing so.", "4871": "In consequence of this he was accused of having been bribed by Alexander, the king of Macedonia, and his enemies at home impeached him on that charge.", "4872": "In his speech in his own defence he reminded the court that he was the proxenus,* or resident agent at Athens, not of the rich Ionians or Thessalians, as some other Athenians were, with a view to their own profit and influence, but of the Lacedæmonians, a people whose frugal habits he had always been eager and proud to imitate;", "4873": "so that he him­ self cared nothing for wealth, but loved to enrich the state with money taken from its enemies.", "4874": "During this trial, Stesimbrotus informs us that Elpinike, Kimon's sister, came to plead her brothers cause with Perikles, the bitterest of his opponents, and that Perikles answered with a smile, “ Elpinike, you are too old to meddle in affairs of this sort.\"", "4875": "But for all that, in the trial he treated Kimon far more gently than any of his other accusers, and spoke only once, for form's sake.", "4876": "XV.", "4877": "Thus was Kimon acquitted;", "4878": "and during the re­ mainder of his stay in Athens he continued to oppose the encroachments of the people, who were endeavouring to make themselves the source of all political power.", "4879": "When, however, he started again on foreign service, the populace finally succeeded in overthrowing the old Athenian con­ stitution, and under the guidance of Ephialtes greatly curtailed the jurisdiction of the Senate of the Areopagus, and turned Athens into a pure democracy.", "4880": "At this time also Perikles was rising to power as a liberal politician.", "4881": "Kimon, on his return, was disgusted at the degrada­ tion of the ancient Senate of the Areopagus, and began to intrigue with a view of restoring the aristocratic constitution of Kleisthenes.", "4882": "This called down upon him a storm of abuse from the popular party, who brought up again the old scandals about his sister, and charged him with partiality for the Lacedæmonians.", "4883": "These imputations are alluded to in the hackneyed lines of Eupolis:", "4884": "“Not a villain beyond measure, Only fond of drink and pleasure;", "4885": "Oft he slept in Sparta's town, And left his sister here alone.\"",

mother.", "4891": "But Diodorus the geo­ grapher says that these two and the third, Thessalus, were all the children of Kimon by Isodike, the daughter of Euryptolemus the son of Megakles.", "4892": "Much of Kimon a political influence was due to the fact that the Lacedæ­ monians were bitterly hostile to Themistokles, and wished to make him, young as he was, into a powerful leader of the opposite party at Athens.", "4893": "The Athenians at first viewed his Spartan partialities without dissatisfaction, especially as they gained considerable advantages by them;", "4894": "for during the early days of their empire when they first began to extend and consolidate their power, they were enabled to do so without rousing the jealousy of Sparta, in consequence of the popularity of Kimon with the Lacedæmonians.", "4895": "Most international questions were settled by his means, as he dealt generously with the subject states, and was viewed with especial favour by the Lacedæmonians.", "4896": "Afterwards, when the Athenians became more powerful, they viewed with dislike Kimon's excessive love for Sparta.", "4897": "He was never weary of singing the praises of Lacedæmon to the Athenians, and especially, we are told by Stesim­ brotus, when he wished to reproach them, or to encourage them to do better, he used to say, “ That is not how the Lacedæmonians do it.\"", "4898": "This habit caused many Athen .", "4899": "ians to regard him with jealousy and dislike:", "4900": "but the most important ground of accusation against him was the following.", "4901": "In the fourth year of the reign of king Archi­ damus, the son of Zeuxidamus, at Sparta, the Lacedæ­ monian territory was visited by the greatest earthquake ever known there.", "4902": "The earth opened in many places, some of the crags of Taygetus fell down, and the whole city was destroyed, with the exception of five houses.", "4903": "It is related that while the boys and young men were prac­ tising gymnastics in the palæstra, a hare ran into the building, and that the boys, naked and anointed as they were, immediately ran out in pursuit of it, while the gymnasium shortly afterwards fell upon the young men who remained and killed them all.", "4904": "Their tomb is at this day called Seismatia, that is, the tomb of those who perished in the earthquake.", "4905": "Archidamus, perceiving the great dangers with which this disaster menaced the state, and observing that the citizens thought of nothing but saving their most valuable property from the wreck, ordered the trumpet to sound, as though the enemy were about to attack, and made every Spartan get under arms and rally round him as quickly as possible.", "4906": "This measure saved Sparta;", "4907": "for the helots had gathered together from the country round about, and were upon the point of falling upon the survivors.", "4908": "Finding them armed and drawn up in order, they retreated to the neighbouring cities, and openly made war against the Spartans, having won over no small number of the Periœki to their side, while the Messenians also joined them in attacking their own old enemies.", "4909": "At this crisis the Spar­ tans sent Perikleides as an ambassador to Athens to demand assistance.", "4910": "This is the man whom Aristophanes ridiculed in his play as sitting by the altars as a suppliant, with a pale face and a scarlet cloak, begging for an army.", "4911": "We are told by Kritias that Ephialtes vigorously opposed his mission, and besought the Athenians not to assist in restoring a state which was the rival of Athens, but to let the pride of Sparta be crushed and trampled in the dust.", "4912": "Kimon, on the other hand, postponing the interests of his own country to those of the Lacedæmonians, persuaded the people of Athens to march a numerous body of men to assist them.", "4913": "The historian Ion has preserved the argument which had most effect upon the Athenians, and says that Kimon besought them not to endure to see Greece lame of one foot and Athens pulling without her yoke-fellow.", "4914": "XVII.", "4915": "When Kimon with his relieving force marched to help the Lacedæmonians, he passed through the terri­ tory of Corinth.", "4916": "Lachartus objected to this, saying that he had marched in before he had asked leave of the Corinthians, and reminded him that when men knock at a door, they do not enter before the master of the house invites them to come in.", "4917": "Kimon answered, “ Lachartus, you Corinthians do not knock at the doors of the cities of Megara or of Kleonæ, but break down the door and force your way in by the right of the stronger, just as we are doing now.\"", "4918": "By this timely show of spirit he silenced the Corinthians, and passed through the territory of Corinth with his army.", "4919": "The Lacedæmonians invited the aid of the Athenians a second time, to assist in the reduction of the fortress of Ithomé, which was held by the Messenians and revolted helots;", "4920": "but when they arrived the Lacedæmonians feared so brilliant and courageous a force, and sent them back, accusing them of revolutionary ideas, although they did not treat any other of their allies in this manner.", "4921": "The Athenians retired, in great anger at the treatment they had received, and no longer restrained their hatred of all who favoured the Lacedæmonians.", "4922": "On some trifling pre­ text they ostracised Kimon, condemning him to exile for ten years, which is the appointed time for those suffering from ostracism.", "4923": "During this time the Lacedæmonians, after setting Delphi free from the Phokians, encamped at Tanagra, and fought a battle there with the Athenians, who came out to meet them.", "4924": "On this occasion Kimon appeared, fully armed, and took his place in the ranks among his fellow-tribesmen.", "4925": "However, the senate of the five hundred hearing of this, became alarmed, and, as his enemies declared that his only object was to create confusion during the battle and so to betray his countrymen to the Lacedæmonians, they sent orders to the generals, forbidding them to receive him.", "4926": "Upon this he went away, after having begged Eutbippus the Anaphlystian and those of his friends who were especially suspected of Laconian lean­ ings, to fight bravely, and by their deeds to efface this suspicion from the minds of their fellow-citizens.", "4927": "They took Kimon's armour, and set it up in their ranks;", "4928": "and then, fighting in one body round it with desperate courage, they all fell, one hundred in number, causing great grief to the Athenians for their loss, and for the unmerited accusation which had been brought against them.", "4929": "This event caused a revulsion of popular feeling in favour of Kimon, when the Athenians remembered how much they owed him, and reflected upon the straits to which they were now reduced, as they had been defeated in a great battle at Tanagra, and expected that during the summer Attica would be invaded by the Lacedæmonians.", "4930": "They now recalled Kimon from exile;", "4931": "and Perikles himself brought forward the decree for his restoration.", "4932": "So mo­ derate were the party-leaders of that time, and willing to subordinate their own differences to the common welfare of their country.", "4933": "XVIII.", "4934": "On his return Kimon at once put an end to the war, and reconciled the two states.", "4935": "After the peace had been concluded, however, he saw that the Athenians were unable to remain quiet, but were eager to increase their empire by foreign conquest.", "4936": "In order, therefore, to prevent their quarrelling with any other Greek state, or cruising with a large fleet among the islands and the Peloponnesian coast, and so becoming entangled in some petty war, he manned a fleet of two hundred triremes with the intention of sailing a second time to Cyprus and Egypt, wishing both to train the Athenians to fight against barbarians, and also to gain legitimate advantages for Athens by the plunder of her natural enemies.", "4937": "When all was ready, and the men were about to embark, Kimon dreamed that he saw an angry dog barking at him, and that in the midst of its barking it spoke with a human voice, saying, “Go, for thou shalt ever be Loved both by my whelps and me.\"", "4938": "This vision was very hard to interpret.", "4939": "Astyphilus of Posei­ donia, a soothsayer and an intimate friend of Kimon's, told him that it portended his death, on the following grounds.", "4940": "The dog is the enemy of the man at whom he barks:", "4941": "now a man is never so much loved by his enemies as when he is dead;", "4942": "and the mixture of the voice, being partly that of a dog and partly that of a man, signifies the Persians, as their army was composed partly of Greeks and partly of barbarians.", "4943": "After this dream Kimon sacrificed to Dionysus.", "4944": "The prophet cut up the victim, and the blood as it congealed was carried by numbers of ants towards Kimon, so that his great too was covered with it before he noticed them.", "4945": "At the moment when Kimon observed this, the priest came up to him to tell him that the liver of the victim was defective.", "4946": "However, he could not avoid going on the expedition, and sailed forthwith.", "4947": "He despatched sixty of his ships to Egypt, but kept the rest with him.", "4948": "He conquered the Phoenician fleet in a sea-fight, recovered the cities of Cilicia, and began to meditate an attack upon those of Egypt, as his object was nothing less than the utter destruction of the Persian empire, especially when he learned that Themistokles had risen to great eminence among the Persians, and had undertaken to command their army in a campaign against Greece.", "4949": "It is said that one of the chief reasons which caused Themistokles to despair of success was his conviction that he could not surpass the courage and good fortune of Kimon.", "4950": "He therefore committed suicide, while Kimon, who was now revolving immense schemes of conquest as he lay at Cyprus with his fleet, sent an embassy to the shrine of Ammon to ask some­ thing secret.", "4951": "What it was no one ever knew, for the god made no response, but as soon as the messengers arrived bade them return, as Kimon was already with him.", "4952": "On hearing this, they retraced their steps to the sea, and when they reached the headquarters of the Greek force, which was then in Egypt, they heard that Kimon was dead.", "4953": "On counting back the days to that on which they received the response, they perceived that the god had alluded to Kimon's death when he said that he was with him, meaning that he was among the gods.", "4954": "XIX.", "4955": "According to most authorities Kimon died of sick­ ness during a siege;", "4956": "but some writers say that he died of a wound which he received in a battle with the Persians.", "4957": "When dying he ordered his friends to conceal his death, but at once to embark the army and sail home.", "4958": "This was effected, and we are told by Phanodemus that no one, either of the enemy or of the Athenian allies conceived any sus­ picion that Kimon had ceased to command the forces until after he had been dead for thirty days.", "4959": "After his death no great success was won by any Greek general over the Persians, but they were all incited by their popular ora­ tors and the war-party to fight with one another, which led to the great Peloponnesian war.", "4960": "This afforded a long breathing-time to the Persians, and wrought terrible havoc with the resources of Greece.", "4961": "Many years afterwards Agesilaus invaded Asia, and carried on war for a short time against the Persian commanders who were nearest the coast.", "4962": "Yet he also effected nothing of any importance, and being recalled to Greece by the internal troubles of that country, left Persia drawing tribute from all the Greek cities and friendly districts of the sea-coast, although in the time of Kimon no Persian tax-gatherer or Persian horseman was ever seen within a distance of four hundred stades (fifty miles) from the sea.", "4963": "His remains were brought back to Attica, as is proved by the monument which to this day is known as the “Tomb of Kimon.\"", "4964": "The people of Kitium,* also, how­ ever, pay respect to a tomb, said to be that of Kimon, according to the tale of the orator Nausikrates, who informs us that once during a season of pestilence and scarcity the people of Kitium were ordered by an oracle not to neglect Kimon, but to pay him honour and respect him as a superior being.", "4965": "Such a man as this was the Greek general.", "4966": "I.", "4967": "The grandfather of Lucullus * was a man of consul rank, and his uncle on the mother's side was Metellus,t surnamed Numidicus.", "4968": "His father was convicted of pecu­ lation, and his mother, Cæcilia, had a bad name as a woman of loose habits.", "4969": "Lucullus, while he was still a youth, before he was a candidate for a magistracy and engaged in public life, made it his first business to bring to trial his father's accuser, Servilins the augur, as a public offender;", "4970": "and the matter appeared to the Romans to be creditable to Lucullus, and they used to speak of that trial as a memorable thing.", "4971": "It was, indeed, the popular notion, that to prefer an accusation was a repu­ table measure, even when there was no foundation for it, and they were glad to see the young men fastening on offenders, like well-bred whelps laying hold of wild beasts.", "4972": "However, there was much party spirit about that trial, and some persons were even wounded and killed;", "4973": "but Servilius was acquitted.", "4974": "Lucullus had been trained to speak both Latin and Greek competently, so that Sulla, when he was writing his memoirs,.", "4975": "dedicated them to Lucullus as a person who would put them together and arrange his history better than himself;", "4976": "for the style of the oratory of Lucullus was not merely suited to business and prompt, like that of the other orators which disturbed the Forum­ “As a struck tunny throws about the sea,” t but when it is out of the Forum is “Dry, and for want of true discipline half dead”— but he cultivated the appropriate and so-called liberal sciences, with a view to self-improvement, from his early youth.", "4977": "When he was more advanced in years he let his mind, as it were, after so many troubles, find tranquillity and repose in philosophy, rousing to activity the con­ templative portion of his nature, and seasonably termina­ ting and cutting short his ambitious aspirations after his difference with Pompeius.", "4978": "Now, as to his love of learning, this also is reported, in addition to what has been men­ tioned :", "4979": "when he was a young man, in a conversation with Hortensius,t the orator, and Sisenna,§ the historian, which began in jest, but ended in a serious proposition, he agreed that if they would propose a poem and a history, Greek and Roman, he would treat the subject of the Marsio war in whichsoever of these two languages the lot should decide;", "4980": "and it seems that the lot resulted in a Greek history, for there is still extant a Greek history of the Marsic war by Lucullus.*", "4981": "Of his affection to his brother Marcus† there were many proofs, but the Romans speak most of the first;", "4982": "being older than his brother, he did not choose to hold a magistracy by himself, but he waited till his brother was of the proper age, and so far gained the public favour that his brother in his absence was elected ædile jointly with him.", "4983": "II.", "4984": "Though he was a young man during the Marsic war, he gave many proofs of courage and prude ce;", "4985": "but it was rather on account of the solidity of his character and the mildness of his temper that Sulla attached Lucul­ lus to himself, and from the beginning he constantly em­ ployed him in affairs of the greatest importance;", "4986": "one of which was the matter relating to the coinage.", "4987": "It was Lucullus who superintended the coining of most of the money in the Peloponnesus during the Mithridatic war, and it was named Lucullean after him, and continued for a long time to have a ready circulation, in consequence of the demands of the war.", "4988": "Afterwards, Sulla, who was in possession of the country about Athens,‡ but was shut out from supplies by sea by the enemy, who had the command of it, sent Lucullus to Egypt and Libya to get ships there.", "4989": "It was now the depth of winter, but still he set sail with three Greek piratical ships, and the same number of Rhodian biremes, exposing himself to a wide sea and to hostile vessels, which, owing to their having the supe­ riority, were cruising about in great numbers and in all directions.", "4990": "However, he landed at Crete, and made the people friendly to his cause;", "4991": "and, finding the Cyrenæans in a state of confusion, owing to continual tyrannies and wars, he tranquillized and settled the state, by reminding the citizens of a certain expression of Plato, which the philosopher had addressed to them in a prophetic spirit.", "4992": "They asked him, as it appears, to draw up laws for them, and to settle their democracy after the model of a well­ ordered polity;", "4993": "but he replied that it was difficult to legislate for the Cyrenæans while they were so prosperous.", "4994": "Nothing, indeed, is more difficult to govern than a man who considers himself prosperous;", "4995": "and, on the other hand, there is nothing more obedient to command than a man when he is humbled by fortune.", "4996": "And it was this that made the Cyrenæans tractable to Lucullus in his legisla­ tion for them.", "4997": "Sailing from Cyrene * to Egypt, he lost most of his vessels by an attack of pirates;", "4998": "but he escaped himself, and entered Alexandria in splendid style;", "4999": "for the whole fleet came out to meet him, as it was used to do when a king entered the port, equipped magnificently.", "5000": "The young king, Ptolemæus,† showed him other surprising marks of attention, and gave him a lodging and table in the palace, though no foreign general had ever before been lodged there.", "5001": "He also offered him an allowance for his expenditure, not such as he used to offer to others, but four times as much;", "5002": "Lucullus, however, would not receive anything more than his necessities required, nor yet any present, though the king sent presents to the value of eighty talents.", "5003": "It is said that Lucullus did not go up to Memphis,* nor make inquiry about any other of the wondrous and far-famed things in Egypt;", "5004": "he said that such things befitted an idle spectator, and one who had only to enjoy himself:", "5005": "not a man like himself, who had left the Imperator encamped under the bare sky, and close to the enemy's battlements.", "5006": "III.", "5007": "Ptolemæus declined the alliance, being afraid of the war ;", "5008": "but he gave Lucullus ships to convoy him as far as Cyprus, and when he was setting sail he embraced him and paid him great attention, and presented him with an emerald set in gold, of great price.", "5009": "Lucullus at first begged to be excused from taking the present;", "5010": "but when the king showed him that the engraving contained his royal likeness, Lucullus was afraid to refuse the present, lest, if he should be supposed to sail away at complete enmity with the king, he might be plotted against on the sea.", "5011": "In his voyage along the coast Lucullus got together a number of vessels from the maritime towns except such as participated in piratical iniquities, and passed over to Cyprus, where, hearing that his enemies were lying in wait for him with their ships at the headlands, he drew up all his vessels, and wrote to the cities about winter quarters and supplies, as if he intended to stay there till the fine season.", "5012": "As soon as a favourable opportunity offered for his voyage, he launched his ships and got out to sea, and by sailing during the day with his sails down and low, and putting them up at night, he got safe to Rhodes.", "5013": "The Rhodians supplied him with some more ships, and he persuaded the people of Kos and Knidus to quit the king's side, and join him in an attack on the Samians.", "5014": "He drove the king's party also out of Chios, and he gave the people of Kolophon freedom by seizing Epigonus, their tyrant.", "5015": "It happened about this time that Mithridates had left Pergamum, and was shut up in Pitane.*", "5016": "While Fimbria t was keeping the king blockaded there on the land side and pressing the siege, Mithridates, looking to the sea, got together and summoned to hint ships from every quarter, having given up all design of engaging and fighting with Fimbria, who was a bold man and had defeated him.", "5017": "Fimbria observing this, and being deficient in naval force, sent to Lucullus, and prayed him to come with his fleet and help him to take the most detested and the most hostile of kings, in order that Mithridates, the great prize, which had been followed through many contests and labours, might not escape the Romans, now that he had given them a chance of seizing him, and was caught within the nets.", "5018": "He said, if Mithridates was taken, no one would have more of the glory than he who stopped his flight and laid hold of him when he was trying to steal away;", "5019": "that if Mithridates were shut out from the land by him, and excluded from the sea by Lucullus, there would be a victory for both of them, and that as to the vaunted exploits of Sulla at Orchomenus and Chæronea,‡ the Romans would think nothing of them in comparison with this.", "5020": "There was nothing unreasonable in all that Fimbria said ;", "5021": "and it was plain to every man that if Lucullus, who was at no great distance, had then accepted the proposal of Fimbria, and led his ships there and blockaded the port with his fleet, the war would have been at an end, and all would have been delivered from innumerable calamities.", "5022": "But whether it was that Lucullus regarded his duty to Bulla.", "5023": "above all private and public interests, or that he detested Fimbria, who was an abandoned man, and had lately mur­ dered his own friend and general,§ merely from ambition to command, or whether it was through chance, as the Deity would have it, that he spared Mithridates, and re­ served him for his own antagonist-he would not listen to Fimbria, but allowed Mithridates to escape by sea, and to mock the force of Fimbria.", "5024": "Lucullus himself, in the first place, defeated off Lektum in the Troad,* the king's ships, which showed themselves there, and again observ­ ing that Neoptolemus was stationed at Tenedos with a larger force, he sailed against him ahead of all the rest, in a Rhodian galley of five banks which was commanded by Demagoras, a man well affected to the Romans, and exceedingly skilful in naval battles.", "5025": "Neoptolemus came against him at a great rate, and ordered the helmsman to steer the ship right against the vessel of Lucullus;", "5026": "but Demagoras, fearing the weight of the king's vessel and the rough brass that she was fitted with, did not venture to engage head to head, but he quickly turned his ship round and ordered them to row her stern foremost,‡ and the vessel being thus depressed at the stern received the blow, which was rendered harmless by falling on those parts of the ship which were in the water.", "5027": "In the meantime his friends coining to his aid, Lucullus commanded them to turn his ship's head to the enemy;", "5028": "and, after performing many praiseworthy feats, he put the enemy to flight, and pursued Neoptolemus.", "5029": "IV.", "5030": "After this, Lucullus joined Sulla in the Chersonesus, as he was going to cross the Hellespont, and he made the passage safe for him, and assisted his army in getting over.", "5031": "When the treaty was made, and Mithridates had sailed off to the Euxine, and Sulla had imposed a contribution ‡ of twenty thousand talents on Asia, and Lucullus had been ap­ pointed to collect the money, and to strike coin, it appeared some small consolation to the cities of Asia for the harsh­ ness of Sulla that Lucullus not only behaved with honesty and justice, but conducted himself mildly in the discharge of so oppressive and disagreeable a duty.", "5032": "Though the Mitylenæans had openly revolted, Lucullus wished them to come to their senses, and to submit to some reasonable penalty for their ill-conduct in the matter of Marius;", "5033": "* but perceiving that they were under the influence of some evil dæmon, he sailed against them, and defeated them in a battle, and, after shutting them up in their walls, and establishing a blockade, he sailed out in open day to Elæa,† but he returned by stealth, and laying an ambuscade near the city, kept quiet.", "5034": "The Mitylenaeans approached in dis­ order, and with confidence in the expectation of plunder­ ing a deserted camp;", "5035": "but Lucullus falling on them took a great number alive, and killed five hundred of them who made resistance.", "5036": "He also took six thousand slaves, and the rest of the booty was past count.", "5037": "But in the miseries which Bulla and Marius were at that time bringing on the people of Italy, without limit and of every kind, he had no share, being detained by his business in Asia by some happy fortune.", "5038": "Nevertheless, he had not less favour with Bulla than the rest of his friends ;", "5039": "for, as I have said Bulla dedicated his memoirs to Lucullus, as a token of his affection, and finally he appointed him the guardian of his son, and passed by Pompeius.", "5040": "And this was probably the origin of the difference and the jealousy between Lucullus and Pompeius;", "5041": "for they were both young, and burning for distinction.", "5042": "V.", "5043": "Shortly after Sulla's death, Lucullus was consul t with Marcus Cotta, about the hundred and seventy-sixth Olympiad.", "5044": "Many persons were again attempting to stir up the Mithridatic war, and Marcus said that the war was not ended, but only stopped for a time.", "5045": "It was for this reason that Lucullus was annoyed at the lot giving him for his province Gaul within (south of) the Alps, which offered no opportunity for great exploits.", "5046": "But the reputa­ tion of Pompeius, who was now in Iberia, stung him most, as it was expected that l'ompeius, in preference to any one else, would be forthwith chosen to the command of the war against Mithridates, if it should happen that the Iberian war should be brought to a close.", "5047": "Accordingly, when Pompeius asked for money,.", "5048": "and wrote to say that if they did not send it he would leave Iberia and Sertorius, and lead his troops back to Italy, Lucullus did all he could to get money sent, and to prevent Pompeius return­ ing from Iberia on any pretence whatever while he was consul;", "5049": "for he considered that the whole State would be at the disposal of Pompeius if he were at Rome with so large an army.", "5050": "Cethegus,† also, who had then the power in his hands by always speaking and acting with a view to popularity, was at enmity with Lucullus, who detested his habits of life, which were nothing but a course of unnatural lusts, insolence, and violence.", "5051": "With Cethegus then Lucullus was at open war.", "5052": "There was, indeed an­ other demagogue, Lucius Quintius,‡ who had set himself against Sulla's measures, and attempted to disturb the present settlement of affairs;", "5053": "but Lucullus, by much per­ suasion in private and reproof in public, drew him from his designs, and quieted his ambition, in as politic and wholesome a way as a man could do, by taking in hand so great a disease at its commencement.", "5054": "VI.", "5055": "In the meantime news arrived of the death of Octavius,§ the Governor of Cilicia.", "5056": "Now there were many eager competitors for the province, who courted Cethegus as the person who was best able to help them to it.", "5057": "As to Cilicia itself, Lucullus made no great account of that province;", "5058": "but, inasmuch as he thought, if he should get Cilicia, which bordered on Cappadocia, no one else would be sent to conduct the war against Mithridates, he left no means untried to prevent the province falling into other hands;", "5059": "and, at last, contrary to his natural disposition, he submitted from necessity to do an act which was not creditable, or commendable, though it was useful towards the end he had in view.", "5060": "There was a woman named Præcia, who was famed through Rome for her beauty and gallantry, and though in other respects she was no better than a common prostitute, yet, as she availed herself of her influence with those who visited her and talked to her, for the purpose of forwarding the interests and political views of her friends, she added to her other attractions the reputation of being a woman who was much attached to her friends, and very active in accomplishing anything, and she obtained great influence.", "5061": "Cethegus, who was then at the height of his popularity, and directed the administration, was captivated by Præcia, and began to cohabit with her, and thus the whole power of the State fell into her hands;", "5062": "for no public measure was transacted if Cethegus was not for it, and if Præcia did not recom­ mend it to Cethegus.", "5063": "Now Lucullus gained over Præcia by presents and flattery;", "5064": "and, indeed, it was in itself a great boon to a proud woman, fond of public display, to be seen using her influence on behalf of Lucullus;", "5065": "and thus he soon had Cethegus speaking in his favour, and trying to get Cilicia for him.", "5066": "When Lucullus had once gained the province of Cilicia, it was no longer necessary for him to call in the aid of Præcia or Cethegus, but all alike readily put into his hands the conduct of the Mithridatic war, believing that it could not be managed better by any other person;", "5067": "for Pompeius was still fighting against Sertorius, and Metellus * had withdrawn from service by reason of his age, and these were the only persons who could be considered as rivals to Lucullus in any dispute about the command in the war.", "5068": "However, Cotta, the colleague of Lucullus, after making earnest application to the Senate, was sent with some ships to watch the Propontis,t and to defend Bithynia.", "5069": "VII.", "5070": "Lucullus, with one legion which he had raised at home, crossed over into Asia, where he took the command of the rest of the forces, all of whom had long been spoiled by luxurious habits and living at free quarters;", "5071": "and the soldiers of Fimbria were said to have become difficult to manage, from being accustomed to obey no commander", "5072": "They were the men who joined Fimbria in putting to death Flaccus, who was a consul and their general, and who gave up Fimbria himself to Sulla *—self-willed and lawless men, but brave and full of endurance, and experi­ enced soldiers.", "5073": "However, in a short time, Lucullus took down the insolence of these soldiers, and changed the character of the rest, who then, for the first time, as it seems, knew what it was to have a genuine commander and leader;", "5074": "for under other generals, they were used to be courted, and spirited on to military service in such wise as was agreeable to them.", "5075": "As to the enemy, matters were thus:", "5076": "Mithridates, like most of the sophists,t full of boasting at first, and rising up against the Romans arro­ gantly, with an army unsubstantial in fact, but in appear­ ance brilliant and pompous, had failed in his undertaking, and exposed himself to ridicule;", "5077": "but now, when he was going to commence the war a second time, taught by ex­ perience he concentrated his powers in a real and effectual preparation.", "5078": "Rejecting those motley numbers and many­ tongued threats of the barbarians, and arms ornamented with gold and precious stones, which he considered to be the spoils of the victors, and to give no strength to those who possess them, he set about having Roman swords made, and heavy shields manufactured;", "5079": "and he got to­ gether horses which were well trained, instead of horses which were well caparisoned;", "5080": "and one hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers who were disciplined to the Roman order of battle, and sixteen thousand horse-soldiers, without reckoning the scythe-bearing four-horse chariots, and these were a hundred;", "5081": "besides, his ships were not filled with tents embroidered with gold, nor with baths for concubines, nor apartments for the women luxuriously furnished;", "5082": "but fitting them out fully with arms, missiles, and stores, he invaded Bithynia, where he was again gladly received by the cities, and not by these cities only, for a return of their former calamities had visited all Asia, which was suffering past endurance from the Roman money-lenders * and farmers of the taxes.t", "5083": "These men, who, like so many harpies, were plundering the people of their substance, Lucullus afterwards drove out;", "5084": "but, for the time, he endeavoured by reproof to make them more mode­ rate in their conduct, and he stopped the insurrection of the towns, when, so to speak, not a single man in them was quiet.", "5085": "VIII.", "5086": "While Lucullus was busied about these matters, Cotta, thinking it a good opportunity for himself, was preparing to fight with Mithridates;", "5087": "and, though many persons brought him intelligence that Lucullus was en­ camped in Phrygia on his advanced march, Cotta, think­ ing that he had the triumph all but in his hands, hastened to engage, that Lucullus might have no share in it.", "5088": "But he was defeated by land and by sea at the same time ;", "5089": "and he lost sixty vessels with all the men in them, and four thousand foot soldiers, and he was shut up in Chalkedon* and besieged there, and obliged to look for help at the hands of Lucullus.", "5090": "Now there were some who urged Lucullus not to care for Cotta, but to advance forward, as he would be able to seize the kingdom of Mithridates, which was unprotected;", "5091": "and this was the language of the soldiers especially, who were indignant that Cotta, not satisfied with ruining himself and those with him by his imprudent measures, should be a hindrance to their getting a victory without a contest when it was in their power;", "5092": "but Lucullus said in reply to all this in an harangue, that he would rather save one Roman from the enemy than get all that the enemy had.", "5093": "And when Archelaus,† who had commanded for Mithridates in Bœotia, and afterwards had left him, and was now in the Roman army, maintained that if Lucullus would only show himself in Pontus, he might make himself master of everything at once, Lucullus replied that he was not a greater coward than huntsmen, which he should be if he passed by the wild beasts and went to their empty dens.", "5094": "Saying this he advanced against Mithridates, with thirty thousand foot-soldiers and two thousand five hundred cavalry.", "5095": "On arriving in sight of theenemy, he was startled at their numbers, and wished to avoid a battle and to protract the time.", "5096": "Marius, however, whom Sertorius had sent from Iberia to Mith­ ridates in command of a force, came out to meet Lucullus, and challenged him to the contest, on which Lucullus put his army in order of battle;", "5097": "and they were just on the point of commencing the engagement, when, without any evident change, but all at once, the sky opened, and there appeared a huge flame-like body, which came down be­ tween the two armies, in form most like a cask, and in colour resembling molten silver, so that both armies were alarmed at the sight and separated.", "5098": "This, it is said, took place in Phrygia, at a place called Otryæ.", "5099": "Lucullus, considering that it was not possible for any human re­ sources or wealth to maintain for any length of time, and in the presence of an enemy, so many thousands as Mith­ ridates had, ordered one of the prisoners to be brought to him, and asked him first how many messmates he had, and then how much provision he had left in his tent.", "5100": "When the man had given his answer, he ordered him to be removed, and he put the same question to a second, and to a third.", "5101": "Then comparing the amount of provisions that the enemy had with the number of those who were to be fed, he concluded that the enemy's provisions would fail them in three or four days.", "5102": "He now stuck still more closely to his plan of protracting the time, and he employed himself in getting into his camp a great store of provision, that he might have abundance himself, and so wait till the enemy was reduced to want.", "5103": "IX.", "5104": "In the meantime Mithridates resolved to attack the Kyzikeni,* who had received a blow in the battle at Chalkedon, for they had lost three thousand men and ten ships.", "5105": "Accordingly, wishing to give Lucullus the slip, he put himself in motion immediately after supper, taking advantage of a dark and rainy night;", "5106": "and he succeeded in planting his force at daybreak right opposite to the city, at the base of the mountain tract of the Adrasteia.t Lucullus, who perceived his movements and followed him, was well satisfied that he had not come up with the enemy while his own troops were out of battle order;", "5107": "and he posted his army near the village named Thrakia, in a position excellently adapted to command the roads and the places from which and through which the soldiers of Mithridates must bring their supplies.", "5108": "Now, as he had in his own mind a clear comprehension of the issue, he did not conceal it from his men;", "5109": "but as soon as he had chosen his ground, and the men had finished the entrenchments, he summoned them together, and confidently told them that he would, in a few days, give them a victory which would cost no blood.", "5110": "Mithridates had hemmed in the Kyzikeni with ten camps on the land side, and towards the sea with his ships, by blocking up the narrow channel which separates tile city from the mainland, and thus he was besieging them on both sides.", "5111": "Though the citizens were disposed to resist the enemy boldly, and had determined to sustain all hardships for the sake of the Romans, they were troubled at not knowing where Lu­ cullus was, and at having heard nothing of him.", "5112": "Yet the army of Lucullus was visible and in sight of the city ;", "5113": "but the citizens were deceived by the soldiers of Mithri­ dates, who pointed to the Romans in their entrenchments on the higher ground, and said, \"Do you see them ?", "5114": "That is the army of the Armenians and Modes, which Tigranes has sent to support Mithridates.", "5115": "\"The Kyzikeni were alarmed to see such a host of enemies around them, and they had no hopes that they could be released, even if Lucullus should come.", "5116": "However, Demonax, who was sent to them by Archelaus, was the first to inform them of Lucullus being there.", "5117": "While they were distrusting his intelligence, and thinking that he had merely invented this story to comfort them in their diffi­ culties, there came a youth, who had been captured by the enemy and made his escape.", "5118": "On their asking him where he supposed Lucullus to be, he laughed outright, for he thought they were making sport of him ;", "5119": "but, seeing that they were in earnest, he pointed with his hand to the Roman camp, and the citizens again took courage.", "5120": "Now the lake Daskylitis * is navigable for boats of a considerable size, and Lucullus, drawing up the largest of them, and conveying it on a waggon to the sea-coast, put into it as many soldiers as it would hold.", "5121": "The soldiers crossed over by night unobserved, and got into the city.X.", "5122": "It appears that the deity, also, admiring the bravery of the Kyzikeni, encouraged them by other manifest signs, and especially by this:", "5123": "the festival called Persephassia† was at hand, and as they had not a black cow to sacrifice, they made one of dough, and placed it at the altar.", "5124": "The cow which was intended to be the victim, and was fatten­ ing for the goddess, was pasturing, like the other animals of the Kyzikeni, on the opposite mainland;", "5125": "but on that day, leaving the rest of the herd by itself, it swam over the channel to the city and presented itself to be sacri­ ficed.", "5126": "The goddess also appeared in a dream to Arista­ goras, the town-clerk,* and said:", "5127": "“ For my part, I am come, and I bring the Libyan fifer against the Pontic trumpeter.", "5128": "Bid the citizens, then, be of good cheer. \"", "5129": "The Kyzikeni were wondering at these words, when at daybreak the sea began to be disturbed by an unsteady, changing wind that descended upon it, and the engines of the king, which were placed near the walls—admirable contrivances of Nikonides the Thessalian—by their creak­ ing and rattling showed what was going to happen:", "5130": "then a south-west wind, bursting forth with incredible fury, broke to pieces the other engines in a very short time, and shook and threw down the wooden tower, which was a hundred cubits high.", "5131": "It is told that Athena appeared to many of the people in Ilium in their sleep, streaming with copious sweat, showing part of her peplus rent, and saying that she had just returned from helping the Kyzikeni.", "5132": "And the people of Ilium used to show a stele t which contained certain decrees and an inscription about these matters.", "5133": "XI.", "5134": "Mithridates, so long as he was deceived by his generals and kept in ignorance of the famine in his army, was annoyed at the Kyzikeni holding out against the blockade.", "5135": "But his ambition and his haughtiness quickly oozed away when he had discovered the straits in which his army was held, and that they were eating one an­ other;", "5136": "for Lucullus was not carrying on the war in a theatrical way, nor with mere show;", "5137": "but, as the proverb says, was kicking against the belly, and contriving every means how he should cut off the food.", "5138": "Accordingly, while Lucullus was engaged in besieging a certain garrisoned post, Mithridates, seizing the opportunity, sent off into Bithynia nearly all his cavalry, with the beasts of burden, and all his superflous infantry.", "5139": "Lucullus hearing of this, returned to his camp during the night, and early in the following morning, it being winter time, getting ready ten cohorts and the cavalry, he followed the troops of Mithridates, though it was snowing, and his soldiers Buffered so much that many of them gave in by reason of the cold, and were left behind:", "5140": "however, with the rest he came up with the enemy at the river Rhyndakus,* and gave them such a defeat that the women came from the town of Apollonia and carried off the baggage and stripped the dead.", "5141": "Many fell in the battle, as might be supposed, but there were taken six thousand horses, with a countless number of baggage-beasts, and fifteen thousand men, all whom he led back past the camp of the enemy.", "5142": "I wonder at Sallustius saying that this was the first time that the Romans saw the camel;", "5143": "t for he must have supposed that the soldiers of Scipio, who some time before had defeated Antiochus, and those who had also fought with Archelaus at Orchomenus and Chæronea, were unacquainted with the camel.", "5144": "Now Mithridates had determined to fly as soon as he could;", "5145": "but, with the view of contriving some­ thing which should draw Lucullus in the other direction, and detain him in his rear, he sent his admiral, Aristonikus, to the Grecian sea, and Aristonikus was just on the point of setting sail when he was betrayed to Lucullus, who got him into his power, together with ten thousand pieces of gold which he was carrying to bribe a part of the Roman army with.", "5146": "Upon this Mithridates fled to the sea, and his generals led the land forces off.", "5147": "But Lucullus falling upon them at the river Granikus,* took many prisoners, and slew twenty thousand of them.", "5148": "It is said that near three hundred thousand persons were destroyed out of the whole number of camp-followers and fighting-men.XII.", "5149": "Upon entering Kyzikus, Lucullus took his pleasure, and enjoyed a friendly reception suitably to the occasion ;", "5150": "he next visited the Hellespont, and got his navy equipped.", "5151": "Arriving at the Troad,t he placed his tent within the sacred precincts of Aphrodite, and as he was sleeping there he thought that he saw the goddess in the night standing by him, saying:", "5152": ",.", "5153": "Why slumber, lion of the mighty heart?", "5154": "The fawns are near at hand'", "5155": "Waking from sleep, Lucullus called his friends and told them his dream, while it was still night;", "5156": "and there came persons from Ilium, who reported that thirteen of the king's quinqueremes had been seen near the Achæan harbour, moving in the direction of Lemnos.", "5157": "Immediately setting sail, Lucullus captured these vessels and killed their commander, Isidorus, and he then advanced against the other captains.", "5158": "Now, as they happened to be at anchor, they drew all their vessels together up to the land, and, fighting from the decks, dealt blows on the men of Lucullus;", "5159": "for the ground rendered it impossible to sail round to the enemy's rear, and, as the ships of Lucullus were afloat, they could make no attack on those of the enemy, which were planted close to the land and securely situated.", "5160": "However, with some difficulty, Lucullus landed the bravest of his soldiers in a part of the island which was accessible, who, falling on the rear of the enemy, killed some and compelled the rest to cut their cables and make their escape from the land, and so to drive their vessels foul of one another, and to be exposed to the blows of the vessels of Lucullus.", "5161": "Many of the enemy perished;", "5162": "but among the captives there was Marius,* he who was sent from Sartorius.", "5163": "Marius had only one eye, and the soldiers had received orders from Lucullus, as they were setting out on the expedition, to kill no one-eyed man;", "5164": "for Lucullus designed to make Marius die a shameful and dishonourable death.", "5165": "XIII.", "5166": "As soon as he had accomplished this, Lucullus hastened in pursuit of Mithridates;", "5167": "for he expected still to find him about Bithynia, and watched by Voconius, whom he had sent with ships to Nikomedia t to follow up the pursuit.", "5168": "But Voconius lingered in Samothrakia,‡ where he was getting initiated into mysteries and cele­ brating festivals.", "5169": "Mithridates, who had set sail with hilt armament, and was in a hurry to reach Pontus before Lucullus returned, was overtaken by a violent storm, by which some of his ships were shattered and others were sunk;", "5170": "and all the coast for many days was filled with the wrecks that were cast up by the waves.", "5171": "The merchant- vessel in which Mithridates was embarked could not easily be brought to land by those who had the manage­ ment of it, by reason of its magnitude, in the agitated state of the water, and the great swell, and it was already too heavy to hold out against the sea, and was water­ logged;", "5172": "accordingly the king got out of the vessel into a piratical ship, and, intrusting his person to pirates, contrary to expectation and after great hazard he arrived at Heraklea * in Pontus.", "5173": "Now it happened that the proud boast of Lucullus to the Senate brought on him no divine retribution.t", "5174": "The Senate was voting a sum of three thousand talents to equip a navy for the war, but Lu­ cullus stopped the measure by sending a letter, couched in vaunting terms, in which he said, that without cost and so much preparation, he would with the ships of the allies drive Mithridates from the sea.", "5175": "And he did this with the aid of the deity;", "5176": "for it is said that it was owing to the anger of Artemis Priapine ‡ that the storm fell on the Pontic soldiers, who had plundered her temple and carried off the wooden statue.", "5177": "XIV.", "5178": "Though many advised Lucullus to suspend the war, he paid no heed to them:", "5179": "but, passing through Bithynia and Galatia, he invaded the country of the king.", "5180": "At first he wanted provisions, so that thirty thousand Galatians followed him, each carrying on his shoulders a medimnus of wheat;", "5181": "but as he advanced and reduced all into his power, he got into such abundance of everything that an ox was sold in the camp for a drachma, and a slave for four drachmæ ;", "5182": "and, as to the rest of the booty, it was valued so little that some left it behind, and others destroyed it;", "5183": "for there were no means of disposing of anything to anybody when all had abundance.", "5184": "The Roman army had advanced with their cavalry and carried their incursions as far as Themiskyra and the plains on the Thermodon,* without doing more than wasting and ravaging the country, when the men began to blame Lucullus for peaceably gaining over all the cities, and they complained that he had not taken a single city by storm, nor given them an opportunity of enriching themselves by plunder.", "5185": "“", "5186": "Nay, even now,” they said, we are quitting Amisus,t a prosperous and wealthy city, which it would be no great matter to take, if any one would press the siege, and the general is leading us to fight with Mithridates in the wilds of the Tibareni and Chaldæans.”‡", "5187": "Now, if Lucullus had supposed that these notions would have led the soldiers to such madness as they afterwards showed he would not have overlooked or neglected these matters, nor have apologised instead to those men who were blaming his tardiness for thus lingering in the neighbourhood of insignificant villages for a long time, and allowing Mith­ ridates to increase his strength.", "5188": "“", "5189": "This is the very thing,\" he said, “ that I wish, and I am sitting here with the design of allowing the man again to become powerful, and to get together a sufficient force to meet us, that he may stay, and not fly from us when we advance.", "5190": "Do you not see that a huge and boundless wilderness is in his rear, and the Caucasus * is near, and many mountains which are full of deep valleys, sufficient to hide ten thousand kings who decline a battle, and to protect them?", "5191": "and it is only a few days' march from Kabeira t into Armenia, and above the plains of Armenia Tigranes ‡ the King of Kings has his residence, with a force which enables him to cut the Parthian off from Asia, and he removes the inhabitants of the Greek cities up into Media, and he is master of Syria and Palestine, and the kings, the descendants of Seleucus, he puts to death, and carries off their daughters and wives captives.", "5192": "Tigranes is the kinsman and son-in- law of Mithridates.", "5193": "Indeed, he will not quietly submit to receive Mithridates as a suppliant;", "5194": "but he will war against us, and, if we strive to eject Mithridates from his kingdom we shall run the risk of drawing upon us Tigranes, who has long been seeking for a pretext against us, and he could not have a more specious pretext than to be compelled to aid a man who is his kinsman and a king.", "5195": "Why, then, should we bring this about, and show Mithridates, who does not know it, with whose aid he ought to carry on the war against us?", "5196": "and why should we drive him against his wish, and ingloriously, into the arms of Tigranes, in­ stead of giving him time to collect a force out of his own resources and to recover his courage, and so fight with the Kolchi, and Tibareni, and Cappadocians, whom we have often defeated, rather than fight with the Medes and Armenians ?", "5197": "\"XV.", "5198": "Upon such considerations as these, Lucullus pro­ tracted the time before Amisus without pushing the siege ;", "5199": "and, when the winter was over, leaving Murena to blockade the city, he advanced against Mithridates, who was posted at Kabeira, and intending to oppose the Romans, as he had got together a force of forty thousand infantry and four thousand horse on whom he relied most.", "5200": "Crossing the river Lykus into the plain, Mithridates offered the Romans battle.", "5201": "A contest between the cavalry ensued, in which the Romans fled, and Pomponius, a man of some note, being wounded, was taken prisoner, and brought to Mith­ ridates while he was suffering from his wounds.", "5202": "The king asked him if he would become his friend if his life were spared, to which Pomponius replied, \"Yes, if you come to terms with the Romans;", "5203": "if not, I shall be your enemy.\"", "5204": "Mithridates admired the answer, and did him no harm.", "5205": "Now, Lucullus was afraid to keep the plain country, as the enemy were masters of it with their cavalry, and he was unwilling to advance into the hilly region, which was of great extent and wooded and difficult of access;", "5206": "but it happened that some Greeks were taken prisoners, who had fled into a cave, and the eldest of them, Artemidorus, promised Lucullus to be his guide, and to put him in a position which would be secure for his army, and also con­ tained a fort that commanded Kabeira.", "5207": "Lucullus, trusting the man, set out at nightfall after lighting numerous fires, and getting through the defiles in safety;", "5208": "he gained possession of the position;", "5209": "and, when the day dawned, he was seen above the enemy, posting his soldiers in a place which gave him the opportunity of making an attack if he chose to fight, and secured him against any assault if he chose to remain quiet.", "5210": "At present neither general had any intention of hazarding a battle;", "5211": "but it is said, that while some of the king's men were pursuing a deer, the Romans met them and attempted to cut off their retreat, and this led to a skirmish, in which fresh men kept con­ tinually coming up on both sides.", "5212": "At last the king's men had the better, and the Romans, who from the ramparts saw their comrades falling, were in a rage, and crowded about Lucullus, praying him to lead them on, and calling for the signal for battle.", "5213": "But Lucullus, wishing them to learn the value of the presence and sight of a prudent general in a struggle with an enemy and in the midst of danger, told them to keep quiet;", "5214": "and, going down into the plain and meeting the first of the fugitives, he ordered them to stand, and to turn round and face the enemy with him.", "5215": "The men obeyed, and the rest also facing about and forming in order of battle, easily put the enemy to flight, and pursued them to their camp.", "5216": "Lucullus, after retiring to his position, imposed on the fugitives the usual mark of disgrace, by ordering them to dig a trench of twelve feet in their loose jackets, while the rest of the soldiers were standing by and looking on.", "5217": "XVI.", "5218": "Now there was in the army of Mithridates a prince of the Dandarii,* named Olthakus (the Dandarii are one of the tribes of barbarians that live about the Mæotis), a man distinguished in all military matters where strength and daring are required, and also in ability equal to the best, and moreover a man who knew how to ingratiate himself with persons, and of insinuating address.", "5219": "Oltha­ kus, who was always engaged in a kind of rivalry for dis­ tinction with one of the princes of the kindred tribes, and was jealous of him, undertook a great exploit for Mithri­ dates,

received him, for there was a great report of him in the Roman army;", "5221": "and Lucullus, after some acquaintance with him, was soon pleased with his acuteness and his zeal, and at last admitted him to his table and made him a member of his council.", "5222": "Now when the Dandarian thought he had a fit opportunity, he ordered the slaves to take his horse without the ramparts, and, as it was noontide and the soldiers were lying in the open air and taking their rest, he went to the general's tent, expecting that nobody would prevent him from entering, as he was on terms of intimacy with Lucullus, and said that he was the bearer of some important news.", "5223": "And he would have entered the tent without any suspicion, if sleep, that has been the cause of the death of many gene­ rals, had not saved Lucullus;", "5224": "for he happened to be asleep, and Menedemus, one of his chamber-attendants, who was standing by the door, said that Olthakus had not come at a fit time, for Lucullus had just gone to rest him­ self after long wakefulness and many toils.", "5225": "As Olthakus did not go away when he was told, but said that he would go in, even should Menedemus attempt to prevent him, because he wished to communicate with Lucullus about a matter of emergency and importance, Menedemus began to get in a passion, and, saying that nothing was more urgent than the health of Lucullus, he shoved the man away with both his hands.", "5226": "Olthakus being alarmed stole out of the camp, and, mounting his horse, rode off to the army of Mithridates, without effecting his purpose.", "5227": "Thus, it appears, it is with actions just as it is with medicines -time and circumstance give to the scales that slight turn which saves alive, as well as that which kills.",

army, Mithridates did not neglect the opportunity, but sent Menemachus and Myron at the head of a large body of cavalry and infantry.", "5232": "All this force, as it is said, was cut to pieces by the Romans.", "5233": "with the exception of two men.", "5234": "Mithridates concealed the loss, and pretended it was not so great as it really was, but a trifling loss owing to the unskilfulness of the commanders.", "5235": "However, Adrianus triumphantly passed by the camp of the enemy with many waggons loaded with corn and booty, which dispirited Mithridates, and caused irremedi­ able confusion and alarm among his soldiers.", "5236": "Accordingly it was resolved not to stay there any longer.", "5237": "But, while the king's servants were quietly sending away their own property first, and endeavouring to hinder the rest, the soldiers, growing infuriated, pushed towards the passages that led out of the camp, and, attacking the king's servants, began to seize the luggage and massacre the men.", "5238": "In this confusion Dorylaus the general, who had nothing else about him but his purple dress, lost his life by reason of it, and Hermæus, the sacrificing priest, was trampled to death at the gates.", "5239": "The king himself,* without attend­ ant or groom to accompany him, fled from the camp mingled with the rest, and was not able to get even one of the royal horses, till at last the eunuch Ptolemaeus, who was mounted, spied him as as he was hurried along in the stream of fugitives, and leaping down from his horse gave it to the king.", "5240": "The Romans, who were following in pursuit, were now close upon the king, and so far as it was a matter of speed they were under no difficulty about taking him, and they came very near it;", "5241": "but greediness and mercenary motives snatched from the Romans the prey which they had so long followed up in many battles and great dangers, and robbed Lucullus of the crowning triumph to his victory;", "5242": "for the horse

it did not carry off Berenike, who had not drunk enough, and, as she was long in dying, she was strangled with the assistance of Bacchides.", "5263": "Of the two unmarried sisters of Mithridates it is said, that one of them, after uttering many imprecations on her brother and much abuse, drank up the poison.", "5264": "Statira did not utter a word of complaint, or anything unworthy of her noble birth;", "5265": "but she commended her brother for that he had not neglected them at a time when his own life was in danger, and had provided that they should die free and be secure against insult.", "5266": "All this gave pain to Lucullus, who was naturally of a mild and humane temper.", "5267": "XIX.", "5268": "Lucullus advanced as far as Talaura,* whence four days before Mithridates had fled into Armenia to Tigranes.", "5269": "From Talaura Lucullus took a different direc­ tion, and after subduing the Chaldæi and Tibareni, and taking possession of the Less Armenia, and reducing forts and cities, he sent Appius to Tigranes to demand Mith­ ridates ;", "5270": "but he went himself to Amisus, which was still holding out against the siege.", "5271": "This was owing to Kalli­ machus the commander, who by his skill in mechanical contrivances, and his ingenuity in devising every resource which is available in a siege, gave the Romans great annoyance, for which he afterwards paid the penalty.", "5272": "Now, however, he was out-generalled by Lucullus, who, by making a sudden attack, just at that time of the day when he was used to lead his soldiers off and to give them rest, got possession of a small part of the wall, upon which Kallimachus quitted the city, having first set fire to it, either because he was unwilling that the Romans should get any advantage from their conquest, or with the view of facilitating his own escape.", "5273": "For no one paid any atten­ tion to those who were sailing out;", "5274": "but when the flames had sprung up with violence, and got hold of the walls, the soldiers were making ready to plunder.", "5275": "Lucullus, lamenting the danger in which the city was of being destroyed, attempted from the outside to help the citizens against the fire, and ordered it to be put out;", "5276": "yet nobody attended to him, and the soldiers called out for booty, and shouted and struck their armour, till at last Lucullus was compelled to let them have their way, expecting that he should thus save the city at least from the fire.", "5277": "But the soldiers did just the contrary;", "5278": "for, as they rummaged every place by the aid of torches, and carried about lights in all directions, they destroyed most of the houses themselves.", "5279": "so that Lucullus, who entered the city at daybreak, said to his friends with tears in his eyes, that he had often con­ sidered Sulla a fortunate man, but on this day of all others he admired the man's good fortune, in that when he chose to save Athens he had also the power;", "5280": "“ but upon me,\" he said, \"who have been emulous to imitate his ex­ ample, the daemon has instead brought the reputation of Mummius.\" *", "5281": "However, as far as present circumstances allowed, he endeavoured to restore the city.", "5282": "The fire indeed was quenched by the rains that chanced to fall, as the deity would have it, at the time of the capture, and the greatest part of what had been destroyed Lucullus rebuilt while he stayed at Amisus;", "5283": "and he received into the city such of the Amisenes as had fled, and settled there any other Greeks who were willing to settle, and added to the limits of the territory a tract of one hundred and twenty stadia.", "5284": "Amisus was a colony!", "5285": "of the Athenians, planted, as one might suppose, at that period in which their power was at its height and had the command of the sea.", "5286": "And this was the reason why many who wished to escape from the tyranny of Aristion ‡ sailed to the Euxine and settled at Amisus, where they became citizens;", "5287": "but it happened that by flying from misfortune at home they came in for a share of the misfortunes of others.", "5288": "Lucullus, however, clothed all of them who survived the capture of the city, and, after giving each two hundred drachmae besides, he sent them back to their home.", "5289": "On this occasion, Tyrannic § the grammarian was taken prisoner.", "5290": "Murena asked him for himself, and on getting Tyrannic set him free, wherein he made an illiberal use of the favour that he had received;", "5291": "for Lucullus did not think it fitting that a man who was esteemed for his learning should be made a slave first and then a freedman;", "5292": "for the giving him an apparent freedom was equivalent to the depriving him of his real freedom.", "5293": "But it was not in this instance only that Murena showed himself far inferior to his general in honourable feeling and conduct.", "5294": "XX.", "5295": "Lucullus now turned to the cities of Asia, in order that while he had leisure from military operations he might pay some attention to justice and the law, which the province had now felt the want of for a long time, and the people had endured unspeakable and incredible calamities, being plundered and reduced to slavery by the Publican!", "5296": "and the money-lenders, so that individuals were compelled to sell their handsome sons and virgin daughters, and the cities to sell their sacred offerings, pictures and statues.", "5297": "The lot of the citizens was at last to be condemned to slavery themselves, but the sufferings which preceded were ptill worse-the fixing of ropes and barriers,.", "5298": "and horses, and standing under the open sky, during the heat in the sun, and during the cold when they were forced into the mud or the ice;", "5299": "so that slavery was considered a relief from the burden of debt, and a blessing.", "5300": "Such evils as these Lucullus discovered in the cities, and in a short time he relieved the sufferers from all of them.", "5301": "In the first place, he declared that the rate of interest should be reckoned at the hundredth part,t and no more;", "5302": "in the second, he cut off all the interest which exceeded the capital;", "5303": "thirdly, what was most important of all, he declared that the lender should receive the fourth part of the income of the debtor;", "5304": "but any lender who had tacked the interest to the principal was deprived of the whole:", "5305": "thus, in less than four years all the debts were paid, and their property was given back to them free from all encumbrance.", "5306": "Now the common debt originated in the twenty thousand talents which Bulla had laid on Asia as a contribution, and twice this amount was repaid to the lenders, though they had indeed now brought the debt up to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand talents by means of the interest.", "5307": "The lenders, however, considered themselves very ill used, and they raised a great outcry against Lucullus at Rome, and they endeavoured to bribe some of the demagogues to attack him;", "5308": "for the lenders had great influence, and had among their debtors many of the men who were engaged in public life.", "5309": "But Lucullus gained the affection of the cities which had been favoured by him, and the other provinces also longed to see such a man over them, and felicitated those who had the good luck to have such a governer.", "5310": "XXI.", "5311": "Appius Clodius,* who was sent to Tigranes (now Clodius was the brother of the then wife of Lucullus), was at first conducted by the king's guides through the upper part of the country, by a route unnecessarily cir­ cuitous and roundabout, and one that required many days' journeying;", "5312": "but, as soon as the straight road was indi­ cated to him by a freedman, a Syrian by nation, he quitted that tedious and tricky road, and, bidding his barbarian guides farewell, he crossed the Euphrates in a few days, and arrived at Antiocheia,† near Daphne.", "5313": "There he waited for Tigranes, pursuant to the king's orders (for Tigranes was absent, and still engaged in reducing some of the Phœnician cities), and in the meantime he gained over many of the princes who paid the Armenian a hollow obedience, among whom was Zarbienus, King of Gordyene,* and he promised aid from Lucullus to many of the en­ slaved cities, which secretly sent to him—bidding them, however, keep quiet for the present.", "5314": "Now the rule of the Armenians was not tolerable to the Greeks, but was harsh ;", "5315": "and what was worse, the king's temper had become violent and exceedingly haughty in his great prosperity ;", "5316": "for he had not only everything about him which the many covet and admire, but he seemed to think that everything was made for him.", "5317": "Beginning with expecta­ lions which were slight and contemptible, he had subdued many nations, and humbled the power of the Parthians as no man before him had done;", "5318": "and he filled Mesopotamia with Greeks, many from Cilicia and many from Cappadocia, whom he removed and settled.", "5319": "He also removed from their abodes the Skenite Arabians,t and settled them near him, that he might with their aid have the benefit of commerce.", "5320": "Many were the kings who were in attendance on him;", "5321": "but there were four who were always about him, like attendants or guards, and when he mounted his horse they ran by his side in jackets ;", "5322": "and when he was seated and transacting business, they stood by with their hands clasped together, which was considered to be of all atti­ tudes the most expressive of servitude, as if they had sold their freedom, and were presenting their bodies to their master in a posture indicating readiness to suffer rather than to act.", "5323": "Appius, however, was not alarmed or startled at the tragedy show;", "5324": "but, as soon as he had an opportunity of addressing the king, he told him plainly that he was come to take back Mithridates, as one who belonged to the triumphs of Lucullus, or to denounce wat against Tigranes.", "5325": "Though the king made an effort to preserve a tranquil mien, and affected a smile while he was listening to the address, he could not conceal from the bystanders that he was disconcerted by the bold speech of the youth, he who had not for near five-and- twenty years * heard the voice of a free man;", "5326": "for so many years had he been king, or rather tyrant.", "5327": "However, he replied to Appius that he would not give up Mithridates, and that he would resist the Romans if they attacked him.", "5328": "He was angry with Lucullus because he addressed him in his letter by the title of King only, and not King of Kings, and, accordingly in his reply, Tigranes did not address Lucullus by the title of Imperator.", "5329": "But he sent splendid presents to Appius, and when they were refused he sent still more.", "5330": "Appius, not wishing to appear to re­ ject the king's presents from any hostile feeling, selected from among them a goblet, and sent the rest back;", "5331": "and then with all speed set off to join the Imperator.", "5332": "XXII.", "5333": "Now, up to this time, Tigranes had not deigned to see Mithridates,† nor to speak to him, though Mithri­ dates was allied to him by marriage, and had been ejected from so great a kingdom ;", "5334": "but, in a degrading and insult­ ing manner, he had allowed M ithridates to be far removed from him, and, in a manner, kept a prisoner in his abode, which was a marshy and unhealthy place.", "5335": "However, he now sent for him with demonstrations of respect and friendship.", "5336": "In a secret conference which took place in the palace, they endeavoured to allay their mutual sus­ picions, by turning the blame on their friends, to their ruin.", "5337": "One of them was Metrodorus ‡ of Skepsis, an agree­ able speaker, and a man of great acquirements, who en­ joyed so high a degree of favour with Mithridates that he got the name of the king's father.", "5338": "Metrodorus, as it seems, had once been sent on an embassy from Mithridates to Tigranes, to pray for aid against the Romans, on which occasion Tigranes asked him, \" But you, Metrodorus, what do you advise me in this matter?\"", "5339": "Metrodorus, either consulting the interests of Tigranes, or not wishing Mithridates to be maintained in his kingdom, replied, that, as ambassador, he requested him to send aid, but, in the capacity of adviser, he told him not to send any.", "5340": "Tigranes reported this to Mithridates, to whom he gave the information, not expecting that he would inflict any extreme punishment on Metrodorus.", "5341": "But Metrodorus was forthwith put to death, and Tigranes was sorry for what he had done, though he was not altogether the cause of the misfortune of Metrodorus:", "5342": "indeed what he had said merely served to turn the balance in the dislike of Mithri­ dates towards Metrodorus;", "5343": "for Mithridates had for a long time disliked Metrodorus, and this was discovered from his private papers, that fell into the hands of the Romans, in which there were orders to put Metrodorus to death.", "5344": "Now, Tigranes interred the body with great pomp, sparing no expense on the man, when dead, whom he had betrayed when living.", "5345": "Amphikrates the rhetorician also lost his life at the court of Tigranes, if he too deserves mention for the sake of Athens.", "5346": "It is said that he fled to Seleu­ keia,* on the Tigris, and that when the citizens there asked him to give lectures on his art, he treated them with contempt, saying, in an arrogant way, that a dish would not hold a dolphin.", "5347": "Removing himself from Seleu­ keia, he betook himself to Kleopatra, who was the daugh­ ter of Mithridates, and the wife of Tigranes;", "5348": "but he soon fell under suspicion, and, being excluded from all com­ munion with the Greeks, he starved himself to death.", "5349": "Amphikrates also received an honourable interment from Kleopatra, and his body lies at Sapha, a place in those parts so called.", "5350": "XXIII.", "5351": "After conferring on Asia the fulness of good administration and of peace, Lucullus did not neglect such things as would gratify the people and gain their favour ;", "5352": "but during his stay at Ephesus he gained popularity in the Asiatic cities by processions and public festivals in commemoration of his victories, and by contests of athletes and gladiators.", "5353": "The cities on their side made a return by celebrating festivals, called after the name of Lucullus, to do honour to the man;", "5354": "and they manifested towards him what is more pleasing than demonstrations of respect, real affection.", "5355": "Now, when Appius had returned, and it appeared that there was to be war with Tigranes, Lucullus again advanced into Pontus, and, getting his troops together, be besieged Sinope,* or rather the Cilicians of the king's party, who were in possession of the city ;", "5356": "but the Cilicians made their escape by night, after massacring many of the Sinopians, and firing the city.", "5357": "Lucullus, who saw what was going on, made his way into the city, and slaughtered eight thousand of the Cilicians, who were left there;", "5358": "but he restored to the rest of the inhabitants their property, and provided for the interests of Sinope, mainly by reason of a vision of this sort:", "5359": "he dreamed that a man stood by him in his sleep, and said, “ Advance a little, Lucullus;", "5360": "for Autolykus is come, and wishes to meet with you.\"", "5361": "On waking, Lucullus could not con­ jecture what was the meaning of the vision;", "5362": "but he took the city on that day, and, while pursuing the Cilicians, who were escaping in their ships, he saw a statue lying on the beach, which the Cilicians had not had time to put on board ;", "5363": "and the statue was the work of Sthenis,* one of his good performances.", "5364": "Now, somebody told Lucullus that it was the statue of Autolykus, the founder of Sinope.", "5365": "Autolykus is said to have been one of those who joined Herakles from Thessalia, in his expedition against the Amazons, and a son of Deimachus.", "5366": "In his voyage home, in company with Demoleon and Phlogius, he lost his ship, which was wrecked at the place called Pedalium, in the Chersonesus :", "5367": "† but he escaped with his arms and companions to Sinope, which he took from the Syrians:", "5368": "for Sinope was in possession of the Syrians, who were descended from Syrus, the son of Apollo, according to the story, and Sinope, the daughter of Asopus.", "5369": "On hearing this, Lu­ cullus called to mind the advice of Sulla, who in his ‘ Me­ moirs' advised to consider nothing so trustworthy and safe as that which is signified in dreams.", "5370": "Lucullus was now apprised that Mithridates and Tigranes were on the point of entering Lycaonia and Cilicia, with the intention of anticipating hostilities by an invasion of Asia, and he was surprised that the Armenian, if he really intended to attack the Romans, did not avail himself of the aid of Mithri­ dates, in the war when he was at the height of his power, nor join his forces to those of Mithridates when he was strong but allowed him to be undone and crushed;", "5371": "and now began a war that offered only cold hopes, and threw himself on the ground to join those who were already there and unable to rise.", "5372": "XXIV.", "5373": "Now, when Machares also, the son of Mithridates, who held the Bosporus, sent to Lucullus a crown worth one thousand gold pieces, and prayed to be acknowledged a friend and ally * of the Romans, Lucullus, considering that the former war was at an end, left Sornatius in those parts to watch over the affairs of Pontus with six thou­ sand soldiers.", "5374": "He set out himself with twelve thousand foot soldiers, and not quite three thousand horse, to com­ mence a second campaign, wherein he seemed to be making a hazardous move, and one not resting on any safe calcula­ tion ;", "5375": "for he was going to throw himself among warlike nations and many thousands of horsemen, and to enter a boundless tract, surrounded by deep rivers and by mountains covered with perpetual snow;", "5376": "so that his soldiers, who were generally not very obedient to dis­ cipline, followed unwillingly and made opposition:", "5377": "and at Rome the popular leaders raised a cry against him, and accused him of seeking one war after another, though the State required no wars, that he might never lay down his arms so long as he had command, and never stop making his private profit out of the public danger;", "5378": "and in course of time the demagogues at Rome accomplished their purpose.", "5379": "Lucullus, advancing by hard marches to the Euphrates, found the stream swollen and muddy, owing to the winter season, and he was vexed on considering that it would cause loss of time and some trouble if he had to get together boats to take his army across and to build rafts.", "5380": "However, in the evening the water began to sub­ side, and it went on falling all through the night, and at daybreak the bed of the river was empty.", "5381": "The natives observing that some small islands in the river had become visible, and that the stream near them was still, made their obeisance to Lucullus;", "5382": "for this had very seldom hap­ pened before, and they considered it a token that the river had purposely made itself tame and gentle for Lucullus, and was offering him an easy and ready passage.", "5383": "Accord­ ingly, Lucullus took advantage of the opportunity, and carried his troops over:", "5384": "and a favourable sign accom­ panied the passage of the army.", "5385": "Cows feed in that neigh­ bourhood, which are sacred to Artemis Persia, a deity whom the barbarians on the farther side of the Euphrates venerate above all others;", "5386": "they use the cows only for sacrifice, which at other times ramble at liberty about the country, with a brand upon them, in the form of the torch of the goddess, and it is not very easy, nor without much trouble, that they can catch the cows when they want them.", "5387": "After the army had crossed the Euphrates one of these cows came to a rock, which is considered sacred to the goddess, and stood upon it, and there laying down its head, just as a cow does when it is held down tight by a rope, it offered itself to Lucullus to be sacrificed.", "5388": "Lucul­ lus also sacrificed a bull to the Euphrates, as an acknow­ ledgment for his passage over the river.", "5389": "He encamped there for that day, and on the next and the following days he advanced through Sophene * without doing any harm to the people, who joined him and gladly received the soldiers;", "5390": "and when the soldiers were expressing a wish to take possession of a fortress, which was supposed to contain much wealth, “ That is the fortress,\" said Lucullus, \" which we must take first,\" pointing to the Taurus t in the distance;", "5391": "“ but this is reserved for the victors.\"", "5392": "He now continued his route by hard marches, and, crossing the Tigris, entered Armenia.XXV.", "5393": "Now, as the first person who reported to Tigranes that Lucullus was in the country got nothing for his pains, but had his head cut off, nobody else would tell him, and Tigranes was sitting in ignorance while the fires of war were burning round him, and listening to flattering words, That Lucullus would be a great general if he should venture to stand against Tigranes at Ephesus, and should not flee forthwith from Asia, at the sight of so many tens of thousands.", "5394": "So true it is, that it is not every man who can bear much wine, nor is it any ordinary understanding that in great prosperity does not lose all sound judgment.", "5395": "The first of his friends who ventured to tell him the truth was Mithrobarzanes;", "5396": "and he, too, got no reward for his boldness in speaking;", "5397": "for he was sent forthwith against Lucullus, with three thousand horsemen and a very large body of infantry, with orders to bring the general alive, and to trample down his men.", "5398": "Now, part of the army of Lucullus was preparing to halt, and the rest was still advancing.", "5399": "When the scouts reported that the barbarian was coming upon them, Lucullus was afraid that the enemy would fall upon his troops while they were divided and not in battle order, and so put them into confusion.", "5400": "Lu­ cullus himself set to work to superintend the encampment, and he sent Sextilius, one of his legati, with sixteen hundred horsemen, and hoplitæ* and light-armed troops, a few more in number, with orders to approach close to the enemy, and wait till he should hear that the soldiers who were with him had made their encampment.", "5401": "Sextilius wished to follow his orders;", "5402": "but he was compelled to engage by Mithrobarzanes, who was confidently advancing against him.", "5403": "A battle ensued, in which Mithrobarzanes fell fighting;", "5404": "and the rest, taking to flight, were all cut to pieces with the exception of a few.", "5405": "Upon this Tigranes left Tigranocerta,t a large city which he had founded, and retreated to the Taurus, and there began to get together his forces from all parts:", "5406": "but Lucullus, allowing him no time for preparation, sent Murena to harass and cut off those who were collecting to join Tigranes, and Sextilius on the other side to check a large body of Arabs, who were approaching to the king.", "5407": "It happened just at the same time that Sextilius fell on the Arabs as they were encamp­ ing and killed most of them, and Murena, following Tigranes, took the opportunity of attacking him as he was passing through a rough and narrow defile with his army in a long line.", "5408": "Tigranes fled, and left behind him all his baggage ;", "5409": "and many of the Armenians were killed and still more taken prisoners.", "5410": "XXVI.", "5411": "After this success Lucullus broke up his camp and marched against Tigranocerta, which he surrounded with his lines, and began to besiege.", "5412": "There were in the city many Greeks, a part of those who had been removed from Cilicia, and many barbarians who had fared the same way with the Greeks, Adiabeni,* and Assyrians, and Gordyeni and Cappadocians, whose native cities Tigranes had digged down, and had removed the inhabitants and settled them there.", "5413": "The city was also filled with wealth and sacred offerings, for every private individual and prince, in order to please the king, contributed to the increase and ornament of the city.", "5414": "For this reason Lu­ cullus pressed the siege, thinking that Tigranes would not endure this, but even contrary to his judgment,would come down in passion and fight a battle;", "5415": "and he was not mistaken.", "5416": "Now, Mithridates, both by messengers and letters, strongly advised Tigranes not to fight a battle, but to cut off the enemy's supplies by means of his cavalry ;", "5417": "and Taxiles t also, who had come from Mith­ ridates to join Tigranes, earnestly entreated the king to keep on the defensive, and to avoid the arms of the Romans, as being invincible.", "5418": "Tigranes at first readily listened to this advice :", "5419": "but when the Armenians and Gordyeni had joined him with all their forces, and the kings were come, bringing with them all the power of the Modes and Adiabeni, and many Arabs had arrived from the sea that borders on Babylonia, and many Albanians from the Caspian, and Iberians, who are neigh­ hour!", "5420": "of the Albanians;", "5421": "and not a few of the tribes about the Araxes,* who are not governed by kings, had come to join him, induced by solicitations and presents, and the banquets of the king were filled with hopes and confidence and barbaric threats, and his councils also,—Taxiles narrowly escaped death for opposing the design of fight­ ing, and it was believed that Mithridates wished to divert Tigranes from obtaining a great victory, merely from envy.", "5422": "Accordingly, Tigranes would not even wait for Mithridates, for fear he should share in the glory;", "5423": "but he advanced with all his force, and greatly complained to his friends, it is said, that he would have to encounter Lu­ cullus alone, and not all the Roman generals at once.", "5424": "And his confidence was not altogether madness nor without good grounds, when he looked upon so many nations and kings following him, and bodies of hoplitæ, and tens of thousands of horsemen ;", "5425": "for he was at the head of twenty thousand bowmen and slingers and fifty-five thousand horsemen, of whom seventeen thousand were clothed in armour of mail, as Lucullus said in his letter to the Senate, and one hundred and fifty thousand hoplitæ, some of whom were drawn up in cohorts and others in phalanx;", "5426": "and of road-makers, bridge-makers, clearers of rivers, timber­ cutters, and labourers for other necessary purposes, there were thirty-five thousand, who, being placed behind the fighting men, added to the imposing appearance and the strength of the army.", "5427": "XXVII.", "5428": "When Tigranes had crossed the Taurus, and, showing himself with all his forces, looked down on the Roman army, which was encamped before Tigranocerta, the barbarians in the city hailed his appearance with shouts and clapping of hands, and from their walls with threats pointed to the Armenians.", "5429": "As Lucullus was con­ sidering about the battle, some advised him to give up the siege, and march against Tigranes;", "5430": "others urged him not to leave so many enemies in his rear, nor to give up the siege.", "5431": "Lucullus replied, that singly they did not advise well, but that taken both together the counsel was good;", "5432": "on which he divided his army.", "5433": "He left Murena with six thousand foot to maintain the siege ;", "5434": "and himself taking twenty-four cohorts, among which there were not above ten thousand hoplitæ, with all his cavalry and slingers and bowmen, to the number of about one thousand, advanced against the enemy.", "5435": "Lucullus, encamping in a large plain by the bank of the river, appeared contemptible to Tigranes, and furnished matter for amusement to the king's flatterers.", "5436": "Some scoffed at him, and others, by way of amusement, cast lots for the spoil, and all the generals and kings severally applied to the king, and begged the matter might be intrusted to each of them singly, and that Tigranes would sit as a spectator.", "5437": "Tigranes also attempted to be witty, and, in a scoffing manner, he uttered the well-known saying, \" If they have come as ambassadors, there are too many of them;", "5438": "if as soldiers, too few.\"", "5439": "Thus they amused themselves with sarcastic sayings and jokes.", "5440": "At daybreak Lucullus led out his troops under arms.", "5441": "Now the barbarian army was on the east side of the river;", "5442": "but, as the river makes a bend towards the west, at a part where it was easiest to ford, Lucullus led his troops out, and hurried in that direction, which led Tigranes to think that he was retreating;", "5443": "and calling Taxiles to him he said, with a laugh, \" Don't you see that these invincible Roman warriors are flying ?”", "5444": "Taxiles replied:", "5445": "“ I should be pleased, 0 king, at any strange thing happening which should be lucky to you ;", "5446": "but the Roman soldiers do not put on their splendid attire when they are on a march;", "5447": "nor have they then their shields cleaned, and their helmets bare, as they now have, by reason of having taken off the leathern coverings;", "5448": "but this brightness of their armour is a sign they are going to fight, and are now marching against their enemies.\"", "5449": "While Taxiles was still speaking the first eagle came in sight;", "5450": "for Lucullus had now faced about, and the cohorts were seen taking their position in manipuli for the purpose of crossing the river:", "5451": "on which Tigranes, as if he were hardly recovering from a drunken bout, called out two or three times, \" What, are they coming against us ? \" and so, with much confusion, the enemy's soldiers set about getting into order, the king taking his position in the centre, and giving the left wing to the King of the Adiabeni, and the right to the Mede, on which wing also were the greater part of the soldiers, clad in mail, occupying the first ranks.", "5452": "As Lucullus was going to cross the river, some of the officers bade him beware of the day, which was one of the unlucky days which the Romans call black days;", "5453": "for on that day Cæpio * and his army were destroyed in a battle with the Cimbri.", "5454": "Lucullus replied in these memorable words:", "5455": "\" Well, I will make it a lucky day for the Romans.\"", "5456": "The day was the sixth of October.", "5457": "XXVIII.", "5458": "Saying this, and bidding his men be of good cheer, Lucullus began to cross the river, and advanced against the enemy at the head of his soldiers, with a breastplate of glittering scaly steel, and a cloak with a fringed border, and he just let it be seen that his sword was already bare, thereby indicating that they must forthwith come to close quarters with the enemy, who fought with missiles, and by the rapidity of the attack cut off the intervening space, within which the barbarians could use their bows.", "5459": "Observing that the mailed cavalry, which had a great reputation, were stationed under an eminence, crowned by a broad level space, and that the approach to it was only a distance of four stadia, and neither difficult nor rough, he ordered the Thracian cavalry and the Gauls who were in the army, to fall on them in the flank, and to beat aside their long spears with their swords.", "5460": "Now the mailed horsemen rely solely on their long spears, and they can do nothing else, either in their own defence or against the enemy, owing to the weight and rigidity of their armour, and they look like men who are walled up in it.", "5461": "Lucullus himself, with two cohorts, I u shed on vigorously to the hill, followed by his men, who were encouraged by seeing him in his armour, enduring all the fatigue on foot, and pressing forwards.", "5462": "On reaching the summit, Lucullus stood on a conspicuous spot, and called cut aloud :", "5463": "\"", "5464": "We have got the victory!", "5465": "Fellow soldiers, we have got the victory! \"", "5466": "With these words he led his men against the mailed horsemen, and ordered them not to use their javelins yet, but every man to hold them in both hands, and to thrust against the enemy's legs and thighs, which are the only parts of these mailed men that are bare.", "5467": "However, there was no occasion for this mode of fighting ;", "5468": "for the enemy did not stand the attack of the Romans, but, setting up a shout and flying most disgrace­ fully, they threw themselves and their horses, with all their weight, upon their own infantry, before the inf intry had begun the battle, so that so many tens of thousands were defeated before a wound was felt or blood was drawn.", "5469": "Now the great slaughter began when the army turned to flight, or rather attempted to fly, for they could not really fly, owing to the closeness and depth of their ranks, which made them in the way of one another.", "5470": "Tigranes, riding off at the front, fled with a few attendants, and, seeing that his son was a partner in his misfortune, he took off the diadem from his head, and, with tears, presented it to him, at the same time telling him to save himself, as he best could, by taking some other direction.", "5471": "The youth would not venture to put the diadem on his head, but gave it to the most faithful of his slaves to keep.", "5472": "This slave, happening to be taken, was carried to Lucullus, and thus the diadem of Tigranes, with other booty, fell into the hands of the Romans.", "5473": "It is said that above one hundred thousand of the infantry perished, and very few of the cavalry escaped.", "5474": "On the side of the Romans, a hundred were wounded, and five killed.", "5475": "Antiochus * the philosopher, who mentions this battle in his ‘ Treatise on the Gods,' says that the sun never saw a battle like it.", "5476": "Strabo, another philosopher,† in his ‘ Historical Memoirs,’ says that the Romans were ashamed, and laughed at one another, for requiring arms against such a set of slaves.", "5477": "And Livius ‡ observed that the Romans never engaged with an enemy with such inferiority of numbers on their side, for the victors were hardly the twentieth part of the defeated enemy, but somewhat less.", "5478": "The most skilful of the Roman generals, and those who had most military experience, commended Lucullus chiefly for this, that he had out-gene railed the two most distinguished and powerful kings by two most opposite manoeuvres, speed and slowness;", "5479": "for he wore out Mithridates, at the height of his power, by time and pro­ tracting the war ;", "5480": "but he crushed Tigranes by his activity:", "5481": "and he was one of the very few commanders who ever employed delay when he was engaged in active operations, and bold measures when his safety was at stake.", "5482": "XXIX.", "5483": "Mithridates made no haste to be present at the battle, because he supposed that Lucullus would carry on the campaign with his usual caution and delay;", "5484": "but he was advancing leisurely to join Tigranes.", "5485": "At first he fell in with a few Armenians on the road, who were retreat­ ing in great alarm and consternation, and he conjectured what had happened, but as he soon heard of the defeat from a large number whom he met, who had lost their arms and were wounded, he set out to seek Tigranes.", "5486": "Though he found Tigranes destitute of everything, and humbled, Mithridates did not retaliate for his former haughty behaviour, but he got down from his horse, and lamented with Tigranes their common misfortunes;", "5487": "he also gave Tigranes a royal train that was attending on him, and encouraged him to hope for the future.", "5488": "Accordingly, the two kings began to collect fresh forces.", "5489": "Now, in the city of Tigranocerta * the Greeks had fallen to quarrelling with the barbarians, and were preparing to surrender the place to Lucullus, on which lie assaulted and took it.", "5490": "Lucullus appropriated to himself the treasures in the city, but he gave up the city to be plundered by the soldiers, which contained eight thousand talents of coined money, with other valuable booty.", "5491": "Besides this, Lucullus gave to each man eight hundred drachmæ out of the produce of the spoils.", "5492": "Hearing that many actors had been taken in the city, whom Tigranes had collected from all quarters, with the view of opening the theatre which he had constructed, Lucullus employed them for the games and shows in cele­ bration of the victory.", "5493": "The Greeks he sent to their homes, and supplied them with means for the journey, and in like manner those barbarians who had been compelled to settle there ;", "5494": "the result of which was that the dissolution of one city was followed by the restoration of many others, which thus recovered their citizens, by whom Lucullus was be­ loved as a benefactor and a founder.", "5495": "Everything else also went on successfully and conformably to the merits of the general, who sought for the praise that is due to justice and humanity, and not the praise that follows success in war:", "5496": "for the success in war was due in no small degree, to the army and to fortune, but his justice and humanity proved that he had a mild and well-regulated temper ;", "5497": "and it was by these means that Lucullus now subdued the barbarians without resorting to arms ;", "5498": "for the kings of the Arabs came to him to surrender all that they had, and the Sopheni also came over to him.", "5499": "He also gained the affec­ tion of the Gordyeni so completely that they were ready to leave their cities, and to follow him, as volunteers, with their children and wives, the reason of which was as follows:", "5500": "Zarbienus, the King of the Gordyeni, as it has been already told, secretly communicated, through Appius, with Lucullus about an alliance, being oppressed by the tyranny of Tigranes;", "5501": "but his design was reported to Tigranes, and he was put to death, and his children and wife perished with him, before the Romans invaded Armenia.", "5502": "Lucullus did not forget all this;", "5503": "and, on enter­ ing Gordyene, he made a funeral for Zarbienus, and, orna­ menting the pile with vests, and the king's gold, and the spoils got from Tigranes.", "5504": "he set fire to it himself, and poured libations on the pile, with the friends and kinsmen of the king, and gave him the name of friend and ally of the Roman people.", "5505": "He also ordered a monument to be erected to him at great cost;", "5506": "for a large quantity of gold and silver was found in the palace of Zarbienus, and there were stored up three million medimni of wheat, so that the soldiers were well supplied, and Lucullus was admired, that without receiving a drachma from the treasury, he made the war support itself.", "5507": "XXX.", "5508": "While Lucullus was here, there came an embassy from the King of the Parthians * also, who invited him to friendship and an alliance.", "5509": "This proposal was agreeable to Lucullus, and in return he sent ambassadors to the Parthian, who discovered that he was playing double and secretly asking Mesopotamia from Tigranes as the price of his alliance.", "5510": "On hearing this Lucullus determined to pass by Tigranes and Mithridates as exhausted antagonists, and to try the strength of the Parthians, and to march against them, thinking it a glorious thing, in one uninterrupted campaign, like an athlete, to give three kings in succes­ sion the throw, and to have made his way through three empires, the most powerful under the run, unvanquished and victorious.", "5511": "Accordingly he sent orders to Sornatius and the other commanders in Pontus to conduct the army there to him, as he was intending to advance from Gord­ yene farther into Asia.", "5512": "These generals had already found that the soldiers were difficult to manage and muti­ nous ;", "5513": "but now they made the ungovernable temper of the soldiers quite apparent, being unable by any means of persuasion or compulsion to move the soldiers, who, with solemn asseverations, declared aloud that they would not stay even where they were, but would go and leave Pontus undefended.", "5514": "Report of this being carried to the army of Lucullus effected the corruption of his soldiers also, who had been made inert towards military service by the wealth they had acquired and their luxurious living, and they wanted rest;", "5515": "and, when they heard of the bold words of the soldiers in Pontus, they said they were men, and their example ought to be followed, for they had done enough to entitle them to be released from military service, and to enjoy repose.", "5516": "XXXI.", "5517": "Lucullus, becoming acquainted with these and other still more mutinous expressions, gave up the ex­ pedition against the Parthians, and marched a second time against Tigranes.", "5518": "It was now the height of summer ;", "5519": "and Lucullus was dispirited after crossing the Taurus, to see that the fields were still green,.", "5520": "so much later are the seasons, owing to the coldness of the air.", "5521": "However, he descended from the Taurus, and, after defeating the Armenians, who twice or thrice ventured to attack him, he plundered the villages without any fear;", "5522": "and, by seiz­ ing the corn which had been stored up by Tigranes, he reduced the enemy to the straits which he was apprehend­ ing himself.", "5523": "Lucullus challenged the Armenians to battle by surrounding their camp with his lines and ravaging the country before their eyes;", "5524": "but, as this did not make them move after their various defeats, he broke up and advanced against Artaxata, the royal residence of Tigranes, where his young children and wives were, thinking that Tigranes would not give them up without a battle.", "5525": "It is said that Hannibal the Carthaginian, after the defeat of Antiochus by the Romans, went to Artaxas the Armenian, to whose notice he introduced many useful things;", "5526": "and, observing a position which possessed great natural advan­ tages and was very pleasant, though at that time unoccupied and neglected, he made the plan of a city on the ground, and, taking Artaxas there, showed it to him, and urged him to build up the place.", "5527": "The king, it is said, was pleased, and asked Hannibal to superintend the work;", "5528": "and there­ upon a large and beautiful city sprung up, and, being named after the king, was declared to be the capital of Armenia.", "5529": "Tigranes did not let Lucullus quietly march against Artaxata, but, moving with his forces on the fourth day, he encamped opposite to the Romans, placing the river Arsanias between him and the enemy, which river the Romans must of necessity cross on their route to Artaxata.", "5530": "After sacrificing to the gods, Lucullus, con­ sidering that he had the victory in his hands, began to lead his army across the river, with twelve cohorts in the van, and the rest placed as a reserve to prevent the enemy from attacking his flank.", "5531": "There was a large body of picked cavalry opposed to the Romans, and in front of them Mardi mounted archers, and Iberians * armed with spears, on whom Tigranes relied more than any of his mercenaries, as being the most warlike of all.", "5532": "However, they showed no gallant spirit;", "5533": "but, after a slight skirmish with the Roman cavalry, they did not venture to stand the attack of the infantry, and separating and taking to flight on both sides they drew after them the cavalry in the pursuit.", "5534": "At the moment when this part of the enemy was dispersed, the cavalry, which was about Tigranes, rode forward, and Lucullus was alarmed when he saw their brave appearance and numbers.", "5535": "He recalled the cavalry from the pursuit, and himself was the first to meet the Satrapeni, † who were posted opposite to him with the king's chief officers;", "5536": "but before they came to close quarters, the enemy was panic-struck and turned to flight.", "5537": "Of three kings at the same time opposed to the Romans.", "5538": "Mithridates of Pontus appears to have fled most disgrace­ fully ;", "5539": "for he did not stay to hear even the shouts of the Romans.", "5540": "The pursuit was continued for a great distance and all night long, and the Romans were wearied with killing and taking prisoners, and getting valuables and booty.", "5541": "Livius * says that in the former battle a greater number of the enemy, but in this more men of rank fell and were taken prisoners.", "5542": "XXXII.", "5543": "Elated and encouraged by this victory, Lucul­ lus was intending to advance farther into the country, and to subdue the barbarian;", "5544": "but contrary to what one would have expected at the season of the autumnal equinox, they were assailed by heavy storms, generally snow-storms, and, when the sky was clear, there was hoar-frost and ice, owing to which the horses could not well drink of the rivers, by reason of the excessive cold;", "5545": "and they were diffi­ cult to ford, because the ice broke, and the rough edges cut the horses' sinews.", "5546": "And as the greater part of the country was shaded and full of defiles and wooded, the soldiers were kept continually wet, being loaded with snow while they were marching, and spending the night uncomfortably in damp places.", "5547": "Accordingly, they had not followed Lucullus for many days after the battle when they began to offer resistance, at first making entreaties and also sending the tribunes to him, and then collecting in a tumultuous manner, with loud shouts in their tents by night, which is considered to be an indication that an army is in a state of mutiny.", "5548": "Yet Lucullus urged them strongly, and called on them to put endurance in their souls till they had taken and destroyed the Armenian Carthage, the work of their greatest enemy, meaning Hannibal.", "5549": "Not being able to prevail on them, he led them back by a different pass over the Taurus, and descended into the country called Myg­ donike, which is fertile and warm, and contains a large and populous city, which the barbarians called Nisibis,t but the Greeks Antiocha Mygdonike.", "5550": "The city was de­ fended in name by Gouras, a brother of Tigranes, but in fact by the experience and mechanical skill of Kallimachus, who had given Lucullus great trouble in the siege of Amisus also.", "5551": "Lucullus seated himself before the city, and, by availing himself of every mode of pressing a siege, in a short time he took the city by storm.", "5552": "Gouras, who surrendered himself to Lucullus, was treated kindly ;", "5553": "but he would not listen to Kallimachus, though he promised to discover concealed treasures of great value;", "5554": "and he ordered him to be brought in chains to be punished for the conflagration by which he destroyed Amisus and deprived Lucullus of the object of his ambition and an opportunity of displaying his friendly disposition to the Greeks.", "5555": "XXXIII.", "5556": "So far one may say that fortune accompanied Lucullus and shared his campaigns:", "5557": "but from this time, just as if a wind had failed him, trying to force everything and always meeting with obstacles, he displayed indeed the courage and endurance of a good commander, but his undertakings produced him neither fame nor good opinion, and even the reputation that he had he came very near losing by his want of success and his fruitless disputes.", "5558": "Lucullus himself was in no small degree the cause of all this;", "5559": "for he was not a man who tried to gain the affection of the soldiery, and he considered everything that was done to please the men as a disparagement to the general's power, and as tending to destroy it.", "5560": "But, what was worst of all, he was not affable to the chief officers and those of the same rank as himself;", "5561": "he despised everybody, and thought no man had any merit compared with his own.", "5562": "­", "5563": "These bad qualities, it is said, that Lucullus had, though he possessed many merits.", "5564": "He was tall and handsome, a powerful speaker, and equally prudent in the Forum and the camp.", "5565": "Now, Sallustius says that the soldiers were ill-disposed towards him at the very commencement of the war before Kyzikus, and again at Amisus, because they were compelled to spend two winters in succession in camp.", "5566": "They were also vexed about the other winters, for they either spent them in a hostile country or en­ camped among the allies under the bare sky ;", "5567": "for Lucullus never once entered a Greek and friendly city with his army.", "5568": "While the soldiers were in this humour, they received encouragement from the demagogues at Rome, who envied Lucullus, and charged him with protract­ ing the war through love of power and avarice.", "5569": "They said that he all but held at once Cilicia, Asia, Bithynia, Paphlagonia, Galatia, Pontus, Armenia, and the parts as far as the Phasis, and that at last he had plundered even the palace of Tigranes, as if he had been sent to strip kings and not to conquer them.", "5570": "This, it is said, was urged by one of the prætors, Lucius Quintus,* by whom they were mainly persuaded to pass a decree to send persons to super­ sede Lucullus in his province.", "5571": "They also decreed that many of the soldiers under Lucullus should be released from service.", "5572": "XXXIV.", "5573": "To these causes, in themselves so weighty, there was added another that, most of all, ruined the measures of Lucullus;", "5574": "and this was Publius Clodius, a violent man, and full of arrogance and audacity.", "5575": "He was the brother of the wife of Lucullus, a woman of most dissolute habits, whom he was also accused of debauching.", "5576": "At this time he was serving with Lucullus, and he did not get all the distinction to which he thought himself entitled.", "5577": "In fact, he aspired to the first rank, and, as there were many preferred before him, in consequence of his character, he secretly endeavoured to win the favour of Fimbria's army, and to excite the soldiers against Lucullus.", "5578": "by circulating among them words well suited to those who were ready to hear them, and were not unaccustomed to be courted.", "5579": "These were the men whom Fimbria had persuaded to kill the consul Flaccus, and to choose him­ self for their general.", "5580": "Accordingly, they gladly listened to Clodius, and called him the soldier's friend, for he pretended to feel indignant at their treatment.", "5581": "\"", "5582": "Was there never to be an end,\" he would say, \" to so many wars and dangers, and were they to wear out their lives in fighting with every nation, and wandering over every country, and getting no equivalent for so much service, but, instead thereof, were they to convoy waggons and camels of Lucullus, loaded with cups of gold, set with precious stones, while the soldiers of Pompeius were now living as citizens,.", "5583": "and with their wives and children were sitting quiet in the enjoyment of fertile lands and cities, though they had not driven Mithridates and Tigranes into un­ inhabited wildernesses, nor pulled down the palaces of Asia, but had fought with exiles in Iberia, and runaway slaves in Italy ?", "5584": "Why, then, if there is never to be an end of our service, do we not reserve what remains of our bodies and our lives for a general who considers the wealth of the soldiers his chief glory ? \"", "5585": "By such causes as these the army of Lucullus was corrupted, and his soldiers refused to follow him either against Tigranes or against Mithri­ dates, who immediately made an irruption from Armenia into Pontus, and endeavoured to recover his power;", "5586": "but alleging the winter as an excuse, the soldiers lingered in Gordyene, expecting every moment that Pompeius, or some other commander,† would arrive to supersede Lucullus.XXXV.", "5587": "But when news came that Mithridates had defeated Fabius,* and was marching against Sornatius and Triarius, through very shame the soldiers followed Lucullus.", "5588": "Triarius, being ambitious to snatch the victory which he thought was in his grasp, before Lucullus, who was near, should arrive, was defeated in a great battle.", "5589": "It is said that above seven thousand Romans fell, among whom were a hundred and fifty centurions, and twenty- four tribunes ;", "5590": "and Mithridates took the camp.", "5591": "Lucullus arrived a few days after, and secreted from the soldiers Triarius, whom in their passion they were looking for;", "5592": "and, as Mithridates was not willing to fight, but was waiting for Tigranes, who was already coming down with a large force, Lucullus determined to march back, and to fight with Tigranes before he and Mithridates could unite.", "5593": "As he was on his march the soldiers of Fimbria mutinied, and left their ranks, considering that they were released from service by the decree of the Senate, and that Lucullus had no longer any right to the command, now that the provinces were assigned to others.", "5594": "Upon this there was nothing, however inconsistent with his dignity, which Lucullus did not submit to do-supplicating the soldiers individually, and going about from tent to tent in humble manner, and with tears in his eyes, and sometimes even faking the soldiers by the hand.", "5595": "But they rejected his proffered hand, and threw down before him their empty purses, and told him to fight with the enemy himself, for he was the only person who knew how to get rich from them.", "5596": "However, at the request of the rest of the army, the soldiers of Fimbria were constrained, and agreed to stay to the end of summer, and if, in the meantime, no enemy should come down to fight them, they were then to be released.", "5597": "Lucullus was of necessity obliged to ac­ quiesce in this, or else to be left alone, and give up the country to the barbarians.", "5598": "He therefore kept the soldiers together, without making any further attempt to force them, or lead them out to battle, for he was well content if they would stay with him, and he allowed Cappadocia to be ravaged by Tigranes, and Mithridates to resume his arrogance, as to whom he had written to the Senate, to inform them that he was completely subdued;", "5599": "and the commissioners * were now with him who had been sent to settle the affairs of Pontus, on the supposition that the country was completely in the power of the Romans.", "5600": "Indeed, the commissioners were now witnesses that Lucul­ lus was not his own master, but was treated with con­ tumely and insult by the soldiers, who carried their audacity towards their commander so far, that, at the close of the summer, they put on their armour, and draw­ ing their swords, challenged to battle the enemy who were no longer there, but had already moved off.", "5601": "After utter­ ing the war shout, and flourishing their swords in the air, they left the camp, declaring that the time was up which they had agreed to stay with Lucullus.", "5602": "The rest of the soldiers were summoned by Pompeius by letter, for he had been appointed to the command t in the war against Mithridates and Tigranes, by the favour of the people, and through the influence of the demagogues;", "5603": "though the Senate and the nobles thought that Lucullus was wronged, inasmuch as he was not superseded in a war, but in a triumph;", "5604": "and it was not the command, but the h nours of the command that he was compelled to divest himself of, and to surrender to others.", "5605": "XXXVI.", "5606": "But it appeared a still greater wrong to those who were with Lucullus in Asia, that Lucullus had not the power either to reward or punish for anything that was done in the war;", "5607": "nor did Pompeius allow any person to go to him, nor to pay any attention to the orders and regulations that he was making in concert with the ten commissioners, but he obstructed him by publishing counter edicts, and by the fear which he inspired from having a larger force.", "5608": "However, their friends agreed to bring them together, and they met in a village of Galatia, where they saluted one another in a friendly manner, and each con­ gratulated the other on his victories.", "5609": "Lucullus was the elder, but Pompeius had the greater reputation, because be had oftener had the command, and enjoyed two triumphs.", "5610": "Fasces, wreathed with bay,* were carried before both generals in token of their victories.", "5611": "But, as Pompeius had made a long march through a country without water and arid, the bays upon his fasces were withered, which the lictors of Lucullus observing, in a friendly manner gave them bays out of their own, which were fresh and green.", "5612": "And this the friends of Pompeius interpreted as a good omen;", "5613": "for, in fact, the exploits of Lucullus served to set off the command of Pompeius.", "5614": "But the conference t resulted in no amicable arrangement, and they separated with increased aversion towards each other.", "5615": "Pompeius also annulled the regulations of Lucullus, and he took off with him all the soldiers with the exception of sixteen hundred, whom he left to Lucullus for his triumph;", "5616": "and even these did not follow him very willingly :", "5617": "so ill suited was the temper of Lucullus, or so unlucky was he in securing that which, of all things, is the chief and greatest in a general;", "5618": "for, if he had pos­ sessed this quality, with the other many and great virtues that he had, courage, activity, judgment, and justice, the Roman empire would not have had the Euphrates for its limit, but the remotest parts of Asia, and the Hyrkanian Sea ;", "5619": "‡ for all the other nations had already been defeated by Tigranes, and the Parthian power was not such as it afterwards showed itself to be in the campaign of Crassus,§ nor so well combined, but owing to intestine and neigh­ bouring wars, was not even strong enough to repel the attacks of the Armenians.", "5620": "But it seems to me that the services of Lucullus to his country were less than the harm he did it in other things;", "5621": "for his trophies in Armenia, which were erected on the borders of Partliia, and Tigranocerta, and Nisibis, and the great wealth that was brought from these cities to Rome, and the display of the diadem of Tigranes in his triumph, urged Crassus to attack Asia, and to think that the barbarians were only spoil and booty, and nothing else.", "5622": "But Crassus soon felt the Parthian arrows, and so proved that Lucullus had got the advantage over the enemy, not through their want of skill or cowardice, but by his own courage and ability.", "5623": "This, however, happened afterwards.", "5624": "XXXVII.", "5625": "When Lucullus returned to Rome, first of all he found that his brother Marcus was under prosecu­ tion by Caius Memmius,* for what he had done in his quæstorship at the command of Sulla.", "5626": "Upon Marcus being acquitted, Memmius transferred his attack to Lu­ oullus himself, and endeavoured to excite the people against him, and persuaded them not to give him a triumph, on the ground that he had appropriated to himself much of the spoils, and had prolonged the war.", "5627": "Now that Lu­ cullus was involved in a great struggle, the first and most powerful men, mingling themselves among the tribes, by much entreaty and exertion with difficulty persuaded the people to allow Lucullus to have a triumph;", "5628": "t not, however, like some, a triumph which was striking and bustling, from the length of the procession, and the quantity of things that were displayed, but he decorated the circus of Flaminius with the arms of the enemy, of which he had a great quantity, and with the royal engines of war ;", "5629": "and it was a spectacle in itself far from being contemptible.", "5630": "In the procession a few of the mailed horsemen, and ten of the scythe-bearing chariots moved along, with sixty of the king's friends and generals, and a hundred and ten brazen-beaked ships of war also were carried in the pro­ cession, and a gold statue of Mithridates six feet high, and a shield ornamented with precious stones, and twenty litters loaded with silver vessels, and two-and-thirty loaded with golden cups, armour, and money.", "5631": "All this was carried on men's shoulders;", "5632": "but there were eight mules that bore golden couches, and fifty-six carried silver in bars, and a hundred and seven others carried silver coin to the amount of near two million seven hundred thousand pieces.",

the eerarium;", "5634": "and besides this, it was added that every soldier received nine hundred and fifty drachmas.", "5635": "After this Lucullus feasted all the city in a splendid style, and the surrounding villages which the Romans call Vici.", "5636": "XXXVIII.", "5637": "After Lucullus had divorced Clodia, who was a loose and unprincipled woman, he married Servilia,* the sister of Cato,

he had the advantage of great reputation and influence;", "5644": "but he dis­ appointed these hopes and gave up political affairs, either because he saw that they were already in a difficult posi­ tion and not in a healthy state, or, as some say, because he was satisfied with glory, and wished to fall back to an easy and luxurious life, after his many contests and dangers, which had not been followed by the most fortunate of results.", "5645": "Some commend him for making such a change, whereby he avoided what had befallen Marius, who, after his Cimbrian victories and that great and glorious success, did not choose to dedicate himself to honour so great and to be an object of admiration, but through insatiate desire of glory and power, though an old man, entered into political warfare with young men, and so ended his career in dreadful acts, and in sufferings more dreadful than acts;", "5646": "and they say that Cicero also would have had a better old age if he had withdrawn from public life after the affair of Catiline, and Scipio after he had - added the conquest of Numantia to that of Carthage, if he had then stopped ;", "5647": "for there is a close to a political period also, and political contests as well as those of athletes are censured when a man's vigour and prime have failed him.", "5648": "But Crassus and Pompeius sneered t at Lucullus for giving himself up to pleasure and extravagant living, as if a luxurious life was not more unsuitable to persons of his age than affairs of state and military command.", "5649": "XXXIX.", "5650": "Now in the life of Lucullus, as in an ancient comedy, we may read, in the first part, of political measures and military command, and, in the last part, of drinking and feasts, and hardly anything but revels, and torches, and all kinds of amusement;", "5651": "for I reckon among amuse­ ments, expensive buildings, and construction of ambu­ latories and baths, and still more paintings and statues, and eagerness about works of this kind, all which he got together at great cost, and to this end spent profusely the wealth which he had accumulated to a large and splendid amount in his military command;", "5652": "for, even now, when luxury of this kind has increased, the gardens of Lucullus are reckoned among the most sumptuous of the imperial gardens.-", "5653": "But with respect to his works on the sea- coast and in the neighbourhood of Neapolis, where he suspended as it were hills by digging great tunnels,† and threw around his dwelling-places circular pieces of sea-water and channels for the breeding of fish, and built houses in the sea, Tubero the Stoic, ‡ on seeing them, called him Xerxes in a toga.", "5654": "He had also country residences in the neighbourhood of Tusculum, and towers commanding prospects,§ and open apartments and ambu­ latories, which Pompeius on visiting found fault with Lucullus, that he had arranged his house in the best way for summer, but had made it unfit to live in during the winter.", "5655": "On which Lucullus said, with a smile, \"You think, then, I have less sense than the cranes and storks, and do not change my residence according to the seasons.\"", "5656": "On one occasion, when a prætor was ambitious to signalize himself in the matter of a public spectacle, and asked of Lucullus some purple cloaks for the dress of a chorus, Lucullus replied, that he would see if he had any and would give them to him;", "5657": "and the day after he apked the prætor how many he wanted.", "5658": "The prætor said that a hundred would be enough, on which Lucullus told him to take twice as many;", "5659": "in allusion to which the poet Flaccus * has remarked, that he does not consider a man to be rich, if the property that he cares not for and knows nothing about is not more than that which he sees.", "5660": "XL.", "5661": "The daily meals of Lucullus were accompanied with all the extravagance of newly-acquired wealth;", "5662": "for it was not only by dyed coverlets for his couches, and cups set with precious stones, and choruses and dramatic entertainments, but by abundance of all kinds of food and dainty dishes, curiously prepared, that he made him­ self an object of admiration to the uninstructed.", "5663": "Now Pompeius gained a good reputation in an illness that lie had;", "5664": "for the physician had ordered him to eat a thrush, and, on his domestics telling him that a thrush could not be found in the summer season except at the house of Lucullus, where they were fed, Pompeius would not consent to have one got from there;", "5665": "but remarking to his physician, \"What, if Lucullus were not so luxurious, could not Pompeius live ?\" bade them get for him some­ thing else that could be easily procured.", "5666": "Cato, who was his friend and connected with him by marriage, was so much annoyed at his life and habits that, on one occasion, when a young man had delivered in the senate a tedious and lengthy discourse, quite out of season, on frugality and temperance, Cato got up and said, Won᾽t you stop, you who are as rich as Crassus, and live like Lucullus, and speak like Cato?\"", "5667": "Some say that a remark to this effect was made, but that it was not by Cato.XLI.", "5668": "That Lucullus was not merely pleased with this mode of living, but prided himself upon it, appears from the anecdotes that are recorded.", "5669": "It is said, that he feasted for many days some Greeks who visited Rome, and that they, feeling as Greeks would do * on the occasion, began to be ashamed and to decline the invitation, on the ground that he was daily incurring so much expense on their account ;", "5670": "but Lucullus said to them with a smile, “ It is true, Greeks, that this is partly done on your account, but mainly on the account of Lucullus.\"", "5671": "One day, when he was supping alone, a single course and a moderate repast had been prepared for him, at which he was angry, and called for the slave whose business it was to look after such matters.", "5672": "The slave said, that he did not suppose that he would want anything costly, as no guest was invited. “", "5673": "What sayest thou ? \" said Lucullus, “ didst thou not know that to-day Lucullus sups with Lucullus ?\"", "5674": "Now, this matter being much talked of in the city, as one might expect, there came up to Lucullus, as he was idling in the Forum, Cicero and Pompeius, of whom Cicero was among his most intimate friends;", "5675": "but between Lucullus and Pompeius there was some difference, arising out of the affair of the command in the Mithridatic war, and yet they were accustomed to associate and talk together frequently in a friendly manner.", "5676": "Accordingly, Cicero saluted him, and asked him how he was disposed to receive visitors, to which Lucullus replied, “ Exceedingly well,\" and invited them to pay him a visit.", "5677": "“We wish,\" said Cicero, “ to sup with you to-day, just in the same way as if preparation were made for yourself only.\"", "5678": "Lucullus began to make some difficulty, and to ask them to allow him to name another day;", "5679": "but they said they would not, nor would they let him speak to his servants, that he might not have the opportunity of ordering anything more than what was preparing for himself.", "5680": "However, at his request, they allowed him just to tell one of his slaves in their presence, that lie would sup on that day in the Apollo;", "5681": "for this was the name of one of his costly apartments.", "5682": "This trick of Lucullus was not understood by his guests;", "5683": "for it is said that to every banqueting-room there was assigned the cost of the feast there, and every room had its peculiar style of preparation and entertainment, so that when the slaves heard in which room their master intended to sup, they also knew what was to be the cost of the supper and the kind of decoration and arrangement.", "5684": "Now, Lucullus was accustomed to sup in the Apollo at the cost of fifty thousand drachmae, and this being the cost of the enter­ tainment on the present occasion, Pompeius and Cicero were surprised at the rapidity with which the banquet had been got ready and the costliness of the entertainment.", "5685": "In this way, then, Lucullus used his wealth, capriciously, just as if it were a captive slave and a barbarian.", "5686": "XLII.", "5687": "What he did as to his collection of books is worth notice and mention.", "5688": "He got together a great number of books which were well transcribed, and the mode in which they were used was more honourable to him than the acquisition of them;", "5689": "for the libraries were open to all, and the walking-places which surrounded them, and the reading rooms were accessible to the Greeks without any restriction, and they went there as to an abode of the Muses, and spent the day there in company with one another, gladly betaking themselves to the libraries from their other occupations.", "5690": "Lucullus himself often spent some time there with the visitors, walking about in the ambu­ latories, and he used to talk there with men engaged in public affairs on such matters as they might choose;", "5691": "and altogether his house was a home and a Greek prytaneum * to those who came to Rome.", "5692": "He was fond of philosophy generally, and well disposed to every sect, and friendly to them all;", "5693": "but from the first he particularly admired and loved the Academy,.", "5694": "not that which is called the New Academy, though the sect was then flourishing by the propagation of the doctrines of Karneades by Philo, but Old Academy, which at that time had for its head a persuasive man and a powerful speaker, Antiochus of Askalon, whom Lucullus eagerly sought for his friend and companion, and opposed to the followers of Philo, of whom Cicero also was one.", "5695": "Cicero wrote an excellent treatise upon the doctrines of this sect, in which he made Lucullus t the speaker in favour of the doctrine of com­ prehension ‡ and himself the speaker on the opposite side.", "5696": "The book is entitled ‘Lucullus.'", "5697": "Lucullus and Cicero were, as I have said, great friends, and associated in their political views, for Lucullus had not entirely withdrawn from public affairs, though he had immediately on his return to Rome surrendered to Crassus and Cato the ambition and the struggle to be the first man in the state and have the greatest power, considering that the struggle was not free from danger and great mortification;", "5698": "for those who looked with jealousy on the power of Pompeius put Crassus and Cato at the head of their party in the Senate, when Lucullus declined to take the lead, but Lucullus used to go to the Forum to support his friends, and to the Senate whenever it was necessary to put a check on any attempt or ambitious design of Pompeius.", "5699": "The arrange­ ments which Pompeius made after his conquest of the kings, Lucullus contrived to nullify, and when Pompeius proposed a distribution of lands * Lucullus with the assist­ ance of Cato prevented it from being made, which drew Pompeius to seek the friendship of Crassus and Cæsar, or rather to enter into a combination with them, and by filling the city with arms and soldiers he got his measures ratified after driving out of the Forum the partisans of Cato and Lucullus.", "5700": "The nobles being indignant at these pro­ ceedings, the party of Pompeius produced one Vettius,* whom, as they said, they had detected in a design on the life of Pompeius.", "5701": "When Vettius was examined before the Senate, he accused others, and before the popular assembly he named Lucullus as the person by whom he had been suborned to murder Pompeius.", "5702": "But nobody believed him, and it soon became clear that the man had been brought forward by the partisans of Pompeius to fabricate a false charge, and to criminate others, and the fraud was made still more apparent, when a few days after the dead body of Vettius was thrown out of the prison;", "5703": "for, though it was given out that he died a natural death t there were marks of strangulation and violence on the body, and it was the opinion that he had been put to death by those who suborned him.", "5704": "XLIII.", "5705": "This induced Lucullus still more to with­ draw from public affairs;", "5706": "and when Cicero was banished from Rome, and Cato ‡ was sent to Cyprus, he retired altogether.", "5707": "Before he died, it is said that his understand­ ing was disordered and gradually failed.", "5708": "Cornelius Nepos says that Lucullus did not die of old age nor of disease, but that his health was destroyed by potions given him by Callisthenes, one of his freedmen, and that the potions were given him by Callisthenes with the view of increasing his master᾽s affection for him, a power which the potions were supposed to have, but they so far disturbed and destroyed his reason, that during his lifetime his brother managed his affairs.", "5709": "However, when Lucullus died, the people grieved just as much as if he had died at the height of his military distinction and his political career, and they flocked together and had his body carried to the Forum by the young men of the highest rank and were proceeding forcibly to have it interred in the Campus Martius where Sulla was interred ;", "5710": "but, as nobody had expected this, and it was not easy to make the requisite preparations, the brother of Lucullus prayed and prevailed on the people to allow the funeral ceremony to take place on the estate at Tusculum, where preparations for it had been made.", "5711": "Nor did he long survive ;", "5712": "but as in age and reputation he came a little after Lucullus, so he died shortly after him, a most affectionate brother.", "5713": "LUCULLUS may be accounted especially fortunate in having died when he did, so that he did not witness the ruin of his country by the civil wars, but departed this life while Rome, though corrupt, was yet a free state.", "5714": "And in this he resembles Kimon more than in any other point;", "5715": "for Kimon also died while the Greeks were at the height of their prosperity, and before they had begun to fight against one another.", "5716": "Indeed, Kimon died in his camp, while acting as commander-in-chief of his country's forces, at the siege of Kitium in Cyprus;", "5717": "not retired home, as if worn out with hard service, nor yet indulging in feasting and wine-drinking, as though that were the end and reward of his military achievements;", "5718": "like that life of eternal drunkenness which Plato sneers at the Orphic school for promising to their disciples as their reward hereafter.", "5719": "A peaceful retirement, and a life of literary leisure, is no doubt a great comfort to a man who has withdrawn himself from taking any active part in politics;", "5720": "but to perform notable exploits with no object in view except to obtain the means of enjoyment, and to pass from the command of armies and the conduct of great wars to a life of voluptuous indolence and luxury seems unworthy of a philosopher of the Academy, or of any who profess to follow the doctrine of Xenokrates, and to be rather fit for a disciple of Epikurus.", "5721": "It is a remarkable circumstance that the youth of Kimon seems to have been licentious and extravagant, while that of Lucullus was spent in a sober and virtuous fashion.", "5722": "Clearly he is the better man that changes for the better;", "5723": "for that nature must be the more excellent in which vice decays, and virtue gains strength.", "5724": "Moreover, both Kimon and Lucullus were wealthy;", "5725": "but they made a very different use of their wealth.", "5726": "We can­ not compare the building of the south wall of the Acropolis of Athens, which was completed with the money won by Kimon in the wars, with the luxurious pavilions and villas washed by the sea which Lucullus erected in Neapolis with the spoils he had taken from the barbarian enemies of Rome.", "5727": "Still less can we compare the generous and popular hospitality of Kimon with the Eastern pro­ fusion and extravagance of Lucullus's table;", "5728": "for Kimon, at a small expense, fed many of his countrymen daily, while the other spent enormous sums to provide luxuries for a small circle of friends.", "5729": "Yet this difference in their habits may have been caused by the times in which they lived;", "5730": "and no one can tell whether Kimon, if he had returned home and spent an old age of indolence and unwarlike repose, might not have even exceeded Lucullus in riotous luxury ;", "5731": "for he was fond of wine and of society, and, as has been told in his life, was greatly addicted to women.", "5732": "But success in war or in politics so delights ambitious natures that they have no time for pursuing minor pleasures.", "5733": "Had Lucullus died at the head of his army, I suppose that the most captious critic could scarcely have found anything to blame in his life.", "5734": "So much, then, for their mode of living.", "5735": "II.", "5736": "Now with regard to their warlike operations, there can be no doubt that both proved themselves to be con­ summate commanders, both by land and by sea;", "5737": "yet, as we are accustomed to call those athletes who have in one day been successful both in wrestling and in the pankratium by the name of notable victors, so Kimon, who in one day won a victory both by sea and by land, thus gaining a double triumph for Greece, deserves to be given some place above all other generals.", "5738": "Moreover, Lucullus was given the chief command by his country, but Kimon won for his country the honour of commanding the other Greek states.", "5739": "Lucullus found his country in command of allies, and by their aid overthrew the enemy, but Kimon found his country acting under the command of others and by his own force of character both made Athens the leading state in Greece and overcame the enemy, for he drove the Persians from the sea, and persuaded the Lacedæmonians to resign their claims to supremacy.", "5740": "If we are to believe it to be the greatest proof of ability in a general to be loved and willingly obeyed by his soldiers, then we see that Lucullus was despised by his soldiers, while Kimon was est, emed and looked up to by his allies, for the soldiers of Luc ullus revolted from him, while the Greek states revolted from Sparta in order to join Kimon.", "5741": "Thus the former was sent out in chief command, and returned home deserted by his men, while the other, though sent out to act as a subordinate under the com­ mand of others, ended by returning as commander-in- chief of them all, having succeeded, in spite of the greatest difficulties, in obtaining three great advantages for his countrymen, namely, having delivered them from the fear of their enemies, having given them authority over their confederates, and established a lasting friendship between them and the Lacedæmonians.", "5742": "Both commanders attempted an enormous task, the conquest of Asia;", "5743": "and both were forced to leave their work unfinished.", "5744": "Kimon was prevented by death, for he died at the head of an army and in the full tide of success;", "5745": "while one cannot altogether think that Lucullus was not to blame for not having tried to satisfy the complaints of his soldiers, which caused them to hate him so bitterly.", "5746": "In this point Lucullus and Kimon are alike;", "5747": "for Kimon was often impeached by his countrymen, who at last banished him by ostracism, in order that, as Plato said, they might not hear his voice for ten years.", "5748": "It seldom happens that men born to command can please the people, or have anything in common with them ;", "5749": "because they cause pain by their attempts to rule and reform them, just as the bandages of a surgeon cause pain to the patient, when by their means he is endeavour­ ing to force back dislocated limbs into their proper position.", "5750": "For this reason, methinks, neither Kimon nor Lucullus deserve blame.", "5751": "III.", "5752": "Lucullus accomplished by far the greater exploits of the two, as he marched beyond the Mount Taurus with an army, being the first Roman who ever did so, and also crossed the river Tigris, and took and burned the royal cities of Asia, Tigranocerta, Kabeira, Sinope, and Nisibis, in the sight of their kings.", "5753": "Towards the north, he went as far as the river Phasis;", "5754": "towards the east as far as Media;", "5755": "and southwards as far as the Red Sea and the kingdom of Arabia, subduing it all to the Roman Empire.", "5756": "He destroyed the power of two mighty kings, and left them in possession of nothing but their lives, forcing them to hide themselves like hunted beasts, in trackless wastes and impassable forests.", "5757": "A great proof of the completeness of Lucullus's success is to be found in the fact that the Persians soon after Kimonos death, attacked the Greeks as vigorously as if they had never been defeated by Kimon at all, and defeated a large Greek army in Egypt;", "5758": "while Tigranes and Mithridates never recovered from the overthrow they sustained from Lucullus.", "5759": "Mithridates was so crushed and broken in strength that he never dared to march out of his en­ trenchments and fight with Pompeius, but retired to Bosporus and died there;", "5760": "while Tigranes of his own accord came into the presence of Pompeius naked and unarmed, and cast down his royal diadem at his feet, not flattering him for the victories which he had won, but for those for which Lucullus had triumphed.", "5761": "He was well pleased to be allowed to resume the ensigns of royalty, and thereby admitted that he had before been deprived of them.", "5762": "He, therefore, is to be held the better general, as he is the better wrestler, who leaves his enemy weakest for his successor to deal with.", "5763": "Moreover, Kimon found the power of the Persians impaired, and their spirit broken by the series of defeats which they had sustained from Themistokles, Pausanias, and Leotychides, and was easily able to conquer men whose hearts were already vanquished:", "5764": "whereas Lucullus met Tigranes when he was full of courage, and in the midst of an unbroken career of victory.", "5765": "As for numbers, one cannot compare the multitudes who were opposed to Lucullus with the troops who were defeated by Kimon.", "5766": "Thus it appears that from whatever point of view we regard them, it is hard to say which was the better man, especially as heaven seems to have dealt so kindly with them both, in telling the one what to do, and the other whats to avoid:", "5767": "so that it seems to appear by the testimony of the gods them­ selves, that they were both men of a noble and godlike nature.", "5768": "LONDON:", "5769": "PRINTED BY
