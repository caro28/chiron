been studying under Cratippus, and that, too, at Athens, you ought to be well furnished with the rules and principles of philosophy, on account of the pre-eminent reputation both of the master and the city, the one of which can improve you by his learning, the other by its examples;", "3": "yet as I, for my own advantage, have always combined the Latin with the Greek, not only in philosophy but even in the practice of speak- ing, I recommend to you the same method, that you may excel equally in both kinds of composition.", "4": "In this respect, indeed, if I mistake not, I was of great service to our countrymen;", "5": "so that not only such of them as are ignorant of Greek learning, but even men of letters, think they have pro- fited somewhat by me both in speaking and reasoning.", "6": "Wherefore you shall study, nay, study as long as you desire, under the best philosopher of this age — and you ought to desire it, as long as you are not dissatisfied with the degree of your improvement;", "7": "but in reading my works, which are not very different from the Peripatetic—because we profess in common to be followers both of Socrates and Plato—as to the subject matter itself, use your own judg- ment;", "8": "but be assured you will, by reading my writings, render your Latin style more copious.", "9": "I would not have it supposed that this is said in ostentation;", "10": "for, while I yield the superiority in philosophy to many, if I claim to myself the province peculiar to an orator-that of speaking with pro- priety, perspicuity, and elegance—I seem, since I have spent my life in that pursuit, to lay claim to it with a certain degree of right.", "11": "Wherefore, my dear Cicero, I most earnestly recommend that you carefully peruse not only my Orations, but even my philosophical works, which have now nearly equalled them in extent;", "12": "for there is in the former the greater force of language, but you ought to cultivate, at the same time, the equable and sober style of the latter.", "13": "And, indeed, I find that it has not happened in the case of any of the Greeks, that the same man has laboured in both departments, and pursued both the former-that of forensic speaking- and the latter quiet mode of argumentation;", "14": "unless, perhaps, Demetrius Phalereus may be reckoned in that number- a refined reasoner, a not very animated speaker, yet of so much sweetness that you might recognize the pupil of Theophrastus.", "15": "How far I have succeeded in both, others must determine;", "16": "certain it is that I have attempted both.", "17": "Indeed, I am of opinion that Plato, had he attempted forensic oratory, would have spoken with copiousness and power;", "18": "and that had Demosthenes retained and repeated the lessons of Plato, he would have delivered them with gracefulness and beauty.", "19": "I form the same judgment of Aristotle and Iso- crates, each of whom was so pleased with his own pursuit that he neglected that of the other.", "20": "II.", "21": "But having resolved at this time to write to you some- what, and a great deal in time to come, I have thought proper to set out with that subject which is best adapted to your years and to my authority.", "22": "For, while many subjects in phi- losopby, of great weight and utility, have been accurately and copiously discussed by philosophers, the most extensive seems to be what they have delivered and enjoined concerning the duties of mankind;", "23": "for there can be no state of life, amidst public or private affairs, abroad or at home-whether you transact anything with yourself or contract anything with another-that is without its obligations.", "24": "In the due discharge of that consists all the dignity, and in its neglect all the disgrace, of life.", "25": "This is an inquiry common to all philosophers;", "26": "for where is the man who will presume to style himself a philosopher, and lay down no rules of duty?", "27": "But there are certain schools which pervert all duty by the ultimate objects of good and evil which they propose.", "28": "For if a man should lay down as the chief good, that which has no connexion with virtue, and measure it by his own interests, and not according to its moral merit;", "29": "if such a man shall act con- sistently with his own principles, and is not sometimes influ- enced by the goodness of his heart, he can cultivate neither friendship, justice, nor generosity.", "30": "In truth, it is impossible for the man to be brave who shall pronounce pain to be the greatest evil, or temperate who shall propose pleasure as the highest good.", "31": "*Though these truths are so self-evident that they require no philosophical discussion, yet they have been treated by me elsewhere.", "32": "I say, therefore, that if these schools are self-consistent, they can say nothing of the moral duties.", "33": "Neither can any firm, permanent, or natural rules of duty be laid down, but by those who esteem virtue to be solely, or by those who deem it to be chiefly, desirable for its own sake.", "34": "The teaching of duties, therefore, is the peculiar study of the Stoics, of the Academics, and the Peripatetics;", "35": "because the sentiments of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Herillus, have been long exploded.", "36": "Yet even those professors would have been entitled to have treated upon the duties of men, had they left us any distinction of things, so that there might have been a path open to the discovery of duty.", "37": "We shall, therefore, upon this occasion, and in this inquiry, chiefly follow the Stoics, not as their expositors, but by drawing, as usual, from their sources, at our own option and judgment, so much and in such manner as we please.*", "38": "I therefore think proper, as my entire argument is on moral obligation, to define what a duty is, a definition which I am surprised has been omitted by Panætius, because every investigation which is rationally undertaken, concerning any subject, ought to set out with a definition, that it may be understood what is the subject of discussion.", "39": "III.", "40": "All questions concerning duty are of two sorts.", "41": "The first relates to the final good;", "42": "the second consists of those rules which arc to regulate the practice of life in all its rela- tions.*", "43": "Examples of the former are as follow:", "44": "-Whether all duties are perfect in themselves ?", "45": "Whether one duty is of more importance than another ?", "46": "together with other ques- tions of the same nature.", "47": "Now the rules for moral duties relate, indeed, to the final good;", "48": "but it is not so perceptible that they do, because they seem chiefly to refer to the regu- lation of ordinary life, and of them we are to treat in this book.", "49": "But there is another division of duty:", "50": "for one is called a mean duty, the other a perfect duty.", "51": "If I mistake not, the complete or perfect duty is the same with what we call a direct one, and by the Greeks is called ϰατόρθωμα.", "52": "As to that duty which is mean they call it ϰαθήϰον, and they thus define those terms.", "53": "Whatever duty is absolute, that they call a perfect duty;", "54": "and they call that duty, for the per- to the authority of any.", "55": "Horace makes a similar profession respecting himself- \" Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri, Quo me cumque rapit tempestas deferor hospes.\"", "56": "First Epist.—First Book, lines 14, 15.", "57": "formance of which a probable reason can be assigned, a mean duty.", "58": "*In the opinion, therefore, of Panætius, there is a threefold consideration for determining our resolution;", "59": "for men doubt whether the thing which falls under their consideration be of itself virtuous or disgraceful, and in this deliberation minds are often distracted into opposite sentiments.", "60": "They then examine and deliberate whether or not the subject o their consideration conduces to the convenience or enjoyment of life, to the improvement of their estate and wealth, to their interest and power, by which they may profit themselves or their relations ;", "61": "all which deliberation falls under the category of utility.", "62": "The third kind of doubtful deliberation", "63": "Is, when an apparent utility seems to clash with moral recti- tude ;", "64": "for when utility hurries us to itself, and virtue, on the other hand, seems to call us back, it happens that the mind is distracted in the choice, and these occasion a double anxiety in deliberation.", "65": "In this division (although an omission is of the worst consequence in divisions of this kind), two things are omitted;", "66": "for we are accustomed to deliberate not only whether a thing be virtuous or shameful in itself, but, of two things that are virtuous, which is the more excellent ?", "67": "And, in like manner, of two things which are profitable which is the more profitable ?", "68": "Thus, it is found that the deliberation, which he considered to be threefold, ought to be distributed into five divisions.", "69": "We must, therefore, first treat of what is virtuous in itself, and that under two heads ;", "70": "in like manner, of what is profitable;", "71": "and we shall next treat of them comparatively.", "72": "IV.", "73": "In the first place, a disposition has been planted by nature in every species of living creatures to cherish them- selves, their life, and body;", "74": "to avoid those things that appear hurtful to them;", "75": "and to look out for and procure whatever is necessary for their living, such as food, shelter, and the like.", "76": "Now the desire of union for the purpose of procreating their own species is common to all animals, as well as a certain degree of concern about what is procreated.", "77": "But the greatest distinction between a man and a brute lies in this, that the latter is impelled only by instinct, and applies itself solely to that object which is present and before it, with very little sensibility to what is past or to come ;", "78": "* but man, because endowed with reason, by which he discerns consequences, looks into the causes of things and their progress, and being acquainted, as it were, with precedents, he compares their analogies, and adapts and connects the present with what is to come.", "79": "It is easy for him to foresee the future direction of all his life, and therefore he prepares whatever is necessary for passing through it.", "80": "Nature, likewise, by the same force of reason, conciliates man to man, in order to a community both of language and of life:", "81": "above all, it implants in them a strong love for their offspring ;", "82": "it impels them to desire that companies and societies should be formed, and that they should mingle in them ;", "83": "and that for those reasons, man should take care to provide for the supply of clothing and of food;", "84": "and that not only for himself, but for his wife, his children, and for all whom he ought to hold dear and to protect.", "85": "This is an affection which arouses the spirit and makes it more strenuous for action.", "86": "The distinguishing property of man is to seareh for and to follow after truth.", "87": "Therefore, when relaxed from our necessary cares and concerns, we then covet to see, to hear, and to learn somewhat;", "88": "and we esteem knowledge of things either obscure or wonderful to be the indispensable means of living happily.*", "89": "From this we understand that truth, simplicity, and candour, are most agreeable to the nature of mankind.", "90": "To this passion for discovering truth, is.", "91": "added a desire to direct;", "92": "for a mind, well formed by na- ture, is unwilling to obey any man but him who lays down rules and instructions to it, or who, for the general advan- tage, exercises equitable and lawful government.", "93": "From this proceeds loftiness of mind, and contempt for worldly inte- rests.", "94": "*Neither is it a mean privilege of nature and reason, that man is the only animal who is sensible of order, of decency, and of propriety, both in acting and speaking.", "95": "In like manner, no other creature perceives the beauty, the gracefulness, and the harmony of parts, in those objects which are discerned by the sight.", "96": "An analogous perception to which nature and reason convey from the sight to the mind;", "97": "and consider that beauty, regularity, and order in counsels and actions should be still more preserved.", "98": "She is cautious not to do aught that is indecent or effeminate, or to act or think wantonly in any of our deliberations or deeds.", "99": "The effect and result of all this produces that honestum which we are now in search of;", "100": "that virtue which is honourable even without being ennobled;", "101": "and of which we may truly say, that even were it praised by none it would be commendable in itself.", "102": "V. My Son Marcus, you here perceive at least a sketch, and, as it were, the outline of virtue;", "103": "which, could we perceive her with our eyes,† would, as Plato says, kindle a wonderful love of wisdom.", "104": "But whatever is virtuous arises from some one of those four divisions:", "105": "for it consists either in sagacity and the perception of truth;", "106": "or in the preservation of human society, by giving to every man his due, and by observing the faith of contracts;", "107": "or in the greatness and firmness of an elevated and unsubdued mind;", "108": "or in observing order and regularity in all our words and in all our actions, in which consists moderation and temperance.", "109": "Though these four divisions are connected and interwoven with one another, yet certain kinds of duties arise from each of them.", "110": "As, for instance, in that part which I first de- scribed, and under which I comprehend sagacity or wisdom, consists the search after and discovery of truth;", "111": "and this is the characteristic function of that virtue:", "112": "for the man who is most sagacious in discovering the real truth in any subject, and who can, with the greatest perspicacity and quickness, both see and explain the grounds of it, is justly esteemed a man of the greatest understanding and discernment.", "113": "From hence it follows that truth is, as it were, the subject matter which this faculty handles, and on which it employs itself.", "114": "As to the other three virtues, they necessarily consist in acquiring and preserving those things with which the conduct of life is connected, in order to preserve the community and relations of mankind, and to display that excellence and greatness of soul, which exhibits itself as well in acquiring resources and advantages both for ourselves and for our friends, as, still more conspicuously, in prop rly disregarding them.", "115": "As to order, resolution, moderation, and the like, they come into that rank of virtues which require not only an operation of the mind, but a certain degree of personal activity;", "116": "for it is in observing order end moderation in those things which constitute the objects of active life, that we shall preserve virtue and decency.", "117": "VI.", "118": "Now, of the four divisions under which I have ranged the nature and essence of virtue, that which consists in the knowledge of truth principally affects the nature of man.", "119": "For all of us are impelled and carried along to the love of knowledge and learning, in which we account it glorious to excel, but consider every slip, mistake, ignorance, and de- ception in it, to be hurtful and shameful.", "120": "In this pursuit, which is both natural and virtuous, two faults are to be avoided.", "121": "The first is, the regarding things which we do not know as if they were understood by us, and thence rashly giving them our assent.*", "122": "And he that wishes, as every man ought to wish, to avoid this error, must devote both his time and nis industry to the study of things.", "123": "The other fault is, that some people bestow too much study and pains upon things that are obscure,* difficult, and even immaterial in themselves.", "124": "When those faults are avoided, all the pains and care a man bestows upon studies that are virtuous in themselves, and worthy of his knowledge, will be deservedly commended.", "125": "Thus we have heard how Caius Sulpiciust ex- celled in astronomy, and Sextus Pompeius, to my own know- ledge, in mathematics;", "126": "many also in logic, and more in the civil law, all which are arts that serve to investigate truth, in the pursuit of which our duty forbids us to be diverted from transacting our business, because the whole glory of virtue consists in activity.", "127": "Yet this is often intermitted, and frequent are our returns to our studies.", "128": "Then there is an incessant working of the mind, which, without our taking pains, is sufficient to keep us in the practice of thinking.", "129": "Now, all our thoughts, and every motion of the mind, should be devoted either to the forming of plans for virtuous actions, and such as belong to a good and a happy life, or else to the pursuits of science and knowledge.", "130": "I have now treated of at least the first source of duty.", "131": "VII.", "132": "Now, as to the other three, the most extensive system is that by which the mutual society of mankind, and, as it were, the intercourse of life, is preserved.", "133": "Of this there are two parts:", "134": "justice, in which virtue displays itself with the most distinguished lustre, and from which men are termed good;", "135": "and allied to this, beneficence, which may likewise be termed benevolence, or liberality.", "136": "Now, the chief province of justice is, that no person injure another, unless he is pro- voked* by suffering wrong;", "137": "next, that public property be appropriated to public, and private to individual, use.", "138": "Now, by nature no property is private, but dependent either on ancient possession (as when men formerly came into unoccupied territories);", "139": "or victory (as when they have taken possession of it in war);", "140": "or public constitution, contract, terms, or lot.", "141": "By those, the land of Arpinum is regarded as belonging to the Arpinates;", "142": "the Tusculan, to the Tusculans.", "143": "The like division holds with regard to matters of private property.", "144": "Thus, as every man holds his own, each should possess that portion which fell to his share of those things that by nature were common ;", "145": "and it follows, that no man can covet another's property without violating the laws of humau society.", "146": "†But (as has been strikingly said by Plato) we are not born for ourselves alone, and our country claims her share, and our friends their share of us ;", "147": "and, as the Stoics hold, all that the earth produces is created for the use of mau, so men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutually do good to one another;", "148": "in this we ought to take nature for our guide, to throw into the public stock the offices of general utility by a reciprocation of duties ;", "149": "sometimes by receiving, sometimes by giving, and sometimes to cement human society by arts, by industry, and by our resources.", "150": "Now the foundation of justice is faithfulness, which is a perseverance and truth in all our declarations and in all our promises.", "151": "Let us therefore (though some people may think it over nice) imitate the Stoics, who curiously examine whence terms are derived, and consider that the wordfides, or faith- fulness, is no other than a performance of what we have promised.*", "152": "But there are two kinds of injustice;", "153": "the first is of those who offer an injury, the second of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not.", "154": "For if a man, prompted either by anger or any sudden perturbation, unjustly assaults another man, such a one seems as it were to lay violent hands on one's ally ;", "155": "and the man who does not repel or withstand the injury, if he can, is as much to blame as if he deserted the cause of his parents, his friends, or his country.", "156": "Those wrongs, however, which are inflicted for the very purpose of doing an injury, often proceed from fear ;", "157": "as for instance, when a man who is contriving to injure another is afraid, unless he executes what he is meditating, that he may himself sustain some disadvantage ;", "158": "but the great incentive to doing wrong is to obtain what one desires, and in this crime avarice is the most pervading motive.", "159": "VIH.", "160": "Now riches are sought after, both for the necessary purposes of life and for the enjoyment of pleasure.", "161": "But in men of greater minds the coveting of money is with a view to power and to the means of giving gratification.", "162": "As M. Crassus lately used to declare, that no man who wanted to have a direction in the government had money enough, unless by the interest of it he could maintain an army.", "163": "Mag- nificent equipages, likewise, and a style of living made up of elegance and abundance give delight, and hence the desire for money becomes boundless.", "164": "Nor indeed is the mere desire to improve one's private fortune, without injury to another, deserving of blame ;", "165": "but injustice must ever be avoided.", "166": "But the main cause why most men are led to a forgetful- ness of justice is their falling into a violent ambition after empire, honours, and glory.", "167": "For what Ennius observes, that \"", "168": "No social bonds, no public faith remains Inviolate ;", "169": "\"— has a still more extensive application ;", "170": "for where the object of ambition is of such a nature as that several cannot ob- tain pre-eminence, the contest for it is generally so violent, that nothing can be more difficult than to preserve the sacred ties of society.", "171": "This was shown lately in the presumption of C. Coesar, who, in order to obtain that direction in the government which the wildness of his imagination had planned out, violated all laws, divine and human.", "172": "But what is deplorable in this matter is, that the desire after honour, empire, power, and glory, is generally most prevalent in the greatest soul and the most exalted genius ;", "173": "* for which reason every crime of that sort is the more carefully to be guarded against.", "174": "But in every species of injustice it is a very material question, whether it is committed through some agitation of passion, which commonly is short-lived and tem- porary, or from deliberate, prepense, malice;", "175": "for those things which proceed from a short, sudden fit, are of slighter moment than those which are inflicted by

their duty towards them.", "179": "They are either unwilling to encounter enmity, toil, or expense ;", "180": "or, perhaps, they do it through negligence, listlessness, or lazi- ness ;", "181": "or they are so embarrassed in certain studies and pursuits, that they suffer those they ought to protect to be neglected.", "182": "Hence we must take care lest Plato's observa- tion with respect to

others value, and which mankind are wont to contend for amongst themselves.\"", "185": "For, while they abstain from hurting any by the infliction of injury, they indeed assert one species of honesty or justice, but they fail in another;", "186": "because, being entangled in the pursuits of learn- in-, they abandon those they ought to protect.", "187": "Some, therefore, think that they would have no concern with the government unless they were forced to it;", "188": "but still, it would be more just that it should be done voluntarily;", "189": "for an action which is intrinsically right is only morally good in so far as it is voluntary.*", "190": "There are others who, either from a desire to improve their private fortune, or from some per- sonal resentments, pretend that they mind their own affairs only that they may'appear not to do wrong to another.", "191": "Now such persons are free from one kind of injustice, but fall into another ;", "192": "because they abandon the fellowship of life by employing in it none of their zeal, none of their labour, none of their abilities.", "193": "Having thus stated the two kinds of dis- honesty or injustice, and assigned the motives for each kind, and settled previously the considerations by which justice is limited, we shall easily (unless we are extremely selfish) be able to form a judgment of our duty on every occasion.", "194": "For, to concern ourselves in other people's affairs is a delicate matter.", "195": "Yet Chremes, a character in Terence, thinks, that there is nothing which has a relation to mankind in which he has not a concern.†", "196": "Meanwhile, because we have the quicker perception and sensation of whatever happens favourably or untowardly to ourselves than to others, which we see as it were at a greater distance, the judgment we form of them is very different from what we form of ourselves.", "197": "Those therefore are wise monitors who teach us to do nothing of which we are doubtful, whether it is honest or unjust ;", "198": "for whatever is honest manifests itself by its own lustre, but doubt implies the entertainment of injustice.", "199": "X.", "200": "But occasions frequently happen in which those duties which are most worthy of an honest, and of such as we call a worthy man, are altered and changed to their contraries.", "201": "For example, to return a deposit, to perform a promise, and other matters that are relative to truth and honesty, some- times alter so, that it is just they should not be observed ;", "202": "for it is proper to have recourse to those fundamentals of honesty which I laid down in the commencement:", "203": "in the first place, that of injuring no person ;", "204": "and, secondly, that of being sub- servient to the public good.", "205": "When these conditions are altered by circumstances, the moral obligation, not being in- variably identical, is similarly altered.", "206": "A promise, as a paction, may happen to be made, the performance of which may be prejudicial either to the party promising, or to the party to whom the promise is made.", "207": "For (as we see in the play) had not Neptune performed his promise to Theseus, the latter would not have been bereaved of his son, Hippolytus ;", "208": "for it is recorded, that of three wishes to be granted him, the third, which he made in a passion, was the death of Hippolytus, which, having been granted, he sunk into the most dreadful distress.", "209": "Therefore, you are not to perform those promises which may be prejudicial to the party to whom you promise, nor if they may be more hurtful to you than they can be serviceable to him.", "210": "It is inconsistent with our duty that the greater obligation should be postponed to the less.", "211": "For instance, suppose you should promise to appear as the advocate of another person while his cause is depending:", "212": "now, if your son was to be seized violently ill in the meantime, it would be no breach of duty in you not to perform what you promise ;", "213": "the other person would rather depart from his duty if he should complain that he had been abandoned.", "214": "Who, then, does not see that a man is not bound by those promises which he makes either when coerced by fear,* or seduced by deceit ?", "215": "Many such promises are cancelled by the edict of the prætor's court, some by the laws;", "216": "for very often wrongs arise through a quirk, and through a too artful but fraudulent construction of the law.", "217": "Hence, \" the rigour of law is the rigour of injustice,\" is a saying that has now passed into a proverb.", "218": "Many injuries of this kind happen even in state affairs:", "219": "thus, when a general had con- cluded a truce with his enemy for thirty days, yet ravaged that enemy's territories every night, because the truce was only for so many days, not for the nights.", "220": "Nor, indeed, if it is true, is the conduct of our countryman, Quintus Fabius Labeo, to be approved of, or whoever he was (for I have the story only by report), who, being appointed an arbiter by the senate to settle a boundary between the people of Nola and those of Naples, counselled each of those people separately to do nothing covetously, and that each ought rather to draw back than advance.", "221": "Both of them taking this advice, a space of unoccupied ground was left in the middle.", "222": "He, therefore, adjudged to each people the boundary to which they had confined themselves, and all that was in the middle to the people of

"228": "Now, in government the laws of war are to be most especially observed;", "229": "for since there are two manners of disputing, one by debating, the other by fighting, though the former characterises men, the latter, brutes, if the former cannot be adopted, recourse must be had to the latter.", "230": "Wars, therefore, are to be undertaken for this end, that we may live in peace without being injured;", "231": "but when we obtain the victory, we must preserve those enemies who behaved without cruelty or inhumanity during the war:", "232": "for example, our forefathers received, even as members of their state, the Tuscans, the .AEqui, the Volscians, the Sabines, and the Hernici, but utterly destroyed Carthage and Nu- mantia.", "233": "I am unwilling to mention Corinth;", "234": "but I believe they had some object in it, and particularly they were induced to destroy it, lest the advantages of its situation should invite the inhabitants to make war in future times.", "235": "In my opinion, we ought always to consult for peace, which should have in it nothing of perfidy.", "236": "Had my voice been followed on this head, we might still have had some form of government (if not the best), whereas now we have none.", "237": "And, while we are bound to exercise consideration toward those whom we have conquered by force, so those should be received into our protection who throw themselves upon the honour of our general, and lay down their arms, even though the battering rams should have struck their walls.", "238": "In which matter justice was cultivated with so much care among our countrymen, that it was a custom among our ancestors that they who received under their protection cities, or nations conquered in war, became their patrons.", "239": "Now, the justice of war was most religiously pointed out by the fecial law of the Romans.", "240": "From this it may be understood that no war is just unless it is undertaken to reclaim property,* or unless it is solemnly denounced and proclaimed beforehand.", "241": "Popilius, as general, held a province where Cato's son served in his army.", "242": "It happened that Popilius thought proper to disband one legion ;", "243": "he dismissed, at the same time, Cato's son, who was serving in that legion.", "244": "When, however, through love of a military life, he remained in the army, his father wrote to Popilius, that if he suffered him to continue in the service he should, for a second time bind him by the military oath ;", "245": "because the obligation of the former having been annulled, he could not lawfully fight with the enemy.", "246": "So very strict was their observance of laws in making war.", "247": "There is extant a letter of old Cato to his soil on this occasion, in which he writes, \" That he heard he had got his discharge from the consul, while he was serving as a soldier in Macedonia, during the war with Perseus.", "248": "He, therefore, enjoins him to take care not to enter upon action ;", "249": "for he declares that it is not lawful for a man who is not a soldier to fight with an enemy.", "250": "XII.", "251": "And, indeed, there is another thing that I should observe, that he who ought properly be termed perduellis, that is, a stubborn foe, is called a hostis, and thereby the softness of the appellation lessens the horror of the thing ;", "252": "for by our ancestors he was called hostis whom we now call a stranger.", "253": "This the twelve tables demonstrate:", "254": "as in the words, \"a day appointed for the hostis to plead;", "255": "\" and again, \"a Roman's right of property, as against a hostis, never terminates.\"", "256": "What can exceed the gentleness of this, to call those with whom you were at war by so soft an appellation ?", "257": "It is true that length of time has affixed a harsher significa- tion to this word, which has now ceased to be applied to the stranger, and remains peculiar to him who carries arms against us.", "258": "Meanwhile, when we fight for empire, and when we seek glory in arms, all those grounds of war which I have already enumerated to be just ones, must absolutely be in force.", "259": "But wars that are founded upon the glory of con- quest alone, are to be carried on with less rancour;", "260": "for, as we treat a fellow citizen in a different manner as a foe, than we do as an antagonist;", "261": "-as with the latter the struggle is for glory and power, as the former for life and reputation;", "262": "- thus we fought against the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians as against enemies, the question being not who should com- mand but who should exist;", "263": "but we fought for empire against the Latines, the Sabines, the Samnites, the Cartha- ginians, and Pyrrhus.", "264": "The Carthaginians, 'tis true, were faithless, and Hannibal was cruel, but the others were better principled.", "265": "The speech of Pyrrhus about ransoming the captives is a noble one:", "266": "-In war not crafty, but in battle bold, No wealth I value, and I spurn at gold.", "267": "Be steel the only metal shall decree", "268": "The fate of empire, or to you or me.",

sentiment is truly noble, and worthy the descendant of the Æacidæ.", "271": "XIII.", "272": "Nay, if even private persons should, induced by circumstances, make a promise to the enemy, even in this fidelity should be observed.", "273": "Thus Regulus, when be was made a prisoner by the Carthaginians in the first Punic war, being sent to Rome to treat of an exchange of prisoners, he swore that he would return.", "274": "The first thing he did when he came to Rome was to deliver his opinion in the senate that the prisoners should not be restored;", "275": "and after that, when he was detained by his relations and friends, he chose to deliver himself up to a cruel death rather than to falsify his word to the enemy.", "276": "But in the second Punic war, after the battle of Cannæ, Hannibal sent ten Romans to Rome, under an oath that they would return to him unless they procured the prisoners to be ransomed ;", "277": "but the censors disfranchised, as long as they lived, all of them that were perjured, as well as him who had devised a fraudulent evasion of his oath.", "278": "For when, by the leave of Hannibal, he had left the camp, he returned soon after, to say that he had forgotten something;", "279": "and then again leaving the camp he considered himself free from the obligations of his oath, which he was with regard to the words but not the meaning of them;", "280": "for in a promise, what you thought, and not what you said, is always to be consi- dered.*", "281": "But our forefathers set us a most eminent example of justice towards an enemy;", "282": "for when a deserter from Pyrrhus offered to the senate to despatch that prince by poison, the senate and C. Fabricius delivered the traitor up to Pyrrhus.", "283": "Thus they disapproved of taking off by treachery an enemy who was powerful, and was carrying on against them an aggressive war.", "284": "Enough has now been said respecting the duties connected with warfare ;", "285": "but we must bear in mind, that justice is due even to the lowest of mankind ;", "286": "and nothing can be lower than the condition and fortune of a slave.", "287": "And yet those prescribe wisely who enjoin us to put them upon the same footing as hired labourers, obliging them to do their work, but giving them their dues.", "288": "Now, as injustice may be done two ways, by force or fraud ;", "289": "fraud being the property of a fox, force that of a lion ;", "290": "both are utterly repugnant to society, but fraud is the more detestable.", "291": "But in the whole system of villainy, none is more capital than that of the men, who, when they most deceive, so manage as that they may seem to be virtuous men.", "292": "Thus much, then, on the subject of justice.", "293": "XIV.", "294": "Let me now, as I proposed, speak of beneficence and liberality, virtues that are the most agreeable to the nature of man, but which involve many precautionary con- siderations.", "295": "For, in the first place, we are to take care lest our kindness should hurt both those whom it is meant to assist, and others.", "296": "In the next place, it ought not to exceed our abilities;", "297": "and it ought to be rendered to each in proportion to his worth.", "298": "This is the fundamental standard of justice to which all these things should be referred.", "299": "And they who do kindnesses which prove of disservice to the person they pretend to oblige, should not be esteemed beneficent nor generous, but injurious sycophants.", "300": "And they who injure one party in order to be liberal to another, are guilty of the same dishonesty as if they should appropriate to themselves what belongs to another.", "301": "*Now many, and they especially who are the most ambitious after grandeur and glory, rob one party to enrich another ;", "302": "and account themselves generous to their friends if they enrich them by whatever means.", "303": "This is so far from being consistent with, that nothing can be more contrary to, our duty.", "304": "We should therefore take care to practise that kind of generosity that is serviceable to our friends, but hurtful to none.", "305": "Upon this principle, when Lucius Sylla and Caius Cæsar took property from its just owners and transferred it to strangers, in so doing they ought not to be accounted generous ;", "306": "for nothing can be generous that is not at the same time just.", "307": "Our next part of circumspection is, that our generosity never should exceed our abilities.", "308": "For they who are more generous than their circumstances admit of are, first, guilty in this, that they wrong their relations;", "309": "because they bestow upon strangers those means which they might, with greater justice, give or leave to those who are nearest to them.", "310": "Now a generosity of this kind is generally attended with a lust to ravish and to plunder, in order to be furnished with the means to give away.", "311": "For it is easy to observe, that most of them are not so much by nature generous, as they are misled by a kind of pride to do a great many things in order that they may seem to be generous ;", "312": "which things seem to spring not so much from good will as from osten- tation.", "313": "Now such a simulation is more nearly allied to duplicity than to generosity or virtue.", "314": "The third head proposed was, that in our generosity we should have regard to merit;", "315": "and, consequently, examine both the morals of the party to whom we are generous, and his disposition towards us, together with the general good of society, and how far he may have already contributed to our own interest.", "316": "Could all those considerations be united, it were the more desirable ;", "317": "but the object in whom is united the most numerous and the most important of them, ought to have the greatest weight with us.XV.", "318": "But as we live not with men who are absolutely perfect and completely wise, but with men who have great merit if they possess the outlines of worth, we are, I think, from thence to infer, that no man is to be neglected in whom there appears any indication of virtue ;", "319": "and that each should be regarded in proportion as he is adorned with the milder virtues of modesty, temperance, and that very justice of which I have so largely treated.", "320": "For fortitude and greatness of spirit is commonly too violent in a man who is not com- pletely wise and perfect;", "321": "but the aforesaid virtues seem to belong more to a good man.", "322": "Having said thus much of morals ;", "323": "with regard to the kindness which a person expresses for us, our first duty is, to perform the most for him by whom we are most beloved.", "324": "Now we are to judge of kindness, not like children, by a sort of ardour of affection, but by its stability and constancy.", "325": "But if its merits are such, that we are not to court but to requite the kindness, the greater ought our care to be;", "326": "for there is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kind- ness.", "327": "Now if, as Hesiod enjoins, we ought, if it is in our power, to repay what we have received for mere use with interest, how ought we to act when called upon by kindness ?", "328": "Are we not to imitate those fertile fields which yield far more than they have received ?", "329": "For, if we readily oblige those who we are in hopes will serve us, how ought we to behave towards those who have served us already ?", "330": "For as generosity is of two kinds, the one conferring a favour, the other repaying it, whether we confer it or not is at our own option, but the not repaying it is not allowable in a good man, provided he can do so without injury to any.", "331": "Now there are distinctions to be made as to the benefits received ;", "332": "and it is clear that the greatest return is due in each case to the greatest obligation.", "333": "Meanwhile, we are above all things to consider the spirit, the zeal, and the meaning with which a favour is conferred.", "334": "For many confer numerous favours with a sort of recklessness, without any judgment or prin- ciple, upon all mankind promiscuously, or influenced by sudden perturbation of mind, as if by a hurricane :", "335": "such favours are not to be esteemed so highly as those which result from judgment, consideration, and consistency.", "336": "But in conferring or requiting kindness, the chief rule of our duty ought to be, if all other circumstances are equal, to confer most upon the man who stands in greatest need of assistance.", "337": "The reverse of this is practised by the generality, who direct their greatest services to the man from whom they hope the most, though he may stand in no need of them.", "338": "XVI.", "339": "Now society and alliances amongst men would be best preserved if the greatest kindness should be manifested where there is the nearest relation.", "340": "But we ought to go higher, if we are to investigate the natural principles of intercourse and community amongst men.", "341": "The first is, that which is perceived in the society of the whole human race.", "342": "and of this the bond is speech and reason, which by teaching, learning, communicating, debating, and judging, conciliate men together, and bind them into a kind of natural society.", "343": "There is nothing in which we differ more from the nature of brutes than in tills ;", "344": "for we very often allow them to have courage, as for instance, horses and lions;", "345": "but we never admit that they possess justice, equity, and goodness ;", "346": "because they are void of reason and speech.", "347": "Now this is the kind of society that is most extensive with mankind amongst themselves, and it goes through all;", "348": "for here a community of all things that nature has produced for the common use of mankind is preserved, so as that they may be possessed in the manner prescribed by laws and civil statutes:", "349": "of which laws themselves some are to be observed in accordance with the Greek proverb, \"that all things amongst friends are to be in common.\"", "350": "Now this community consists of things which are of that nature which, though placed by Ennius under one head, may be applied to many. \" He (says that author) who kindly shows the bewildered traveller the right road.", "351": "does as it were light his lamp by his own ;", "352": "which affords none the less light to himself after it has lighted the other.", "353": "\"By this single example he sufficiently enjoins on us to perform, even to a stranger, all the service we can do without detriment to ourselves.", "354": "Of which service the following are common illustrations :", "355": "\"That we are to debar no man from the running stream;", "356": "\" \"", "357": "That we are to suffer any who desire it to kindle fire at our fire \"", "358": "That we are to give faithful counsel to a person who is in doubt:", "359": "\" all which are particulars that are serviceable to the receiver without being detrimental to the bestower.", "360": "We are therefore to practise them, and be constantly contributing somewhat to the common good.", "361": "As the means, however, of each par- ticular person are very confined and the numbers of the indigent are boundless, our distributive generosity ought still to be bounded by the principle of Ennius,—\"it nevertheless gives light to one's self,\"—that we may still be possessed of the means to be generous to our friends.", "362": "XVII.", "363": "Now the degrees of human society are many.", "364": "For, to quit the foregoing unbounded kind, there is one more confined, which consists of men of the same race, nation, and language, by which people are more intimately connected among themselves.", "365": "A more contracted society than that consists of men inhabiting the same city;", "366": "for many things are in common among fellow citizens, such as their forum, their temples, their porticoes, their streets, their laws, their rites, their courts of justice, their trials, not to mention their customs, and intimacies, with a great number of particular dealings and intercourses of numbers with numbers.", "367": "There is a still more contracted degree of society, which is that of relatives;", "368": "and this closes, in a narrow point, the unbounded general association of the human race.", "369": "For, as it is a common natural principle among all animated beings that they have a desire to propagate their own species, the first principle of society consists in the marriage tie, the next in children, the next in a family within one roof, where everything is in common.", "370": "This society gives rise to the city, and Is, as it were, the nursery of the commonwealth.", "371": "Next follows the connexion of brotherhood, next that of cousins, in their different degrees;", "372": "and, when they grow too numerous to be contained under one roof, they are trans- planted to different dwellings, as it were to so many colonies.", "373": "Then follow marriages and alliances, whence spring more numerous relationships.", "374": "The descendants, by this propa- gation, form the origin of commonwealths;", "375": "but the ties and affections of blood bind mankind by affection.", "376": "*For there is something very powerful in having the monu- merits of our ancestors the same, in practising the same religious rites, and in having the same places of interment.", "377": "But amongst all the degrees of society, none is more excel- lent, none more stable, than when worthy meu, through a similarity of manners, are intimately connected together;", "378": "for, as I have often said, even when we discern the honestum in another it touches us, and makes us friends to the man in whom it resides.", "379": "Now, though virtue of every kind attracts and charms us to the love of those who possess it, yet that love is strongest that is effected by justice and generosity.", "380": "For nothing is more lovely, nothing is more binding, than a similarity of good dispositions;", "381": "* because amongst those whose pursuits and pleasures are the same, every man is pleased as much with another as he is with himself, and that is effected which Pythagoras chiefly contemplates in friendship, \"that many become one.\"", "382": "A strong community is likewise effected by good offices mutually conferred and received;", "383": "and, provided these be reciprocal and agreeable, those amongst whom they happen are bound together in close association.", "384": "But when you view everything with reason and reflection, of all connections none is more weighty, none is more dear, than that between every individual and his country.", "385": "Our parents are dear to us;", "386": "our children, our kinsmen, our friends, are dear to us;", "387": "but our country comprehends alone all the endearments of us all.", "388": "For which what good man would hesitate to die if he could do her service ?", "389": "The more execrably unnatural, therefore, are they who wound their country by every species of guilt, and who are now, and have been, employed in her utter destruction.", "390": "But were a computation or comparison set up, of those objects to which our chief duty should be paid, the principal are our country and our parents, by whose services we are laid under the strongest obligations;", "391": "the next are our children and entire family, who depend upon us alone, without having any other refuge;", "392": "the next our agreeable kinsmen, who generally share our fortuue in common.", "393": "The necessary supports of life, therefore, are due chiefly to those I have already mentioned ;", "394": "but the mutual intercourses of life, counsels, discourses, ex- hortations, consultations, and even sometimes reproofs, flourish chiefly in friendships, and those friendships are the most agreeable that are cemented by a similarity of manners.", "395": "XVIII.", "396": "But in performing all those duties we are care- fully to consider what is most necessary to each, and what every one of them could or could not attain even without us.", "397": "Thus the relative claims of relationship and of circumstances will not always be identical.", "398": "Some duties are owing to some more than to others.", "399": "For instance, you are sooner to help your neighbour to house his corn, than your brother or your friend;", "400": "but if a cause be on trial, you are to take part with your kinsman, or your friend, rather than with your neigh- bour.", "401": "These considerations, therefore, and the like, ought to be carefully observed in every duty;", "402": "and custom and practice should be attained, that we may be able to be correct assessors of our duties, and, by adding or subtracting, to strike the balance, by which we may see the proportion to which every party is entitled.", "403": "But as neither physicians, nor generals, nor orators, how- ever perfect they may be in the theory of their art, can ever perform anything that is highly praiseworthy, without expe- rience and practice, so rules have indeed been laid down for the observation of duties, as I myself am doing;", "404": "but the import- ance of the matter demands experience and practice.", "405": "I have now, I think, sufficiently treated of the manner in which the honestum, which gives the fitness to our duties, arises from those matters that come within the rights of human society.", "406": "It must be understood, however, at the same time, that when the four springs from which virtue and honesty, arise are laid open, that which is done with a lofty spirit, and one which scorns ordinary interests, appears the most noble.", "407": "Therefore the most natural of all reproaches is somewhat of the following kind:", "408": "- Young men, ye carry but the souls of women;", "409": "That woman of a man.", "410": "Or somewhat of the following kind:", "411": "- Salmacis, give me spoils without toil or danger.", "412": "On the other hand, in our praises, I know not how it is, but actions performed with magnanimity, with fortitude, and virtue, we eulogize in a loftier

Publius, Marcus Marcellus, and a great many others.", "415": "Indeed, the Roman people in general are distinguished above all by elevation of spirit;", "416": "and their fondness for military glory is shown by the fact that we generally see their statues dressed in warlike habits.", "417": "XIX.", "418": "But that magnanimity which is discovered in toils and dangers, if it be devoid of justice, and contend not for the public good, but for selfish interest, is blameable ;", "419": "for, so far from being a mark of virtue, it is rather that of a barbarity which is repulsive to all humanity.", "420": "By the Stoics, therefore, fortitude is rightly defined, when they call it valour fighting on the side of justice.\"", "421": "No man, there- fore, who has acquired the reputation of fortitude, attained his glory by deceit and malice;", "422": "for nothing that is devoid of justice can be a virtue.", "423": "It is, therefore, finely said by Plato, that not only the knowledge that is apart from justice deserves the appellation of cunning rather than wisdom, but also a mind that is ready to encounter danger, if it is animated by private interest, and not public utility, deserves the character of audaciousness rather than of fortitude.", "424": "We, therefore, require that all men of courage and magnanimity should be at the same time men of virtue and of simplicity, lovers of truth, and by no means deceitful;", "425": "for these qualities are the main glory of justice.", "426": "But there is one painful consideration, that obstinacy, and an undue ambition for power, naturally spring up from this elevation and greatness of spirit;", "427": "for, as Plato tells us, the entire character of the Lacedemonians was inflamed with the desire of conquest.", "428": "Thus the man who is most distin- guished by his magnanimity, is most desirous of being the leading, or rather the only potentate of all.", "429": "Now, it is a difficult matter, when you desire to be superior to all others, to preserve that equability which is the characteristic or justice.", "430": "Hence it is that such men will not suffer themselves to be thwarted in a debate, nor by any public and lawful authority;", "431": "and in public matters they are commonly guilty of corruption and faction, in order to grasp at as great power as possible;", "432": "and they choose to be superior by means of force, rather than equals by justice.", "433": "But the more diffi- cult the matter is, it is the more glorious;", "434": "for there is no conjuncture which ought to be unconnected with justice.", "435": "They, therefore, who oppose, not they who commit, in- justice are to be deemed brave and magnanimous.", "436": "Now, genuine and well-considered magnanimity judges that the honestum, which is nature's chief aim, consists in realities and not in mere glory, and rather chooses to be than to seem pre-eminent:", "437": "for the man who is swayed by the pre- judices of an ignorant rabble is not to be reckoned among the great;", "438": "but the man of a spirit the most elevated, through the desire of glory, is the most easily impelled into acts of injustice.", "439": "This is, indeed, a slippery situation;", "440": "for scarcely can there be found a man who, after enduring trials and encountering dangers, does not pant for popularity as the reward of his exploits.*XX.", "441": "A spirit altogether brave and elevated is chiefly dis- cernible by two characters.", "442": "The first consists in a low estimate of mere outward circumstances, since it is convinced that a man ought to admire, desire, or court nothing but what is virtuous and becoming;", "443": "and that he ought to succumb to no man, nor to any perturbation either of spirit or fortune.*", "444": "The other thing is, that possessed of such a spirit as I have just mentioned, you should perform actions which are great and of the greatest utility, but extremely arduous, full of difficulties and danger both to life and the many things which pertain to life.", "445": "In the latter of those two characters consist all the glory, the majesty, and, I add, the utility;", "446": "but the causes and the efficient means that form great men is in the former, which contains the principles that elevate the soul, and gives it a contempt for temporary considerations.", "447": "Now, this very excel- lence consists in two particulars:", "448": "you are to deem that only to be good that is virtuous;", "449": "and that you be free from all mental irregularity.", "450": "For we are to look upon it as the character of a noble and an elevated soul, to slight all those considerations that the generality of mankind account great and glorious, and to despise them, upon firm and durable principles;", "451": "while strength of mind, and greatness of resolution, are discerned in bearing those calamities which, in the course of man's life, are many and various, so as not to be driven from your na- tural disposition, nor from the dignity of a wise man:", "452": "for it is not consistent that he who is not subdued by fear should be subjugated by passion ;", "453": "nor that he who has shown him- self invincible by toil, should be conquered by pleasure.", "454": "t", "455": "Wherefore, we ought to watch and avoid the love of money:", "456": "for nothing so truly characterizes a narrow, grovelling dispo- sition as to love riches;", "457": "* and nothing is more noble and more exalted than to despise riches if you have them not, and if you have them, to employ them in beneficence and libe- rality.", "458": "†An inordinate passion for glory, as I have already ob- served, is likewise to be guarded against;", "459": "for it deprives us of liberty, the only prize for which men of elevated senti- ments ought to contend.", "460": "Power is so far from being desirable in itself, that it sometimes ought to be refused, and some- times to be resigned.", "461": "We should likewise be free from all disorders of the mind, from all violent passion and fear, as well as languor, voluptuousness, and anger, that we may possess that tranquillity and security which confer alike consistency and dignity.", "462": "Now, many there are, and have been, who, courting that tranquillity which I have mentioned here, have withdrawn themselves from public affairs and taken refuge in retirement.", "463": "Amongst these, some of the noblest and most leading of our philosophers;", "464": "‡ and some persons, of strict and grave dispositions, were unable to bear with the manners either of the people or their rulers;", "465": "and some have lived in the country, amusing themselves with the management of their private affairs.", "466": "Their aim was the same as that of the powerful, that they might enjoy their liberty, without wanting anything or obeying any person;", "467": "for the essence of liberty is to live just as you please.", "468": "XXI.", "469": "Therefore, as the object of those who are ambitious for power, and of those who court retirement, and whom I have just now described, is the same, the former imagine they can attain it if they are possessed of great resources, and the latter, if they can be contented with their own, and with little.", "470": "In this matter, the sentiments of neither are to be absolutely rejected.", "471": "But a life of retirement is more easy, more safe, less tiresome, and less troublesome than any other;", "472": "while the life of those who apply themselves to the affairs of government, and to the management of a state, is more beneficial to mankind, and more conducive to glory and renown.", "473": "Allowances, therefore, are to be made for those who having no management in public matters, with an excellent genius, give themselves up to learning;", "474": "and to those who being hindered by feebleness of health, or for some very weighty reason, retire from affairs of government, and leave to others the power and the honour of the administration:", "475": "but when men, who have no such excuses, say that they despise that power and those offices which most admire, such men are so far from deserving praise that they incur censure.", "476": "It is difficult to condemn their judgment in despising and under- valuing popularity;", "477": "but then they seem to dread the toils and troubles of affronts and repulses as involving ignominy and infamy.", "478": "For some there are who, in opposite matters, are very inconsistent with themselves;", "479": "they spurn most rigidly at pleasure, but they droop in pain;", "480": "they despise glory, but sink under unpopularity;", "481": "and that, too, with no little inconsistency.", "482": "But the men who inherit from nature appliances for government ought, laying aside all excuses, to undertake the discharge of all public offices and the management of state affairs;", "483": "for neither can a state be governed, nor can magna- nimity display itself, by any other means.", "484": "I am not, however, sure whether those who undertake the management of public affairs ought not to be equally distinguished by magnanimity us philosophers, if not more so, and impressed with a con- tempt of common affairs and to possess that tranquillity, that calm of mind, I have so much recommended;", "485": "I mean, if they wish to live without anxiety, with dignity and consistency.", "486": "This may be the more easily practised by philosophers, because in their lives there is less exposed for fortune to strike at;", "487": "because their necessities are more contracted;", "488": "and because, if anything adverse should happen, they cannot fall so heavily.", "489": "It is not, therefore, without reason, that in the mind of those who undertake the management of public affairs, more violent passions are excited, and mightier mat- ters are to be attempted, than by those who are retired;", "490": "they, therefore, ought to possess greater elevation of spirit, and freedom from disquiets.", "491": "But, whoever enters upon public life ought to take care that the question, how far the measure is virtuous, be not his sole consideration, but also how far he may have the means of carrying it into execution.", "492": "In this he is chiefly to take care that through indolence he do not meanly despond, nor through eagerness too much pre- sume.", "493": "Thus, in all affairs, before you undertake them, a diligent preparation should be entered into.", "494": "XXII.", "495": "But, since most persons are of opinion that the achievements of war are more glorious than civil affairs, this judgment needs to be restricted:", "496": "for many, as generally is the case with high minds and enterprising spirits, espe- cially if they are adapted to military life and are fond of warlike achievements, have often sought opportunities of war from their fondness for glory;", "497": "but if we are willing to judge truly, many are the civil employments of greater im- portance, and of more renown, than the military.", "498": "For though Themistocles is justly praised-his name is now more illustrious than that of Solon, and his glorious victory at Salamis is mentioned preferably to the policy of Solon, by which he first confirmed the power of the Areopagus -the one should not be considered more illustrious than the other;", "499": "for the one availed his country only for once-the other is lastingly advantageous;", "500": "because by it the laws of the Athenians, and the institutions of their ancestors, are preserved.", "501": "Now,", "502": "Themistocles could not have stated any respect in which he benefited the Areopagus, but the former might with truth declare that Themistocles had been advan- taged by him;", "503": "for the war was carried on by the counsels of that senate which was constituted by Solon.", "504": "We may make the same observation with regard to Pausanias and Lysander amongst the Lacedemonians ;", "505": "for all the addition of empire which their conquests are supposed to have brought to their country is not to be compared to the laws and economy of Lycurgus ;", "506": "for indeed, owing to these very causes they had armies more subordinate and courageous.", "507": "In my eyes, Marcus Scaurus (who flourished when I was but a boy) was not inferior to Caius Marius;", "508": "nor, after I came to have a concern in the government, Quintus Catulus to Cneius Pompey.", "509": "An army abroad is but of small service unless there be a wise administration at home.", "510": "Nor did that good man and great general, Africanus, perform a more important service to his country when he razed Numantia, than did that private citizen, P. Nasica, when at the same period he killed Tiberius Gracchus.", "511": "An action which it is true was not merely of a civil nature ;", "512": "for it approaches to a military character, as being the result of force and courage ;", "513": "but it was an action performed without an army, and from political considerations.", "514": "That state described by the following line is best for a country, for which I understand that I am abused by the wicked and malicious:", "515": "Arms to the gown, and laurels yield to lore.", "516": "*For, not to mention other persons, when I was at the helm of government did not \"arms yield to the gown?\"", "517": "For never did our country know a time of more threatening danger or more profound tranquillity;", "518": "so quickly, through my counsel and my diligence, did the arms of our most pro- fligate fellow citizens drop of themselves out of their hands.", "519": "What so great exploit as this was ever performed in wai, or what triumph can be compared with it ?", "520": "The inheritance of my glory and the imitation of my actions are to descend to you, my son Marcus, therefore it is allowable for me to boast in writing to you.", "521": "It is, how- ever, certain that Pompey, who was possessed of much military glory, paid this tribute to me, in the hearing of many, that in vain would he have returned to his third triumph, had not my public services preserved the place in which he was to celebrate it.", "522": "The examples of civil courage are therefore no less meritorious than those of mili- tary ;", "523": "and they require a greater share of zeal and labour than the latter.", "524": "XXIII.", "525": "Now all that excellence which springs from a lofty and noble nature is altogether produced by the mental and not by the corporeal powers.*", "526": "Meanwhile, the body ought to be kept in such action and order, as that it may be always ready to obey the dictates of reason and wisdom, in carrying them into execution, and in persevering under hardships.", "527": "But with regard to that honestum we are treating of, it consists wholly in the thoughtful application of the mind ;", "528": "by which the civilians who preside over public affairs are equally serviceable to their country as they who wage wars.", "529": "For it often happens that by such counsels wars are either not entered into, or they are brought to a termination ;", "530": "sometimes they are even undertaken, as the third Punic wale was by the advice of Marcus Cato, whose authority was powerful, even after he was dead.", "531": "Wisdom in determining is therefore preferable tc courage in fighting ;", "532": "but in this we are to take care that we are not swayed by an aversion to fighting rather than by a consideration of expediency.*", "533": "Now in engaging in war we ought to make it appear that we have no other view but peace.", "534": "But the character of a brave and resolute man is not to be ruffled with adversity, and not to be in such confusion as to quit his post, as we say, but to preserve a presence of mind, and the exercise of reason, without departing from his purpose.", "535": "And while this is the charac- teristic of a lofty spirit, so this also is that of a powerful intellect, namely, to anticipate futurity in thought, and to conclude beforehand what may happen on either side, and, upon that, what measures to pursue, and never be surprised so as to say, \"I had not thought of that.\"", "536": "Such are the operations of a genius, capacious and elevated ;", "537": "of such a one as relies on its own prudence and counsel ;", "538": "† but to rush precipitately into the field, and to encounter an enemy with mere physical force has somewhat in it that is barbarous and brutal.",

plundering of cities, great consideration is required that nothing be done rashly, nothing cruelly.*", "542": "And this is the part of a great man, after he has maturely weighed all circumstances, to punish the guilty, to spare the many ;", "543": "and in every state of fortune not to depart from an upright, virtuous conduct.", "544": "For, as you find (as I have already observed) men who prefer military to civil duties, so will you find many of that cast wile look upon dangerous and violent resolutions to be more splendid and more dignified than calm and digested measures.", "545": "We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear irresolute and cowardly ;", "546": "but, at the same time, we should avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than which nothing can be more foolish.", "547": "In encountering dangers, therefore, we are to imitate the practice of the physicians who apply to gentle illnesses gentle medicines, but are forced to apply more desperate and more doubtful cures to more dangerous diseases.", "548": "It is the part of a madman to wish for an adverse tempest in a calm, but of a wise man to find relief against the tempest by what- ever means ;", "549": "and the rather if one incurs more advantage by accomplishing the matter than disadvantage by keeping it in suspense.", "550": "Now the conducting of enterprises is dangerous sometimes to the undertakers, and sometimes to the state;", "551": "and hence some are in danger of losing their lives, some their reputation, and some their popularity.", "552": "But we ought to be more forward to expose our own persons than the general interests to danger, and to be more ready to fight for honour and reputation than for other advantages.", "553": "Though many have been known cheerfully to venture not only their money but their lives for the public;", "554": "yet those very men have refused to suffer the smallest loss of glory even at the request of their country.", "555": "For instance, Calli- cratidas, who, after performing many gallant actions at the head of the Lacedemonian armies, during the Peloponesian war, at last threw everything into confusion by refusing to obey the directions of those who were for removing the fleet from Arginusæ, and not for fighting the Athenians ;", "556": "to whom his answer was, that if the Lacedemonians lost that fleet they could fit out another, but that he could not turn his back without dishonour to himself.", "557": "'Tis true, the blow that followed upon this was not very severe to the Lacedemonians ;", "558": "but it was a deadly one, when, from a fear of public odium, Cleombrotus fought with Epamonidas, and the power of the Lacedemonians perished.", "559": "How preferable was the conduct of Quintus Maximus, of whom Ennius says :", "560": "— “ The man* who saved his country by delay, No tales could move him, and no envy sway;", "561": "And thus the laurels on his honoured brow, In age shall flourish, and with time shall grow.\"", "562": "This is a species of fault which ought also to be avoided in civil matters;", "563": "for there are some men who, from a dread of unpopularity, dare not express their opinions however excellent they may be.XXV.", "564": "All who hope to rise in a state ought strictly to observe two rules of Plato.", "565": "The first is, that they so keep in view the advantage of their fellow citizens as to have reference to it in whatever they do, regardless of their indi- vidual interest.*", "566": "The second is, that their cares be applied to the whole of the state, lest while they are cherishing one part they abandon the others.", "567": "For the administration of government, like a guardianship, ought to be directed to the good of those who confer, and not of those who receive the trust.", "568": "†", "569": "Now, they who consult the interests of one part of a community and neglect another, introduce into the state the greatest of all evils, sedition and discord.", "570": "From this partiality some seem to court the people, some each great man, but few the whole.", "571": "Hence the great discords amongst the Athenians, and in our government not only seditions but the most destructive wars, which every worthy and brave citizen who deserves to rise in the state will avoid and de- test :", "572": "he will give himself entirely up to the service of his country, without regard to riches or to power, and he will watch over the whole so as to consult the good of all, He will even be far from bringing any man into hatred or disgrace, by ill-grounded charges, and he will so closely attach himself to the rules of justice and virtue, that how- ever lie may give offence he will preserve them, and incur death itself rather than swerve from the principles I have laid down.", "573": "Of all evils, ambition and the disputes for public posts are the most deplorable.", "574": "Plato, likewise, on this subject, says very admirably, \" that they who dispute for the management of a state resemble mariners wrangling about who should direct the helm.\"", "575": "He then lays down as a rule that we ought to look upon those as our enemies who take arms against the public, and not those who want to have public affairs directed by their judgment.", "576": "For instance, Publius Africanus and Quintus Metellus differed in opinion, but without animosity.", "577": "Nor, indeed, are those to be listened to who consider that we ought to cherish a bitter resentment against our enemies, and that this is characteristic of a high-minded and brave man;", "578": "for nothing is more noble, nothing more worthy of a great and a good man, than placability and moderation.*'", "579": "Nay, amidst free nations and equality of rights, an equability and loftiness of temper is necessary, to prevent our falling into an idle, disagreeable peevishness, when we are irritated by persons approaching us unseasonably, or preferring to us unreasonable requests.", "580": "Yet this politeness and moderation ought to be so tempered, that for the sake of the interests of the state severity should be employed, otherwise public business could not be carried on.", "581": "Meanwhile, all reprimands and punishments ought to be inflicted without abuse, without regard to the party so punishing or reprimanding, but to the good of the state.", "582": "We ought, likewise, to take care that the punishment be proportioned to the offence, * aDd that some be not punished for doing things for which others are not so much as called to account.", "583": "Above all things, in punishing we ought to guard against passion;", "584": "for the man who is to pronounce a sentence of punishment in a passion, never can preserve that mean between what is too much and too little, which is so justly recommended by the Peripatetics, did they not too much commend the passion of anger, by asserting it to be a useful property of our nature.", "585": "For my part, I think that it ought to be checked under all circumstances ;", "586": "† and it were to be wished that they who preside in government were like the laws, which in punishing are not directed by resentments but by equity.", "587": "XXVI.", "588": "Now, during our prosperity, and while things flow agreeably to our desire, we ought with great care to avoid pride and arrogance;", "589": "for, as it discovers weakness not to bear adversity with equanimity, so also with prosperity.", "590": "That equanimity in every condition of life is a noble attri- bute, and that uniform expression of countenance and appear- anc3 which we find recorded of Socrates, and also of Cams Lælius.", "591": "Though Philip of Macedon was excelled by his soil in his achievements and his renown, yet I find him superior to him in politeness and goodness of nature;", "592": "the one, there- fore, always appeared great, while the other often became detestable.", "593": "So that they appear to teach rightly, who admo- nish us that the more advanced we are in our fortune the more affable ought we to be in our behaviour.", "594": "Panætius tells us his scholar and friend, Africanus, used to say, that as horses, grown unruly by being in frequent engagements, are delivered over to be tamed by horse-breakers, thus men, who grow riotous and self-sufficient by prosperity, ought, as it were, to be exercised in the traverse of reason and phi- losophy, that they may learn the inconstancy of human affairs and the uncertainty of fortune.", "595": "In the time of our greatest prosperity we should also have the greatest recourse to the advice of our friends, and greater authority should be conceded to them than before.", "596": "At such a time we are to take care not to lend our ears to flatterers, or to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by adulation, by which it is easy to be misled:", "597": "for we then think ourselves such as may be justly praised, an opinion that gives rise to a thousand errors in conduct;", "598": "because, when men are once blown up with idle conceits, they are exposed to igno- minious ridicule and led into the greatest mistakes.", "599": "So much for this subject.", "600": "One thing you are to understand, that they who regulate public affairs perform the greatest exploits, and such as require the highest style of mind, because their business is most extensive and concerns the greatest number.", "601": "Yet there are, and have been, many men of great capacities, who in private life have planned out or attempted mighty matters, and yet have confined themselves to the limits of their own affairs;", "602": "or, being thrown into a middle state, between phi losophers and those who govern the state, have amused themselves with the management of their private fortune, without swelling it by all manner of means, not debarring their friends from the benefit of it, but rather, when occasion calls upon them, sharing it both with their friends and their country.", "603": "This should be originally acquired with honesty, without any scandalous or oppressive practices;", "604": "it should then be made serviceable to as many as possible, provided they be worthy;", "605": "it should next be augmented by prudence, by industry, and frugality, without serving the purposes of pleasure and luxury rather than of generosity and humanity.", "606": "The man who observes those rules may live with magni- ficence, with dignity, and with spirit, yet with simplicity and honour, and agreeably to (the economy of) human life.", "607": "XXVII.", "608": "The next thing is, to treat of that remaining part of virtue in which consist chastity and those (as we may term them) ornaments of life, temperance, moderation, and all that allays the perturbations of the mind.", "609": "Under this head is comprehended what in Latin we may call decorum (or the graceful), for the Greeks term it the πϱεπον.", "610": "Now, its quality is such that it is indiscernible from the honestum ;", "611": "for what- ever is graceful is virtuous, and whatever is virtuous is graceful.", "612": "But it is more easy to conceive than to express the differ- ence between what is virtuous and what is graceful (or between the honestum and the decorum;", "613": ") for whatever is graceful appears such, when virtue is its antecedent.", "614": "What is graceful, therefore, appears not only in that division of virtue which is here treated of, but in the three foregoing ones ;", "615": "for it is graceful in a man to think and to speak with propriety, to act with deliberation, and in every occurrence of life to find out and persevere in the truth.", "616": "On the other hand, to be imposed upon, to mistake, to faulter, and to be deceived, is as ungraceful as to rave or to be insane.", "617": "Thus, whatever is just is graceful;", "618": "whatever is unjust is as un- graceful as it is criminal.", "619": "The same principle applies to courage;", "620": "for every manly and magnanimous action is worthy of a man and graceful;", "621": "the reverse, as being unworthy, is ungraceful.", "622": "This, therefore, which I call gracefulness, is a universal property of virtue, and a property that is self-evident, and not discerned by any profundity of reasoning;", "623": "for there is a certain gracefulness that is implied in every virtue, and which may exist distinctly from virtue, rather in thought than in fact:", "624": "as grace and beauty of person, for example, cannot be separated from health, so the whole of that grace- fulness which I here speak of is blended with virtue, but may exist separately in the mind and in idea.", "625": "Now, the definition of this is twofold :", "626": "for there is a general gracefulness that is the property of all virtue, and that in- eludes another, which is fitted to the particular divisions of virtue.", "627": "The former is commonly defined to be that grace- fulness that is conformable to that excellence of man, in which he differs from other sentient beings;", "628": "but the special, which is comprised under the general, is defined to be a gracefulness so adapted to nature as to exhibit propriety and sweetness under a certain elegant appearance.", "629": "XXVIII.", "630": "We may perceive that these things are so understood from that gracefulness which is aimed at by the poets, and of which elsewhere more is wont to be said ;", "631": "for we say that the poets observe that gracefulness to be when a person speaks and acts in that manner which is most becoming his character.", "632": "Thus if Æacus or Minos should say:", "633": "-Let them hate me, so they fear me ;", "634": "Or-The father's belly is his children's grave,it would seem unsuitable, because we know them to have been just persons;", "635": "but when said by an Atreus, they are received with applause, because the speech is worthy of the character.", "636": "Now, poets will form their judgment of what is becoming in each individual according to his character;", "637": "but nature herself has stamped on us a character in excellence greatly surpassing the rest of the animal creation.", "638": "Poets, therefore, in their vast variety of characters, con- sider what is proper and what is becoming, even in the vicious:", "639": "but as nature herself has cast to us our parts in constancy moderation, temperance, and modesty;", "640": "as she, at the same time, instructs us not to be unmindful, how we should behave to mankind, the effect is, that the extent both of that gracefulness which is the general property of all virtue, and of that particular gracefulness that is adapted to every species of it, is discovered.", "641": "For as personal beauty, by the sym- metrical disposition of the limbs, attracts our attention and pleases the eye, by the harmony and elegance with which each part corresponds to another, so that gracefulness which manifests itself in life, attracts the approbation of those among whom we live, by the order, consistency, and modesty of all our words and deeds.", "642": "There is, therefore, a degree of respect due from us, suited to every man's character, from the best to the worst:", "643": "for it it is not only arrogant, but it is profligate, for a man to disre- gard the world's opinion of himself;", "644": "but, in our estimate of human life, we are to make a difference between justice and moral susceptibility.*", "645": "The dictate of justice is to do no wrong;", "646": "that of moral susceptibility is to give no offence to mankind, and in this the force of the graceful is most per- ceptible.", "647": "By these explanations I conceive that what we mean by the graceful and becoming may be understood.", "648": "Now the duty resulting from this has a primary tendency to an agreement with and conservation of our nature ;", "649": "and if we follow it as a guide we never shall err, but shall attain to that natural excellence which consists in acuteness and sagacity, to that which is best adapted to human society, and to that which is energetic and manly.*", "650": "But the chief force of the graceful lies in that suitableness of which I am now treating.", "651": "For not only those emotions of a physical kind, but still more those of the mind are to be approved as they are conformable to nature.", "652": "For the nature and powers of the mind are two-fold ;", "653": "one consists in appetite, by the Greeks called (i. e. impulse) which hurries man hither and thither ;", "654": "the other in reason, which teaches and explains what we are to do, and what we are to avoid.", "655": "The result is, that reason should direct and appetite obey.", "656": "XXIX.", "657": "Now every human action ought to be free from precipitancy and negligence, nor indeed ought we to do anything for which we cannot give a justifiable reason.", "658": "This indeed almost amounts to a definition of duty.", "659": "Now we must manage so as to keep the appetites subservient to reason, that they may neither outstrip it, nor fall behind through sloth and cowardice.", "660": "Let them be ever composed and free from all perturbation of spirit;", "661": "and thus entire consistency and moderation will display themselves.", "662": "For those appetites that are too vagrant and rampant as it were, either through desire or aversion, are not sufficiently under the command of reason ;", "663": "such, 1 say, undoubtedly transgress bounds and moderation.", "664": "For they abandon and disclaim that subordination to reason, to which by the law of nature they are subjected, and thereby not only the mind but the body is thrown into disturbance.", "665": "Let any one observe the very looks of men who are in a rage, of those who are.", "666": "agitated by desire or fear, or who exult in an excess of joy ;", "667": "all whose countenances, voices, motions, and attitudes, are changed.", "668": "But to return to my description of duty.", "669": "From these par- ticulars we learn that all our appetites ought to be contracted and mitigated ;", "670": "that all our attention and diligence ought to be awake, so that we do nothing in a rash, random, thought- less, and inconsiderate manner.", "671": "For nature has not formed us to sport and merriment, but rather to seriousness, and studies that are important and sublime.", "672": "Sport and merriment are not always disallowable :", "673": "but we are to use them as we do sleep and other kinds of repose, when we have despatched our weighty and important affairs.", "674": "Nay, our very manner of joking should be neither wanton nor indecent, but genteel and good-humoured.", "675": "For as we indulge boys not in an unlimited licence of sport, but only in that which is not inconsistent with virtuous conduct, so in our very jokes there should appear some gleam of a virtuous nature.", "676": "The manner of joking is reduceable under two denomina- tions ;", "677": "-one that is ill-bred, insolent, profligate, and obscene ;", "678": "another that is elegant, polite, witty, and good-humoured.", "679": "We have abundance of this last, not only in our Plautus, and the authors of the old Greek comedy, but in the writings of the Socratic philosophers.", "680": "Many collections have likewise been made by various writers, of humorous sayings, such as that made by Cato, and called his Apopthegms.", "681": "The dis- tinction, therefore, between a genteel and an ill-mannered joke is a very ready one.", "682": "The former, if seasonably made, and when the attention is relaxed, is worthy of a virtuous man ;", "683": "the other, if it exhibit immorality in its subject, or obscenity in the expression, is unworthy even of a man.", "684": "There is likewise a certain limit to be observed, even in our amusements, that we do not give up everything to amusement, and that, after being elevated by pleasure, we do not sink into some immorality.", "685": "Our Campus Martins, and the sport of hunting, supply creditable examples of amusement.", "686": "XXX.", "687": "But in all our disquisitions concerning the nature of a duty, it is material that we keep in our eye the great excellence of man's nature above that of the brutes and all other creatures.", "688": "They are insensible to everything but pleasure, and are hurried to it by every impulse.", "689": "Whereas the mind of man is nourished by study and reflection, and, being charmed by the pleasure of seeing and hearing, it is ever either inquiring or acting.", "690": "But if there is a man who has a small bias to pleasure, provided he is not of the brute kind (for there are some who are men only in name) ;", "691": "but, I say, if he is more high-minded even in a small degree, though he may be smitten with pleasure, he yet, through a principle of shame, hides and disguises his inclination for it.", "692": "From this we are to conclude that mere corporeal pleasure is unworthy the excellency of man's nature ;", "693": "and that it ought therefore to be despised and rejected ;", "694": "but that if a man shall have any delight in pleasure, he ought to be extremely observant of limits in its indulgence.", "695": "Therefore, the nourish- ment and dress of our bodies should be with a view not to our pleasure, but to our health and our strength ;", "696": "and should we examine the excellency and dignity of our nature, we should then be made sensible how shameful it is to melt away in pleasure, and to live in voluptuousness and effemi- nacy ;", "697": "and how noble it is to live with abstinence, with modesty, with strictness, and sobriety.", "698": "We are likewise to observe, that nature has, as it were, endowed us with two characters.", "699": "The first is in common to all mankind, because all of its partake in that excellency of reason, which places us above the brutes ;", "700": "from which is derived all that is virtuous, all that is graceful, and by which we trace our connections with our several duties.", "701": "The other character is peculiar to individuals.", "702": "For, as there are great dissimilarities in our persons-some for instance are swift in running, others strong in wrestling ;", "703": "and in style of beauty some have a dignity, and others a sweetness of aspect-so are there still greater varieties in our minds.", "704": "Lucius Crassus and Lucius Philippus had a great deal of wit;", "705": "but in Caius Cæsar, the son of Lucius, it was greater in degree, and more elaborate.", "706": "In their contemporaries, Marcus Scaurus, and young Mareus Drusus, there was a remarkable seriousness ;", "707": "in Caius Lælius great hilarity ;", "708": "but in his friend Scipio greater ambition, and a graver style of life.", "709": "As to the Greeks, we are told of Socrates that he was agreeable and witty ;", "710": "his conversation jocose, and in all his discourse a feigner of opinions whom the Greeks called ε’ίϱων.", "711": "On the other hand, Pythagoras and Pericles, without any gaiety, attained the highest authority.", "712": "Amongst the Carthaginian generals, Hannibal, we learn, was crafty, and Quintus Maximus amongst our own generals was apt at con- cealment, secrecy, dissimulation, plotting, and anticipating the designs of enemies.", "713": "In this class the Greeks rank Themis- tocles, and lason of Pheræ, above all others ;", "714": "and place among the very first, that cunning and artful device of Solon, when, to secure his own life, and that he might be of greater service to his country, he counterfeited madness.", "715": "In opposition to those characters, the tempers of many others are plain and open.", "716": "Lovers of truth and haters of deceit, they think that nothing should be done by stealth, nothing by stratagem ;", "717": "while others care not what they suffer themselves, or whom they stoop to, provided they accomplish their ends;", "718": "as we have seen Sylla and Marcus Crassus.", "719": "In which class Lysander the Lacedemonian, we are told, had the greatest art and per- severance, and that Callicratides, who succeeded to Lysander in the command of the fleet, was the reverse.", "720": "We have known some others, who though very powerful in conversation, always make themselves appear undistinguished individuals among many ;", "721": "such were the Catuli, father and son, and Quintus Mucius Mancia.", "722": "I have heard from men older than myself, that Publius Scipio Nasica was of the same cast, but that his father, the same who punished the pernicious designs of Tiberius Gracchus, was void of all politeness in conver- sation :", "723": "and the same of Xenocrates, the most austere of philosophers, and from that very circumstance a distinguished and celebrated man.", "724": "Innumerable, but far from being blame- able, are the other differences in the natures and manners of men.XXXI.", "725": "Every man, however, ought carefully to follow out his peculiar character, provided it is only peculiar, and not vicious, that he may the more easily attain that grace- fulness of which we are inquiring.", "726": "For we ought to manage so as never to counteract the general system of nature;", "727": "but having taken care of that, we are to follow our natural bias;", "728": "insomuch, that though other studies may be of greater weight and excellence, yet we are to regulate our pursuits by the disposition of our nature.", "729": "It is to no purpose to thwart nature, or to aim at what you cannot attain.", "730": "We therefore may have a still clearer conception of the graceful I am recommending, from this consideration, that nothing is grace- ful that goes (as the saying is) against the grain, that is, in contradiction and opposition to nature.", "731": "If anything at all is graceful, nothing surely is more so than a uniformity through the course of all your life, as well as through every particular action of it ;", "732": "and you never can preserve this uniformity, if, aping another man's nature, you forsake your own.", "733": "For as we ought to converse in the language we are best acquainted with, for fear of making ourselves justly ridiculous, as those do who cram in Greek expressions ;", "734": "so there ought to be no incongruity in our actions, and none in all the tenor of our lives.", "735": "*Now so powerful is this difference of natures, that it may be the duty of one man to put himself to death, and yet not of another, though in the same predicament.", "736": "For was the predicament of Marcus Cato different from that of those who surrendered themselves to Cæsar in Africa?", "737": "Yet it had been perhaps blameable in the latter, had they put them- selves to death, because their lives were less severe, and their moral natures more pliable.", "738": "But it became Cato, who had by perpetual perseverance strengthened that inflexibility which nature had given him, and had never departed from the purpose and resolution lie had once formed, to die rather than to look upon the face of a tyrant.†", "739": "How various were those sufferings of Ulysses, in his long continued wanderings, when he became the slave of women (if you consider Circe and Calypso as such):", "740": "and in all he said he sought to be complaisant and agreeable to every body, nay, put up with abuses from slaves and handmaidens at home, that he might at length compass what he desired;", "741": "but with the spirit with which he is represented, Ajax would have preferred a thousand deaths to suffering such indig- nities.", "742": "In the contemplation of which each ought to consider what is peculiar to himself, and to regulate those peculiari- ties, without making any experiments how another man's become them;", "743": "for that manner which is most peculiarly a man's own always becomes him best.", "744": "Every man ought, therefore, to study his own genius, so as to become an impartial judge of his own good and bad qualities, otherwise the players will discover better sense than we;", "745": "for they don't choose for themselves those parts that are the most excellent, but those which are best adapted to them.", "746": "Those who rely on their voices choose the part of Epigonas or Medus ;", "747": "the best actors that of Menalippa or Clytemnestra.", "748": "Rupilius, who I remember, always selected that of Antiopa;", "749": "Esopus seldom chose that of Ajax.", "750": "Shall a player, then, observe this upon the stage, and shall a wise man not observe it in the conduct of life ?", "751": "Let us, there- fore, most earnestly apply to those parts for which we are best fitted;", "752": "but should necessity degrade us into characters unsuitable to our genius, let us employ all our care, attention, and industry, in endeavouring to perform them, if not with propriety, with as little impropriety as possible:", "753": "nor should we strive so much to attain excellencies which have not been conferred on us, as to avoid defects.", "754": "XXXII.", "755": "To the two characters above described is added a third, which either accident or occasion imposes on us;", "756": "and even a fourth, which we accommodate to ourselves by our own judgment and choice.", "757": "Now kingdoms, governments, honours, dignities, riches, interest, and whatever are the qualities contrary to them, happen through accident, and are directed by occasions;", "758": "but what part we ourselves should wish to act, originates from our own will.", "759": "Some, therefore, apply to philosophy, some to the civil law, and some to elo- quence ;", "760": "and of the virtues themselves some endeavour to shine in one, and some in another.", "761": "Men generally are ambitious of distinguishing themselves in that kind of excellence in which their fathers or their an- cestors were most famous:", "762": "for instance, Quintus, the son of Publius Mucius, in the civil law;", "763": "Africanus, the son of Paulus, in the art of war.", "764": "Some, however, increase, by merits of their own, that glory which they have received from their fathers;", "765": "for the same Africanus crowned his military glory with the practice of eloquence.", "766": "In like manner, Timo- theus, the son of Conon, who equalled his father in the duties of the field, but added to them the glory of genius and learning.", "767": "Sometimes, however, it happens that men, laying aside the imitation of their ancestors, follow a purpose of their own;", "768": "and this is most commonly the case with such men who, though descended from obscure ancestors, purpose to them- selves great aims.", "769": "In our search, then, after what is graceful, all those parti- culars ought to be embraced in our contemplation and study.", "770": "In the first place, we are to determine who and what manner of men we are to be, and what mode of life we are to adopt- a consideration which is the most difficult of all;", "771": "for, in our early youth, when there is the greatest weakness of judgment, every one chooses to himself that kind of life which he has most fancied.", "772": "He, therefore, is trepanned into some fixed and settled course of living before lie is capable to judge what is the most proper.", "773": "*For the Hercules of Prodicus, as we learn from Xenophon, in his early puberty (an age appointed by nature for every man's choosing his scheme of life) is said to have gone into a solitude, and there sitting down, to have deliberated within himself much, and for a long time, whether of two paths that he saw before him it was better to enter on, the one of pleasure, the other of virtue.", "774": "This might, indeed, happen to a Jove- begotten Hercules;", "775": "but not so with us, who imitate those whom we have an opinion of, and are thereby drawn into their pursuits and purposes:", "776": "for generally, prepossessed by the principles of our parents, we are drawn away to their customs and habits.", "777": "Others, swayed by the judgment of the multitude, are passionately fond of those things which seem best to the majority.", "778": "A few, however, either through some good fortune, or a certain excellency of nature, or through the training of their parents, pursue the right path of life.", "779": "XXXIII.", "780": "The rarest class is composed of those who, endowed with an exalted genius, or with excellent educa- tion and learning, or possessing both, have had scope enough for deliberating as to what course of life they would be most willing to adopt.", "781": "Every design, in such a delibera- tion, ought to be referred to the natural powers of the indi- vidual;", "782": "for since, as I said before, we discover this propriety in every act which is performed, by reference to the qualities with which a man is born, so, in fixing the plan of our future life, we ought to be still much more careful in that respect, that we may be consistent throughout the duration of life with ourselves, and not deficient in any one duty.", "783": "But because nature in this possesses the chief power, and fortune the next, we ought to pay regard to both in fixing our scheme of life;", "784": "but chiefly to nature, as she is much more firm and constant, insomuch that the struggle, some- times between nature and fortune, seems to be between a mortal and an immortal being.", "785": "The mail, therefore, who adapts his whole system of living to his undepraved nature, let him maintain his constancy;", "786": "for that, above all things, becomes a man, provided he come not to learn that he has been mistaken in his choice of a mode of life.", "787": "Should that occur, as it possibly may, a change must be made in all his habits and purposes which, if circumstances shall be favourable, we shall more easily and readily effect;", "788": "but, should it happen otherwise, it must be done slowly and gradually.", "789": "Thus, men of sense think it more suitable that friendships which are disagreeable or not approved should be gradually detached, rather than suddenly cut off.", "790": "Still, upon altering our scheme of life, we ought to take the utmost care to make it appear that we have done it upon good grounds.", "791": "But if, as I said above, we are to imitate our ancestors, this should be first excepted that their bad qualities must not be imitated.", "792": "In the next place, if nature does not qualify us to imitate them in some things, we are not to attempt it:", "793": "for instance, the son of the elder African us, who adopted the younger son of Paulus, could not, from infirmity of health, resemble his father so much as his father did his grand- father.", "794": "If, therefore, a man is unable to defend causes, to entertain the people by haranguing, or to wage war, yet still he ought to do what is in his power;", "795": "he ought to practise justice, honour, generosity, modesty, and temperance, that what is wanting may be the less required of him.", "796": "Now, the best inheritance a parent can leave a child--more excellent than any patrimony-is the glory of his virtue and his deeds;", "797": "to bring disgrace on which ought to be regarded as wicked and monstrous.", "798": "XXXIV.", "799": "And as the same moral duties are not suited to the different periods of life, some belonging to the young, others to the old, we must likewise say somewhat on this distinc- tion.", "800": "It is the duty of a young man to reverence his elders, and amongst them to select the best and the worthiest, on whose advice and authority to rely.", "801": "For the inexperience of youth ought to be instructed and conducted by the wisdom of the aged.", "802": "Above all things, the young man ought to be restrained from lawless desires, and exercised in endurance and labour both of body and mind, that by persevering in them, he may be efficient in the duties both of war and peace.", "803": "Nay, when they even unbend their minds and give them- selves up to mirth, they ought to avoide intemperance, and never lose sight of morality ;", "804": "and this will be the more easy if even upon such occasions they desire that their elders should be associated with them.", "805": "*As to old men, their bodily labours seem to require diminu- tion, but the exercises of their mind ought even to be increased.", "806": "Their care should be to assist their friends, the youth, and above all their country, to the utmost of their ability by their advice and experience.", "807": "Now there is nothing that old age ought more carefully to guard against, than giving itself up to listlessness and indolence.", "808": "As to luxury, though it is shameful in every stage of life, in old age it is detestable ;", "809": "but if to that is added intemperance in lawless desires, the evil is doubled;", "810": "because old age itself thereby incurs dis- grace ;", "811": "and makes the excesses of the young more shameless.", "812": "†Neither is it foreign to my purpose to touch upon the duties of magistrates, of private citizens, and of strangers.", "813": "It is then the peculiar duty of a magistrate to bear in mind that he represents the state, and that he ought, therefore, to maintain its dignity and glory, to preserve its constitution, to act by its laws, and to remember that these things are committed to his fidelity.*", "814": "As to a private man and citi- zen, his duty is to live upon a just and equal footing with his fellow citizens, neither subordinate and subservient nor domineering.", "815": "In his sentiments of the public to be always for peaceful and virtuous measures;", "816": "for such we are ac- customed to imagine and describe a virtuous citizen.", "817": "Now the duty of a stranger and an alien is, to mind no- thing but his own business, not to intermeddle with another, and least of all to be curious about the affairs of a foreign government.", "818": "Thus we shall generally succeed in the prac- tice of the moral duties, when we inquire after what is most becoming and best fitted to persons, occasions, and ages;", "819": "and nothing is more becoming than in all our actions and in all our deliberations to preserve consistency.", "820": "XXXV.", "821": "But, because the graceful or becoming character we treat of appears in all our words and actions, nay, in every motion and disposition of our person, and consists of three particulars, beauty, regularity, and appointment suited to action (ideas which indeed are difficult to be expressed, but it is sufficient if they are understood);", "822": "and as in these three heads is comprehended our care to be approved by those amongst whom and with whom we live, on them also a few observations must be made.", "823": "In the first place nature seems to have paid a great regard to the form of our bodies, by ex- posing to the sight all that part of our figure that has a beauti- ful appearance, while she has covered and concealed those parts which were given for the necessities of nature, and which would have been offensive and disagreeable to the sight.", "824": "This careful contrivance of nature has been imitated by the modesty of mankind ;", "825": "for all men in their senses conceal from the eye the parts which nature has hid;", "826": "and they take care that they should discharge as privately as possible even the necessities of nature.", "827": "And those parts which serve those necessities, aud the necessities themselves, are not called by their real names;", "828": "because that which is not shameful if privately performed, it is still obscene to describe.", "829": "There- fore neither the public commission of those things, nor the obscene expression of them, is free from immodesty.", "830": "Neither are we to regard the Cynics or the Stoics, who are next to Cynics, who abuse and ridicule us for deeming things that are not shameful in their own nature, to become vicious through names and expressions.", "831": "Now, we give everything that is disgraceful in its own nature its proper term.", "832": "Theft, fraud, adultery, are disgraceful in their own nature, but not obscene in the expression.", "833": "The act of be- getting children is virtuous, but the expression obscene.", "834": "Thus, a great many arguments to the same purpose are maintained by these philosophers in subversion of delicacy.", "835": "Let us, for our parts, follow nature, and avoid whatever is offensive to the eyes or ears ;", "836": "let us aim at the graceful or becoming, whether we stand or walk, whether we sit or lie down, in every motion of our features, our eyes, or our hands.", "837": "In those matters two things are chiefly to be avoided ;", "838": "that there be nothing effeminate and foppish, nor any thing coarse and clownish.", "839": "Neither are we to admit, that those considerations are proper for actors and orators, but not binding upon us.", "840": "The manners at least of the actors, from the morality of our ancestors, are so decent that none of them appear upon the stage without an under-covering ;", "841": "being afraid lest if by any accident certain parts of the body should be exposed, they should make an indecent appearance.", "842": "According to our customs, sons grown up to manhood do not bathe along with their fathers, nor sons-in-law with their fathers-in-law.", "843": "Modesty of this kind, therefore, is to be cherished, especially as nature herself is our instructor and guide.", "844": "XXXVI.", "845": "Now as beauty is of two kinds, one that consists in loveliness, and the other in dignity;", "846": "loveliness we should regard as the characteristic of women, dignity of men :", "847": "therefore, let a man remove from his person every ornament that is unbecoming a man, and let him take the same care of every similar fault with regard to his gesture or motion.", "848": "For very often the movements learned in the Palæstra are offen- sive, and not a few impercinent gestures among the players are productive of disgust, while in both whatever is unaffected and simple is received with applause.", "849": "Now, comeliness in the person is preserved by the freshness of the complexion, and that freshness by the exercises of the body.", "850": "To this we are to add, a neatness that is neither troublesome nor too much studied, but which just avoids all clownish, ill-bred sloven- ness.", "851": "The same rules are to be observed with regard to ornaments of dress, in which, as in all other matters, a mean is preferable.", "852": "We must likewise avoid a drawling solemn pace in walk- ing, so as to seem like bearers in a procession ;", "853": "and likewise in matters that require despatch, quick, hurried motions ;", "854": "which, when they occur, occasion a shortness of breathing, an alteration in the looks, and a convulsion in the features, all which strongly indicate an inconstant character.", "855": "But still greater should be our care that the movements of our mind never depart from nature ;", "856": "in which we shall succeed if we guard against falling into any flurry and disorder or spirit, and keep our faculties intent on the preservation of propriety.", "857": "Now the motions of the mind are of two kinds, the one of reflection and the other of appetite.", "858": "Reflection chiefly applies itself in the search of truth.", "859": "Appetite prompts us to action.", "860": "We are therefore to take care to employ our reflection upon the best subjects, and to render our appetite obedient to our reason.", "861": "XXXVII.", "862": "And since the influence of speech is very great and that of two kinds,—one proper for disputing, the other for discoursing,-the former should be employed in plead- ings at trials, in assemblies of the people, and meetings of the senate;", "863": "the latter in social circles, disquisitions, the meetings of our friends, and should likewise attend upon entertainments.", "864": "Rhetoricians lay down rules for disputing, but none for dis- coursing, though I am not sure but that likewise may be done.", "865": "Masters are to be found in all pursuits in which there are learners, and all places are filled with crowds of rhetori- cians ;", "866": "but there are

subjects he should speak.", "886": "If serious, let him use gra- vity ;", "887": "if merry, good-humour.", "888": "But a man ought to take the greatest care that his discourse betray no defect in his mo- rals ;", "889": "and this generally is the case when for the sake of de- traction we eagerly speak of the absent in a malicious, ridi- culous, harsh, bitter, and contemptuous manner.", "890": "Now

subjects, to recall it:", "892": "and whatever subjects may present themselves (for we are not all pleased with the same subjects and that similarly and at all times) we should observe how far our conversation maintains its interest;", "893": "and as there was a reason for beginning so there should be a limit at which to conclude.", "894": "XXXVIII.", "895": "But as we are very propely

adapted, but still regard must be paid to magni- ficence and elegance.", "913": "We learn that it was to the honour of Cneius Octavius, the first of that family who was raised to the consulship, that he built upon the Palatine, a house of a noble and majestic appearance, which, as it was visited as a spectacle by the common people, was supposed to have voted its proprietor, though but a new man, into the consulship.", "914": "Scaurus demolished this house, and took the ground into his own palace.", "915": "But though the one first brought a consulship into his family, yet the other, though the son of a man of the greatest rank and distinction, carried into this, his enlarged palace, not only repulse but disgrace, nay ruin.", "916": "For dignity should be adorned by a palace, but not be wholly sought from it :", "917": "-the house ought to be ennobled by thie.", "918": "master, and not the master by the house.", "919": "And, as in other matters a man should have regard to others and not to his own concerns alone, so in the house of a man of rank, who is to entertain a great many guests and to admit a multitude of all denominations, attention should be paid to spaciousness;", "920": "but a great house often reflects discredit upon its master, if there is solitude in it, especially if, under a former proprietor, it has been accustomed to be well filled.", "921": "It is a mortifying thing when passengers exclaim, \"Ah!", "922": "ancient dwelling!", "923": "by how degenerate a master art thou occupied!”", "924": "which may well be said at the present time of a great many houses.", "925": "But you are to take care, especially if you build for yourself, not to go beyond bounds in grandeur and costliness.", "926": "Even the example of an excess of this kind does much mischief.", "927": "For most people, particularly in this respect, studiously imitate the example of their leaders.", "928": "For instance, who imitates the virtue of the excellent Lucius Lucullus ?", "929": "But how many there are who have imitated the magnificence of his villas.", "930": "To which certainly a bound ought to be set, and it reduced to moderation, and the same spirit of moderation ought to be extended to all the practice and economy of life.", "931": "But of this enough.", "932": "Now in undertaking every action we are to regard three things.", "933": "First, that appetite be subservient to reason, than which there is no condition better fitted for preserving the moral duties.", "934": "We are, secondly, to examine how important the object in which we desire to accomplish, that our atten- tion or labour may be neither more nor less than the occasion requires.", "935": "Thirdly, we are to take care that every thing that comes under the head of magnificence and dignity should be well regulated.", "936": "Now, the best regulation is, to observe that same graceful propriety which I have recommended, and to go no further.", "937": "But of those three heads, the most excellent is, that of making our appetites subservient to our reason.", "938": "XL.", "939": "I am now to speak concerning the order and the timing of things.", "940": "In this science is comprehended what the Greek call εὐταξία, not that which we Romans call mode- ration, an expression that implies keeping within bounds ;", "941": "whereas that is εὐταξία, in which the preservation of order is involved.", "942": "This duty, which we will denominate moderation, is defined by the Stoics as those things which are either said or done in their appropriate places of ranging.", "943": "Therefore, the signification of order and of arrangement seems to be the same.", "944": "For they define order to be the disposing of things into fitting and convenient places.", "945": "Now they tell us that the appropriate place of an action is the oppor- tunity of doing it.", "946": "The proper opportunity for action being called by the Greeks εὐϰαρία, and by the Latins, occasio, or occasion.", "947": "Thus, as I have already observed, that modestia which we have thus explained, is the knowledge of acting according to the fitness of a conjecture.", "948": "But prudence, of which we have treated in the beginning of this book, may admit of the same definition.", "949": "Under this head, however, I speak of moderation and temperance, and the like virtues.", "950": "Therefore, the considerations which belong to prudence have been treated in their proper place.", "951": "But at present I am to treat of those virtues I have been so long speaking of, which relate to morality, and the approbation of those with whom we -live.", "952": "Such then should be the regularity of all our actions, that in the economy of life, as in a connected discourse, all things may agree and correspond.", "953": "For it would be unbecoming and highly blameable, should we, when upon a serious subject, introduce the language of the jovial or the effemi- nate.", "954": "When Pericles had for his colleague in the prætor- ship Sophocles the poet, and as they were discoursing upon their joint official duty, a beautiful boy by chance passed by, Sophocles exclaimed, \"What a charming boy, Pericles !\" but Pericles very properly told him, \" A magistrate ought to keep not only his hands, but his eyes under restraint.\"", "955": "Now Sophocles, had he said the same thing at a trial of athletic performers would not have been liable to this just reprimand, such importance there is in the time and place.", "956": "So too, a man, who is going to plead a cause, if on a journey or in a walk he should muse or appear to himself more thonghtful than ordinary, he is not blamed:", "957": "but should he do this at an entertainment, he would seem ill-bred for not dis- tinguishing times.", "958": "But those actions that are in wide discrepancy with good- breeding, such, for instance, as singing in the forum, or any such absurdity, are so easily discernible, that they re- quire no great degree of reprehension or advice.", "959": "But faults that seem to be inconsiderable, and such as are descernible only by a few, are to be more carefully avoided.", "960": "As in lutes or pipes, however little they be out of tune, it is per- ceived by a practised ear ;", "961": "so in life we are to guard against all discrepancy, and the rather as the harmony of morals is greater and much more valuable than that of sounds.", "962": "XLI.", "963": "Thus, as the ear is sensible of the smallest discord in musical instruments, so we, if we desire to be accurate and attentive observers of faults, may make great discoveries from very trifling circumstances.", "964": "The cast of the eye, the bending or unbending of the brow, an air of dejection or cheerfulness, laughter, the tone of words, silence, the raising or falling of the voice, and the like circumstances, we may easily form a judgment which of them are in their pro- per state, and which of them are in discord with duty and nature.", "965": "Now in this case, it is advisable to judge from others, of the condition and properties of every one of those, so that we ourselves may avoid those things that are unbecoming in others.", "966": "For it happens, I know not how, that we perceive what is defective more readily in others than we do in ourselves.", "967": "Therefore, when masters mimic the faults of boys that they may amend them, those boys are most easily corrected.", "968": "Neither is it improper, in order to fix our choice in matters which involve a doubt, if we apply to men of learning and also of experience, and learn what they think of the several kinds of duty;", "969": "for the greatest part of such men are usually led to that conclusion to which nature herself directs;", "970": "and in these cases, we are to examine not only what a man says, but what he thinks, and upon what grounds he thinks it.", "971": "For as painters, statuaries, and even poets, want to have their works canvassed by the public in order to correct any thing that is generally condemned, and examine both by themselves and with others where the defect lies ;", "972": "thus we ought to make use of the judgment of others to do, and not to do, to alter and correct, a great many things.", "973": "As to actions resulting from the customs or civil institu- tions of a people, no precepts can be laid down ;", "974": "for those very institutions are precepts in themselves.", "975": "Nor ought men to be under the mistake to imagine that if Socrates or Aristippus acted or spoke in opposition to the manners and civil constitutions of their country, they themselves have a similar licence.*", "976": "For this was a right they acquired by their great and superhuman endowments.", "977": "But as to the whole system of the Cynics;", "978": "we are absolutely to reject it, because it is inconsistent with moral susceptibility without which nothing can be honest, nothing can be virtuous.", "979": "Now it is our duty to esteem and to honour, in the same manner as if they were dignified with titles or vested with command, those men whose lives have been conspicuous for great and glorious actions, who feel rightly towards the state and deserve well or have deserved well of their country.", "980": "We are likewise to have a great regard for old age, to pay a deference to magistrates ;", "981": "to distinguish between (what we owe to) a fellow citizen and a foreigner, and to consider whether that foreigner comes in a public or a private capacity.", "982": "In short, not to dwell on particulars, we ought to regard, to cultivate, and to promote the good will and the social welfare of all mankind.", "983": "XLII.", "984": "Now with regard to what arts and means of ac- quiring wealth are to be regarded as worthy and what dis- reputable, we have been taught as follows.", "985": "In the first place, those sources of emolument are condemned that incur the public hatred ;", "986": "such as those of tax-gatherers and usurers.", "987": "We are likewise to account as ungenteel and mean the gains of all hired workmen, whose source of profit is not their art but their labour;", "988": "for their very wages are the consideration of their servitude.", "989": "We are likewise to despise all who retail from merchants goods for prompt sale;", "990": "for they never can suc- ceed unless they lie most abominably.", "991": "Now nothing is more disgraceful than insincerity.", "992": "All mechanical labourers are by their profession mean.", "993": "For a workshop can contain nothing befitting a gentleman.", "994": "Least of all are those trades to be approved that serve the purposes of sensuality, such as (to speak after Terence) fishmongers, butchers, cooks, pastry-cooks, and fishermen ;", "995": "to whom we shall add, if you please, perfumers, dancers, and the whole tribe of games- ters.", "996": "*But those professions that involve a higher degree of in- telligence or a greater amount of utility, such as medicine, architecture, the teaching the liberal arts, are honourable in those to whose rank in life they are suited.", "997": "As to merchandizing, if on a small scale it is mean ;", "998": "but if it is extensive and rich, bring numerous commodities from all parts of the world, and giving bread to numbers without fraud, it is not so despicable.", "999": "But if a merchant, satiated, or rather satisfied with his profits, as he sometimes used to leave the open sea and make the harbour, shall from the harbour step into an estate and lands ;", "1000": "such a man seems most justly deserving of praise.", "1001": "For of all gainful profes- sions, nothing is better, nothing more pleasing, nothing more delightful, nothing better becomes a well-bred man than agriculture.", "1002": "But as I have handled that subject at large in my Cato Major, you can draw from thence all that falls under this head.", "1003": "XLIII.", "1004": "I have I think sufficiently explained in what manner the duties arc derived from the consituent parts of virtue.", "1005": "Now it often may happen that an emulation and a contest may arise amongst things that are in themselves virtuous ;", "1006": "-of two virtuous actions which is preferable.", "1007": "A division that Panætius has overlooked.", "1008": "For as all virtue is the result of four qualities, prudence, justice, magnanimity and moderation;", "1009": "so in the choice of a duty, those qualities must necessarily come in competition with one another.", "1010": "I am therefore of opinion that the duties arising from the social relations are more agreeable to nature than those that are merely notional.", "1011": "This may be confirmed from the fol- lowing argument.", "1012": "Supposing that this kind of life should befall a wise man, that in an affluence of all things he might be able with great leisure to contemplate and attend to every object that is worthy his knowledge;", "1013": "yet if his condition be so solitary as to have no company with mankind, he would prefer death to it.", "1014": "Of all virtues, the most leading is that wisdom which the Greeks call σοϕια, for by that sagacity which they term ϕρονησις we understand quite another thing, as it implies the knowledge of what things are to be de- sired, and what to be avoided.", "1015": "But that wisdom which I have stated to be the chief, is the knowledge of things divine and human, which comprehends the fellowship of gods and men, and their society within themselves.", "1016": "If that be, as it certainly is, the highest of all objects, it follows of course that the duty resulting from this fellowship is the highest of all duties.", "1017": "For the knowledge and contem- plation of nature is in a manner lame and unfinished, if it is followed by no activity ;", "1018": "now activity is most perspi- cuous when it is exerted in protecting the rights of mankind.", "1019": "It therefore has reference to the social interests of the human race, and is for that reason preferable to knowledge;", "1020": "and this every virtuous man maintains and exhibits in prac- tice.", "1021": "For who is so eager in pursuing and examining the nature of things, that if, while lie is handling and con- templating the noblest objects of knowledge, the peril and crisis of his country is made known to him, and that it is in his power to assist and relieve her, would not instantly aban- don and fling from him all those studies, even though he thought he would be enabled to number the stars, or measure the dimensions of the world ?", "1022": "And he would do the same were the safety of a friend or a parent concerned or endan- gered.", "1023": "From this consideration I infer, that the duties of justice are perferable to the studies and duties of knowledge, relating as they do to the interests of the human race, to which no anterior consideration ought to exist in the mind of man.", "1024": "XLIV.", "1025": "But some have employed their whole lives in the pursuits of knowledge, and yet have not declined to contri- bute to the utility and advantage of men.", "1026": "For they have even instructed many how they ought be better citizens and more useful to their country.", "1027": "Thus Lysis the Pythagorean educated Epaminondas of Thebes, as did Plato Dion of Syracuse, and so of many others ;", "1028": "and as to whatever ser- vices I have performed, if I have performed any to the state, I came to it after being furnished and adorned with know- ledge by teachers and learning.", "1029": "Nor do those philosophers only instruct and educate those who are desirous of learning while alive and present amongst us;", "1030": "but they continue to do the same after death, by the monuments of their learning;", "1031": "for they neglect no point that relates to the constitution, the manners and the morals of their country;", "1032": "so that it appears as if they had dedicated all their leisure to our advantage.", "1033": "Thus while they are them- selves devoted to the studies of learning and wisdom, they make their understanding and their skill chiefly available to the service of mankind.", "1034": "It is therefore more serviceable to the public for a man to discourse copiously, provided it is to the purpose, than for a man to think ever so accurately without the power of expression ;", "1035": "the reason is, because thought terminates in itself alone, but discourse affects those with whom we are connected in a community.", "1036": "Now as the swarms of bees do not assemble in order to form the honey-comb, but form the honey-comb because they are by nature gregarious ;", "1037": "so, and in a far greater degree, men being associated by nature, manifest their skill in think- in- and acting.", "1038": "Therefore, unless knowledge is connected with that virtue which consists in doing service to mankind, that is, in improving human society, it would seem to be but solitary and barren.", "1039": "In like manner greatness of soul, when utterly disunited from the company and society of men, becomes a kind of un- couth ferocity.", "1040": "Hence it follows, that the company and the community of men are preferable to mere speculative know- ledge.", "1041": "Neither is that maxim true which is affirmed by some, that human communities and societies were instituted from the necessity of our condition, because we cannot without the help of others supply what our nature requires;", "1042": "and that if we could be furnished, as by a kind of magic wand, with every thing that relates to food and raiment, that then every man of excelling genius, laying aside all other occupations, would apply himself to knowledge and learning.", "1043": "The fact is not so;", "1044": "for he would fly from solitude and look out for a com- panion in his pursuits;", "1045": "and would desire sometimes to teach and sometimes to learn, sometimes to listen and sometimes to speak.", "1046": "Every duty therefore that operates for the good of human community and society, is preferable to that duty which is limited to speculation and knowledge.XLV.", "1047": "Here perhaps it should be inquired, whether the duties of that society which is most suitable to nature are preferable to moderation and decency ?", "1048": "By no means.", "1049": "For some things are partly so disgraceful, and partly so criminal in their nature, that a wise man would not commit them, even to save his country.", "1050": "Posidonius has collected very many such;", "1051": "but they are so obscene and so shocking that it would be scandalous even to name them.", "1052": "A wise man would not undertake such things, even to serve his country, nor would his country undertake them to serve herself.", "1053": "But it fortunately happens, that there never can be a conjunc- ture, when the public interest shall require from a wise man the performance of such actions.", "1054": "Hence it follows, that in the choice of our duties we are to prefer that kind of duty that contributes to the good of society.", "1055": "For well-directed action is always the result of knowledge and prudence.", "1056": "And therefore it is of more con- sequence to act properly, than to deliberate justly.", "1057": "Thus much then may suffice on this subject;", "1058": "for this topic has now been so fully laid open, that it is easy for every man in the study of his duties, to see which is preferable.", "1059": "Now in society there are degrees of duties by which every man may understand what belongs to himself.", "1060": "The first is owing to the immortal gods, the second to our country, the third to our parents, and lastly to others through different grada- tions.", "1061": "From these arguments thus briefly stated we perceive that men are sometimes not only in doubt, whether a thing is virtuous or disgraceful;", "1062": "but likewise when two virtuous things are proposed, which is more so.", "1063": "This head, as I said before, was omitted by Panætius.", "1064": "Let us now proceed to what remains of our subject.", "1065": "I THINK I have in the former Book sufficiently explained in what manner our duties are derived from morality, and every kind of virtue.", "1066": "It now remains that I treat of those kinds of duties that relate to the improvement of life, and to the acquirement of those means which men employ for the attainment of wealth and interest.", "1067": "In this inquiry, as I have already observed, I will treat of what is useful, and what is not so.", "1068": "Of several utilities I shall speak of that which is more useful, or most so.", "1069": "Of all this I shall treat, after premising a few words concerning my own plan of life and choice of pursuits.", "1070": "Although my works have prompted a great many to the exercise not only of reading but of writing, yet I sometimes am apprehensive, that the name of philosophy is offensive to some worthy men, and that they are surprized at my having employed so much of my pains and time in that study.", "1071": "For my part, as long as the state was under the management ofthose into whose hands she had committed herself, I applied to it all my attention and thought.", "1072": "But when the government was engrossed by one person, when there was an end of all public deliberation and authority ;", "1073": "when I in short had lost these excellent patriots who were my assciates in the protection of my country, I neither abandoned myself to that anguish of spirit which, had I given way to it, must have consumed me, nor did I indulge those pleasures that are disgraceful to a man of learning.", "1074": "Would that the constitution had remained in its original state;", "1075": "and that it had not fallen into the hands of men whose aim was not to alter but to destroy it!", "1076": "For then I would first.", "1077": "as I was wont to do when our government existed, have em- ployed my labours in action rather than in writing;", "1078": "and in the next place, in my writings I should have recorded my own pleadings as I had frequently done, and not such subjects as the present.", "1079": "But when the constitution, to which all my care, thoughts, and labour used to be devoted, ceased to exist, then those public and senatorial studies were silenced.", "1080": "But as my mind could not be inactive, and as my early life had been employed in these studies, I thought that they might most honourably be laid aside by betaking myself anew to philosophy, having, when young, spent a great deal of my time in its study, with a view to improvement.", "1081": "When I afterwards began to court public offices and devoted myself entirely to the service of my country, I had so much room for philosophy as the time that remained over from the business of my friends and the public.", "1082": "But I spent it all in reading, having no leisure for writing.", "1083": "II.", "1084": "In the midst of the greatest calamities, therefore, I seem to have realized the advantage that I have reduced into writ- ing, matters in which my countrymen were not sufficiently instructed, and which were most worthy their attention.", "1085": "For in the name of the gods, what is more desirable, what is more excellent, than wisdom ?", "1086": "What is better for man ?", "1087": "what more worthy of him ?", "1088": "They therefore who court her are termed philosophers ;", "1089": "for philosophy, if it is to be interpreted, implies nothing but the love of wisdom.", "1090": "Now the ancient philosophers defined wisdom to be the knowledge of things divine and human, and of the causes by which these things are regulated ;", "1091": "a study that if any man despises, I know not what he can think deserving of esteem.", "1092": "For if we seek the entertainment of the mind, or a respite 'from cares, what is comparable to those pursuits that are always searching out somewhat that relates to and secures the welfare and happiness of life ?", "1093": "Or if we regard the principles of self-consistency and virtue, either this is the art, or there is absolutely no art by which we can attain them.", "1094": "And to say that there is no art for the attainment of the highest objects, when we see that none of the most inconsiderable are without it, is the language of men who speak without consideration, and w1 o mistake in the most important matters.", "1095": "Now if there is any school of virtue, where can it be found, if you abandon this method of study?", "1096": "But it is usual to treat these subjects more particularly when we exhort to philosophy, which I have done in another book.", "1097": "At this time my intention was only to explain the reasons why, being divested of all offices of state, I choose to apply myself to this study preferably to all others.", "1098": "Now an objection is brought against me, and indeed by some men of learning and knowledge, who inquire whether I act con- sistently with myself, when, though I affirm that nothing can be certainly known, I treat upon different subjects, and when, as now, I am investigating the principles of moral duty.", "1099": "I could wish such persons were thoroughly acquainted with my way of thinking.", "1100": "I am not one of those whose reason is always wandering in the midst of uncertainty and never has any- thing to pursue.", "1101": "For if we abolish all the rules, not only of reasoning but of living, what must become of reason, nay of life itself?", "1102": "For my own part, while others maintain some things to be certain, and others uncertain, I say, on the other side, that some things are probable, and others not so.", "1103": "What, therefore, hinders me from following whatever appears to me to be most probable, and from rejecting what is otherwise ;", "1104": "and, while I avoid the arrogance of dogmatizing, from escaping that recklessness which is most inconsistent with wisdom ?", "1105": "Now all subjects are disputed by our sect, because this very probability cannot appear, unless there be a com- parison of the arguments on both sides.", "1106": "But, if I mistake not, I have with sufficient accuracy explained these points in my Academic;", "1107": ". As to you, my dear Cicero, though you are now employed in the study of the oldest and noblest philo- sophy under Cratippus, who greatly resembles those who have propounded these noble principles, yet I was unwilling that these my sentiments, which are so corresponding with your system, should be unknown to you.", "1108": "But to proceed in what I propose.", "1109": "III.", "1110": "Having laid down the five principles upon which we pursue our duty, two of which relate to propriety and virtue, two to the enjoyments of life, such as wealth, interest, and power, the fifth to the forming of a right judgment in any case, if there should appear to be any clashing between the princi- ples I have mentioned, the part assigned to virtue is con- eluded, and with that I desire you should be thoroughly ac- quainted.", "1111": "Now the subject I am now to treat of is neither more nor less than what we call expediency;", "1112": "in which matter custom has so declined and gradually deviated from the right path, that, separating virtue from expediency, it has determined that some things may be virtuous which are not expedient, and some expedient which are not virtuous;", "1113": "than which doctrine nothing more pernicious can be introduced into human life.", "1114": "It is indeed with strictness and honesty that philosophers, and those of the highest reputation, distinguish in idea those three principles which really are blended together.", "1115": "For they give it as their opinion that whatever is just is expedient ;", "1116": "and in like manner whatever is virtuous is just ;", "1117": "from whence it follows that whatever is virtuous is also expedient.", "1118": "Those who do not perceive this distinction often admire crafty and cunning men, and mistake knavery for wisdom.", "1119": "The error of such ought to be eradicated ;", "1120": "and every notion ought to be reduced to this hope, that men may attain the ends they propose, by virtuous designs and just actions, and not by dishonesty and wickedness.", "1121": "The things then that pertain to the preservation of human life are partly inanimate, such as gold, silver, the fruits of the earth, and the like ;", "1122": "and partly animal, which have their peculiar instincts and affections.", "1123": "Now of these some are void of, and some are endowed with, reason.", "1124": "The animals void of reason are horses, oxen, with other brute creatures, and bees, who by their labours contribute somewhat to the service and existence of mankind.", "1125": "As to the animals endowed with reason, they are of two kinds, one the gods, the other men.", "1126": "Piety and sanctity will render the gods propitious ;", "1127": "and next to the gods mankind are most useful to men.", "1128": "(The same division holds as to things that are hurtful and prejudicial.", "1129": "But as we are not to suppose the gods to be injurious to mankind, excluding them, man appears to be most hurtful to man.)",

which either the violence of the cold is repelled, or the inconveniences of the heat mitigated, how could they have originally been given to the human race, or afterwards repaired when ruined by

aqueducts, the cuts of rivers, the irrigation of the land, dams opposed to streams, and artificial harbours ?", "1138": "From those and a great many other instances, it is plain that we could by no manner of means have, without the hand and industry of man, reaped the benefits and advantages arising from such things as are inanimate.", "1139": "In short, what advantage and convenience could have been realized from the brute creation, had not men assisted ?", "1140": "Men, undoubtedly, were the first who discovered what useful result we might realize from every animal ;", "1141": "nor could we

receiving, and by the exchange of resources and articles of wealth, we wanted for nothing.", "1150": "V.", "1151": "We are more prolix than is necessary on this head For to whom is not that self-evident for which Panaetius employs a great many words, that no man, whether he be a commander of an army, or a leader in the state, has ever been able to perform great and salutary achievements without the zealous co-operation of men ?", "1152": "As instances of this, he mentions Themistocles, Pericles, Cyrus, Alexander, and Agesilaus, who, he says, without the aid of men never could have achieved such great exploits.", "1153": "Thus in a matter that is undoubted he brings evidences that are unnecessary.", "1154": "But as the assem- blage or agreement of men amongst themselves is

cerning the destruction of mankind ;", "1156": "and after collecting together all the different causes, such as those of inundations, pestilence, devastation, and those sudden attacks of swarms of creatures, by which he tells us some tribes of men have been destroyed ;", "1157": "he then calculates how many more men have been destroyed by men, that is by wars and seditions, than by every other species of calamity.", "1158": "As this point therefore admits of no doubt, that man can do the greatest good and the greatest injury to man, I lay it down as the peculiar property of virtue, that it recon- ciles the affections of mankind, and employs them for her own purposes.", "1159": "So that all the application and management of inanimate things, and of brutes for the use of mankind, is effected by the industrial arts.", "1160": "But the quick and ready zeal of mankind for advancing and enlarging our conditions, is excited through the wisdom and virtue of the best of mankind.",

will be the con- sequence of such or such a thing ;", "1165": "how one thing arises from another, and what is the cause of each.", "1166": "The next property of virtue is to calm those violent disorders of the mind which the Greeks call πάθη, and to render obedient to reason those appetites which they call ο̒ϱμαι.", "1167": "The third property is to treat with moderation and prudence those with whom we are joined in society, that by their means we may have the complete and full enjoyment of all that nature stands in need of;", "1168": "and likewise by them repel every thing adverse that

that are more connected with virtue.", "1195": "Now, mankind submit to the command and power of another for several reasons.", "1196": "For they are induced by benevolence or by the greatness of his bene- fits ;", "1197": "or by his transcendent worth, or by the hopes that their submission will turn to their own account, or from the fear of their being forced to submit, or from the hopes of

tyrants;", "1203": "few of whom have escaped a. similar fate.", "1204": "For fear is but a bad guardian to permanency, whereas affection is faithful even to perpetuity.", "1205": "But the truth is,

suspended, are more severe than if it had been retained.", "1210": "We ought therefore to follow this most ob- vious principle, that dread should be removed and affection reconciled, which has the greatest influence not only on our security, but also on our interest and power;", "1211": "and thus we shall most easily attain to the object of our wishes, both in private and political affairs.",

most powerful in winning the confidence of mankind.", "1283": "For honesty without wisdom, has influence sufficient of it- self ;", "1284": "but wisdom without honesty is of no effect in inspiring confidence;", "1285": "because, when we have no opinion of a man's probity, the greater his craft and cunning, the more hated and suspected he becomes;", "1286": "honesty, therefore, joined to un- derstanding, will have unbounded power in acquiring con- fidence ;", "1287": "honesty without understanding can do a great deal;", "1288": "but understanding without honesty can do nothing.", "1289": "X.", "1290": "But lest any one should wonder why, as all philosophers are agreed in one maxim, which I myself have often main- tained, that the man who possesses one of the virtues is in possession of them all, I here make a distinction which im- plies that a man may be just but not at the same time pru- dent, there is one kind of accuracy which in disputation refines even upon truth, and another kind, when our whole discourse is accommodated to the understanding of the public.", "1291": "Therefore I here make use of the common terms of discourse, by calling some men brave, some good,

reverence and extol with the greatest praise, those men in whom they think they can perceive some distinguished or singular vir- tues ;", "1298": "whereas they despise those whom they think to possess no virtue, spirit, or manliness.", "1299": "Now, men do not despise all those of whom they think ill.", "1300": "For they by no means con- temn rogues, slanderers, cheats, and those who are prepared to commit an injury, though they have a bad opinion of them.", "1301": "Therefore, as I have already said, those are despised who can neither serve themselves nor any one else, who have no assiduity, no industry, and no concern about them;", "1302": "but those men are the objects of admiration who are thought to surpass others in virtue, and to be free as well from every disgrace, as especially

admire the splendour and the beauty of virtue ?", "1308": "XI.", "1309": "This sublimity of soul, therefore, produces the highest admiration ;", "1310": "and above all justice, from which single virtue men are called good, appears to the multitude as something marvellous.", "1311": "And with good reason ;", "1312": "for no man can be just if he is afraid of death, pain, exile, or poverty, or prefers their contraries to justice.", "1313": "Men especially admire him who is incorruptible by money, and they consider every man in whom that quality is seen as ore purified by the fire.", "1314":

confidence, for the same reason ;", "1317": "and its admiration, because it neglects and despises those objects to which most men are hurried on inflamed with avidity.", "1318": "In my opinion, however, every scheme and purpose of life requires the assistance of men, especially that one should have some with whom he can familiarly unbosom himself, which is hard for one to do, unless he maintain the appear- ance of a good man.", "1319": "For this reason, were a man to live ever so lonely or ever so retired in the country, a reputation for justice would be indispensable to him, and so much the more, as those who do not possess it will be esteemed dis- honest, and thus surrounded by no protection will be ex- posed to numerous injuries.", "1320": "And with those likewise who buy or sell, who hire or let out, or who are engaged in the transaction of business, justice is necessary to the carrying of their pursuits, for its influ- ence is so great, that without some grains of it, even they who live by malpractices and villiany could not subsist.", "1321": "For amongst those who thieve in company, if any one of them cheat or rob another he is turned out of the gang;", "1322":

laws, which they obey and observe.", "1324": "By this impartiality in sharing the booty, Bardyllis, the Illyrian robber, mentioned by Theopompus, obtained great wealth;", "1325": "and Viriathus, the Lusitanian, much greater;", "1326": "to whom our armies and our gene- rals yielded ;", "1327": "but whom the prætor Caius Lælius, surnamed the wise, crushed and subdued, and so repressed his ferocity

amidst the laws and administration of a well-consti- tuted government ?XII.", "1329": "It appears to me, that not only among the Medes, as we are told by Herodotus, but by our own ancestors, men of the best principles were constituted kings, for the benefit of their just government.", "1330": "For when the helpless people were oppressed by those who had greater power, they betook themselves to some one man who was distinguished by his virtue, who not only protected the weakest from oppression, but by setting up an equitable system of government, united highest and lowest in equal rights.",

all.", "1334": "When mankind could enjoy it under one just and good man, they were satisfied with that;", "1335": "but when that was not the case, laws were invented, which perpetually spoke to all men with one and the same voice.", "1336": "It is therefore undeniable that the men whose reputation among the people was the highest for their justice, were commonly chosen to bear rule.", "1337":

manner of means to be reverenced and practised ;", "1339": "both for its own sake (for otherwise it would not be justice), and for the enlargement of our own dignity and popularity.", "1340": "But as there is a system not only for the acquisition of money but also for its investment, so that it may supply ever- recurring expenses, not only the needful but the liberal;", "1341": "so popularity must be both acquired and maintained by system.", "1342": "It was finely said by Socrates that the shortest and most direct road to popularity, is \"for a man to be the same that he wishes to be taken for.\"", "1343": "People are egregiously mistaken if they think they ever can attain to permanent popularity by hypocrisy, by mere outside appearances, and by disguising not only their language but their looks.", "1344": "True popularity takes deep root and spreads itself wide;", "1345": "but the false falls away like blossoms;", "1346": "for nothing that is false can be lasting.", "1347": "I could bring many instances of both kinds;", "1348": "but for the sake of liberty, I will confine myself to one family.", "1349": "While there is a memorial of Roman history remaining, the memory cf Tiberius Gracchus, the son of Publius, will be held in honour;", "1350": "but his sons even in life were not approved of by the good, and, being dead, they are ranked amongst those who were deservedly

set up in the strongest point of light, no word or deed of his can be private.", "1358": "Now those whose early life, through their mean and ob- scure rank, is passed unnoticed by the public, when they come to be young men, ought to contemplate important pur- poses.", "1359": "and pursue them by the most direct means, which they will do with a firmer resolution, because not only is no envy felt.", "1360": "but favour rather is shown towards that period of life.", "1361": "The chief recommendation then of a young man to fame is derived from military exploits.*", "1362": "Of this we have many ex- amples amongst our ancestors, for they were almost always waging wars.", "1363": "Your youth however has fallen upon the time cf a war, in which one party incurred too much guilt and to- other too little success.", "1364": "But when in that war Pompey gave you the command of a squadron, you gained the praise of that great man and of his army by your horsemanship, your darting the

body, so the objects we pursue by intelligence and reason are more important than those we effeet by bodily strength.", "1369": "The most early recommendation, therefore, is modesty, obedience to parents, and affection for relations.", "1370": "Young men are likewise most easily and best known, who attach themselves to wise and illustrious men who benefit their country by their counsels.",

acquired the highest honour from that noble and celebrated prosecution he undertook;", "1374": "and at an age when even those who exercise themselves are highly applauded (as we are told in the case of Demosthenes), Crassus, I say, at that age showed that he could already do that most success- fully in the forum, which at that time he would have gained praise had he attempted at home.", "1375":

conversation have to win the affections of mankind.", "1381": "There are extant letters from Philip, from Antipater, and from Anti-onus, three of the wisest men we meet with in history, to their sons Alexander, Cas- sander, and Philip, recommending to them to draw the minds of the people to kindly sentiments by a generous style of discourse, and to engage their soldiers by a winning address.",

defence.", "1388": "Of those, though the latter is preferable in point of honour ;", "1389": "yet the other has often been approved.", "1390": "I have spoken a little before of Crassus ;", "1391": "Marcus Antonius when a youth did the same.", "1392": "An accusation also displayed the eloquence of Publius Sulpicius, when he brought to trial Caius Norba- nus, a seditious and worthless citizen.", "1393": "But in truth, we ought not to do this frequently nor ever, except for the sake of our country, as in the cases I have mentioned;", "1394": "or for the purpose of revenge,* as the two Lu- culli did;", "1395": "or by way of patronage, as I did on behalf of the Sicilians, or as Julius did in the case of Albucius on behalf of the Sardians.", "1396": "The diligence of Lucius Fufius was dis- played in the impeachment of Manius Aquillius.", "1397": "For once therefore it may be done;", "1398": "or at all events not often.", "1399": "But if a man should be under a necessity of doing it oftener, let him perform it as a duty to his country, for it is by no means blameworthy to carry on repeated prosecutions against her enemies.", "1400": "But still let moderation be observed.", "1401": "For it seems to be the part of a cruel man, or rather scar rely of man at all, to endanger the lives of many.", "1402": "It is both dangerous to your person, and disgraceful to your character, so to act as to get the name of an accuser, as happened in the case of Marcus Brutus, a man sprung from a most noble family, and son to the eminent adept in civil law.", "1403": "Moreover, this precept of duty also must be carefully ob- served, that you never arraign an innocent man on trial for his life, for this can by no means be done without heinous guilt.", "1404": "For what can be so unnatural as to prostitute to the persecution and the ruin of the good, that eloquence which nature has given us for the safety and preservation of man- kind.", "1405": "Although, however, this is to be avoided, yet we are not to consider it a religious duty never to defend a guilty party, so that he be not abominable and impious.", "1406": "The people desire this, custom tolerates it, and humanity suffers it.", "1407": "The duty of a judge in all trials is to follow truth;", "1408": "that of a pleader, sometimes to maintain the plausible though it may not be the truth,* which I should not, especially as I am now treating of philosophy, venture to write, were it not likewise the opinion of a man of the greatest weight among the Stoics.", "1409": "Panætius.", "1410": "But it is by defences that glory and favour also are acquired in the greatest degree ;", "1411": "and so much the greater, if at any time it happens that we come to the help of one who seems to be circumvented and oppressed by the influence of some powerful man, as I myself have done both in other cases frequently, and when a youth in defence of Sextus Roscitis Amerinus, against the influence of Lucius Sylla, then in power, which speech, as you know, is extant.", "1412": "XV.", "1413": "But having explained the duties of young men, which avail to the attainment of glory, we have next to speak about beneficence and liberality, the nature of which is twofold;", "1414": "for a kindness is done to those who need it, by giving either our labour or our money.", "1415": "The latter is easier, especially to a wealthy person ;", "1416": "but the former is the more noble and splendid, and more worthy of a brave and illus- trious man ;", "1417": "for although there exists in both a liberal incli- nation to oblige, yet the one is a draft on our purse, the other on our virtue, and bounty which is given out of our income exhausts the very source of the munificence.", "1418": "Thus benignity is done away by benignity, and the greater the number you have exercised it upon, so much the less able are you to exercise it oil many.", "1419": "But they who will be beneficent and liberal of their labour, that is, of their virtue and industry, in the first place, will have by how much greater the number of persons they shall have served, so much the more coadjutors in their beneficence.", "1420": "And in the next place, by the habit of beneficence they will be the better prepared, and, as it were, better exercised to de- serve well of many.", "1421": "Philip, in a certain letter, admirably reproves his son Alexander, because he sought to gain the goodwill of the Macedonians by largesses—\"Pest!\" he says, \"what consideration led you into the hope that you could imagine that they whom you have corrupted with money would be faithful to you ?", "1422": "Are you aiming at this, that the Macedonians should expect you will be, not their king, but their agent and purveyor.\"", "1423": "He says well, \"agent and purveyor,\" because that is undignified in a king;", "1424": "and still better, because he designates a largess a corrupt bribe;", "1425": "for he who receives becomes the worse for it, and more ready always to expect the same.", "1426": "He enjoined this on his son, but we may consider it a precept for all men.", "1427": "Wherefore, this indeed is not doubtful, that such beneficence as consists of labour and industry is both the more honourable, and ex- tends more widely, and can serve a greater number.", "1428": "Some- times, however, we must make presents-nor is this sort of beneficence to be altogether repudiated;", "1429": "and oftentimes we ought to communicate from our fortune to suitable persons, who are in need, but carefully and moderately.", "1430": "For many persons have squandered their patrimonies by unadvised ge- nerosity.", "1431": "Now, what is more absurd than to bring it to pass that you can no longer do that which you would willingly do ?", "1432": "And moreover, rapine follows profuseness.", "1433": "For when, by giving, they begin to be in want, they are forced to lay their hands upon other men's property.", "1434": "Thus, when, for the sako of procuring goodwill, they mean to be beneficent, they ac- quire not so much the affection of those to whom they give as the hatred of those from whom they take.", "1435": "Wherefore, our purse should neither be so closed up that our generosity cannot open it, nor so unfastened that it lies open to all-a bound should be set, and it should bear reference to our means.", "1436": "We ought altogether to remember that saying which, from being very often used by our countrymen, has come into the usage of a proverb, that bounty has no bottom.", "1437": "For what bounds can there be, when both they who have been accustomed to receive, and other persons, are desiring the same thing ?XVI.", "1438": "There are two kinds of men who give largely, of whom one kind are prodigal, the other liberal.", "1439": "The prodigal are those who with entertainments, and distributions of meat to the populace, and gladiatorial exhibitions, and the appa- ratus of the stage and the chase, lavish their money upon those things of which they will leave behind either a tran- sient memory, or none at all.", "1440": "But the liberal are they who, with their fortunes, either redeem those captured by robbers, or take up the debts of their friends, or aid in the establish- ing of their daughters, or assist them either in seeking or increasing their fortunes.", "1441": "Therefore, I am astonished what could come into the mind of Theophrastus, in that book which he wrote about riches, in which he has said many things well, but this most absurdly.", "1442": "For lie is lavish in praise of magnificence, and of the furnishing of popular exhibitions, and he considers the means of supplying such expenses to be the grand advantage of wealth.", "1443": "Now, to me that enjoyment of liberality of which I have given a few examples, seems much greater and surer.", "1444": "With how much more weight and truth does Aristotle censure such of us as feel no astonishment at that profusion of wealth which is wasted in courting the people;", "1445": "\"if,\" says he, \"they who are besieged by an enemy should be compelled to purchase a pint of water at a mina,* this, on first hearing, would seem to us incredible, and all would be astonished, but when we reflect upon it, we excuse it for its necessity;", "1446": "while in these pieces of immense extravagance and unbounded expense, we do not feel greatly astonished.\"", "1447": "And he censures us, especially, \"because we are neither relieving necessity, nor is our dignity increased, and the very delight of the multitude is for a brief and little space, and only felt by the most giddy, even in whom, how- ever, at the same time with the satiety, the memory of the pleasure likewise dies.\"", "1448": "He sums up well, too, that \" these things are agreeable to boys, and silly women, and slaves, and freemen very like slaves;", "1449": "but that by a man of sense, and one who ponders with sound judgment on such exhibi- tions, they can in no way be approved.\"", "1450": "Though I know that in our state it is established by ancient usage, and even now in the good times, that the splendour of ædileships* is expected even from the most excellent men.", "1451": "Therefore, both Publius Crassus, wealthy as well in name as in fortune, dis- charged the office of ædile with the most magnificent enter- tainment;", "1452": "and, a little while after, Lucius Crassus, with Quintus Mucius, the most moderate of all men.", "1453": "served a most magnificent ædileship;", "1454": "and next, Caius Claudius, son of Appius;", "1455": "many subsequently-the Luculli, Hortensius, Sila- nus;", "1456": "but Publius Lentulus, in my consulship, surpasssd all his predecessors.", "1457": "Scaurus imitated him;", "1458": "but the shows of my friend Pompey, in his second consulship, were the most magnificent of all-concerning all of whom, you see what is my opinion.", "1459": "XVII.", "1460": "Nevertheless, the suspicion of avarice should be avoided.", "1461": "The omitting of the ædileship caused the rejection of Mamercus, a very wealthy man, from the consulship.", "1462": "Wherefore it must be done if it be required by the people, and good men, if not desiring, at least approve it, but in proportion to our means, as I myself did it;", "1463": "and again, if some object of greater magnitude and utility is acquired by popular largess, as lately the dinners in the streets, under pretext of a vow of a tenth,† brought great honour to Orestes.", "1464": "Nor was ever any fault found with Marcus Seius, because in the scarcity he gave corn to the people at an as the bushel.", "1465": "For he delivered himself from a great and in- veterate dislike by an expense neither disgraceful, since he was ædile at the time, nor excessive.", "1466": "But it lately brought the greatest honour to our friend Milo, that with gladiators, hired for the sake of the republic, which was held together by my safety, he repressed all the attempts and madness of Publius Clodius.", "1467": "The justification, therefore, of profuse bounty is that it is either necessary or useful.", "1468": "Moreover, in these very cases the rule of mediocrity is the best.", "1469": "Lucius Philippus, indeed, the son of Quintus, a man in the highest degree illustrious for his great genius, used to boast that without any expense lie had attained all the highest honours that could be obtained.", "1470": "Cotta said the same, and Curio.", "1471": "I myself, too, might in some degree boast on this subject;", "1472": "for considering the amplitude of the honours which I attained with all the votes in my own* year, too-a thing that happened to none of those whom I have just named-the expense of my ædileship was certainly trifling.", "1473": "These expenses also are more justifiable on walls, docks, ports, aqueducts, and all things which pertain to the service of the state, though what is given as it were into our hands is more agreeable at present, yet these things are more acceptable to posterity.", "1474": "Theatres, porticos, new temples, I censure with more reserve for Pompey's sake, but the most learned men disapprove of them, as also this very Panætius, whom in these books I have closely followed, though not translated ;", "1475": "and Demetrius Phalereus, who censures Pericles, the greatest man of Greece, because he lavished so much money on that glorious vestibule ;", "1476": "† but all this subject I have carefully discussed in those books which I have written upon Government.", "1477": "The whole plan, then, of such largesses is vicious in its nature, but necessitated by particular occa- sions, and even then ought to be accommodated to our means, and regulated by moderation.", "1478": "XVIII.", "1479": "But in that second kind of munificence which proceeds from liberality, we ought in different cases to be affected in different manners.", "1480": "The case is different of him who is oppressed with misfortune, and of him who seeks to better his fortune without being in any adversity.", "1481": "Our benignity will require to be more prompt toward the dis- tressed, unless perhaps they merit their distress ;", "1482": "yet from those who desire to be assisted, not that they may be relieved from affliction, but that they may ascend to a higher degree, we ought by no means to be altogether restricted, but to apply judgment and discretion in selecting proper persons.", "1483": "For Ennius observes well-\" Benefactions ill bestowed, I deem malefactions.", "1484": "\"But in that which is bestowed upon a worthy and grateful man there is profit, as well from himself as also from others ;", "1485": "for liberality, when free from rashness, is most agreeable, and many applaud it the more earnestly on this account, because the bounty of every very exalted man is the common refuge of all.", "1486": "We should do our endeavour, then, that we may serve as many as possible with those benefits, the recol- lection of which may be handed down to their children and posterity, that it may not be in their power to be ungrateful;", "1487": "for all men detest one forgetful of a benefit, and they consider that an injury is done even to themselves by discouraging liberality, and that he who does so is the common enemy of the poor.", "1488": "And besides, that benignity is useful to the state by which captives are redeemed from slavery, and the poor are enriched.", "1489": "That it was indeed the common custom that this should be done by our order,* we see copiously described in the speech of Crassus.", "1490": "This kind of bounty, therefore, I prefer far before the munificent exhibition of shows.", "1491": "That is the part of dignified and great men—this of flatterers of the populace, tickling, as it were, with pleasures the levity of the multitude.", "1492": "It will, moreover, be expedient that a man, as he should be munificent in giving, so that he should not be harsh in exacting ;", "1493": "and in every contract, in selling, buying, hiring, letting, to be just and good-natured to the vicinage and surrounding occupiers ;", "1494": "conceding to many much that is his own right, but shunning disputes as far as he can conveniently, and I know not but even a little more than he can conveniently.", "1495": "For, to abate at times a little from our rights, is not only generous, but sometimes profitable also.", "1496": "But of our property, which it is truly disgraceful to allow to get dilapidated, care must be taken, but in such a way that the suspicion of shabbiness and avarice be avoided.", "1497": "For to be able to practise liberality, not stripping ourselves of our patrimony, is indeed the greatest enjoyment of wealth.", "1498": "Hospitality also has been justly recommended by Theo- phrastus.", "1499": "For, as it appears to me, indeed, it is very decorous that the houses of illustrious men should be open for illustrious guests.", "1500": "And that also brings credit to the state, that foreigners in our city should not fail of ex- periencing this species of liberality.", "1501": "It is, moreover, exceed- ingly useful to those who wish to be very powerful in an honourable way, to get the command over wealth and interest among foreign nations, through their guests.", "1502": "Theophrastus, indeed, writes that Cymon at Athens practised hospitality even towards his brethren of the Lacian tribe ;", "1503": "for that he so directed and commanded his stewards, that all things should be supplied to any of them that should turn aside into his villa.", "1504": "XIX.", "1505": "Now, those benefits which are bestowed out of our labour, not our money, are conferred as well upon the entire commonwealth, as upon individual citizens.", "1506": "For to give legal opinions, to assist with counsel, and to serve as many as we can with this kind of knowledge, tends very much to increase both our means and our interest.", "1507": "This, therefore, as well as many things about our ancestors, was noble, that the knowledge and interpretation of our most excellently constituted civil law was always in the highest repute ;", "1508": "which, indeed, before this confusion of the present times, the nobles retained in their own possession.", "1509": "Now, like honours -like all the degrees of rank, so the splendour of this science is extinguished ;", "1510": "and this is the more unmeet on this account, because it has happened at the very time when he* was in existence who far surpassed in this science all who went before, to whom also he was equal in dignity.", "1511": "This labour, then, is acceptable to many, and suited to bind men to us by benefits.", "1512": "But the talent of speaking, being very closely connected with this art, is more dignified, more agree- able, and capable of higher ornament.", "1513": "For what is more excellent than eloquence, in the admiration of the hearers, or in the expectation of those in need of its assistance, or in the gratitude of those who have been defended ?", "1514": "To this, then, the first rank of civil dignity was given by our ancestors.", "1515": "Of an eloquent man, then, and one willingly labouring, and, what is according to the customs of our forefathers, defending the causes of many, both ungrudgingly and gratuitously, the benefits and patronage are very extensive.", "1516": "The subject would admonish me that at this opportunity I should likewise deplore the discontinuance, not to call it the extinction, of eloquence, did I not apprehend lest I should appear to be making some complaint upon my own account.", "1517": "However, we see what orators are extinct, in how few there is promise, in how much fewer ability, in how many pre- sumption.", "1518": "But though all, or even many, cannot be skilful in the law, or eloquent, yet it is in a man's power, by his exertions, to be of service to many, by asking benefits for them, commending them to judges and magistrates, watch- ing the interests of others, entreating in their behalf those very advocates who either are consulted or defend causes.", "1519": "They who act thus, gain a great deal of influence, and their industry diffuses itself most extensively.", "1520": "Furthermore, they need not be admonished of this (for it is obvious), that they take care to offend none while they are wishing to serve others.", "1521": "For oftentime they offend either those whom it is their duty or whom it is their interest not to offend.", "1522": "If un- wittingly they do it, it is a fault of negligence;", "1523": "if knowingly, of rashness.", "1524": "It is necessary, too, that you make an apology, in whatever way you can, to those whom you unwillingly of- fend-how that which you did was of necessity, and that you could not do otherwise;", "1525": "and it will be necessary to make compensation to them for what injury you have inflicted by other efforts and good offices.", "1526": "XX.", "1527": "But since, in rendering services to men, it is usual to look either to their character or their fortune, it is easy, indeed, to say, and so people commonly say, that in bestow- ing benefits they only attend to a man's character, not to his- fortune.", "1528": "It is a fine speech ;", "1529": "but pray is there any one who in rendering a service would not prefer the thanks of a rich and powerful man before the cause of a poor, though most worthy man ?", "1530": "For in general our goodwill is more inclined towards him from whom it appears that remuneration would be easier and quicker.", "1531": "But we ought to consider more at- tentively what the nature of things is:", "1532": "for of course that poor man, if he be a good man, though he cannot requite a kindness, can at least have a sense of it.", "1533": "Now it was well said, whoever said it, \" that he who hath the loan of money, hath not repaid;", "1534": "and he who hath repaid, bath not the loan.", "1535": "But both he who hath requited kindness hath a sense of it, and he who hath a sense of it* bath requited.\"", "1536": "But they who consider themselves wealthy, honoured, pros- perous, do not wish even to be bound by a benefit.", "1537": "More- over, they consider that they have conferred a favour when they themselves have received one, however great;", "1538": "and they also suspect that something is either sought or expected from them:", "1539": "but they think it like death to them that they should need patronage, and be called clients.", "1540": "But, on the other hand, that poor man, because in whatever is done for him he thinks it is himself and not his fortune that is regarded, is anxious that he may be seen to be grateful, not only by him who has merited it from him, but also by those from whom he expects the like (for he needs it from many).", "1541": "Nor indeed does he magnify with words any favour of his own doing, if by chance he confers one, but rather undervalues it.", "1542": "And this is to be considered, that if you defend a man of power and fortune, the gratitude is confined to himself alone, or perhaps to his children ;", "1543": "but if you defend a poor but worthy and modest man, all poor men who are not worthless (which is a vast multitude among the people) see a protection offered to themselves:", "1544": "wherefore, I think it better that a favour should be bestowed upon worthy per- sons than upon persons of fortune.", "1545": "We should by all means endeavour to satisfy every description of people.", "1546": "But if the matter shall come to competition, undoubtedly Themistocles is to be received as an authority, who, when he was consulted whether a man should marry his daughter to a worthy poor man, or to a rich man of less approved character, said, \" I certainly would rather she married a man without money, than money without a man.", "1547": "\"But our morals are corrupted and depraved by the admi- ration of other men's wealth.", "1548": "Though what concern is its amount to any of us ?", "1549": "Perhaps it is of use to him who owns it;", "1550": "not always even that:", "1551": "but admit that it is of use to him- self, to be sure he is able to spend more, but how is he an honester man ?", "1552": "But if he shall be a good man besides, let his riches not prevent him from getting our assistance-only let them not help him to get it, and let the entire consideration be, not how wealthy, but how worthy each individual is.", "1553": "But the last precept about benefits and bestowing our labour is, do nothing hostile to equity-nothing in defence of in- justice.", "1554": "For the foundation of lasting commendation and fame is justice-without which nothing can be laudable.", "1555": "XXI.", "1556": "But since I have finished speaking about that kind of benefits which have regard to a single citizen,

citizens collectively;", "1558": "some are such that they reach to all individually, which are likewise the more agreeable.", "1559": "The effort is by all means to be made, if possible, to consult for both, and notwithstanding, to consult also for them indivi- dually ;", "1560": "but in such a manner that this may either serve, or at least should not oppose, the public interest.", "1561": "The grant of corn proposed by Caius Gracchus was large, and therefore would have exhausted the treasury;", "1562": "that of Marcus Octavius was moderate, both able to be borne by the state, and neces-

this kind of injustice, the Lacedæmonians expelled their Ephorus Lysander, and put to death their king Agis—a thing which never before had happened among them.", "1610": "And from that time such great dissensions ensued, that tyrants arose, and the nobles were exiled, and a constitution admirably established fell to pieces.", "1611": "Nor did it fall alone, but also overthrew the rest of Greece by the contagion of evil principles, which having sprung from the Lacedæmonians, flowed far and wide.", "1612": "What!", "1613": "was it not the agrarian contentions that destroyed our own Gracehi sons of that most illustrious man Tiberius Grac- chus, and grandsons of Africanus ?", "1614": "But, on the contrary, Aratus, the Sicyonian, is justly commended, who, when his native city had been held for fifty years by tyrants, having set out from Argos to Sicyon, by a secret entrance got possession of the city, and when on a sudden he had over- thrown the tyrant Nicocles, he restored six hundred exiles, who had been the wealthiest men of that state, and restored freedom to the state by his coming.", "1615": "But when he perceived a great difficulty about the goods and possessions, because he considered it most unjust both that they whom he had restored, of whose property others had been in possession, should be in want, and he did not think it very fair that possessions of fifty years should be disturbed, because that after so long an interval many of those properties were got possession of without injustice, by inheritance, many by purchase, many by marriage portions ;", "1616": "he judged neither that the properties ought to be taken from the latter, nor that these to whom they had belonged should be without satis- faction.", "1617": "When, then, he had concluded that there was need of money to arrange that matter, he said that he would go to Alexandria, and ordered the matter to be undisturbed until his return.", "1618": "He quickly came to his friend Ptolemy, who was then reigning, the second after the building of Alexandria, and when he bad explained to him that he was desirous to liberate his country, and informed him of the case, this most eminent man readily received consent from the opulent king that he should be assisted with a large sum of money.", "1619": "When he had brought this to Sicyon, he took to himself for his council fifteen noblemen, with whom he took cognizance of the cases, both of those who held other persons' possessions, and of those who had lost their own ;", "1620": "and by valuing the possessions.", "1621": "he so managed as to persuade some to prefer receiving the money, and yielding up the possessions ;", "1622": "others to think it more convenient that there should be paid down to them what was the price, rather than they should resume possession of their own.", "1623": "Thus it was brought about that all departed without a complaint, and concord was established.", "1624": "Admirable man, and worthy to have been born in our nation !", "1625": "Thus it is right to act with citizens, not (as we have now seen twice)* to fix up a spear in the forum, and subject the goods of the citizens to the voice of the auctioneer.", "1626": "But that Greek thought, as became a wise and superior man, that it was necessary to consult for all.", "1627": "And this is the highest 0 reason and wisdom of a good citizen, not to make divisions in the interests of the citizens, but to govern all by the same equity.", "1628": "Should any dwell free of expense in another man's house ?", "1629": "Why so ?", "1630": "Is it that when I shall have bought, built, repaired, expended, you, without my will, should enjoy what Is mine ?", "1631": "What else is this but to take from some what is theirs ;", "1632": "to give to some what Is another man's ?", "1633": "But what is the meaning of an abolition of debts, unless that you should buy an estate with my money-that you should have the estate, and I should not have my money ?XXIV.", "1634": "Wherefore, it ought to be provided that there be not such an amount of debt as may injure the state—a thing which may be guarded against in many ways ;", "1635": "not that if there shall be such debt the rich should lose their rights, and the debtors gain what is another's—for nothing holds the state more firmly together than public credit, which cannot at all exist unless the payment of money lent shall be compulsory.", "1636": "It never was more violently agitated than in my consulship, that debts should not be paid ;", "1637": "the matter was tried in arms and camps, by every rank and description of men, whom I resisted in such a manner, that this mischief of such magnitude was removed from the state.", "1638": "Never was debt either greater, or better and more easily paid.", "1639": "For the hope of defrauding being frustrated, the necessity of paying followed.", "1640": "But on the other hand, this man, now our victor,* but who was vanquished then, has accomplished the things which he had in view, when it was now a matter of no importance to himself.", "1641": "So great was the desire in him of doing wrong, that the mere wrong- doing delighted him, although there was not a motive for it.", "1642": "From this kind of liberality, then, to give to some, to take from others, they will keep aloof who would preserve the commonwealth, and will take particular care that each may hold his own in equity of right and judgments ;", "1643": "and neither that advantage be taken of the poorer class, on account of their humbleness, nor that envy be prejudicial to the rich, either in keeping or recovering their own.", "1644": "They will besides increase the power of the state in whatever way they can, either abroad or at home, in authority, territories, tributes.", "1645": "These are the duties of great men.", "1646": "These were practised among our ancestors ;", "1647": "they who persevere in those kinds of duties, will, along with the highest advantage to the republic, themselves obtain both great popularity and glory.", "1648": "Now, in these precepts about things profitable, Antipater the Tyrian, a Stoic, who lately died at Athens, considers that two things are passed over by Panætius-the care of health and of property-which matters I fancy were passed over by that very eminent philosopher because they were obvious ;", "1649": "they certainly are useful.", "1650": "Now, health is supported by under- standing one's own constitution, and by observing what things are accustomed to do one good or injuryt ;", "1651": "and by temperance in all food and manner of living, for the sake of preserving the body;", "1652": "and by forbearance in pleasures ;", "1653": "and lastly, by the skill of those to whose profession these things belong.", "1654": "Wealth ought to be acquired by those means in which there is no disgrace, but preserved by diligence and frugality, and increased, too, by the same means.", "1655": "These matters Xenophon, the Socratic philosopher, has discussed very completely in that book which is entitled Œconomics, which I, when I was about that age at which you are now, translated from the Greek into Latin.", "1656": "XXV.", "1657": "But a comparison of profitable things, since this was the fourth head, but passed over by Panætius, is often necessary.", "1658": "For it is usual to compare the good estate of the body with external advantages, and external with those of the body, and those of the body among themselves, and external with external.", "1659": "The good estate of the body is compared with external advantages in this manner, that you had rather be healthy than wealthy.", "1660": "External with those of the body in this manner, to be wealthy rather than of the greatest physical strength.", "1661": "Those of the body among them- ,,-elves, thus, that good health should be preferred to pleasure, and strength to speed.", "1662": "But the comparison of external objects is thus, that glory should be preferred to wealth, a city income to a country one.", "1663": "Of which kind of comparison is that reply of Cato the elder, of whom, when inquiry was made, what was the best policy in the management of one's property, he answered, \" Good grazing.\" \" What was next ?\" ,;", "1664": "Tolerable grazing.\"", "1665": "\"What third?\" \" Bad grazing.\"", "1666": "\"What fourth ?\" \"Tilling.\"", "1667": "And when he who had interrogated him inquired, \" What do you think of lending at usury ?\"", "1668": "Then Cato answered, \" What do you think of killing a man ?\"*", "1669": "From which, and many other things, it ought to be understood that it is usual to make comparisons of profitable things;", "1670": "and that this was rightly added as a fourth head of investigating our duties.", "1671": "But about this entire head, about gaining money, about letting it out, also about spending it, the matter is discussed to more advantage by certain most estimable persons.", "1672": "sitting at the middle Janus, than by any philosophers in any school.", "1673": "Yet these things ought to be understood ;", "1674": "for they relate to utility, about which we have discoursed in this book.", "1675": "We will next pass to what remains.", "1676": "END OF SECOND HOOK.I.", "1677": "PUBLIUS SCIPIO, my son Marcus, he who first was surnamed Africanus, was accustomed, as Cato, who was nearly of the same age as he, has written, to say \" that he was never less at leisure than when at leisure, nor less alone than when be was alone.\"", "1678": "A truly noble saying, and worthy of a great and wise man, which declares that both in his leisure he was accustomed to reflect on business, and in solitude to converse with himself;", "1679": "so that he never was idle, and sometimes was not in need of the conversation of an- other.", "1680": "Thus, leisure and solitude, two things which cause languor to others, sharpened him.", "1681": "I could wish it were in my power to say the same.", "1682": "But if I cannot quite attain to any intimation of so great an excellence of disposition, I come very near it, in will at least.", "1683": "For, being debarred by impious arms and force from public affairs and forensic business, I remain in retirement;", "1684": "and on that account having left the city, wandering about the fields, I am often alone.", "1685": "But neither is this leisure to be compared with the leisure of Africanus, nor this solitude with that.", "1686": "For he, reposing from the most honourable employments of the state, sometimes took leisure to himself, and sometimes betook himself from the concourse and haunts of men into his soli- tude as into a haven:", "1687": "but my retirement is occasioned by the want of business, not by the desire of repose.", "1688": "For, the senate being extinct, and courts of justice abolished, what is there that I could do worthy of myself, either in the senate- house or in the forum ?", "1689": "Thus, I who formerly lived in the greatest celebrity, and before the eyes of the citizens, now shunning the sight of wicked men, with whom all places abound, conceal myself as far as it is possible, and often am alone.", "1690": "But since we have been taught by learned men, that out of evils it is fit not only to choose the least, but also from those very evils to gather whatever good is in them, I therefore am both enjoying rest-not such, indeed, as he ought who formerly procured rest for the state,-and I am not allowing that solitude which necessity, not inclination, brings me, to be spent in idleness.", "1691": "Although, in my judg- ment, Africanus obtained greater praise.", "1692": "For there are ex- tant no monuments of his genius committed to writing- no work of his leisure-no employment of his solitude.", "1693": "From which it ought to be understood, that he was never either idle or solitary, because of the activity of his mind, and the investigation of those things which he pursued in thought.", "1694": "But I who have not so much strength that I can be drawn away from solitude by silent thought, turn all my study and care to this labour of composition.", "1695": "And thus I have written more in a short time, since the overthrow of the republic, than in the many years while it stood.", "1696": "II.", "1697": "But as all philosophy, my Cicero, is fruitful and pro- fitable, and no part of it uncultivated and desert-so no part in it is more fruitful and profitable than that about duties, from which the.", "1698": "rules of living consistently and virtuously are derived.", "1699": "Wherefore, although I trust you constantly hear and learn these matters from my friend Cratippus, the prince of the philosophers within our memory, yet I think it is beneficial that your ears should ring on all sides with such discourse, and that they, if it were possible, should hear nothing else.", "1700": "Which, as it ought to be done by all who design to enter upon a virtuous life, so I know not but it ought by no one more than you ;", "1701": "for you stand under no small expectation of emulating my industry-under a great one of emulating my honours-under no small one, per- haps, of my fame.", "1702": "Besides, you have incurred a heavy responsi- bility both from Athens and Cratippus;", "1703": "and since you have gone to these as to a mart for good qualities, it would be most scandalous to return empty, disgracing the reputation both of the city and of the master.", "1704": "Wherefore, try and ac- complish as much as you can, labour with your mind and with your industry (if it be labour to learn rather than a pleasure), and do not permit that, when all things have been supplied by me, you should seem to have been wanting to yourself.", "1705": "But let this suffice;", "1706": "for we have often written much to you for the purpose of encouraging you.", "1707": "Now let us return to the remaining part of our proposed division.", "1708": "Panætius, then, who without controversy has discoursed most accurately about duties, and whom I, making some cor- rection, have principally followed, having proposed three heads under which men were accustomed to deliberate and consult about duty-one, when they were in doubt whether that about which they were considering was virtuous or base;", "1709": "another, whether useful or unprofitable;", "1710": "a third, when that which had the appearance of virtue was in opposition to that which seemed useful, how this ought to be determined ;", "1711": "he unfolded the two first heads in three books, but on the third head he said that he would afterwards write, but did not perform what he had promised.", "1712": "At which I am the more surprised on this account, that it is recorded by his disciple Posidonius, that Panætius lived thirty years after he had published those books.", "1713": "And I am surprised that this matter should be only briefly touched on by Posidonius in some commentaries, especially when he writes that there is no subject in all philosophy so necessary.", "1714": "But by no means do I agree with those who deny that this subject was casually omitted by Panætius, but that it was designedly abandoned, and that it ought not to have been written at all, because utility could never be in opposition to virtue.", "1715": "On which point is one thing that may admit a doubt;", "1716": "whether this head, which is third in the division of Panætius, ought to have been taken up, or whether it ought to have been altogether omitted.", "1717": "The other thing cannot be doubted, that it was undertaken by Panætius, but left unfinished.", "1718": "For he who has completed two parts out of a three-fold division, must have a third remaining.", "1719": "Besides, in the end of the third book he promises that he will afterwards write about this third part.", "1720": "To this is also added a sufficient witness, Posi- donius, who in a certain letter writes that Publius Rutilius Rufus, who had been a disciple of Panætius, had been ac- customed to say, that as no painter could be found who could finish that part of the Coan Venus which Apelles had left unfinished (for the beauty of the countenance left no hope of making the rest of the body correspond), so no one could go through with those things which Panætius had omitted, on account of the excellence of those parts which he had com- pleted.", "1721": "III.", "1722": "Wherefore, there cannot be a doubt about the opinion of Panætius;", "1723": "but whether it was right in him, or otherwise, to join this third part to the investigation of duty, about this, perhaps, there may be a question.", "1724": "For whether virtue be the only good, as is the opinion of the Stoics, or whether that which is virtuous be, as it appears to your Peripatetics, so much the greatest good, that all things placed on the other side have scarcely the smallest weight;", "1725": "it is not to be doubted but that utility never can compare with virtue.", "1726": "Therefore we have learned that Socrates used to execrate those who had first separated in theory those things cohering in nature.", "1727": "To whom, indeed, the Stoics have so far assented, that they considered that whatever is virtuous is useful, and that no- thing can be useful which is not virtuous.", "1728": "But if Panætius was one who would say that virtue was to be cultivated only on this account, because it was a means of procuring profit, as they do who measure the desirableness of objects either by pleasure or by the absence of pain, it would be allowable for him to say that our interest sometimes is opposed to virtue.", "1729": "But as he was one who judged that alone to be good which is virtuous, but that of such things as oppose this with some appearance of utility, neither the accession can make life better, nor the loss make it worse, it appears that he ought not to have introduced a deliberation of this kind, in which what seems profitable could be compared with that which is virtuous.", "1730": "For what is called the summum bonum by the Stoics, to live agreeably to nature, has, I conceive, this meaning-always to conform to virtue;", "1731": "and as to all other things which may be according to nature, to take them if they should not be repugnant to virtue.", "1732": "And since this is so, some think that this comparison is improperly in- troduced, and that no principle should be laid down upon this head.", "1733": "And, indeed, that perfection of conduct which is properly and truly called so, exists in the wise alone, and can never be separated from virtue.", "1734": "But in those persons in whom there is not perfect wisdom, that perfection can indeed by no means exist;", "1735": "but the likeness of it can.", "1736": "For the Stoics call all those duties about which we are discours- ing in these books, mean duties (media officia).", "1737": "These are common, and extend widely, which many attain by the good- ness of natural disposition, and by progressive improvement.", "1738": "But that duty which the same philosophers call right (rec- turn), is perfect and absolute, and, as the same philosophers say, has all the parts perfect, and cannot fall to the lot of any but the wise man.", "1739": "But when anything is performed in which mean duties appear, it seems to be abundantly perfect, because the vulgar do not at all understand how far it falls short of the perfect;", "1740": "but as far as they understand, they think there is nothing wanting.", "1741": "Which same thing comes to pass in poems, in pictures, and in many other matters, that those things which should not be commended, the un- skilful are delighted with and commend;", "1742": "on this account, I suppose, that there is in these things some merit which catches the unskilful, who indeed are unable to judge what deficiency there may be in each.", "1743": "Therefore, when they are apprised of it by the initiated, they readily abandon their opinion.", "1744": "IV.", "1745": "These duties, then, of which we are discoursing in these books, they* say are virtuous in some secondary degree -not peculiar to the wise alone, but common to every de- scription of men.", "1746": "By these, therefore, all are moved in whom there is a natural disposition towards virtue.", "1747": "Nor, indeed, when the two Decii or the two Scipios are comme- morated as brave men, or when Fabricius and Aristides are called just, is either an example of fortitude looked for from the former, or of justice from the latter, as from wise men.", "1748": "For neither of these was wise in such a sense as we wish the term wise man to be understood.", "1749": "Nor were these who were esteemed and named wise, Marcus Cato and Caius Lælius, wise men;", "1750": "nor were even those famous seven,t but from the frequent performance of mean duties they bore some simili- tude and appearance of wise men.", "1751": "Wherefore, it is neither right to compare that which is truly virtuous with what is repugnant to utility, nor should that which we commonly call virtuous, which is cultivated by those who wish to be esteemed good men, ever be compared with profits.", "1752": "And that virtue which falls within our comprehension is as much to be maintained and preserved by us, as that which is properly called, and which truly is virtue, is by the wise.", "1753": "For otherwise, whatever advancement is made towards vir- tue, it cannot be maintained.", "1754": "But these remarks are made regarding those who are considered good men, on account of their observance of duties ;", "1755": "but those who measure all things by profit and advantage, and who do not consider that those things are outweighed by virtue, are accustomed, in deliberating, to compare virtue with that which they think profitable ;", "1756": "good men are not so accustomed.", "1757": "There- fore, I think that Panætius, when he said that men were accustomed to deliberate on this comparison, meant this very thing which he expressed,-only that it was their cus- tom, not that it was also their duty.", "1758": "For not only to think more of what seems profitable than what is virtuous, but even to compare them one with the other, and to hesitate between them, is most shameful.", "1759": "What is it, then.", "1760": "that is accustomed at times to raise a doubt, and seems necessary to be considered ?", "1761": "I believe, whenever a doubt arises, it is what the character of that action may be about which one is considering.", "1762": "For oftentimes it happens, that what is accustomed to be generally considered disreputable, may be found not to be disreputable.", "1763": "For the sake of ex- ample, let a case be supposed which has a wide applica- tion.", "1764": "What can be greater wickedness than to slay not only a man, but even an intimate friend ?", "1765": "Has he then in- volved himself in guilt, who slays a tyrant, however inti- mate ?", "1766": "He does not appear so to the Roman people at least, who of all great exploits deem that the most honourable.*", "1767": "Has expediency, then, overcome virtue ?", "1768": "Kay, rather, expe- diency has followed virtue.", "1769": "Therefore, that we may be able to decide without any mistake, if ever that which we call expediency (utile) shall appear to be at variance with that which we understand to be virtuous (honestum), a certain rule ought to be established, which if we will fol- low in comparing such cases, we shall never fail in our duty.", "1770": "But this rule will be one conformable to the reason- ing and discipline of the Stoics chiefly, which, indeed, we are following in these books, because, though both by the ancient Academicians and by your Peripatetics, who for- merly were the same sect, things which are virtuous are preferred to those which seem expedient;", "1771": "nevertheless, those subjects are more nobly treated of by those* to whom whatever is virtuous seems also expedient, and nothing ex- pedient which is not virtuous, than by those according to whom that may be virtuous which is not expedient, and that expedient which is not virtuous.", "1772": "But to us, our Academic, sect gives this great licence, that we, whatever may seem most probable, by our privilege are at liberty to maintain.", "1773": "But I return to my rule.", "1774": "V.", "1775": "To take away wrongfully, then, from another, and for one man to advance his own interest by the disadvantage of another man, is more contrary to nature than death, than poverty, than pain, than any other evils which can befall either our bodies or external circumstances.", "1776": "For, in the first place, it destroys human intercourse and society;", "1777": "for if we will be so disposed that each for his own gain shall despoil or offer violence to another, the inevitable conse- quence is, that the society of the human race, which is most consistent with nature, will be broken asunder.", "1778": "As, supposing each member of the body was so disposed as to think it could be well if it should draw to itself the health of the adjacent member, it is inevitable that the whole body would be debilitated and would perish ;", "1779": "so if each of us should seize for himself the interests of another, and wrest whatever he could from each for the sake of his own emolument, the necessary consequence is, that human society and community would be overturned.", "1780": "It is indeed allowed, nature not opposing, that each should rather acquire for himself than for another, whatever pertains to the enjoyment of life;", "1781": "but nature does not allow this, that by the spoliation of others we should increase our own means, resources, and opulence.", "1782": "Nor indeed is this forbid- den by nature alone-that is, by the law of nations-but it is also in the same manner enacted by the municipal laws of countries, by which government is supported in individual states, that it should not be lawful to injure another man for the sake of one's own advantage.*", "1783": "For this the laws look to, this they require, that the union of the citizens should be unimpaired ;", "1784": "those who are for severing it they coerce by death, by banishment, by imprisonment, by fine.", "1785": "But what declares this much more is our natural reason, which is a.", "1786": "Jaw divine and human, which he who is willing to obey, (and all will obey it who are willing to live according to nature) never will suffer himself to covet what is another person's, and to assume to himself that which he shall have wrongfully taken from another.*", "1787": "For loftiness and greatness of mind, and likewise community of feeling, justice, and libe- rality, are much more in accordance with nature, than plea- sure, than life, than riches—which things, even to contemn and count as nothing in comparison with the common good, is the part of a great and lofty soul.", "1788": "Therefore, to take away wrongfully from another for the sake of one's own advan- tage, is more contrary to nature than death, than pain, than other considerations of the same kind.", "1789": "And likewise, to undergo the greatest labours and inquietudes for the sake, if it were possible, of preserving or assisting all nations- imitating that Hercules whom the report of men, mindful of his benefits, has placed in the council of the gods †—is more in accordance with nature than to live in solitude, not only without any inquietudes, but even amidst the greatest plea- sures, abounding in all manner of wealth, though you should also excel in beauty and strength.", "1790": "Wherefore, every man of the best and most noble disposition much prefers that life to this.", "1791": "From whence it is evinced, that man, obeying nature, cannot injure men.", "1792": "In the next place, he who injures another that he may himself attain some advantage, either thinks that he is doing nothing contrary to nature, or thinks that death, poverty, pain, the loss of children, of kindred, and of friends, are more to be avoided than doing injury to another.", "1793": "If lie thinks that nothing is done con- trary to nature by injuring men, what use is there in dis- puting with him who would altogether take away from man what is human ?", "1794": "But if he thinks that indeed is to be shunned, but that those things, death, poverty, pain, are much worse, he errs in this, that he thinks any defect, either of body or fortune, more grievous than the defects of the mind.", "1795": "VI, One thing, therefore, ought to be aimed at by all men ;", "1796": "that the interest of each individually, and of all collectively, should be the same;", "1797": "for if each should grasp at his individual interest, all human society will be dissolved.", "1798": "And also, if nature enjoins this, that a man should desire to consult the in- terest of a man, whoever he is, for the very reason that he is man, it necessarily follows that, as the nature, so the interest, of all mankind, is a common one.", "1799": "If that be so, we are all included under one and the same law of nature ;", "1800": "and if this too be true, we are certainly prohibited by the law of nature from injuring another.", "1801": "But the first is true ;", "1802": "therefore, the last is true.", "1803": "For that which some say, that they would take nothing wrongfully, for the sake of their own advantage, from a parent or brother, but that the case is different with other citizens, is indeed absurd.", "1804": "These establish the prin- ciple that they have nothing in the way of right, no society with their fellow citizens, for the sake of the common interest-an opinion which tears asunder the whole social compact.", "1805": "They, again, who say that a regard ought to be had to fellow citizens, but deny that it ought to foreigners, break up the common society of the human race, which, being withdrawn, beneficence, liberality, goodness, justice, are utterly abolished.", "1806": "But they who tear up these things should be judged impious, even towards the immortal gods ;", "1807": "for they overturn the society established by them among men, the closest bond of which society is, the consideration that it is more contrary to nature that man, for the sake of his own gain, should wrongfully take from man, than that he should en- dure all such disadvantages, either external or in the person, or even in the mind itself, as are not the effects of injustice.", "1808": "For that one virtue, justice, is the mistress and queen of all virtues..", "1809": "Some person will perhaps say-should not the wise man, then, if himself famished with hunger, wrest food from another, some good-for-nothing fellow ?", "1810": "By no means ;", "1811": "for my life is not more useful to me, than such a disposition of mind that I would do violence to no man for the sake of my own advantage.", "1812": "What !", "1813": "If a worthy man could despoil Phalaris, a cruel and outrageous tyrant, of his gar- ments, that he might not himself perish with cold, should he not do it ?", "1814": "These points are very easy to decide.", "1815": "For if you will wrongfully take away anything from a good-for- nothing man for the sake of your own interest, you will act unsociably and contrary to the law of nature.", "1816": "But if you be one who can bring much advantage to the state, and to human society if you remain in life, it may not deserve to be reprehended should you wrongfully take anything upon that account from another.", "1817": "But if that be not the case, it is rather the duty of each to bear his own misfortune, than wrongfully to take from the comforts of another.", "1818": "Disease, then, or poverty, or anything of this sort, is not more con- trary to nature than is the wrongful taking or coveting what is another's.", "1819": "But the desertion of the common interest is contrary to nature, for it is unjust.", "1820": "Therefore, the very law of nature which preserves and governs the interest of men, decrees undoubtedly that things necessary for living should be transferred from an inert and useless fellow to a wise, good, and brave man, who, if he should perish, would largely take away from the common good ;", "1821": "provided he do this* in such a manner, that he do not, through thinking well of himself, and loving himself, make this an excuse for com- mitting injustice.", "1822": "Thus will he always discharge his duty, advancing the interests of mankind, and that human so- ciety of which I so often make mention.t", "1823": "Now, as to what relates to Phalaris, the decision is very easy ;", "1824": "for we have no society with tyrants, but rather the widest separation from .", "1825": "them ;", "1826": "nor is it contrary to nature to despoil, if you can, him whom it is a virtue to slay-and this pestilential and impious class ought to be entirely exterminated from the community of mankind.", "1827": "For as certain limbs are amputated, both if they themselves have begun to be destitute of blood, and, as it were, of life, and if they injure the other parts of the body, so the brutality and ferocity of a beast iu the figure of a man, ought to be cut off from the common body, as it were, of humanity.", "1828": "Of this sort are all those questions in which our duty is sought out of the circumstances of the case.", "1829": "VII.", "1830": "In this manner, then, I think Panæstius would have pursued these subjects, had not some accident or occupation interrupted his design;", "1831": "for which same deliberations there are in his former books rules sufficiently numerous, by which it can be perceived what ought to be avoided on account of its baseness, and what therefore need not be avoided, because it is not at all base.", "1832": "But since I am putting, as it were, the top upon a work incomplete, yet nearly finished, as it is the custom of geometers not to demonstrate everything, but to require that some postulates be granted to them, that they may more readily explain what they intend, so I ask of you, my Cicero, that you grant me, if you can, that nothing except what is virtuous is worthy to be sought for its own sake.", "1833": "But if this be not allowed you by Cratippus,* still you will at least grant that what is virtuous is most worthy to be sought for its own sake.", "1834": "Whichever of the two you please is sufficient for me, and sometimes the one, sometimes the other, seems the more probable;", "1835": "nor does anything else seem probable.", "1836": "tAnd in the first place, Panæstius is to be defended in this, that he did not say that the really expedient could ever be opposed to the virtuous (for it was not permitted to him t to say so), but only those things which seemed expedient.", "1837": "But he often bears testimony that nothing is expedient which is not likewise virtuous-nothing virtuous which is not likewise expedient;", "1838": "and he denies that any greater mischief has ever attacked the race of men than the opinion of those persons who would separate these things.", "1839": "It was not, therefore, in order that we should prefer the expedient to the virtuous, but in order that we should decide between them without error, if ever they should come in collision, that he intro- duced that opposition which seemed to have, not which has, existence.", "1840": "This part, therefore, thus abandoned, I will com- plete with no help, but, as it is said, with my own forces", "1841": "For there has not, since the time of Panætius, been anything delivered upon this subject, of all the works which have come to my hands, that meets my approbation.", "1842": "VIII.", "1843": "When, therefore, any appearance of expediency", "1844": "Is presented to you, you are necessarily affected by it ;", "1845": "but if, when you direct your attention to it, you see moral turpitude attached to that which offers the appearance of expediency, tnen you are under an obligation not to abandon expediency, but to understand that there cannot be real expediency where there is moral turpitude ;", "1846": "because, since nothing is so contrary to nature as moral turpitude (for nature desires the upright, the suitable, and the consistent, and rejects the reverse), and nothing is so agreeable to nature as expe- diency, surely expediency and turpitude cannot co-exist in the same subject.", "1847": "And again, since we are born for virtue, and this either is the only thing to be desired, as it appeared to Zeno, or is at least to be considered weightier in its entire importance than all other things, as is the opinion of Aristotle, it is the necessary consequence, that whatever is virtuous either is the only, or it is the highest good ;", "1848": "but whatever is good is certainly useful-therefore, whatever is virtuous is useful.*", "1849": "Wherefore, it is an error of bad men, which, when it grasps at something which seems useful, separates it immediately from virtue.",

of ex- cessive opulence-hence, in fine, even in free states, the lust of sway, than which nothing darker or fouler can be con- ceived.", "1851": "For men view the profits of transactions with false judgment, but they do not see the punishment—I do not say of the laws, which they often break through, but of moral turpitude itself, which is most severe.", "1852": "Wherefore, this class of sceptics should be put out of our consider- ation (as being altogether wicked and impious), who hesitate whether they should follow that which they see is virtuous, or knowingly contaminate themselves with wicked- ness.", "1853": "For the guilty deed exists in the very hesitation, even though they shall not have carried it out.", "1854": "Therefore, such matters should not be at all deliberated about, in which the very deliberation is criminal ;", "1855": "and also from every delibera- tion the hope and idea of secrecy and concealment ought to.", "1856": "be removed.", "1857": "For we ought to be

unjust, nothing licentious, nothing incontinent.", "1858": "IX.", "1859": "To this purpose Plato introduces that celebrated Gyges, who, when the earth had opened, in consequence of certain heavy showers, descended into that chasm, and, as tradition goes, beheld a brazen horse, in whose side was a door, on opening which he beheld the body of a dead man of extraordinary size, and a gold ring upon his linger, which when he had drawn off, he himself put it on, and then betook himself to the assembly of the shepherds (for he was the king's shepherd).", "1860": "There, when he turned the stone of this ring to the palm of his hand, he was visible to no person, but himself saw everything ;", "1861": "and when he had turned the ring into its proper place, he again became visible.",

likely to oppose him.", "1863": "Nor could any one discover him in these crimes.", "1864": "So with the assistance of the ring he suddenly sprang up to be king of Lydia.", "1865": "Now, if a wise man had this ring itself, he would think that he was no more at liberty to commit crime than if he had it not.", "1866": "For virtue, not secrecy, is sought by good men.", "1867": "And here some philosophers, and they indeed by no means unworthy men, but not very acute, say that the story told by Plato is false and fabulous, just as if he indeed maintained either that it had happened or could have happened.", "1868": "The import of this ring and of this example is this—if nobody were to know, nobody even to suspect that you were doing anything for the sake of riches, power, domination, lust—if it would be for ever unknown to gods and men, would you do it ?", "1869": "They deny that the case is possible.", "1870": "But though indeed it be possible, I only inquire what they would do if that were possible which they deny to be so.", "1871": "They argue very stupidly, for they simply deny that it is possible, and they persist in that answer.", "1872": "They do not perceive what is the force of that expression, \" if it were possible.\"", "1873": "For when we ask what they would do if they possibly could conceal, we are not asking whether they really could conceal ;", "1874":

profit (for on this, indeed, it is dishonest to deliberate), but this, whether or no that which seems profitable can be done without baseness.", "1879": "When Brutus deposed his colleague, Collatinus, from his command, he might seem to be acting with injustice ;", "1880": "for Collatinus had been the associate and assistant in the councils of Brutus in expelling the kings.", "1881": "But when the rulers had taken this counsel, that the kindred of Superbus, and the name of the Tarquinii, and the memory of royalty were to be rooted out ;", "1882": "that which was useful, namely, to consult for his country, was so virtuous that it ought to have pleased even Collatinus himself.", "1883": "Therefore the expediency of the measure prevailed with Brutus on account of its rectitude, without which expediency could not have even existed.", "1884": "But it was otherwise in that king who founded the city ;", "1885": "for the appear- ance of expediency influenced his mind, since, when it seemed to him more profitable to reign alone than with another, he slew his brother.", "1886": "He disregarded both affection and humanity, that he might obtain that which seemed useful, but was not.", "1887":

day for the execution of one of them, and he who had been condemned to death had entreated a few days for himself, for the purpose of commending his family to the care of his friends, the other became security to have him forthcoming, so that if he had not returned, it would have been necessary for himself to die in his place.", "1909": "When he returned upon the day, the tyrant having admired

did Africanus want of me ?", "2773": "nothing whatever ;", "2774": "nor indeed did I need aught from him :", "2775": "but I loved him from admiration of his excellence;", "2776": "lie in turn perhaps was at- tached to me from some high opinion which he entertained of my character, and association fostered our affection.", "2777": "But although many and great advantages ensued, yet it was not from any hope of these that the causes of our attachment sprang:", "2778": "for as we are beneficent and liberal, not to exact favour in return (for we are not usurers in kind actions), but by nature are inclined to liberality, thus I think that friend- ship is to be desired, not attracted by the hope of reward, but because the whole of its profit consists in love only.", "2779": "From such opinions, they who, after the fashion of beasts, refer everything to pleasure, widely differ:", "2780": "and no great wonder, since they cannot look up to anything lofty, magnificent, or divine, who cast all their thoughts on an object so mean and contemptible.", "2781": "Therefore let us exclude such persons altogether from our discourse;", "2782": "and let us ourselves hold this opinion, that the sentiment of loving, and the attachment of kind feelings, are produced by nature, when the evidence of virtue has been established;", "2783": "and they who have eagerly sought the latter, draw nigh and attach themselves to it, that they may enjoy the friendship and character of the individual they have begun to love, and that they may be commensurate and equal in affection, and more inclined to confer a favour than to claim any return.", "2784": "And let this honourable struggle be maintained between them ;", "2785": "so not only will the greatest advantages be derived from friendship, but its origin from nature rather than from a sense of weakness, will be at once more impressive and more true.", "2786": "For if it were expediency that cemented friendships, the same when changed would dissolve them;", "2787": "but because nature can never change, there- fore true friendships are eternal.", "2788": "Thus you see the origin of friendship, unless you wish to make some reply to these

nothing was more difficult than that friendship should continue to the end of life;", "2797": "for it often happened, either that the same course was not expedient to both parties, or that they held different views of politics :", "2798": "he also remarked that the characters of men often changed;", "2799": "in some cases by adversity, in others by old age becoming oppressive;", "2800": "and he derived an authority for such notions from a comparison with early life, because the strongest attachment of boys are con- stantly laid aside with the prætexta;", "2801": "even if they should main- tain it to manhood, yet sometimes it is broken off by rivalry, for a dowried wife, or some other advantage, which they cannot both attain.", "2802": "And even if men should be carried on still further in their friendship, yet that feeling is often undermined, should they fall into rivalry for preferments ;", "2803": "for there is no greater enemy to friendship than covet- ousness of money, in most men, and even in the best, an emulous desire of high offices and glory;", "2804": "in consequence of which the most bitter enmities have often arisen between the dearest friends.", "2805": "For great

apostatized from virtue.", "2828": "Now if we shall lay it down as right, either to concede to friends whatever they wish, or to obtain from them whatever we wish, we must have indeed consummate wisdom, if such a course leads to no vice.", "2829": "But we are speak- ing of those friends who are before our eyes, whom we see around us, or else whom we know by report, and with whom every-day

than enough, of his own affairs ;", "2878": "that to be needlessly impli- cated in those of other people is vexatious ;", "2879": "that it was most convenient to hold the reins of friendship as loose

(setting the emotions of the mind aside), I do not say between a man and a beast, but between a man and a stone, or log, or anything of that kind ?", "2899": "For they do do not deserve to be listened

remove friendship from the world, any more than that the virtues, because they bring with them certain cares and troubles, should therefore be discarded.", "2904": "For when it produces friendship (as I said above), should any indication of virtue shine forth, to which a congenial mind may attach and unite itself-when this happens, affection must necessarily arise.", "2905": "For what is so

with virtue, in such a soul as can either love, or (so to speak) love in return ?", "2907": "for there is nothing more delightful than the repayment of kindness, and the interchange of devotedness and good offices.", "2908": "Now if we add this, which may with propriety be added, that there is nothing which so allures and draws any object to itself a.;", "2909": "congeniality does friendship;",

more apt to seek and seize on its like than nature.", "2913": "Wherefore this certainly is clear, Tannins and Scævola (in my opinion), that among the good a liking for the good is, as it were, inevitable;", "2914": "and this indeed is ap- pointed by nature herself as the very fountain of friendship.*", "2915": "But the same kind disposition belongs also to the multitude;", "2916": "for virtue is not inhuman, or cruel, or haughty, since she is accustomed to protect even whole nations, and to adopt the best measures for their welfare, which assuredly she would not do did she shrink from the affection of the vulgar.", "2917": "And to myself, indeed, those who form friendships with a view to advantage, seem to do away with its most endearing bond ;", "2918": "for it is not so much the advantage obtained through a friend, as the mere love of that friend, which delights ;", "2919": "and then only what has proceeded from a friend becomes de- lightful, if it has proceeded from zealous affection :", "2920": "and that friendship should be cultivated from a sense of necessity, is so far from being the case, that those who, being endowed with power and wealth, and especially with virtue (in which is the strongest support of friendship), have least need of another, are most liberal and generous.", "2921": "Yet I am not sure whether it is requisite that friends should never stand in any need;", "2922": "for wherein would any devotedness of mine to him have been exerted, if Scipio had never stood in need of my advice or assistance at home or abroad ?", "2923": "Wherefore friendship has not followed upon advantage, but advantage on friendship.", "2924": "XV.", "2925": "Persons, therefore, who are wallowing in indulgence, will not need to be listened to if ever they shall descant upon friendship, which they have known neither by ex- perience nor by theory.", "2926": "For who is there, by the faith of gods and men, who would desire, on the condition of his loving no one, and himself being loved by none, to roll in affluence, and live in a superfluity of all things?", "2927": "For this is the life of tyrants, in which undoubtedly there can be no confidence, no affection, no steady dependence on attach- ment ;", "2928": "all is perpetually mistrust and disquietude-there is no room for friendship.", "2929": "For who can love either him whom he fears, or him by whom he thinks he himself is feared ?", "2930": "Yet are they courted, solely in hypocrisy, for a time ;", "2931": "because, if perchance (as it frequently happens) they have been brought low, then is it perceived how desti- tute they were of friends.", "2932": "And this, they say, Tarquin* expressed ;", "2933": "that when going into exile, he found out whom he had as faithful friends, and whom unfaithful ones, since then he could no longer show gratitude to either party;", "2934": "although I wonder that, with such haughtiness and im- patience of temper, he could find one at all.", "2935": "And as the character of the individual whom I have mentioned could not obtain true friends, so the riches of many men of rank exclude all faithful friendship;", "2936": "for not only is fortune blind herself, but she commonly renders blind those whom she embraces.", "2937": "Accordingly such persons are commonly puffed up with pride and insolence, nor can any thing be found more intolerable than a fortunate fool.", "2938": "And thus, indeed, one may observe, that those who before were of agreeable character, by military command, by preferment, by pros- perity, are changed, and old friendships are despised by them, and new ones cherished.", "2939": "For what can be more foolish than, when men are possessed of great influence by their wealth, power, and resources, to procure other things which are procured by money-horses, slaves, rich apparel, costly vases-and not to procure friends, the most valuable and fairest furniture of life, if I may so speak;", "2940": "for while they are procuring those things, they know not for whom they are procuring them, nor for whose sake they are labouring.*", "2941": "For every one of these things belongs to him who is most powerful, whereas the possession of his friend- ships is preserved to every one steadfast and secure;", "2942": "so that if those things are preserved which are, as it were, the gifts of fortune, yet a life unadorned and abandoned by friends cannot possibly be happy.", "2943": "But on this head enough.", "2944": "XVI.", "2945": "But it is required to lay down what limits there are in friendship, and, as it were, what bounds of loving, con- cerning which I see three opinions held, of none of which I approve :", "2946": "-the first, that we should be affected towards a friend in the same manner as towards ourselves;", "2947": "the second, that our goodwill towards our friends should exactly and equally answer to their goodwill towards us;", "2948": "the third, that at whatever value a man sets himself, at the same he should be estimated by his friends.", "2949": "To none of these three opinions do I entirely assent.", "2950": "For the first one is not true, that as a man feels towards himself so he should be disposed towards his friend.", "2951": "For how many things, which for our own sake we should never do, do we perform for the sake of our friends ?", "2952": "To ask favours of unworthy persons, to supplicate them, to inveigh bitterly against any one, and to accuse him with great vehemence, which in our own cases cannot be done creditably, in the case of our friends are most honourably done;", "2953": "and there are many cases in which good men subtract many things from their own interests, or allow them to be subtracted, that their friends, rather than themselves, may enjoy them.", "2954": "The second opinion is that which limits friend- ship to an equality of kind actions and kind wishes:", "2955": "this is indeed to reduce friendship to figures too minutely and penu- riously, so that there may be a balance of received and paid.", "2956": "True friendship seems to be far too rich and affluent for that, and not to observe, narrowly, lest it should pay more than it receives:", "2957": "nor need it be feared lest anything should be lost or fall to the ground, or lest more than what is fair should be accumulated on the side of friendship.", "2958": "But the third limitation is most detestable, that at whatever value a man sets on himself, at that value he should be estimated by his friends;", "2959": "for often, in certain persons, either their spirit is too humble, or their hope of improving their condition too desponding;", "2960": "it is not, therefore, the part of a friend to be towards him what he is to himself;", "2961": "but rather to use every effort, and to contrive to cheer the prostrate spirit of his friend.", "2962": "and to encourage better hopes and thoughts.", "2963": "There- fore I must lay down some other limit of true friendship, as soon as I shall have stated what Scipio was accustomed above all things to reprehend.", "2964": "He used to declare that no speech could be found more hostile to friendship, than his who had said that a man ought so to love as if one day he would come to hate.*", "2965": "Nor, indeed, could he be induced to believe that this, as was supposed, was said by Bias, † who was considered one of the seven wise men ;", "2966": "but that it was the opinion of some wicked or ambitious man, or one who sought to bring everything under his own power.", "2967": "For in what manner can any one be a friend to him to whom he thinks he may possibly become an enemy ?", "2968": "Moreover, it will follow that he desires and wishes his friend to do wrong as often as possible, that he may afford him, as it were, so many handles for reproach.", "2969": "And, again, at the right conduct and advantage of his friends he will necessarily be tormented, grieved, and jealous.", "2970": "Wherefore this precept, to whomso- ever it belongs, is powerful only for the destruction of friend- ship.", "2971": "This, rather, should have been the precept, that we should employ such carefulness in forming our friendships, that we should not any time begin to love the man whom we could ever possibly hate.", "2972": "Moreover, if we have been but unfortunate in our selection, Scipio was of opinion that this should be submitted to, rather than that a time of alienation should ever be contemplated.", "2973": "XVII.", "2974": "I think, therefore, we must adopt these limitations, that when the character of friends is correct, then there should be a community between them of all things, of pur- pose and of will, without any exception;", "2975": "so that, even if by any chance it has happened that the less honourable wishes of our friends have to be forwarded, in which either their life is concerned, or their reputation, then you may decline a little from the straight path,* provided only extreme infamy do not follow;", "2976": "for there is a point to which indulgence may be granted to friendship:", "2977": "yet reputation must not be disre- garded;", "2978": "nor ought we to esteem the good will of our fellow countrymen as an engine of small value in the administration of the state, although to seek it by fawning and flattering is mean indeed ;", "2979": "yet virtue, on which affection is consequent, should by no means be rejected.", "2980": "But frequently (for I return to Scipio, the whole of whose discourse was concern- ing friendship) he used to complain, that in all other things men were comparatively careful;", "2981": "so that every man could tell how m'any goats or how many sheep he possessed, yet how many friends he had he could not tell;", "2982": "and in procuring the former, men employed carefulness, while in selecting their friends they were negligent, nor had they, as it were, any signs or marks by which they determined who were suited for friendship.", "2983": "The steadfast, then, and the steady, and the consistent are to be selected, of which class of persons there is a great scarcity;", "2984": "and, in truth, it is difficult for any one to judge, unless after he is experienced.", "2985": "Now the trial must be made in actual friendship;", "2986": "thus friendship outstrips judgment, and removes the power of making ex- periments.", "2987": "It is the part, therefore, of a prudent man, to check the impetus of his kindly feeling as he would his chariot, that we may have our friendships, like our horses, fully proved, when the character of our friends has been in some measure tested.", "2988": "Of some, it is often discovered in small sums of money how void of worth they are.", "2989": "Some, whom a small sum could not influence, are discovered in the case of a large one.", "2990": "But, even if some shall be found who think it sordid to prefer money to friendship, where should we find those who do not place above friendship high digni- ties, magistracies, military command, civil authorities, and influence?", "2991": "so that, when on the one side these objects have been proposed, and the claim of friendship on the other, they would not far prefer the former.", "2992": "For nature is too weak to despise the possession of power;", "2993": "for, even if they have attained it by the slighting of friendship, they think the act will be thrown into the shade, because friendship was not overlooked without strong grounds.", "2994": "Therefore real friend- ships are found with most difficulty among those who are in- vested with high offices, or in business of the state.", "2995": "For where can you find the man who would prefer his friend's advancement to his own?", "2996": "And why?", "2997": "For to pass over these matters, how grievous, how impracticable to most men does participation in afflictions appear!", "2998": "to which it is not easy to find the man who will descend.", "2999":

in friendship, is sincerity.", "3006": "For nothing is steadfast which is insincere.", "3007": "Besides, it is right that one should be chosen who is frank and good-natured, and congenial in his sentiments;", "3008": "one, in fact, who is influenced by the same motives ;", "3009": "all which qualities have a tendency to create sincerity.", "3010": "For it is impossible for a wily and tortuous

ingenuous man, than by his looks to conceal his sen timents);", "3017": "in the next place, that not only does he repel charges when brought (against his friends) by any one, but is not himself suspicious, ever fancying that some infidelity has been committed by his friend.", "3018": "To all this there should be added a certain suavity of conversation and manners, affording as it does no inconsiderable zest to friendship.", "3019": "Now solemnity and gravity on all occasions, certainly, carry with them dignity;", "3020": "but friendship ought to be easier and more free and more pleasant, and tending more to every kind of politeness and good nature.", "3021": "XIX.", "3022": "But there arises on this subject a somewhat difficult question ;", "3023": "whether ever new friends, if deserving friendship, are to be preferred to old ones, just as we are wont to prefer young colts to old horses ?", "3024": "a perplexity unworthy of a man;", "3025": "for there ought to be no

fruits shall appear, such are not to be rejected;", "3029": "yet the old one must be preserved in its proper place, for the power of age and custom is exceedingly great;", "3030": "besides, in the very case of the horse, which I just mentioned, if there is no impediment, there is no one who does not more pleasurably use that to which he is accustomed than one unbroken and strange to him;",

there often are instances of superiority, as was the case with Scipio, one, so to speak, of our own herd.", "3034": "He never ranked himself above Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or other friends of an inferior grade.", "3035": "But his brother, Quintus Maximus, a distinguished man, though by no means equal to himself, simply because he was the elder, he treated as his superior, and he wished all his friends should receive additional dignity through him.", "3036": "And this conduct should be adopted and imitated by all, so that if they have attained to any excellence in worth, genius, or fortune, they should communicate them with their friends, and share them with their connexions;", "3037": "so that if men have been born of humble parentage, or if they have kinsmen less powerful than themselves, either in mind or in fortune, they should increase the consequence of such persons, and be to them a source of credit and of dignity;", "3038": "as in works of fiction, they who for some time, through igno- rance of their origin and descent, have been in a state of servitude, when they have been discovered and found out to be the sons of gods or kings, yet retain their affection for

are superior ought in the exercise of friendship to condescend;", "3049": "so, in a measure, they ought to raise up their inferiors.", "3050": "For there are some persons who render friendships with

"4519": "no revolt of our allies ;", "4520": "no want of money or scarcity of provisions, and no mutiny in the army.", "4521": "Yet these have often happened to the wisest of men, who are forced to yield to the assaults of fortune, as the best of pilots sometimes are to the violence of a tempest.", "4522": "The most profound peace and perfect tranquillity has fallen to your lot;", "4523": "but though those are circumstances that may well give pleasure to a vigilant steersman, yet they may be fatal to a sleeping one.", "4524": "For your province is composed, first of that kind of allies, who of all the human race are the most humanized ;", "4525": "and in the next place of those Roman citizens, who either as farmers of the public revenues, are most intimately connected with me,* or, having so traded as to have become rich, consider they possess their fortunes in security through the beneficial influence of my consular administration.", "4526": "Yet even among these very men serious dis- putes exist, many injustices are committed, and great con- tentions are the consequence;", "4527": "and, thinking thus, I am sensible that you have not a little business upon your hands.", "4528": "I know that this business is very important, and requires great wisdom.", "4529": "But still remember that I main- tain, that this is a business which rather requires wisdom than good fortune.", "4530": "If you restrain yourself, how easy is it to restrain those you govern.", "4531": "This may indeed be a great and difficult matter to others, as indeed it is a most difficult achievement;", "4532": "but the practice of it was ever easy to you;", "4533": "and well it might be, as your disposition is such that it seems capable of moderation even without harming;", "4534": "while such an education has been enjoyed by you as would be capable of correcting the most vicious nature.", "4535": "When you check, as you do, the passion for money, for pleasure, and for all other things, can there be forsooth any danger of your being unable to restrain a dishonest trader, or a too rapacious publican ?", "4536": "For even the Greeks, when they behold your living in this manner, will think that some one from the records of their ancient history, or some divine person from heaven has descended upon that province.", "4537": "*I write to you in this strain, not that you might practise these things, but that you may rejoice that you do practise them, and that you have ever done so.", "4538": "For it is a glorious thing for a man to have been invested with three years sovereign power in Asia, in such a manner that no statue, no picture, no plate, no garment, no slave, no beauty, no hoard of money, in which things this province abounds, ever caused him to swerve from his continence and moderation !†", "4539": "Again, what can be a more distinguished, a more desirable circum- stance, than that this virtue, this moderation, this purity of mind, should not be buried or concealed in darkness, but dis- played in the sight of Asia, to the eyes of the noblest of our provinces, and to the ears of all people and nations.", "4540": "That the inhabitants are not alarmed at your journeys !-that they are not impoverished by your expenses !-that they are not frightened by your approach !—that there is the utmost rejoicing, both public and private, wherever you go !-that every town seems to receive you as its guardian, not as its tyrant!—every house as a guest, and not as a robber !", "4541": "*But upon this subject, experience by this time must have instructed you that it is not sufficient for you alone to practise these virtues, but you are to give careful attention, that invested as you are with this government, not only you, but all officers subordinate to your authority, are to act for the good of our allies, of our fellow citizens, and of our country.", "4542": "You have, it is true, lieutenants under you, who will themselves have regard to their own dignity;", "4543": "and of these the chief in preferment, in dignity, and in experience, is Tubero, who, I make no doubt, especially while he is writing his history, will be able to choose from his own annals such models of conduct, as he both can and will imitate ;", "4544": "and Allienus, too, attached to us as well in affec- tion and inclination, as in imitation of our lives.", "4545": "Need I to mention Gratidius, who, I know for a certainty, labours for his own fame, so as, with a brotherly affection for us, to labour equally for ours.", "4546": "You have a quæstor,† whom lot, and not your own choice, appointed to you.", "4547": "It is necessary that lie should both be moderate by his own inclination, and conform himself to your arrangements and directions.", "4548": "Should any of your officers appear of a more selfish dis- position, you should bear with him, so long as he only neglects the laws by which he is bound in his own person, but not if he should prostitute for interest that power which you have annexed to his office.", "4549": "It does not however seem desirable to me, especially as our manners have lately leaned so much to laxity and ambition, that you should scrutinize and dissect out every instance of corruption ;", "4550": "* but to pro- portion the trust you repose in every one, according to the degree of honesty he possesses.", "4551": "In like manner you should be answerable for those whom our government has given you as assessors and assistants, only under the restrictions which I have already laid down.", "4552": "As to those whom you have chosen to belong to your domestic establishment, or to be with you as your necessary retinue, and who are accustomed to be designated as of the prætor's cohort, you are answerable, not only for all their actions, but for all their sayings.", "4553": "But you have about your person those whom you may easily love while they act rightly ;", "4554": "and such as but slightly consult your reputation you can most easily coerce.", "4555": "Meanwhile it is natural to suppose, that, while you were inexperienced, your generosity might have been imposed upon ;", "4556": "for the more virtuous any man is in himself, the less easily does he suspect others to be vicious.", "4557": "fBut now let this third year be distinguished by the same purity which marked the two former, and even by more caution and diligence.", "4558": "Let your ears be such as are supposed to hear what they listen to, but not into which things may be falsely and dishonestly whispered for the sake of gain, without being the receptacles of false and malicious whispers, insinuations, and complaints.", "4559": "Suffer not your seal to be a common chattel, but as your very self;", "4560": "let it not be the tool of another's pleasure, but the evidence of your own.", "4561": "Let your pursuivant keep the rank which our ancestors assigned to him, who did not rashly entrust that office to any but freed men, over whom they exercised pretty much the same command, as they did over their slaves, and that not as a post of advantage but of labour and service.", "4562": "Let the lictor be the agent of your lenity rather than of his own, and let i his axe and his rods be stronger evidences of his post than of his power.", "4563": "In short, let all the province be sensible how dearly you prize the welfare, the children, the fame, and the fortunes of all who are under your command.", "4564": "Let it be notorious that you will be equally the enemy of the man who gives, as of him who receives a present, if you shall know it;", "4565": "for no one will give them, when it shall be clearly perceived that those who pretend to have the greatest interest with you are ac- customed to obtain nothing from you.", "4566": "Yet this address of mine to you is not because I would have you treat your dependants in a too severe or suspicious manner.", "4567": "For if any of them for two years have never fallen under suspicion of avarice, as I hear Cæsius, Chærippus, and Labeo, have done, and I believe it because I know them well;", "4568": "there is nothing which I should not think may be most properly committed to them and to men of their character.", "4569": "But if there is a man, from whom you have already received offence, or of whom you have known any- thing ill, never entrust anything to him, nor commit to him any portion of your reputation.", "4570": "But if within your province you have got any person who has been thoroughly admitted to your intimacy, and who is unknown to me, consider how far you ought to trust him.", "4571": "Not but that there may be many worthy men amongst the provincials ;", "4572": "but this it is lawful to hope, but dangerous to determine.", "4573": "For every man's nature is concealed with many folds of disguise, and covered as it were with various veils.", "4574": "His nature, his brows, his eyes, and very often his countenance are deceitful, and -his speech is most commonly a lie.", "4575": "Wherefore, out of that class of men who, being devoted to the love of money, are destitute of all those qualities from which we cannot be separated, where can you find one who will sincerely love you, a mere stranger to them.", "4576": "and not pretend to do so for the sake of advantage ?", "4577": "It would seem to me very extraordinary, especially as those very men pay seldom any regard to any private man, while they are all invariably attached themselves to the prætors.", "4578": "However, if amongst such kind of men you should find one (for the thing is not impossible), who loves you more than he does his own interest, eagerly enrol such a man in the number of your friends ;", "4579": "but if you do not perceive this, there will be no class in your acquaintance more to be avoided :", "4580": "because they know all the arts of getting money, they Jo nothing but for money, and they are indifferent about the opinion of any man with whom they are not to continue to live.", "4581": "Certain connections too with the Greeks themselves are to be most carefully guarded against, except with a very few men, who, if any, are worthy of ancient Greece.", "4582": "For truly, in general they are deceitful and treacherous, and trained up by perpetual subjection, in the art of sycophancy.*", "4583": "All of these I would say should be liberally treated, and the best of them received into hospitality and friendship ;", "4584": "but too close intimacies with them are not very safe, for though they dare not oppose our wishes, yet they are jealous not only of our countrymen but even of their own.", "4585": "Though they dare not fly in the face of a Roman magistrate, yet at the bottom they hate not only us but their own countrymen.", "4586": "Now, as in matters of this kind, as I wish to be cautious and diligent (though I fear I may seem too rigid), what do you think is my feeling with respect to slaves, whom we ought to keep under the strictest commmand in all places, but especially in the provinces ?", "4587": "Concerning this class many directions might be given ;", "4588": "but the shortest and plainest method I can recommend is, that in all your Asiatic journeys, they should behave as if you were travelling over the Appian way, and that they think there is not the least difference whether they were entering Tralles † or Formiæ.‡", "4589": "But if any of your slaves should distinguish himself by his fidelity, let him be employed in your domestic and private affairs, but not let him have the smallest thing to do with any public concern, or anything relating to the business of your government.", "4590": "For though many things may properly be entrusted to our faithful slaves, yet for the sake of avoid- ing observation and animadversion, they ought not to be committed to them.", "4591": "But I know not how my discourse has deviated into a style of dictation, though that was not my intention at the com- mencement.", "4592": "For why should I dictate to a man not inferior to me in knowledge, especially in all matters of this kind, and even superior in experience ?", "4593": "but I thought it would be very agreeable, if my sanction were added to what you are doing.", "4594": "Wherefore let these be the foundations of your dignity.", "4595": "In the first place, your own integrity and modera- tion ;", "4596": "in the next place, the modest behaviour of all who are about you, joined to a very cautious and circumspect choice of your acquaintance, whether they be provincials or Greeks;", "4597": "and the orderly and consistent regulation of your household.", "4598": "All which particulars are commendable in our private and daily concerns, but they must appear divine amidst such great power, such depraved manners, and so corrupting a province.", "4599": "Such a plan, and such regulations, will be sufficient to support that severity in all your resolutions, and all your decrees, which you exercised in those matters, and by which, to my great pleasure, we have incurred some enmities, unless, indeed, you imagine that I was influenced by the complaints of an individual—I know not whom-of the name of Paconius, who is not even a Greek, but is some Mysian, or rather Phrygian;", "4600": "or that I was moved by the vociferations of Tuscenius, that frantic, mean-spirited wretch, from whose polluted maw you, with the utmost equity, rescued a dis- honest prey.", "4601": "Wherefore we could not easily maintain those and the other instances of severity which you have practised in that province, without the most perfect integrity.", "4602": "There should therefore be the utmost rigour in your ad- ministration of justice, so that it should not be affected by favour, but maintained without variation.*", "4603": "It is, however, of no great consequence that justice should be impartially and diligently administered by yourself, unless the same is done 'by those to whom you have delegated some part of your functions.", "4604": "Now it appears to me that in the government of Asia there is no great variety of business, but that it is chiefly employed in judicial administration, the method of which especially in provinces is simple.", "4605": "Constancy and gravity must indeed be exercised, which may be not only above partiality, but even above the suspicion of it.", "4606": "To this must be added affability in hearing, calmness in determining, and carefulness in discussing the case and making restitu- tion.", "4607": "By reason of these qualities, Octavius* lately became most popular, before whom, for the first time, the lictor had nothing to do, and the crier had nothing to say;", "4608": "for every one spoke when he pleased and as long as he pleased.", "4609": "In this matter he might, perhaps, seem too compliant, were it not that this gentleness was the warrant of his inflexibility.", "4610": "The men of Sylla's party were compelled to restore what they had seized by force and terror.", "4611": "Such of the magistrates as had made unjust decisions were obliged themselves to submit, as private men, to similar inflictions.", "4612": "Now this severity on his part would have seemed cruel, had it not been tempered with many ingredients of humanity.", "4613": "If this gentleness is agreeable at Rome, where there is so much arrogance, such unbounded liberty, such unrestrained licentiousness, where there are such numerous magistracies, so many auxiliaries, so great force, and so much authority in the senate, how agreeable must the affability of a prætor be in Asia, where so great a number of our countrymen and allies, where so many cities and so many states, are observant ofone man's nod ?", "4614": "where they have no resource, no tribunal, no senate, and no assembly of the people ?", "4615": "It belongs there- fore to the character of a great man, and of a man as well humane by nature, as improved by learning and the study of the noblest arts, so to conduct himself in the use of such great power as that no other authority should be desired by those over whom he rules.", "4616": "The great Cyrus is represented by Xenophon (not accord- ing to the truth of history, but as the ideal model of right government*), whose extreme gravity is combined by that philosopher with singular sweetness of manners;", "4617": "which books our countryman, Scipio Africanus, was accustomed, and not without reason, always to have in his hands, for in them no duty of active, well-tempered government has been passed over;", "4618": "and if Cyrus, who could never be reduced to a private station, so diligently cultivated those duties, what ought they to be held by those to whom power has been given on con- dition of their surrendering it, and given by those laws to which they must be amenable ?", "4619": "Now it seems to me that all the considerations of those who rule over others should be referred to this object, that those who are under their government should be as happy as possible;", "4620": "and by constant report, and the acknowledgment of all, it has become no honour that this both is, and ever has been your most settled principle ever since you first landed in Asia;", "4621": "nay, that it is the duty, not only of those who govern the allies and the subjects of Rome, but of those who have the care of slaves and dumb cattle, to con- tribute to the interests and welfare of all committed to their charge.", "4622": "In this respect I perceive it is universally allowed that the utmost diligence has been used by you;", "4623": "that no new debts have been contracted by the states;", "4624": "that you have dis- charged many old ones with which many of the cities were burdened and oppressed;", "4625": "that you have repaired many ruin- ous and almost abandoned towns;", "4626": "amongst others Samus the capital of Ionia, and Halicarnassus the capital of Caria;", "4627": "that there are no seditions, no discords in your towns;", "4628": "that it has been seen to by you that the states are governed by the counsels of the best men;", "4629": "that you have suppressed rapine in Mysia, and bloodshed in many places;", "4630": "that peace has been established all over your province;", "4631": "that you have chased thieves and robbers, not only from the highways and country places, but from towns and temples, where they were more numerous and more dangerous;", "4632": "that calumny, that most cruel minister to the avarice of prætors, has been removed from the reputation, the fortunes, and the retire- ment of the rich;", "4633": "that the funds and taxes of the states are equally borne by all who inhabit the borders of those states;", "4634": "that access to you is most easy;", "4635": "that your ears are open to the complaints of all men;", "4636": "that the poor and the helpless always find admittance, not only to your public audiences and tribunals, but even to your house and your bed-chamber;", "4637": "and that in short, in the whole of your government there is nothing that is spiteful, nothing that is merciless, but that it is filled with clemency, gentleness, and humanity.", "4638": "How important was that public service you performed when you freed Asia from the unjust and burdensome tax imposed upon them by the ædiles, with great odium to us;", "4639": "for if one man of quality publicly complains that you have deprived him of almost £100,000, by ordering that money should not be levied for public exhibitions, what vast sums must have been raised, had the custom continued for raising money in the name of all who exhibited public shows at Rome.", "4640": "I stifled these complaints of our people, by a method which, however it may be regarded in Asia, is highly ap- plauded at Rome ;", "4641": "for when the states of ray province had voted a sum of money for erecting a temple and a monument to me, and when on account of my great deserts and your extraordinary services, they did it voluntarily and cheer- fully, and though the law has expressly provided, \" That governors may receive money for erecting a temple or a monument,\" nay, though the money which was granted was not to perish, but to be laid out upon the ornaments of a temple, that was to appear to future times, not more a pre- sent to me than to the people of Rome, and to the immortal gods;", "4642": "and yet I thought that the offer should be rejected though warranted by dignity, by law, and by the good will of those who made it;", "4643": "and this I did for this reason, amongst others, that those magistrates to whom such sums are not due, nor permitted by law, might bear (the refusal of them) with a more resigned temper.", "4644": "Apply yourself, therefore, with all your spirit and all your zeal, to that plan which you have already practised, that of loving the people which your country has committed and en- trusted to your faithful care ;", "4645": "protecting them in every way, and desiring that they should be as happy as possible.", "4646": "*But if fortune had set you over the Africans, the Spaniards, or the Gauls, those fierce and barbarous nations, yet still it would have been the dictate of your humanity to study their interests, and to have promoted their advantage and welfare.", "4647": "But when we govern a set of men, among whom civilization not only exists, but from whom it may be supposed even to have extended to others, surely we are most especially bound to repay them what we have received from them ;", "4648": "for I am not ashamed to acknowledge, especially in my position in life, and with the deeds which I have per- formed, which can involve no suspicion of indolence or un- steadiness ;", "4649": "that I have arrived at all those accomplishments to which I have attained, by means of those studies and arts which have been handed down to us in the remains and sys- tems of Greece.", "4650": "Therefore, besides the common faith which we owe to all mankind, we seem to be especially in- debted to this race of men,* so that we should be desirous of offering to those, by whose precepts we have been instructed, that which we learned from them.", "4651": "Plato, that philosopher, so distinguished by his genius and learning, thought that states would then at length be happy, when either wise and learned men should begin to be their rulers, or when their governors should apply themselves wholly to the study of learning and wisdom ;", "4652": "that is, he thought that this union of power and wisdom would constitute the safety of states.", "4653": "This may possibly, at some time, be the case of our whole empire, but at present it is the case of one province, that an individual possesses the supreme power in it, who has de- voted, from his childhood, the largest amount of time and study to the pursuit of learning, of virtue, and humanity.", "4654": "Take care, therefore, my Quintus, that this year which is added to your government, prove to be a year that is added to the welfare of Asia ;", "4655": "and because Asia has been more successful in detaining you than I was in procuring your recall, do you behave so as that my regret may receive some mitigation from the joy of the province.", "4656": "For if you have so indefatigably applied yourself to deserve greater honours than perhaps ever man did, you ought to exert much greater diligence in maintaining them.", "4657": "I have already given you my sentiments concerning that kind of honours.", "4658": "I have always been of opinion, that if they are commonly accessible they are worthless ;", "4659": "if bestowed to serve a purpose, they are con- temptible;", "4660": "but if they are offered (as has been done) as a t ibute to your merits, I think you cannot bestow too much pains upon their preservation.", "4661": "As, therefore, you are invested with the highest command and power in those cities where you see your virtues are consecrated and deified, think, in all that you arrange, and decree, and perform, what you owe to such opinions on the part of mankind, to such flattering decisions, and such ex- alted honours.", "4662": "The result of this will be, that you will pro- vide for all, that you will remedy the ills of your subjects, provide for their welfare, and desire to be designated and regarded as the parent of Asia.", "4663": "To this zeal and assiduity the farmers of the revenue offer a great obstruction.", "4664": "If we oppose them, we shall separate from ourselves and from the state an order of men who have the highest claims upon us, and who by me were attached to the service of our government.", "4665": "If, on the other hand, we should indulge them in every respect, we must suffer those to be utterly ruined, whose welfare, nay, whose convenience, we are bound to consult.", "4666": "This, if we will view the case aright, is the sole difficulty in all your administration.", "4667": "For to practise self-control, to subdue all inordinate desires, to regulate your family, to practise the impartial administra- tion of justice, to show yourself ready to acquaint yourself with cases, and to admit and grant a hearing to individuals, are things more glorious than difficult, for they consist not in any laborious application, but in the bent of the mind and of the affections.", "4668": "We learned how much bitterness of feeling this matter of the farmers of the revenue occasioned to our allies from our own fellow countrymen ;", "4669": "who, when the tolls of Italy were lately abolished, complained not so much of the heaviness of the tolls as of the insolence of the toll-gatherers, from which I am sensible of what must befall our allies in remote coun- tries, when I have heard such complaints from our fellow citizens in Italy.", "4670": "It seems to require a superhuman virtue, that is, one like your own, in this situation of things, to give satisfaction to the farmers of the public revenue, especially when the taxes have been disadvantageously contracted for, and at the same time not to suffer our allies to be ruined.", "4671": "But, in the first place, as to the Greeks, the hardship which they most bitterly complain of, that of their being taxed, is, in my opinion, no great hardship, because by their own constitutions, apart from the government of the Roman people, they were in the same condition with their own cou- sent.", "4672": "As to the name of a farmer of the revenue, the Greeks- ought not to hold it in such contempt, because, without their assistance, they could not have paid the tax indiscriminately imposed upon them by Sylla.", "4673": "Now that the Greeks are fully as severe as our farmers are, in the collection of the public revenue, may be concluded from this, that the Caunians* some time ago, who inhabit the islands that were annexed by Sylla to the division of Rhodes, petitioned the senate that they might pay their taxes to us, rather than to the Rho- dians.", "4674": "They therefore who always have been taxed, ought not to hold the name of a tax-gatherer with horror, nor ought they to despise him, without whom they cannot pay their taxes ;", "4675": "nor ought they who have petitioned for him to reject him.", "4676": "The Asiatics ought at the same time to reflect, that were they not under our government, no calamity of foreign war and domestic dissension would ever have been absent from them.", "4677": "And since this government cannot be supported without taxes, they ought cheerfully to purchase for themselves, with some part of their incomes, an uninter- rupted peace and tranquillity.", "4678": "When once they come to en- dure with patience the profession and name of a farmer of the revenue, your prudent measures and conduct will be able to make other annoyances seem lighter to them.", "4679": "They will come, not to reflect so much in making their compositions upon the Censorian Law, but rather upon the advantage of settling the business, and upon their freedom from molesta- tion.", "4680": "You can likewise continue what you have always so admirably done, to put them in mind how much dignity there is in the office of a farmer of the revenue, andhow much we owe to that order.", "4681": "So that, apart from force and the influence of authority, and of the fasces, you will bring the publicans into favour and credit with the Greeks.", "4682": "You may even entreat those whom you have so highly obliged, and who owe their all to you, that by their compliance they will suffer us to cherish and continue those intimate con- nexions that subsist between us and the farmers of the revenue.", "4683": "But why do I exhort you to those measures which you are not only able to do of your own accord without the iu-- structions of any one, but which in a great degree you already have happily executed.", "4684": "For the most honourable and considerable bodies of our empire never cease to pay me their daily thanks, which are the more agreeable, because the Greeks do the same.", "4685": "Now it is a matter of great difficulty to bring together in good will those whose in- terests, whose advantages, and whose natures, I had almost said, are repugnant.", "4686": "But what I have here written, I have written not for your instruction (for wisdom such as yours stands in need of no man's instructions), but the recording of yeur merits delights me as I write.", "4687": "In this letter, how- ever, I have been longer than I intended or supposed that I should be.", "4688": "There is one thing which I shall not cease to recommend to you, for so far as in me lies I will not suffer an exception to your praises.", "4689": "All who come from that region, while they praise your virtue, your integrity, and your humanity, even in their highest commendations make one exception, your anger;", "4690": "a vice, which in private and every day life seems to be the defect of an inconstant and weak mind ;", "4691": "but when a passionate behaviour is joined to sovereign power, nothing can be more monstrous.*", "4692": "I shall not, however, endeavour to give you the sentiments of the best instructed men, concern- ing the passion of anger, both because I am unwilling thia.", "4693": "this letter should be too long, and because you can easily learn them from the writings of many men.", "4694": "Still I do not think that one thing which is proper to a letter should be neglected, namely, that he to whom we write should be made acquainted with those things of which he is ignorant.", "4695": "Now I am told almost by every body, that when you are free from anger, nothing can be more agreeable than you are ;", "4696": "ut when the impudence or perverseness of another has excited you, you are under such violent agitations that your kindly disposition is sought for in vain.", "4697": "As, therefore, a certain desire of glory as well as interest, and fortune, have concurred to lead us into that walk of life, by which we become the perpetual subject of conversation amongst mankind, we ought to do and to strive all we can that no conspicuous vice may be said to attach to us.*", "4698": "I do not now insist on this consideration, that in human nature at large, and especially at our time of life, it is very difficult for a man to alter his disposition, or suddenly to pluck out a fail- in-, that has settled into a habit.", "4699": "But my advice to you is this, if you cannot altogether avoid this, but passion takes possession of your mind before reason can take precautions that it should not invade it, you should undergo a course of preparation, and be every day meditating that resistance must be offered to anger, and the more violently it affects the mind, the more diligently must you restrain your tongue ;", "4700": "which merit sometimes appears to me not less than that of never being angry at all;", "4701": "because the latter virtue is not solely the proof of self-respect, but sometimes of a lethargic temperament.", "4702": "But when you are touched with anger, to control both your temper and your language, even to hold your peace, and to keep under command all excitement and irritation of mind ;", "4703": "these are the
