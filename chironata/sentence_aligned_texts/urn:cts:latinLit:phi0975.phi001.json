fabuliste entre lui et Phèdre, si Titianus, assez peu éloigné de ce dernier, n’est pas nommé dans la Préface, il en résulte, selon le docte commentateur, la preuve qu’Avianus a paru postérieurement à

Babrius, n’est-il pas évident qu’A vianus, après avoir nommé ce dernier, n’avait aucune raison de citer Titianus, simple copiste qui, à ses yeux, ne se distinguait pas de l’auteur original, et que, par conséquent, il ne pouvait ni ne devait compter parmi les vrais fabulistes?", "1357": "De cette manière, on s’explique sans peine le motif pour lequel Avianus n’a pas prononcé le nom de Titianus,

deviennent inutiles;", "1367": "ces élucubrations laborieuses ne donnent aucun résultat;", "1368": "et, après tant de corrections impossibles, la simple inspection du texte soi-disant amendé ou

Avianus, en s’adressant à Macrobe, qui, dit-on, était revêtu de la charge de préfet de la chambre impériale, emploie ces expressions un peu familières, Theodosi optime, il n’y a rien là qui doive étonner;", "1372": "nous ne connaissons ni la position ni les emplois d’Avianus, qui, peut-être, n’était pas d’un rang inférieur à Macrobe;", "1373": "et l’eût-il même été, il est évident que, dans

nennen, sich öffnet, Ist doch gewiß kein Körper;", "308": "und da, wo ein Körper vorhanden, Lässet ein lediger Raum auf keinerlei Weise sich denken:", "309": "Dicht und des Leeren beraubt sind also die Körper des Urstoffs.Weil in erzeugeten Dingen sodann sich das Leere befindet, Muß um solches ein Stoff, der dicht, nothwendig bestehen.", "310": "Niemals läßt sich auf irgend vernünftige Weise behaupten, Daß ein Körper im Innern was Leeres enthalte, wofern man Nicht auch das Dichte zugleich zugibt, dem das Leere sich einschließt.", "311": "Das könnt' aber ja doch nichts Anderes sein, als des Grundstoffs Einigung, welche das Leere zusammenzuhalten im Stand ist.", "312": "Demnach kann die Materie nur, die dichter Natur ist, Immer und ewig bestehn, wenn jegliches Andre sich auflöst.Wäre sofort Nichts da, was leer und ohne Gehalt ist, Dann wär' Alles ja dicht;", "313": "und hinwiederum, gäb' es nicht Körper, Welche den Raum ausfüllen und überall Alles besetzen, Würde der sämmtliche Raum Nichts sein, als ein lediges Leeres:", "314": "Wechselseitig somit ist der Körper getrennt von dem Leeren.", "315": "Nun kann aber das Volle sich nicht ausschließlich behaupten, Eben so wenig das Leere:", "316": "somit sind Körper vorhanden, Welche den ledigen Raum vom vollen zu scheiden vermögen.", "317": "Die nun lassen sich nie durch Schläge von außen zertrümmern, Nicht auslösen, dieweil durchdrungen in innrer Verbindung;", "318": "Noch auf irgendwie denkbare Weis' erweichen und schwächen.", "319": "Was ich im Obigen ja erst eben bewiesen dir habe.", "320": "Denn, wie es scheint, läßt Nichts sich ohne das Leere zerstoßen Oder zerbrechen, und eben so wenig in Theile zerlegen;", "321": "Nichts nimmt Feuchtigkeit aus, und in Nichts kann die Kälte sich schleichen, In Nichts dringen das Feuer, von dem Jedwedes verzehrt wird.", "322": "Ja, je mehr von dem Leeren ein Ding im Inneren einschließt, Um so größre Gefahr der Zerstörung hat's zu besorgen.", "323": "Sind urstoffliche Körper nun dicht und entbehren der Leere, Haben sie, wie ich gezeigt, nothwendig auch ewige Dauer.", "324": "Weiter noch:", "325": "wäre der Grundstoff nicht von ewiger Dauer, Dann wär' jegliches Ding in's Nichts schon lange versunken, Wär' aus dem Nichts von Neuem geboren, was irgend wir sehen.", "326": "Doch, da ich oben gezeigt, Nichts könn' aus Nichts sich erzeugen, Eben so wenig in Nichts das Erschaffene wieder zurückgehn, Müssen auch ewige Dauer besitzen die Körper des Urstoffs, In die jegliches Ding am Ende der Tage sich auslöst, Daß ein genügender Stoff zur Wiedererzeugung bereit sei.", "327": "Einfach dichter Natur find also die Körper des Urstoffs, Nimmer ja könnten sie sonst bei nie aufhörendem Dasein Seit undenklicher Zeit fortwährend ihr Wesen erneuern.", "328": "Endlich noch, hätte Natur ein Ziel der Zermalmung der Dinge Nimmer gesetzt, schon längst dann wären die Körper des Urstoffs Durch die vergangene Zeit aus solcherlei Weise zermalmet, Daß von dem festen Termin der Empfängniß keiner derselben Bis zum entferntesten Ziele des Lebens könnte gelangen.", "329": "Sehn wir ja doch, daß jegliches Ding weit leichter zerstört wird, Als man es neu herstellt, drum könnte, was vorige Tage, Längst entschwundene Zeit und unvordenkliches Alter Haben in Theile zerstückt und aufgelöst und zerstreuet, Sich in der folgenden Zeit niemal von Neuem erbauen.", "330": "Haarscharf ist nun aber ein Ziel der Zermalmung gesetzet, Und wir ers-glitt, daß Alles und Jedes sich wiederum herstellt, Daß für ein jegliches Ding nach Art feststehet das Zeitmaß, Das ihm die Blüthe des Alters ^dereinsh zu erreichen gestattet.", "331": "Hiezu kommt noch weiter:", "332": "so fest auch die Körper des Urstoffs Immerhin sei'n, kann doch aus allen das Weiche sich wieder Bilden, wie Luft und Wasser und Erd' und Dünste, nach welcher Weis' es geschieht und durch welcherlei Kraft die Verbindung zu Stand kommt;", "333": "Ist doch den Dingen einmal hinzugemischet das Leere.", "334": "Wären sie weich hingegen, die uranfänglichen Stoffe, Niemals ließe sich finden, aus was sich kräftige Kiesel Bildeten, aus was Eisen;", "335": "es fehlte der ganzen Natur ja Durchaus immer die erste Bedingung ihres Bestandes.", "336": "Kräftig daher sind sie, weil dicht und wesentlich einfach, Und je gedrängter verbunden sie sind, um so fester auch können Alles zusammen sie halten und zeigen die mächtige Grundkraft.Wäre sodann kein Ziel der Zerstörung der Körper gesetzet, Müssen doch derlei Körper, aus unvordenklichen Zeiten Uebrig geblieben, noch jetzt nothwendig vorhanden sich finden, Denen von jeder Gefahr entfernt sich zu halten geglückt war.", "337": "Wenn sie jedoch so schwach und gebrechlich in ihrer Natur sind, Dann ist schwer zu ersehn, wie, geplagt von unzähligen Stößen, Ewige Zeit sie zu dauern und noch zu bestehen vermochten.", "338": "Endlich auch noch, da die Gränzen für Lebenserhaltung und Wachsthum Jeglichem Ding nach seiner besonderen Gattung gesetzt sind, Und der geheiligte Bund der Natur unabänderlich feststellt, Was Jedwedes vermag, was nicht es vermag zu erreichen, Nichts auch Aendrung befährt, vielmehr sein Wesen ein jedes So durchaus festhält, daß selbst die vershciedenen Vögel Immer die nämlichen Farben auf ihrem Gefieder uns zeigen:", "339": "Deßhalb muß nothwendig in jeglichem Körper ein Grundstoff Stetig bestehn;", "340": "denn, könnten die uranfänglichen Stoffe, Sei's auf welcherlei Weise, besiegt nur werden und iwehcseln, Niemals ließe sich dann mit Gewißheit sagen, was werden Könne, was nicht, auf welcherlei Weise die eigene Kraft von Jeglichem Dinge beschränkt, welch endliches Ziel ihm gesteckt sei.", "341": "Auch nicht zeigeten fort und fort die Geschlechter der Thiere Sitt' und Natur und Bewegung und Lebensweise der Eltern.Da nun ferner in jedem der Körper ein äußerster Punkt ist, Den wir mit unserm Aug niemals zu erfassen vermögen, Läßt er, wie leicht zu verstehn, auch nie sich in Theile zerlegen, Winzig nach seiner Natur:", "342": "nie hat für sich selbst er bestanden, Kann auch hinfort nicht also bestehn, da selber der erste Theil und der letzte des andern er ist;", "343": "dann reihn an einander Aehnliche Theilchen sich an und füllen, zusammen in einen Dichten Haufen gedränget, des Körpers ganze Natur aus.", "344": "Weil nun die für sich selbst nicht können bestehen, so müssen Innig zusammen sie hangen, daß Nichts von einander sie losreißt.Dicht und einfach somit sind uranfängliche Stoffe, Welche zusammenhängen, gedrängt in den winzigsten Theilchen:", "345": "Nicht die Zusammenkunft fremdartiger Theile vereint sie, Vielmehr thut es die Kraft des von jezeit einfachen Wesens;", "346": "Nichts abstreifen von ihnen, noch irgendwie auch sie vermindern Läßt die Natur, sie bewahrt vielmehr sie zu Samen der Dinge.Nähme man übrigens nicht ein Kleinestes an, so bestände Jeglicher Körper, so winzig er ist, aus unendlichen Theilen, Nämlich so, daß die Hälfte beständig sich ließ' in die Hälfte Theilen und für kein Ding zum Voraus Schranken beständen.", "347": "Wär' ein Unterschied dann zwischen dem Größten und Kleinsten?", "348": "Nirgends fändest du solchen:", "349": "denn wenn schon sämmtliche Dinge Selber unendlich sind, so würde das Kleinste ja dennoch Ebenso, wie das Gesammte, bestehn aus unendlichen Theilen.", "350": "Weil hiegegen jedoch die Vernunft sich sträubt und den Glauben Weigert, so mußt nothwendig, durch Gründe besiegt, du gestehen, Daß auch ^KörperZ es gebe, die nicht mit Theilen begabt sind, Und von der kleinsten Natur;", "351": "und verhält sich's also, so mußt du Ebenso auch zugeben, daß dicht sie seien und ewig.Endlich, wofern die Natur, die Alles erschaffen, hinwiedrum Alles gewaltsam nicht auflöst' in die winzigsten Theilchen, Würde sie auch auf's Neue daraus Nichts können erzeugen.", "352": "Denn wo mehrere Theilchen sich nicht zu den Dingen gesellen, Können sie auch Nichts haben von dem, was der zeugende Stoff braucht:", "353": "Weder Verbindungen mancherlei Art, noch Schwere, noch Triebkraft, Noch den Zusammenstoß, noch Bewegung, die Alles hervorbringt.", "354": "Deßhalb scheinet es auch, daß die, so das Feuer als Grundstoff Sämmtlicher Ding' ansehn und Alles allein aus dem Feuer Lassen entstehn, sich weit entfernen vom Wege der Wahrheit.", "355": "Hierin that sich zuerst Heraclit hervor als des Kampfes Held, durch dunkele Sprache gepriesener unter den leeren Köpfen, als unter den ernsten, die Wahrheit suchenden Grajern.", "356": "Lieben ja doch und bewundern die Narrn absonderlich Alles Das, was unter vershcrobenen Worten verstecket sie sehen;", "357": "Wahrheit nennen sie das, was lieblich die Ohren berühret Und was den Anstrich trägt von hold ansprechendem Wortschall.", "358": "Wie doch käm's — so frag' ich — daß also verschieden die Dinge, Wären dieselben allein und rein aus Feuer erschaffen?", "359": "Fruchtlos wär's, ob das Feu'r man verdichtete, oder verdünnte, Wenn die vereinzelten Theile des Feuers das nämliche Wesen Zeigeten, das in dem Ganzen sich kund gibt.", "360": "Heftiger würde Bei zusammengedrängeten Theilen die Hitze ja werden, Aber hinwiedrum gelinder, wo diese getrennt und zerstreut sind.", "361": "Glaube du fest, daß dieß allein ans solcherlei Ursach Kann entstehn, doch nie bei Dingen aus dichterem oder Dünnerem Feuer so große Verschiedenheit sich bekunden.", "362": "Nähmen sie weiter noch an, daß Leeres zu Dingen gemischt sei, Könnten sie doch bald dichter das Feu'r, bald dünner sich denken;", "363": "Doch, da sie sehn, wie viel hierbei entgegen sich stellet, Und rein Leeres in keinem der Dinge zu suchen gewillt sind, Gehn sie vom richtigen Pfad, indem sie den schwierigen scheun, ab, Sehn auch wiederum nicht, daß, fehlte den Dingen das Leere, Alles zusammengedrängt, ein Körper aus sämmtlichen würde, Der Nichts könnte von sich wegschleudern, wie wärmendes Feuer Licht ausströmet und Dunst, wo du siehst, daß dieses mit nichten Könn' aus dicht aneinander gedrängeten Theilen erfolgen.", "364": "Sind sie nun aber des Wahns, es könne das Feuer erlöshcen, Wenn es zusammen sich drängt, und seine Natur sich verändern;", "365": "Bleiben sie dann noch dabei, daß durchweg dieses der Fall sei:", "366": "Nun, so versinket in Nichts von Grund aus sämmtliches Feuer, Und es entsteht aus Nichts jedwedes erschaffene Wesen.", "367": "Denn was in andrer Gestalt aus seinen Bezirken hinausgeht, Stirbt in demselben Moment als das, was zuvor es gewesen.", "368": "Demnach muß unversehrt Etwas sich vom Feuer erhalten, Daß nicht endlich in Nichts von Grund aus Alles zerfalle.", "369": "Neu auch erzeugt aus Nichts aufgrüne die Fülle der Dinge.Ist nun richtig, es gebe bestimmete Körper von der Art, Daß sie in ihrer Natur sich stets unverändert erhalten, - Aber durch Zugang, Trennung und Wechsel des Orts und der Lage Aendern der Dinge Natur und in andern Gestalten ershceinen:", "370": "Dann sieht Jeder auch ein, daß die nicht feuriger Art sind.", "371": "Denn was läge daran, ob Etwas sich trennt' und entfernte, Sich mit Andrem verbünd' und Ordnung wechselt' und Lage, Wenn sich des Feuers Natur gleichwohl bei allen erhielte?", "372": "Feuer ja könnte nur sein, was irgend aus ihnen erzeugt wird.", "373": "Aber nach meinem Begriff ist's so:", "374": "Bei einigen Körpern Wirken Zusammenfluß, Ordnung und Gestalt und Bewegung Und die vershciedene Lage das Feuer;", "375": "verändern sich diese, Aendert damit sich der Sache Natur auch:", "376": "weder dem Feuer Sind sie vergleichbar, noch sonst auch Dingen, die Theilchen den Sinnen Senden und unser Gefühl durch Anstoß könnten berühren.", "377": "Dann zu behaupten:", "378": "es sei, was da ist, Feuer, und Nichts sei Wesentlich da von Allem, was irgend es geb', als das Feuer, Wie es der Obige thut, das scheint mir völliger Unsinn.", "379": "Er, der der Sinne bedarf, kämpft gleichwohl gegen die Sinne, Schwächet den Glauben an die, von denen der Glaube doch ausgeht, Durch die Kunde von dem er erhielt, was Feuer er nennet.", "380": "Feuer allein, so wähnt er, erkennten die Sinne mit Wahrheit, Nichts gibt weiter er zu, so klar auch immer es sein mag:", "381": "Was nicht weniger mir grundlos, denn albern erscheinet.", "382": "Auf was könnten wir halten, auf was uns sicherer stützen, Als aus die Sinne?", "383": "was sollen wir Wahrheit nennen, was Irrthum?Ist's denn besser gethan, wenn alles das Andre man ausgibt Und als Wesen der Ding' allein läßt gelten das Feuer, Als wenn das Feuer bei Seite man setzt und das Uebrige stehn läßt?", "384": "Eins, wie das Andre, erscheint mir indeß als die nämliche Thorheit, Deßhalb glaub' ich, daß ebenso die, die das Feuer als Urstoff Sämmtlicher Ding' annahmen, aus Feuer erschaffen das Ganze;", "385": "Wie die, welche die Lust festsetzten als zeugende Grundkrast, Oder der Meinung sind, daß einzig das Wasser die Dinge Bilde;", "386": "sowie auch die, so die Erde zur Zeug'rin von Allem Machen, in alle Naturen sich umzuwandeln vermögend:", "387": "Daß die Alle sich weit vom Wege des Wahren verirren.Füg' auch Jene noch bei, die verdoppeln die Urelemente, Die mit dem Feuer die Lust, mit dem Wasser verbinden die Erde, Ebenso die, die Alles und Jedes aus vier Elementen Lassen entstehn:", "388": "aus Feuer und Erd', aus Lust und aus Wasser.", "389": "Hier nun eröffnet den Reihn Empedocles aus Agrigentum, Welchen das Eiland trug an der dreifach spitzigen Küste, Das, vom ionischen Meer umfluthet in mächtigen Bogen, Rings mit dem salzigen Schlamm anspritzet die bläuliche Woge;", "390": "Das, durch die Engen des Sunds sich drängend, der reißende Meerstrom Von dem äolischen Land abtrennt.", "391": "Hier ist der Charybdis Gräulicher Schlund, hier drohen die rollenden Donner des Aetna Wieder zu sammeln die wild umrasenden Flammen, von Neuem Aus weit gähnendem Rachen zu spein den gewaltigen Glutstrom Und an das Himmelsgewölbe die leuchtenden Blitze zu schleudern.", "392": "Mag auch dem Menschengeschlecht dieß Land aus vielerlei Gründen Höchst merkwürdig erscheinen und werth, es selber zu schauen, Reich an Besitz und trefflich beschützt durch kräftige Männer:", "393": "Ist, wie mir scheint, Her Mann doch das Herrlichste, Heiligste, Theu'rste, Wunderbareste, was es im eigenen Schooße getragen.", "394": "Selbst die erhabnen Gesäng' aus seiner göttlichen Brust ja, Und die Erforschungen, die er uns kund that, sprechen es laut aus:", "395": "Kaum als möglich erschein's, daß menschlichem Stamm er entsprossen.", "396": "Hat ja doch Er, wie Andre, von denen wir oben gesprochen, Und die so vielfach unter ihm stehn, viel minder als er sind, Wenn auch viel sie erdacht, das wohl und von göttlichem Anhauch, Wie aus dem heiligen Sitze des Herzens, würdigern Ausspruch, Weit glaubhastern ertheilt, als Pythia selbst von dem Dreifuß Und aus dem Lorbeerhaine des Phöbus solchen verkündet:", "397": "Gleichwohl sind auch sie an der Ding' Urgründen gescheitert, Durch den gewaltigen Sturz die eigene Größe bezeichnend.", "398": "Vorweg nehmen sie an die Bewegung ohne das Leere, Geben auch zu, daß Körper, die weich und locker, bestehen, Feuer und Luft und Sonn' und Erde, Gethier und Gewächse, Ohne denselben jedoch hinzuzumischen das Leere.", "399": "Dann auch, weil nie Grenzen sie setzen der Theilung der Körper, Nicht zugeben den Punkt, bei dem die Zerbrechlichkeit aushört, Auch bei keinem der Ding' ein Kleinestes wollen erkennen, Während wir sehn, daß an jeglichem Dinge die äußerste Spitze Das sei, was als Kleinstes desselben den Sinnen sich darstellt.", "400": "Hieraus folget der Schluß:", "401": "was so weit außen sich ansetzt, Daß es dem Blick sich entzieht, das ist an den Dingen das Kleinste.Weiter noch kommt hiezu, daß die Uranfänge der Dinge Sie als Weiches bestimmen, da doch wir sehn, es entstehe Dieses aus Zeugung erst und sei hinfällig von Grund aus.", "402": "Und so müßte die Summe der Dinge zurück in das Nichts gehn Und aus dem Nichts hinwiedrum die Fülle der Wesen emporblühn, Während du siehst, wie weit vom Wahren sich Beides entferne.", "403": "Dann auch stehn vielfach sie sich feindlich entgegen, das Eine Ist für das Andere Gift;", "404": "sie rieben sich auf, sie zerflögen Bei dem Zusammenstoß, gleichwie, wenn Wetter sich drängen, Blitze zerfliegen wir sehn und Stürm' und platzende Güsse.Endlich, wofern Jedwedes aus nur vier Dingen entstünde, Und auch ebenso Alles in diese sich wiederum löste:", "405": "Wär's dann richtiger, die Elemente der Dinge zu nennen, Als von den Dingen zu sagen, sie sei'n Elemente von ihnen?", "406": "Denn Eins wird von dem Andern erzeugt, sie verändern ihr Aussehn, Ja, ihre ganze Natur seit unvordenklichen Zeiten.", "407": "Stehst du vielleicht im Wahn, es vermische die Masse der Erde, Feuer und himmlische Luft und Thau des Gewässers sich also, Daß Nichts ihre Natur bei diesem Vereine verändre:", "408": "Sicherlich könnt' ein Geschöpf niemals aus ihnen hervorgehn, Weder ein lebendes, noch lebloses, dergleichen ein Baum ist.", "409": "Nämlich es würd' ein Jedes, obgleich in gemengeten Haufen, Seine Natur festhalten:", "410": "es würde, gemischt mit der Erde, Luft sich zeigen und unter der Fluth sich Feuer befinden.", "411": "Bei der Erzeugung der Dinge jedoch muh jeglicher Urstoff Seine Natur im Verborgenen halten, geheim sie bewahren, Daß Nichts trete zu Tag, was widerstrebet und hindert, Daß sich in seiner Natur das Erschaffene könne behaupten.Ja, beim Himmel beginnen sie selbst und den Feuern-des Himmels, Lassen das Feuer zuerst in lustigen Hauch sich verwandeln, Hieraus Regen entstehn und dann aus Regen die Erde;", "412": "Nach dem lassen sie Alles zurück von der Erde sich wenden, Erstlich das Wasser, nach diesem die Lust und als letztes das Feuer Im nie endenden Wechsel:", "413": "es geht vom Himmel zur Erde, Dann von der Erd' empor zum Sternengezelte;", "414": "doch niemals Kann sich's also verhalten mit uranfänglichen Stoffen.", "415": "Etwas muß in den Dingen, was nie sich verändert, hervorstehn, Daß nicht Alles und Jedes in Nichts hinsinke von Grund aus.", "416": "Denn was einmal verändert aus seinen Gränzen heraustritt, Findet den Tod urplötzlich als das, was zuvor es gewesen.", "417": "Deßhalb müssen auch die, von denen wir eben gesprochen, Weil sie veränderlich sind, nothwendig aus anderen Körpern Wieder bestehn, an denen sich keine Veränderung kund gibt, Daß nicht Alles und Jedes in Nichts hinsinke von Grund aus.", "418": "Eher noch könnte man sich die Natur von bestimmeten Körpern So vorstellen:", "419": "dieselben, wosern sie das Feuer geschaffen, Könnten, wenn Einiges hier wegfällt, dort Einiges zuwächst, Bei umgestalteter Folge der Ordnung und der Bewegung Lust ausbilden, und so sich andre verwandeln in Andres.", "420": "Aber der Augenschein — so bemerkst du — zeiget ja deutlich, Daß all Ding aus der Erd' in die Lust aufwächst und sich nähret, Daß, wenn günstiges Wetter sich nicht einstellet im Jahrlaus, Nicht, vom träufelnden Regen benetzt, umshcwanket das Buschwerk, Noch auch die Sonne sich freundlich erweist und Wärme verleihet, Weder die Feldfrucht wächst, noch Bäume, noch lebende Wesen.", "421": "Ja, wenn trockene Nahrung nicht, nicht flüssiger Trank uns Stöcken, schwände der Körper dahin und es würde das Leben Ganz und gar aus allen Gebeinen und Knochen sich lösen.", "422": "Und so stärken und nähren wir uns — fest steht's — durch ge­ wisse Ding', und andere werden genährt durch andere Dinge:", "423": "Darum sicherlich, weil in den vielen vershciedenen Dingen Vielerlei Grundstoff liegt, der mehreren Dingen gemein ist:", "424": "So gibt nun das Verschiedne Vershciedenem wieder die Nahrung.", "425": "Das auch ist von Belang, mit was für Stoffen verbunden Und in welcherlei Lage der uranfängliche Stoff sei, Auf was Weise sich auch kund gebe die Wechselbewegung.", "426": "Denn aus dem nämlichen Stoffe bestehn ja Himmel und Erde, Meer und Ström' und Sonn' und Pflanzen und lebende Wesen, Nur der vershciedene Grad der verschiedenen Mischung be­ stimmt sie.", "427": "Kommen doch hin und wieder sogar in unseren Versen Viel Buchstaben dir vor, die mehreren Wörtern gemein sind;", "428": "Gleichwohl mußt du gestehn, daß weder die Verse, noch Wörter, Sei es dem Inhalt, sei es dem Klang nach, irgend sich gleichen.", "429": "So viel wirken die Lettern allein durch veränderte Stellung:", "430": "Wie viel mehr noch ershceinen die Stoffe der Dinge geeignet, Durch der Verbindungen Zahl die vershciedensten Wesen zu schaffen!Laß die Homöomerie desAnaxagoras

Bilden;", "435": "aus winzigen Stückchen zusammenwachsen die Erde, Feuer aus feurigen Fünkchen, aus Wassertropfen das Wasser.", "436": "Gleichergestalt auch läßt er in seinen Gedanken die andern Ding'

wir oben bereits anführten, zu irren.Dann auch denkt er sich allzu gebrechlich die Körper des Ur­ stoffs;", "438": "Wenn Urstoffe sie sind, sie, die mit den Dingen die gleichen Eigenschaften besitzen

Blut? oder die Knochen?", "442": "Gar Nichts, wie mich bedünkt, denn billig ist alles das Andre Gleich hinfällig, wie das, was überwiegende Kräfte Uns vor dem Aug' hinrichten und das wir sehen vergehen.", "443": "Doch, daß die Dinge so wenig in Nichts sich zu wandeln ver- mögen, Als zu erwachsen aus Nichts, das gründ' ich aus obige Sätze.Weil nun ferner die Speise den Körper ernähret und stärket, Läßt hieraus sich erkennen, daß aus fremdartigen Theilen Unsere Knochen bestehn, auch Blut und Adern und Nerven.", "444": "Stellte den Satz man aus:", "445": "es enthalten die Speisen gemischte Körper, es seien von Blut und Adern und Knochen und Nerven Winzige Theilchen in ihnen verbunden, so solgete daraus, Daß das Getränk nun selber, sowie auch die trockene Nahrung Aus fremdartigen Dingen zusammengesetzet erschienen, Nämlich aus Knochen und Nerven, mit Adern und Blute ge­ mischet.", "446": "Ebenso ist's mit dem Uebrigen auch, was wächst aus der Erde:", "447": "s Ist

auf Gebirgs­ höhn Nachbarlich ragende Gipfel der Bäume, wenn südliche Stürme Sie mit Gewalt anreiben, sich wechselseitig entzünden, Bis helllodernd zuletzt empor sich heben die Flammen?", "460": "Also geschieht's;", "461": "doch das Feuer, es wohnt nicht selber im Holze, Mancherlei Samen der Glut nur sind's, die, mittelst der Reibung Mit einander vereinigt, den Brand in den Wäldern erzeugen.",

des Körpers Unwillkürlich bewegt und zugleich fort werde gerissen, Bis dann endlich der Wille die Obhand wieder gewonnen.", "699": "Siehest du daraus nun, daß, wenn auch Viele die äußre Kraft oft treibt und wider den eigenen Willen zum Fortgang Nöthiget, ja, sie jach hinreißt, doch Etwas in unsrer Brust sei, das in den Kampf dagegen zu treten vermöge, Dessen Befehl alsdann auch die sämmtliche Masse des Stoffes Unterwerfen sich muß in allen Gelenken und Gliedern, Daß, im Schusse gehemmt, er wieder zur Ruhe gelange?", "700": "Drum auch mußt bei den Samen du dich zum Gleichen bekennen, Nämlich:", "701": "daß außer dem Stoß und Gewicht noc5 ein Andres es gebe, Das sie bewegt, und woher dieß innre Vermögen sie haben, Da wir gesehn, daß Nichts aus Nichts zu entstehen vermöge.", "702": "Hindert ja doch das Gewicht, daß äußere Kräfte des Stoffes Nicht Jedwedes bewirken, dagegen im Innern der Geist selbst Nicht nothwendig bestimmt zu jeder der Handlungen werde, Gleichsam in Bande gelegt, um Alles zu dulden, zu leiden:", "703": "Dieses bewirket die wenig bemerkbare Beugung der Stoffe In unbestimmter Zeit und an nicht zu bestimmendem Orte.Niemals war das Gesammte des uranfänglichen Stoffes Dichter zusammengedrängt, noch mehr von einander gelockert, Denn er vermehret sich nicht, auch geht Nichts unter von selbem.", "704": "Drum auch ist die Bewegung, in welcher die

Wechselnde Farben daraus von verschiedenen Arten zu schaffen.", "861": "Dann auch ist von Bedeutung die Mischung und Lage der Stoffe, Wie sie sich unter einander und wieder zu andern verhalten, Welche Bewegung sie sich mittheilen und wieder empfangen, So daß leichtlich daraus der Beweis herleiten sich lässet, Weßhalb das, was schwarz von Farbe noch eben gewesen, Sich urplötzlich in Weiße des Marmors könne verändern, Wie, von des Sturmes Gewalt in die Höhe getrieben, die Meerfluth Sich umwandelt in Wogen von Heller und glänzender Weiße.", "862": "Alsdann könnte man sagen, daß das, was

aus schwarzen was Schwärze man nennt, vielmehr aus verschiednen, Liegt viel näher da doch ftie Vermuthung^ uns, daß das Weiße Aus Farblosem entsteh', als sich aus Schwarzem erzeuge, Oder aus jeglicher

bestehet, versteckt, ist gleichsam die Seele der ganzen Seel' und besitzt vollständig die Herrschaft über den Körper.", "1159": "In ganz ähnlicher Art muß Hauch und Luft auch und Wärme, Unter einander gemischt in den Gliedern, thätig sich zeigen, Eines dem anderen mehr nachstehn, dann wieder sich vorthun, Daß ein einziges Ganzes aus ihnen sich scheine zu bilden, Und nicht jedes besonders, die Wärme, getrennt von der Lust, und Die vom Hauche, vernichte den Sinn, durch Sonderung löse.Wärme befindet sich auch im Geist, wann Zorn ihn erfasset, Wann er in Hitze geräth und Glut aussprüht aus den Augen, Während der frostige Hauch allmeist der Begleiter der Furcht ist, Welche den Körper erschüttert und Schauer erregt in den Gliedern.", "1160": "So auch liegt's in der ruhigen Luft selbsteigenem

verweilen, Sondern es folgt als Begleiter ihm rasch, entschwebt in die Lüfte Und läßt, starr vom Froste des Todes, die Glieder zurücke.", "1210": "Aber im Leben verbleibt, wem geistige Kraft noch zurückblieb, Seien verstümmelt ihm auch, ja völlig zerfleischet die Glieder:", "1211": "Selbst als Rumpf, dem die Glieder man abriß, lebet er ohne Seele noch fort und athmet ätherische Hauche des Lebens.", "1212": "Wenn er nicht ganz und gar, obgleich zum beträchtlichen Theile, Seellos ist, dann weilet er noch im Leben und hängt dran;", "1213": "Wie, wenn das Auge zerfleischt, unversehret jedoch die Pupille Blieb, die lebendige Kraft des Gesichts fortwährend Bestand hat:", "1214": "Hast du die Rundung des Augs nur nicht vollständig vernichtet, Rings durchschnitten die Sehe, verbindungslos sie gelassen, Denn dieß würde nicht ohne Verderben für beide geschehen.", "1215": "Doch, ist ein winziger Theil nur inmitten des Auges zerfressen, Dann geht plötzlich zu Grunde das Licht und es folget das Dunkel, Mag im Uebrigen auch unversehrt und glänzend der Kreis sein.", "1216": "Durch solch Band sind Geist und Seel' auch ständig verbunden.Auf nun, daß du erkennest, es werden zugleich mit den Körpern Geist und Seele geschaffen und sterben auch wieder mit diesen, Will ich, was süßes Bemühn seit lange gesucht und gefunden, Im dein würdigen Lied forthin auseinander dir setzen.", "1217": "Fass' indessen die Namen von beiden in einen zusammen, Daß du, so\"oft ich mich etwa des Namens „Seele\" bediene, Diese für sterblich erklärend, das Nämliche glaubst von dem Geiste, Da sie beide nur Eins und unter sich innig verknüpft sind.So denn hab' ich zum Ersten gezeigt, es bestehe dieß zarte Wesen aus winzigen Körpern und aus weit kleineren Stoffen, Als klarfließendes Wasser und Rauch und Nebel;", "1218": "denn weitaus Stehet es diesen voran an Beweglichkeit, und, erreget Selbst von der leisesten Triebkraft nur, wird schon es beweget ^Schon von den bloßen Gebilden

daß dieß durch Bilder erzeugt wird.", "1220": "Wenn du somit wahrnimmst, daß allenthalben das Wasser Rinnt aus lecken Gesäßen, das Naß entweicht, in die Lüste Rauch und Nebel zerfliegen, so glaube mir, daß auf dieselbe Weise die Seele verdunste, ja, noch weit schneller vergehe, Rascher sich auch auslös' in die uranfänglichen Stoffe, Wenn aus den Gliedern des Menschen einmal sie hinweg sich ge­ zogen.", "1221": "Denn, wofern sie der Körper, der gleichsam doch ihr Gefäß ist, Nimmer zusammenzuhalten vermag, wenn irgend ein Unfall, Oder den Adern entzogenes Blut ihn geschwächt und zerstört

gezeugt, aufwahcse zugleich mit demselben und alt're;", "1223": "Denn, wie das Kind, so lange noch schwach sein Körper und zart ist, Unstät schwankt, so zeiget auch schwach bei ihm noch der Geist

zerrüttet, Fallen die Glieder zusammen bei stumpf gewordenen Kräften:", "1226": "Dann auch erlahmet der Geist, es verirrt sich Zung' und Gedanke, Alles zumal nimmt ab und versagt gleichzeitig die Dienste.", "1227": "Dem vollkommen gemäß löst ebenso auch sich der Seele Ganze Natur, wie der Rauch sich hoch in die Lüfte zertheilet, Da wir zugleich mit dem Körper erzeugt sie sehen und wachsen Und, wie bereits ich gelehrt, vom Alter ermüdet zerfallen.", "1228": "Hiezu kommt dann weiter, daß, wie wir schreckliche Krankheit Ausstehn sehen den Körper und Schmerzen erdulden und Mühsal, Gleichergestalt an der Seel' auch Furcht wahrnehmen und Trauer, Draus sich ergibt, daß der Tod auch sie muß treffen, wie jenen.Ja, bei krankendem Körper verliert nicht selten der Geist auch Seinen gehörigen Stand, wird blöd und redet im Irrsinn;", "1229": "Manchmal sinket er auch durch Schlafsucht tief in den Schlummer Und in den ewigen Schlaf, bei isnkenden Augen und Antlitz:", "1230": "Nimmer vernimmt er Stimmen, erkennt auch nimmer die Züge Derer, die, noch einmal in's Leben zurück ihn zu rufen, Ringsum stehen, Gesicht und Wangen mit Thränen benetzend.", "1231": "Deßhalb mußt du gestehen,

solchen Erscheinungen Alles sich einstellt.", "1235": "Was ist's Andres, als daß die gewaltige Stärke des Weines Selbst im Körper die Seel' in Verwirrung pfleget zu bringen?", "1236": "Alles jedoch, was sich läßt in Verwirrung bringen und hindern, Zeigt, wenn ein Anlaß noch, der kräftiger wirket, hinzutritt, Daß es zu Grund gehn kann und fernerer Dauer beraubt sein.", "1237": "Plötzlich sogar stürzt Einer, ergriffen von heftiger Krankheit, Nieder vor unseren Augen, als hätte der Blitz ihn getroffen, Schaum tritt über die Lippen, er stöhnt, ihm zittern die Glieder, Sinnlos liegt er, die Nerven gedehnt, fühlt Qualen, gebrochen Athmet er nur und ermüdet ^zuletzt) die geschüttelten Glieder.", "1238": "Gleichwie nun die umher in den Gliedern wüthende Krankheit Störend wirkt auf den Geist, so kochen die schäumenden Wogen Auch auf der salzigen Fluth, von Sturmesgewalten getrieben.", "1239": "Seufzer entPressen sosort sich der Brust, weil Schmerz in den Gliedern Fest sich gesetzt,

da die Kraft des Geists und der Seele In Verwirrung geräth und, wie ich gezeigt, durch dasselbe Gift auseinander gerissen und jede besonders zerstreut wird.", "1241": "Ist nun der Krankheit Grund entfernt, und kehret der scharfe Saft des verdorbenen Körpers zurück zu seinen Gesässen, Dann erhebt, wie im Taumel, der Kranke zuerst sich, und mälig Nimmt die Besinnungskraft er zurück und mit dieser die Seele.", "1242": "Die nun, welche du so durch Krankheit schon in dem Körper Auf elendige Weise zerrissen, geworfen, geplagt siehst;", "1243": "Die könn' ohne den Körper, vermeinst du, frei in den Lüsten, Zu den gewaltigen Stürmen gesellt, sich lebend erhalten?Sehn wir die Seele nun auch, gleichwie den erkranketen Körper, Durch der Arznei Wirkung die Gesundheit wieder erlangen, Zeigt auch dieses uns an, daß sterblich der Seele Natur sei.", "1244": "Theile ja hätte hinzuzufügen, die Lage zu wechseln, Oder, es sei auch Weniges nur, vom Ganzen zu nehmen, Wer den Versuch anstellet, der Seele Natur zu verändern, Oder das Wesen von sonst was Andrem zu werden bemüht ist.", "1245": "Doch läßt weder die Theile versetzen, noch Etwas hinzuthun Ein Unsterbliches, duldet auch nicht den

einwärts Ziehn, die verschiedenen Theile zusammendrängen in Eines Und dadurch das Gefühl aus sämmtlichen Gliedern entfernen, Müßte doch eben der Ort, wo die Fülle der Seel' in so hohem Grade sich häuft, um so mehr empfindungsfähig sich zeigen:", "1252": "Doch, da nirgend ein solcher vorhanden, so wird sie zerrissen Und nach außen zerstreut;", "1253": "und folglich geht sie zu Grunde.Wenn ich sogar dir gern zugäbe die falsche Behauptung, Daß aufwinden die Seele sich könn' in dem Körper von denen, Welche das Lebenslicht theilweise verlässet im Sterben:", "1254": "Gleichwohl mußt du bekennen, daß sterblich der Seele Natur sei.", "1255": "Auch liegt wenig daran, ob dieselbe zerstreut in die Lüste, Ob, wenn die Theile zusammen sich ziehn, des Gefühles beraubt wird, Wenn aus dem Menschen je mehr und mehr jedwede Empfindung Völlig entweicht und weniger stets vom Leben zurückbleibt.", "1256": "Und da die Seel' ein Theil vom Menschen ist, ihren bestimmten Sitz einnimmt, wie

"1568": "es finden Geschöpfe sich vor, so klein, daß der dritte Theil derselben durchaus nicht wahrnehmbar für das Aug' ist.", "1569": "Wie klein mag von diesen nun jeglicher innere Theil sein?", "1570": "Wie das gerundete Herzchen? die Augen? die Glieder?", "1571": "Gelenke?", "1572": "Wie gar winzig!", "1573": "Die Stoffe sodann, aus welchen die Seele Und aus welchen das Wesen des Geists nothwendig bestehet, Siehest du nicht, wie fein das Alles, wie winzig es sein muß?Sämmtliche Panaceen sodann, aus deren Substanzen Scharfer Geruch ausströmt, wie der widrig schmeckende Wermuth, Bitteres Tausendgülden und schwer zu verdauende Stabwurz:", "1574": "Wann zufällig von diesen auch leicht nur eins du berührest, Wirst alsbald du gewahr, daß mancherlei Bilder derselben Schweifen auf allerlei Weis', unfähig, Gefühl zu erregen.", "1575": "I^Doch, welch winziger Theil von diesen annoch das Gebild sei, Ist Niemand zu behaupten im Stand, Niemand zu beweisen.", "1576": "^Hege jedoch nicht etwa den Wahn, es schwärmen nur solche Bilder von Dingen umher, die los von denselben sich treiben:", "1577": "Noch sind andre vorhanden, von selbst sich erzeugende, welche In dem Himmel, der Luftkreis heißt, zur Erscheinung gelangen;", "1578": "Wie manchmal wir entstehen sie sehn, wenn Wolken empor sich Thürmen und graß entstellen des Weltalls heiteres Aussehn:", "1579": "Die nun schweben, gebildet auf mancherlei Art, in die Höhe, Aendern sich unaufhörlich, zerfließen in neue Gestalten, Und in vershciedenster Weise verwandeln sie Formen und Umriß, Fächelnd die Lust durch ihre Bewegung:", "1580": "als Riesengestalten Sehen wir oft sie schweben und weit hinziehen den Schatten, Ost als ragende Berg' und los von den Bergen gerifs'ne Felsen, und bald vor der Sonne voraus, bald hinter ihr wandeln, Andere Wolken auch noch nachschleppen als Schreckensgestalten.Jetzo vernimm, wie leicht und geschwind sich dieselben bewegen, Wie fortwährend den Dingen entfliehen und ledig sich machen;", "1581": "Dein stets sondert sich reichlich ein Aeußerstes ab von den Dingen, Welches sie von sich schießen, und trifft's aus andere Dinge, Kleider besonders, so dringt's hindurch, trifft's aber auf rauhe Massen Gesteins und auf Stoffe von Holz, dann wird es zerrissen, Daß kein Bild von demselben zurück es zu geben im Stand ist.", "1582": "Wenn sich jedoch entgegen Was stellt, das glänzend und glatt ist, Wie vornämlih cder Spiegel, so trägt dergleichen sich nicht zu:", "1583": "Nicht, wie das Kleid, durchdringt es denselben, und eben so wenig Wird es zerreißen, da schon es die Glätte dagegen verwahrt hat.", "1584": "Daher kommt's, daß von dort sich zurück uns werfen die Bilder;", "1585": "Und wie schnell und in welchem Moment vor den Spiegel auch immer Irgend ein Ding du stellst, zeigt alsbald dir sich das Abbild:", "1586": "Lerne daraus, daß stets von der obersten Fläche des Körpers Zarte Gewebe der Ding' abfließen und zarte Gestalten.", "1587": "Also bewegen sich Bilder die Meng' im kürzesten Zeitraum, Daß sie „die schnellsten Geburten\" mit Recht sich lassen benennen.", "1588": "Und, wie in kürzester Frist vielfältige Strahlen die Sonne Ausschickt, daß von denselben das All fortwährend erfüllt sei:", "1589": "Müssen auf ähnliche Art nothwendig auch Bilder in Menge Sich im Moment ablösen in mannigfaltigster Weise Und sich überallhin, nach jeglicher Richtung, verbreiten;", "1590": "Sintemal uns, wohin auch immer den Spiegel wir wenden, Stets in der nämlichen Form und Farbe die Sach' in das Aug' tritt.Weiter noch das:", "1591": "wie klar auch und hell am Himmel das Wetter Eben noch war, wird's plötzlich von allher stürmisch und trübe, Daß du vermeinst, es seien die Nächte des Acheron alle Ausgestiegen und füllen die weiten Gewölbe des Himmels.", "1592": "Solch ein Schreckensgesicht von zumal sich erhebenden Wettern Hänget herab und droht mit ershcreckendem Dunkel von oben:", "1593": "Welch ein winziger Theil von diesen annoh cdas Gebild sei, Ist Niemand zu behaupten im Stand, Niemand zu beweisen.", "1594": "Auf nun, wie sich so schnell in Bewegung setzen die Bilder, Und wie regsam dieselben, die Luft durchschwimmend, erscheinen, Daß für die weiteste Bahn ein kurzer Moment nur daraufgeht, Wohin jedes nur immer nach seinem vershciedenen Wink strebt, Will ich in nicht zahlreichen, doch lieblichen Versen verlautbarn:", "1595": "Schwanengesang, der kurz nur dauert, ist besser, als jenes Kranichgekrächz, das schmettert in lustige Wolken des Auster.Erstlich, so sind gar oft sehr leichte, mit überaus kleinen Körpern bestehende Dinge zu sehn, die schnell sich bewegen:", "1596": "Zu der Gattung gehöret das Licht und die Wärme der Sonne, Aus dem Grund, weil beid' aus winzigen Stoffen bestehen.", "1597": "Gleichsam geschlagen und vom nachfolgenden Schlage getrieben, Dringen nun rastlos diese die Zwischenrüume der Lust durch:", "1598": "Plötzlich ist anderes Licht an der Stelle des vorigen Lichtes, Im fortlaufenden Zug wird Blitz vom Blitze gestachelt.", "1599": "Deßhalb müssen denn auch nothwendig die Bilder auf gleiche Weis' unermeßlichen Raum durchlaufen in kürzester Zeitfrist:", "1600": "Einmal, weil aus der Ferne bereits die geringe Bewegkraft Einwirkt, die sie von hinten nach vorwärts dränget und fort­ stößt;", "1601": "Dann auch, weil ihr Gewebe so dünn und locker beschaffen, Daß durch jegliches Ding gar leicht sie zu dringen und gleichsam Zu durchströmen vermögen die Zwischenräume des Aethers.Ferner die Körperchen, die, im Innern der Dinge befindlich, Werden nach außen entsandt, wie Licht und Wärme der Sonne, Sehn wir, sobald sie sich ledig gemacht, in kürzester Zeitfrist Allwürtshin durch des Himmels gewaltigen Raum sich ergießen, Länder und Meer durchfliegen und überströmen den Himmel.", "1602": "Da nun diese so leicht im Flug sich bewegen, wie solltest Du nicht sehn, wie die Bilder, die, wenn einmal von der Körper Aeußerster Fläche geschnellt, Nichts sonst auf dem Wege zurückhält, Sich weit schneller und durch noch größere Bahnen bewegen Und vielfach durchlaufen den nämlichen Raum in der gleichen Zeit, wo die strahlen der Sonne sich über den Himmel verbreiten", "1603": "?Das auch ist vor Allem als klarer Beweis zu betrachten, Mit welch schneller Bewegung die Bilder der Dinge begabt sei'n, Daß in demselben Moment, wo die glänzende Fläche des Wassers Wird in's Freie gestellt bei heitrem, gestirnetem Himmel, Sich in dem Naß abspiegeln die strahlenden Lichter des Weltalls.", "1604": "Siehest du nun hieraus, wie das Bild in der kürzesten Zeitfrist Abwärts fällt von den Gränzen des Aethers aus jene der Erde?", "1605": "Demnach nöthiget dich auch diese so seltsame Sache, Körperchen zuzugestehn, die treffen das Aug' und es reizen, Die fortwährend entstehn und stets abfließen von Dingen, Wie von den Flüssen der Frost, von der Sonne die Wärme, der Gischt vom Brausenden Meer, der die Mauern zerfrißt ringsum am Gestade.", "1606": "Auch durchfliegen beständig vershciedene Töne die Lüste.", "1607": "Dann auch setzt an den Mund oftmals sich ein salz'ger Geschmack uns, Wenn wir am Meer hinwandeln, und wo wir verdünneten Wermuth Sehen bereiten zum Trank, ist's Bittere, die wir empfinden.", "1608": "So gehn Dinge von Dingen hinweg in beständigem Abfluß, Allwärtshin entsendet von ihnen, nach jeglicher Seite:", "1609": "Nicht ist einige Rast, noch Ruhe vergönnt der Entströmung, Weil das Gefühl fortwährend vorhanden und stets uns vergönnt ist, Alles zu sehen, zu riechen und Töne des Lauts zu vernehmen.", "1610": "Ferner auch, da jedwede Figur, wenn im nächtlichen Dunkel Unsere Hand sie betastet, als ebendieselbe erkannt wird, Welche bei Licht und im Schimmer des Tags man erblicket, so muß durch Aehnlichen Grund das Gefühl und Gesicht erregen sich lassen.", "1611": "Wenn wir ein Viereck also bei nächtlichem Dunkel betasten Und wahrnehmen als solches:", "1612": "was kann beim Lichte noch Andres Kommen zu dieser Gestalt, als einzig das Bild von dem Viereck?", "1613": "Demnah cscheint in den Bildern der Grund, daß wir sehen, zu liegen Und Nichts ohne dieselben sich darzustellen dem Auge.", "1614": "Diese, von denen ich rede, die Bilder der Dinge, verbreiten Ringsum sich und werfen sich hin nach jeglicher Seite;", "1615": "Aber dieweil wir allein mit den Augen zu sehen im Stand sind, Kommt's, daß von da nur, wohin das Gesicht wir wenden, die Dinge Alle zumal nach Gestalt und Färb' auf selbiges treffen.", "1616": "Ebenso wirket das Bild, daß den Abstand jegliches Dings wir Sehen und solches »iach diesem^ zu unterscheiden vermögen.", "1617": "Nämlich, sobald entsendet das Bild wird, stößet und treibt es Sämmtliche zwischen ihm selbst und den Augen befindliche Lust fort;", "1618": "Die nun gleitet hinan zu den Sehwerkzeugen, bestreichelt Gleichsam zuerst die Pupillen und dringt so bis in das Innre.", "1619": "Also geschieht's, daß von jeglichem Ding wir sehen den Abstand;", "1620": "Und je größer die Masse der fortgetriebenen Luft ist, Und in je längerem Strom sie unsere Augen bestreichelt, Um so weiter entfernt erscheint auch jegliches Ding uns.", "1621": "Freilich geschieht das Alles mit solch unglaublicher Schnelle, Daß mit dem Wesen des Dings wir zugleich die Entfernung bemerken.", "1622": "Hiebei haben wir uns im Mindesten nicht zu verwundern, Daß die Bilder, die uns in die Augen treffen, obgleich man Einzeln sie nicht kann sehn, doch sichtbar machen die Dinge.", "1623": "So, wenn in Stößen der Wind einherbraust, schneidende Kälte Herströmt, fühlen wir nicht jedwedes der Theilchen des Windes, Oder des Frosts, vielmehr die Gesammtwirkung;", "1624": "sie erscheint uns, Als ob unserem Körper ein anderer Körper von außen Streiche versetzt' und ihm mittheilte die eigne Empfindung.", "1625": "Dann auch, wenn an den Stein mit dem Finger wir stoßen, be­ rühren Blos sein Aeußerstes wir und die oberste Farbe;", "1626": "wir fühlen Beim Anrühren sie nicht, wir fühlen dagegen die Härte, Die durchweg in dem Stein, im Innern desselben enthalten.Auf, und vernimm nunmehr, weßhalb im Spiegel wir jenseits Sehen das Bild, denn tiefer erscheint? in denselben gerücket:", "1627": "Etwa wie Gegenstände, die draußen wir deutlich erblicken, Wenn die geöffnete Thüre die Durchsicht frei unS gewähret Und aus dem Innern des Hauses so mancherlei draußen uns sehn läßt.", "1628": "Denn es geschiehet das Sehn auch hier durch doppelte Luftschicht:", "1629": "Einmal ist es die Lust, die diesseits lieget der Pfosten;", "1630": "Dann die nach rechts und links sich öffnenden Flügel der Thüre;", "1631": "Drauf wird das Licht von außen die Augen bestreichen und andre Lust und die Gegenstände, die draußen wir deutlich erblicken.", "1632": "So, wenn zuerst vom Spiegel sich losgeworfen das Bild hat, Stößt und treibet es, bis es zu unseren Augen gelanget, Die sich zwischen ihm selbst und den Augen befindende Luft fort Und macht, daß wir noch eher die Lust, als den Spiegel empfinden.", "1633": "Aber nachdem wir den Spiegel nun selbst auch haben empfunden, Kommt das von uns entsendete Bild alsbald auch in diesen Wieder, und kehret geworfen zurück zu unseren Augen;", "1634": "Und dieß treibt eine andere Luft und wälzet sie vor sich, Macht, daß diese noch eher, als selber das Bild, wir erblicken, Weßhalb dieses im Spiegel so weit entfernt uns ershceinen Darum haben sich die im Mindesten nicht zu verwundern, Die auf gedoppelte Schichten der Lust rückführen des Spiegels Wirkung, dieweil durch beide der Schichten die Sache geschiehet.Daß die Theile, die rechts sich an unserem Körper befinden, Go im Spiegel erscheinen, als lägen sie links, das erklärt sich Daraus, daß, wenn das Bild anprallt an der Glätte des Spiegels, Nicht unverändert von hier es zurückkommt, sondern gerades Wegs rückwärts wird gestoßen;", "1635": "sowie, wenn Einer ein thönern Bildstück, eh' es gehörig getrocknet ist, würs' an den Pseiler, Oder den Balken, dasselbe, wofern es gerad' in der Bildung Nur sich erhielt und zurück auf die andere Seite sich drückte, Das, was den Augen zuvor zur Rechten ershcienen, zur Linken Jetzt uns zeiget' und rechts durch selbige Wendung das Linke.Ebenso kommt's, daß ein Bild, von Spiegel zu Spiegel geworfen, So sich zeigt, als wären es fünf, sechs nämliche Bilder;", "1636": "Daß sich Alles, was irgend im Innern des Hauses versteckt ist, Wär' es auch noch so schief und völlig entrückt dem Gesichts- kreis, Durch die gekrümmeten Gänge heraus läßt leiten vermittelst Mehrerer Spiegel, und in den Gemächern bei sich erblicken:", "1637": "So sehr leuchtet das Bild von Spiegel zu Spiegel herüber.", "1638": "Ist nun die Linke gegeben, so wird aus dieser die Rechte, Die kehrt abermal um und wendet sich wieder zur erstern.Ja, diejenigen Spiegel, die Seitenflächen besitzen, Ausgestattet mit ähnlicher Beugung unseres Körpers, Senden uns rechts deßwegen zurück die Bilder:", "1639": "entweder, Weil von Spiegel zu Spiegel hinübergeworfen das Bild wird, Und so doppelt geprägt uns zufliegt;", "1640": "oder auch darum, Weil sich während des Kommens das Bild umwendet, indem des Spiegels gebogne Figur dasselbe nach uns sich zu drehn lehrt.", "1641": "Ferner noch kommt dir's vor, als wandelten mit uns in gleichem Schritte die Bilder einher und machten die gleichen Geberden.", "1642": "Das ist der Grund, weil von der Seite des Spiegels, von welcher Du rücktrittst, nicht plötzlich zurück auch kehren die Bilder;", "1643": "Denn die Natur zwingt Alles, zurück sich vom Andern zu ziehn und Rückwärts wieder zu springen in eben derselbigen Beugung.Glänzenden Dingen entzieht sich das Aug' und wendet den Blick ab;", "1644": "Blendet die Sonne doch selbst, wenn unverwandt man hinein- schaut, Drum, weil ihre Gewalt gar groß ist und aus der Höhe Mächtig die Bilder herab durch den Luftraum werden getrieben, Die dann treffen das Aug' und dessen Gewebe zerrütten.", "1645": "Auch ein schärferer Glanz entzündet zuweilen die Augen, Deßhalb, weil gar viele der feurigen Stoff' er befitzet, Welche, sobald in's Auge sie dringen, ihm Schmerzen erregen.", "1646": "Alles erscheint als gelb, worauf Gelbsüchtige schauen, Weil viel gelblicher Stoff abfließt aus dem Körper des Kranken Und auf die Bilder der Dinge sich setzt, auch finden in seinen Augen sich sonst noch vielerlei Mischungen, welche den Dingen Sich ansetzen und selbe mit häßlicher Bleiche bemalen.Aus dem Finsteren aber erblicken wir das, was im Licht steht, Deßhalb, weil, wenn näher zum Auge gedrungen die schwarze Finstere Luft und fest sich in seiner Oeffnung gesetzt hat, Hinter ihr augenblicklich die glänzende, leuchtende Luft folgt, Welche das Aug' ausputzt und zerstreuet die dunkelen Schatten Jener Luft;", "1647": "denn in vielen Beziehungen reger ist diese, Vielfach seiner beschaffen und mehr an Kräften vermögend.", "1648": "Hat nun diese die Wege der Augen erfüllet mit Lichte, Offen gelegt die Gänge, wo vorher wohnte die schwarze:", "1649": "Sogleich folgen dann auch, entledigt der Hülle, die Bilder, Die im Lichte sich finden, und reizen uns, daß wir sie sehen.", "1650": "Andererseits geht's nicht, aus dem Licht in's Dunkel zu schauen, Darum, weil erst später die dickere, finstere Luft folgt, Die nun alle die Oeffnungen füllt und den Augen den Zugang Absperrt, daß die Gebilde der Dinge, die von ihr bedeckt sind, Sich aus keinerlei Weis' in Bewegung zu setzen vermögen.Daß, wenn von weitem der Stadt viereckige Thürme wir sehen, Rund uns dieselben erscheinen, hat darin seine Begründung, Weil, aus der Ferne betrachtet, ein jeglicher Winkel sich stumpf zeigt, Vielmehr gänzlich vershcwindet, der Abstoß nimmer vorhanden Und deßwegen auch nimmer erreichbar unserem Blick ist;", "1651": "Weil die Masse von Lust, durch welche die Bilder sich treiben, Durch fortwährende Stöße sie nöthiget stumpfer zu werden.", "1652": "Da dem Gesichtssinn nun sich jeglicher Winkel entziehet, Kommt's, daß der steinerne Bau uns ershceint, als wär' er ge­ rundet :", "1653": "Nicht so, freilich, wie Dinge, die nah und in Wirklichkeit rund sind, Sondern nur ähnlich geformt und in unvollkommenem Abriß.So scheint uns in der Sonne der Schatten sich auch zu bewegen, Unseren Tritten zu folgen, uns nach in Geberden zu ahmen;", "1654": "Wenn du anders von einer des Lichtes beraubeten Luft magst Glauben, sie geh' und begleite des Menschen Geberd' und Bewegung;", "1655": "Denn nichts Andres, als eine des Lichtes beraubete Luft, kann Jene Erscheinung sein, die Schatten zu nennen wir pflegen.", "1656": "Dieß wird aber bewirkt, wenn wir, fortschreitend im Gehen, Fern von bestimmeten Stellen des Bodens halten der Sonne Licht;", "1657": "doch füllt urplötzlich sich wiederum, was wir verließen.", "1658": "Also geschieht's, daß immer der vorige Schatten des Körpers Nachzufolgen uns scheint, und auch von der nämlichen Seite;", "1659": "Denn es ergießet sich stets das erneuete Licht von den Strahlen, Während das erste verlischt, als zöge man Wolle durch Feuer.", "1660": "Leicht wird folglich des Lichtes dcr Boden bekundet, und leicht auch Wieder gefüllt und waschet sich rein von den dunkelen Schatten.", "1661": "Nie auch geben wir zu, daß hier sich täuschen die Augen;", "1662": "Denn, wo überall Licht, wo Schatten sich finde, zu sehen Ist ihr Geschäft;", "1663": "doch, ob es das nämliche Licht, ob derselbe Schatten, der hier war, sei, und jetzo vorübergezogen, Oder es vielmehr so, wie oben gesagt sich verhalte:", "1664": "Das zu entscheiden ist schließlich die Sache verständigen Urtheils, Denn kein Aug' ist im Stande, der Dinge Natur zu erforschen:", "1665": "Deßhalb dichte du nimmer dem Auge die Fehler des Geists an.Wann im Schiffe wir fahren, so scheint dieß stille zu stehen, Jenes dagegen, das ruht auf der Rinde, vorüber zu gleiten;", "1666": "Hügel und Au'n auch scheinen zum Hinterverdeck zu entfliehen, Wann mit gebläheten Segeln vorbei an denselben wir steuern.Scheinen ja auch, wie fest an's Himmelsgewölbe geheftet, Still die Gestirne zu stehn, und sind doch in steter Bewegung;", "1667": "Nämlich sie steigen herauf und sinken hinunter im Fernen, Wenn durchmefsen den Himmel sie haben mit leuchtendem Körper.", "1668": "Gleichergestalt scheint Sonn' und Mond an der Stelle zu bleiben, Während die Sache doch selbst anzeigt, daß sich beide bewegen.Weit von einander im Meer aufragende Felsen, daß Flotten Zwischen denselben hindurch ungehindert zu segeln vermöchten, Scheinen von Weitem vereint, ein einziges größeres Eiland.Säulen und Hausflur scheinen dem Knaben, nachdem er sich selber Lange genug hat gedreht und nun aufhört, sich im Kreise Fort und fort noch zu drehn, daß kaum er vermag zu begreifen, Wie nicht auf ihn herab sich stürze das ganze Gebäude.Wenn mit zitterndem Licht die Natur früh Morgens die rothe Fackel beginnt zu erheben und über die Berge zu tragen, Dann sind öfter die Berg', auf denen die Sonne zu stehen Und sie mit feuriger Glut unmittelbar scheint zu berühren, Kaum entfernet von uns zweitausend Schüsse des Bogens, Manchmal kaum fünfhundert sogar von Würfen des Speeres.", "1669": "Zwischen der Sonn' und den Bergen jedoch ist mächtig gedehnter Meerraum, untergebreitet den weiten ätherischen Küsten;", "1670": "Auch viel Tausend der Länder befinden sich zwischen denselben, Von gar mancherlei Völkern bewohnt und Geschlechtern der Thiere.", "1671": "Aber gesammeltes Wasser, das kaum in der Höhe des Fingers Stehn bleibt zwischen Gestein auf Straßen umher und auf Wegen, Bietet uns solchen gewaltigen Anblick unter der Erde, Als von der Erde der Schlund Hochauf gähnt gegen den Himmel;", "1672": "So daß Wolken und Himmel du unter der Erde zu sehen Glaubst, und Körper, versteckt in des Himmels Wunderershceinung.Wenn uns das muthige Roß stehn bleibt in der Mitte des Stromes, Und wir schauen hinab in die reißenden Wellen, so scheinet Strom-aufwärts uns getrieben der Körper des stehenden Thiers durch Irgend 'ne Kraft und jach sich diesem entgegen zu drängen;", "1673": "Und wo wir immer den Blick hinwerfen, da scheinet uns Alles Fort sich zu treiben und auf ganz ähnliche Weise zu fluthen.", "1674": "Endlich der Säulengang, ob schnurgrad auch er sich hinzieht, Immer der nämliche bleibt, gleichmäßig auf Säulen gestützet, Ziehet sich, wenn ganz außen am Ende du stehst und das Ganze Ueberschaust, allmälig in kegelspitzige Form zu, Eint mit dem Boden das Dach, und Alles, was rechts, mit dem Linken, Bis in die dunkele Spitze des Kegels endlich er ausläuft.So auch scheint Seefahrern die Sonn' aus den Wogen zu steigen, Unterzugehn in den Wogen und dort ihr Licht zu verbergen, Sintemal sie nichts weiter erblicken, als Wasser und Himmel:", "1675": "Glaube daher nicht leichtlich, es liege die Schuld an den Sinnen.Meerunkundigen aber erscheinen im Hafen die Schiffe Lahm an der Hinteren Wand, entgegen den Fluthen zu treiben, Denn der Theil von den Rudern, der vorsteht über die Salzfluth, Zeigt sich gerad', und gerade des Schiffs vorragendes Steuer;", "1676": "Aber was unter die Fluthen versenkt ist, scheinet gebrochen, Wieder zurück sich zu beugen und hin nach oben zu wenden Und in der Beugung fast aus der Oberfläche zu schwimmen.", "1677": "Wenn zur nächtlichen Zeit am Himmel zerstreutes Gewölke Führen die Winde dahin, dann scheinen die glänzenden Sterne Gegen dieselben zu gleiten, in ihrem erhabenen Lause Auf ganz andere Bahn, als sonst sie gemacht, sich zu wenden.", "1678": "Wenn es geschieht, daß die Hand an's Auge man bringt und dasselbe Aufwärts drückt, macht dieses die Wirkung, daß wir vermeinen, Alles, wohin sich wenden die Blicke, gedoppelt zu sehen:", "1679": "Doppelt den Leuchter mit hoch ihr Licht ausstrahlenden Kerzen;", "1680": "Doppelt den rings umher im Gebäude befindlichen Hausrath;", "1681": "Doppelt der Menschen Gesicht und doppelt gestaltet die Leiber.Hat mit erquickendem Schlummer der Schlaf uns die Glieder ge­ banden, Daß vollständig der Körper in tiefeste Ruhe versenkt liegt, Scheint es uns doch, als wachten annoch und wären noch regsam Unsere Glieder;", "1682": "wir glauben im nächtlichen Dunkel die Sonne, Mit ihr die Helle des Tages zu schaun;", "1683": "am geschlossenen Orte Glauben vorüberzuziehu wir am Himmel, am Meer und an Strömen Und an Gebirgen, und Fluren mit unserem Fuß zu durchwandern;", "1684": "Töne sogar zu vernehmen, wenn ringsum nächtliche Stille Waltet und Ernst;", "1685": "ja, Reden zu führen, indem wir doch schweigen.Uebrigens sehen wir noch viel Wunderershceinungen der Art, Welche den Sinnen zu traun uns abzuhalten versuchen, Aber umsonst;", "1686": "denn es ist in den häufigsten Fällen die eigne Irrige Meinung, die selbst in die Sache wir tragen, und die dann Sehen uns läßt, was nie uns wurde gezeigt von den Sinnen;", "1687": "Und doch gibt's nichts Schöneres, als augenscheinliche Dinge Von den Zweifeln zu trennen, die selber der Geist noch hinzuthut.Endlich, wenn Einer vermeint, daß Nichts man wisse, so weiß er Selber ja dieß auch nicht, ob Nichts in Allem man wisse.", "1688": "Gerne verzieh? ich darauf, mit Solchem herum mich zu streiten, Welcher den Kopf hinwendet nach eben verlassenen Spuren.", "1689": "Doch, im Fall ich ihm auch zugäbe, daß dieses er wisse, Möcht' ich fragen:", "1690": "von wannen, da vorher nie er die Wahrheit Sah, der Begriff vom Wissen und vom Nichtwissen ihm zukam?", "1691": "Wie er die Kenntniß sich vom Wahren und Falschen erworben, Und er den Zweifel von dem, was gewiß in den Dingen ist, scheide?", "1692": "sAlsdann würde man finden, zuerst aus den Sinnen entstanden Sei die Erkenntniß des Wahren, und erstere nicht widerlegbar;", "1693": "Denn weit größeren Glauben verdient doch immerhin, was aus Eigner Natur mit dem Wahren das Falsche vermag zu besiegen.", "1694": "Wem muß größeren Glauben man schenken sonnt, als den Sinnen?", "1695": "Läßt aus der Sinne Betrug sich ein Schluß ziehn gegen dieselben, Da sich ein jeglicher Grund herleitet allein aus den Sinnen?", "1696": "Weil ja, wenn diese betrügen, zugleich auch alle Vernunft trügt.", "1697": "Wäre das Ohr im Stande, dem Auge Verweise zu geben?", "1698": "Oder dem Ohr das Gefühl, und des Mundes Geschmack dem Gefühle?", "1699": "Oder bestritte die Nase, was gegenerweisen die Augen?", "1700": "Nicht so — dünket mich — iM, denn seine besondere Kraft ist Jedem ertheilt, sein eignes Vermögen auch jedem, und darum Muß, was weich, was kalt, was heiß, nothwendig den Sinnen Auch so scheinen, sie müßen der Dinge verschiedene Farben, Und was noch mit den Farben verbunden, besonders empfinden.", "1701": "So hat des Mundes Geschmack sein eignes Vermögen, sein eignes So der Geruch, das Gehör sein eigenes, was uns beweisen Daß kein Sinn je den andern zu widerlegen vermöge.", "1702": "Ja, es vermöcht' auch selbst nicht einer den andern zu tadeln, Weil stets jedem von ihnen derselbige Glaube gebühret, Folglich auch das, was zu jeglicher Zeit sie bethätigen, wahr ist.", "1703": "Und wenn gleich die Vernunft nicht kann darlegen die Gründe, Weßhalb, was in der Näh' ein Viereck war, in der Ferne Rund sich zeige, so ist's doch besser, bei mangelnder Kenntniß Irrig den Grund von den beiden Figuren zu geben, als dach wir Ließen den Händen entwischen, was klar uns lieget vor Augen, Anzutasten den obersten Glauben und alle die Stützen Niederzuwerfen, worauf doch Leben beruhet und Wohlfahrt.", "1704": "Nicht blos alle Vernunft stürzt plötzlich zusammen, es stürzt auch Selber das Leben, wo nicht du den Sinnen zu trauen den Muth hast, Fährlichen Gegenden nicht, noch anderen Dingen von der Art Suchst zu entfliehen, und dem, was entgegen dir tritt, dich be­ quemest.", "1705": "Alles ist deßhalb auch nicht weiter, als eiteler Wortschwall, Was man als Rüstzeug wählt, tun gegen die Sinne zu streiten,Endlich, wie bei'm Bauwesen geschieht, wenn falsch nur die erste Linie läuft, von der richtigen Flucht abweichet das Richtmaß Und um ein Winziges nur aus die Seite sich neiget das Bleiloth, Daß voll Fehler und schief dastehet das ganze Gebäude, Hängend nach vorn oder hinten, gedrückt, Abstoßend und häßlich, So daß Manche? in Bälde den Einsturz droht und auch wirtlich Stürzt, da gleich im Beginne die richtige Regel verfehlt war:", "1706": "Ebenso muß die Vernunft nothwendig als falsch und betrüglich Dir sich erweisen, sobald von betrÄglichen Sinnen sie ausgeht.", "1707": "Wie von den übrigen Sinnen nun jeder von dem, was ihn angeht.", "1708": "Habe Gefühl, daS ermitteln wir auf nicht schwierigem Wege.Erstlich, den Schall und die Stimme vernehmen wir, wenn zu dem Ohre Dringen die Stoffe derselben und schlagen an dessen Organe:", "1709": "Drum auch muß man bekennen, daß beide, der Schall und die Stimme, Körperlich seien, dieweil sie die Sinne vermögen zu rühren.", "1710": "Deßhalb reizt auch öfter die Stimme den Schlund, und das laute, Weithin tönende Schrei'n macht rauh und heiser die Kehle.", "1711": "Denn, wenn die Stoffe des Lautes, gedrängt in größere Hausen, Sich anschicken, den Weg durch?", "1712": "Enge nach außen zu nehmen, Wird, wenn die Pforte des Mundes gefüllt ist, rauh auch der Ausgang, Und es verletzet die Stimme den Pfad, durch den sie hinausgeht.", "1713": "Nicht ist zu zweifeln daher, es bestehen die Stimmen und Worte Aus Urstoffen von Körpern;", "1714": "sie können ja so nur verletzen.Auch entgeht eS dir nicht, wie sehr für den Körper ermüdend, Wie abspannend für Nerven und jeglicher Kraft uns beraubend Sei fortwährendes Reden, vom frühesten Strahle des Morgens Ununterbrochen geführt, bis Nacht und Dunkel hereinbricht, Sonderlich, wenn eS, verbunden mit lautem Geschrei, sich ergießet.", "1715": "Körperlich muß deßhalb nothwendig der Stimme Natur sein, Weil durch häufiges Sprechen ein Theil vom Körper daraufgeht.", "1716": "Auch nicht ähnlich an Form durchdringen die Stoffe die Ohren, Wenn tief brüllet die Tuba mit niedergehaltnem Geschmetter, Und daS gebogene Horn rückhallet von dumpfem Gebrumme z Oder der Schwan, vom Tode geängstet, in Helieons Thälern Mit wehklagender Stimm' anhebt sein schmelzendes Sterblied.Alle die Töne somit, die tief ans dem Körper wir pressen Und auf geradestem Weg zum Mund aussenden, sie werden Kunstreich durch die Bewegung der Zunge zu Worten gegliedert, Auch durch die eigene Bildung der Lippen gebeugt und gesormet.", "1717": "Aber der rauhere Ton entsteht aus rauherem Urstoff, Wie gleichfalls auch der glatte von glätteren Stoffen erzeugt wird.Ist nun der Zwischenraum nicht groß, aus welchem die Stimme Herkommt, müssen wir auch nothwendig die einzelnen Worte Scharf und deutlich vernehmen und unterscheiden nach Gliedrung, Denn es erhält sich die Bildung des Worts, es erhält die Figur sich.", "1718": "Wenn hingegen das Wort herkommt aus weiterem Abstand, Mischt dasselbe sich auch nothwendig mit größerem Lustraum, Und es verwirrt sich der Laut, indem aus der Lust er daherfliegt.", "1719": "Daher kommt's, daß den Schall zwar hören du kannst, doch mit nichten Untershceiden, was seie der einzelnen Worte Bedeutung:", "1720": "Also verwirrt sich der Laut und wird undeutlich im Kommen.Ferner, ein einziges Wort, vom Mund entsendet des Herolds, Tönt ost Jedem in's Ohr vom ganzen versammelten Volke, Denn es zertheilt sich plötzlich in viele die einzige Stimme, Flieget nach hier und nach dort, da jeglichem Ohr sie besonders Sich mittheilet, bezeichnend den Klang und die Bildung der Worte.Doch der Theil von den Lauten, der nicht zu den Ohren gelangt, wird Wirkungslos vorübergesührt und verfliegt in die Lüfte.", "1721": "Wieder ein Theil auch wirst sich an dichtere Körper und prallet Schallend zurück und täuscht manchmal mit dem Bilde des Wortes.Weil du nun das einsiehst, mein Trefflichster, kannst du getrost auch Rechenschaft dir selber und Anderen geben, worin wohl Suchen man müsse den Grund, daß an einsamen Orten die Felsen Ordnungsmäßig erwidern die nämlichen Formen der Worte, Wenn wir Freund' aussuchen, die zwischen beschatteten Bergen Schweifen umher, und mit lautem Geschrei die Zerstreueten rufen.", "1722": "Sechsfach, siebensach hab' ich das Echo vernommen von Worten, Die man nur einmal rief:", "1723": "so warf ein Hügel dem andern Widerhallend sie zu, um wieder zurück sie zu bringen.", "1724": "Derlei Gegenden malen die Grenznachbarn, als von Nymphen Und bocksfüßigen Satyrn bewohnet, sich aus, und von Faunen:", "1725": "Diese, behaupten sie, treiben des Nachts umher sich und stören Durch ihr Gelärm und loses Geschäcker die schweigende Ruhe;", "1726": "Klänge der Saiten vernehme man dann und die schmelzende Klage, Welche die Flöt' ausgießt, vom Finger des Sängers geschlagen;", "1727": "Weit und breit auch horchen die Landesbebauer, sobald Pan Schüttelt sein halbwild Haupt, umgeben mit fichtenem Walle, Und mit gebogener Hippe durchläuft die geöffneten Halme, Daß die Schalmei nicht ruhet, den Hirtengesang zu entlocken.", "1728": "Mehreres redet man noch von derlei Wundergeshcichten.", "1729": "Daß nicht auch von den Göttern sogar man die einsamen Orte Wähne geflohn, stafsirt man sie aus mit allerlei Wundern, Oder von anderem Grunde geleitet noch:", "1730": "ist doch das ganze Menschengeschlecht gar gierig, das Ohr nach Geschichtchen zu spitzen.", "1731": "Uebrigens darf es dir nicht ausfallen, daß selber durch solche Orte, durch welche das Aug' nicht durchzublicken im Stand ist, Stimmen zu uns Herdringen und wirken auf unsere Ohren:", "1732": "e Hören wir doch ein Gespräch auch ost durch vershclossene Thüren.", "1733": "Nämlich die Stimme vermag durch der Dinge gewundene Gänge Ohne Gefährde zu gehn, doch weigern sich dessen die Bilder;", "1734": "Denn sie zerreißen, sobald ihr Durchgang nimmer gerad ist, Wie durch Poren des Glases, wo ganz durchstreichet das Bildniß.Weiter:", "1735": "nach jeglicher Seite vermag sich der Schall zu ver­ theilen, Weil aus dem einen der andre entsteht;", "1736": "doch, ist er zersprungen Einmal, streut er in viele sich aus, wie der Funke des Feuers Ost in mehrere Funken sich pflegt zu zerstreun und zu theilen:", "1737": "Demnach füllet mit Tönen sich jeglicher Ort, und ob Alles Noch so versteckt auch sei, doch wird vom Schall es gewecket.", "1738": "Aber die Bilder zumal, sind einmal gesandt sie, verfolgen Gradaus immer die Richtung, daher Niemand auch im Stand ist, Ueber Verhacke zu schaun, doch Töne vernimmt er von auswärts.", "1739": "Selber die Stimme sogar, indem sie verschlossene Wege e Durchläuft, stumpfet sich ab und dringet verworren zum Ohre, Daß zwar wohl wir den Schall, doch minder die Worte vernehmen.", "1740": "Wie wir den Saft empfinden vermittelst der Zung' und des Gaumens, Das hat tieferen Grund, es erheischt auch größere Mühe.Erstlich, wir fühlen im Munde den Saft, wenn die Speise durch Kauen Wir ausdrücken, gerad, wie wenn mit der Hand man das Wasser Aus dem geschwängerten Schwamm ausdrückt, den trocknen man möchte.", "1741": "Was man heraus nun gedrückt, das wird durch des Gaumens Kanäle Gänzlich verführet, sowie durch die Röhren der lockeren.", "1742": "Zunge.", "1743": "Wenn von glatter Natur nun die Stoffe des flüssigen Safts sind, Ist die Berührung mild und es füllen mit mildem Geschmack sich Ringsum alle die feuchten, die schweißigen Kammern der Zunge;", "1744": "Aber, je rauher sie sind und in größerer Menge verbunden, Stechen sie nur um so mehr und reizen in uns den ^Geschmakcs-Minn.", "1745": "Aber bis dahin nur empfinden die Lust wir vom Saft, wo Endet der Gaum;", "1746": "doch wenn er hinab sich zum Schlunde gesenkt hat, Ist das Vergnügen vorbei, er vertheilt sich umher in den Gliedern.", "1747": "Wenig auch liegt daran, wodurch sich der Körper ernähre, Wenn das Genossene nur du richtig verdauet in alle Glieder vertheilst und genügender Saft im Magen verbleibet.", "1748": "Nunmehr zeig' ich, warum ein Thier die Speis' und ein andres Andre genießt, und warum, was widrig dem einen und herb ist, Wiederum süß und lieblich das andere könne bedünken.So groß ist hierin die Verschiedenheit und der Abstand, Daß, was Speise dem einen, dem andern verderbliches Gift wird.", "1749": "Richtig ist das, daß Schlangen, berührt vom Speichel des Men­ schen, Sterben, indem sie sich selber zernagen und also vernichten.", "1750": "Ebenso ist Nießwurz für uns ein Gift das den Tod bringt, Während dagegen den Ziegen und Wachteln das Fett sie vermehret.Daß, wie dieses sich Alles verhalte, du mögest erkennen, Mußt du zuerst dich erinnern an das, was oben ich sagte:", "1751": "Daß aus mancherlei Weise der Stoff in den Dingen gemischt sei;", "1752": "Ferner, daß jegliches Thier, das Nahrung genießt, wie von außen Jedes vershcieden vom andern nach Umriß ist und nach Gattung, Und, wie von außen beschränkt bei jedem die Glieder sich zeigen, Ebenso auch nach Stoff und Figur abweiche von andern.", "1753": "Sind nun verschieden die Stoffe, so sind auch die Räume dazwischen, Wie auch die Gänge, die Poren zu nennen wir pflegen, verschieden Rings in den Gliedern umher, im Mund und selber im Gaumen;", "1754": "Einige kleiner somit und andere größer;", "1755": "die einen Müssen die Form darstellen des Dreiecks, andre des Vierecks;", "1756": "Viele davon sind rund, viel' haben auch mancherlei Winkel.", "1757": "Denn so, wie es der Stoffe Figur und Bewegung erfordert, Müssen die Poren sich auch in ihren Figuren verändern Und sich die Gänge verändern, beschränkt durch eignes Gewebe.", "1758": "So wird denn, was lieblich dem Einen ist, bitter dem Andern:", "1759": "Wer's als lieblich empfindet, den müssen die glattesten Stoffe Sanft nur rühren und so eingehn in des Gaumens Kanäle;", "1760": "Während dagegen bei dem, der herb im Innern dasselbe Ding empfindet, es rauh' und hakig hinein in den Schlund dringt.Nun ist's leicht, aus diesem das Uebrige auch zu erkennen.", "1761": "Wer, wenn in ihm sich die Galle gehaust, vom Fieber befallen, Oder aus anderem Grund von Krankheit heftig erregt wird, Dem wird gänzlich zerrüttet der Körper, und sämmtliche Stoffe Werden verrückt bei ihm aus der ordnungsmäßigen Lage.", "1762": "Daher kommt es denn auch, daß Körper, die sonst sich dem Sinne Wohl anpaßten, sich jetzt nicht mehr anpassen, dagegen Andre genehmer ihm sind, die Empfindung wecken des Herben.", "1763": "Beiderlei Körper nun sind im Geschmacke des Honigs vereinigt, Was ich dir mehrfach schon im Obigen habe gezeiget.Auf, ich behandle nun das, wie, wenn der Geruch sich der Rase Nähert, auf diese er wirkt.", "1764": "Für's Erste, so gibt es der Dinge Viele, woraus sich der Strom von vershciednen Gerüchen hervor-wälzt;", "1765": "Nicht ist an Ausfluß, Trieb und Verbreitung derselben zu zweifeln.", "1766": "Aber sie eignen sich minder und mehr für das thierische Werkzeug, Weil sie verschieden nach Form:", "1767": "drum führet der Honiggeruch auch Alls entlegener Ferne die Bienen daher durch die Lüste;", "1768": "So auch den Geier das Aas;", "1769": "auch sucht, wo des Wildes gespaltne Klaue die Fährt' hinlenkte, mit Gier der entlassene Hund sie Auf, und von weither wittert, wenn Menschen sich nahn, den Geruch schon Sie, der Romulischen Burg Errett'rin, die schimmernde Weißgans.", "1770": "So führt also die Wittrung ein Jedes zu der ihm bestimmten Nahrung, und zwingt es, zurück vor widrigem Gifte zu scheuen:", "1771": "Und das ist es, wodurch sich erhalten der Thiere Geschlechter.", "1772": "Dieser Geruch nun selbst, der, die Nase berührend, sie reizet, — Sei's, daß der eine sich weiter, der andre beschränkter ver­ breite — Wird so weit in die Ferne doch nun und nimmer getragen, Wie beim Schall und der Stimme geschieht;", "1773": "ich geschweige der Bilder, Die aus die Schürfe des Augs einwirken und reizen die Sehkraft:", "1774": "Langsam kommt er herbei, irrt um und verlieret sich mälig Vorher schon, und wird in die leichteren Lüste zerstreuet, Da aus dem Innern zuerst nur mühsam er sich entwickelt.", "1775": "Denn, daß von innen heraus der Geruch entströme den Dingen, Liefert uns das den Beweis, daß alles Zerbrochene stärker Riecht, auch alles Zerriebne und alles vom Feuer Versengte.", "1776": "Ferner ist gar kein Zweifel, aus größeren Stoffen geschaffen Sei der Geruch, als der Schall, da steinerne Mauern der erstre Nicht durchdringt, durch welche doch Schall und Stimme sich schwingen.", "1777": "Schwieriger muß es daher bei riechenden Dingen ershceinen, Aufzufinden den Ort, an welchem dieselben versteckt sind.", "1778": "Während er nämlich verweilt, erstarret der Trieb in den Lüften Und eilt nicht mehr warm zu dem Sinn und kündet die Sach' an:", "1779": "Drum auch irren so häufig die Hunde vergeblich der Spur nach.Doch nicht lediglich bei dem Geruch und bei dem Geschmack ist Dieses der Fall;", "1780": "auch sind die Gestalten und Farben der Dinge Alle zumal nicht gleich annehmlich jeglichem Sinne, So, daß einer davon nicht mehr, als der andre, gereizt wird.", "1781": "Wie sonst könnten dem Hahn, der die Nacht mit schlagenden Flügeln Scheucht und mit lautem Krähen die Morgenröthe herbeiruft, Richt entgegen sich stellen die grimmigen Löwen und ihn nicht Anschaun?", "1782": "denken sie doch ihm möglichst schnell zu entfliehen.", "1783": "Nämlich, es sind im Körper des Hahns Stofftheile vorhanden Solcher Natur, daß, wenn in's Auge deS Löwen sie treffen, In die Pupillen sie ihm sich bohren und heftige Schmerzen Zuziehn, daß er den Blick nicht aushält, er, der so wild ist;", "1784": "Während dieselben für uns doch gar nichts Störendes haben, Sei's nun, daß sie durchaus nicht durchzudringen vermögen, Oder doch, drängen sie durch, frei steht aus den Augen der Ausgang, Daß im Verweilen sie nicht im Mindesten diese verlegen.Aus nun!", "1785": "WaS das Gemüth uns erreg' und wie das, was von außen Kommt, zu dem Geiste gelange, vernimm mit Wenigem jetzo.Erstlich behaupt' ich das, daß mancherlei Bilder der Dinge Schwärmen auf allerlei Weise, nach jeglicher Seite getrieben, Zarte, die leicht in der Lust sich zusammenzufügen vermögen, Wenn sie sich treffen, wie Spinnengeweb' und Blättchen des Goldes;", "1786": "Sintemal ungleich seiner sie sind und von dünnrem Gewebe, Als die, welche das Aug' im Sehn saßt und dann gereizt wird:", "1787": "Denn sie dringen hinein in die winzigsten Poren des Körpers, Wecken den zarten Geist im Innern und reizen den Sinn uns.", "1788": "So denn sehen wir auch Centauren und Glieder der Scyllen, Schlünde des höllischen Hunds, wir sehen Gestalten von Solchen, Deren Gebein, da sie längst todt sind, umfasset die Erde;", "1789": "Weil ja zerstreut umstiegen Gebilde von allerlei Arten, Welche sich theils in der Lust durch freies Gebahren erzeugen, Theils von Dingen verschiedener Art entweichen und fliehen Und, aus deren Figuren zusammengesetzet, sich bilden.", "1790": "Sicherlich stammt doch nicht aus dem Leben das Bild deS Centauren, Weil in der Dinge Natur niemals ein solches Geschöpf war;", "1791": "Sondern, wenn zufällig die Bilder des Rosses und Menschen Treffen zusammen, so hängen sie schnell, wie ich oben bemerkte, Wegen der zarten Natur und dem seinen Geweb an einander.Mehreres noch der Art entsteht auf die nämliche Weise, Was, da mit rashcer Bewegung und äußerst leicht es dahinschlüpft, Uns — wie ich früher gezeigt — durch einen vereinzelten Anstoß Als ein zartes Gebilde die Seele vermag zu erregen:", "1792": "Denn die selber ist zart und zum Erstaunen beweglich.Daß dieß wirklich so sei, ist daraus leicht zu erkennen:", "1793": "Weil das, was mit dem Geist und den Augen wir sehen, einander Aehnlich ist, so muß es auf Ähnliche Weis' auch entstehen.", "1794": "Run denn, da ich gelehrt, daß etwa Gebilde der Löwen Das mich lassen erblicken, wodurch mein Auge gereizt wird, Läßt sich ersehn, daß ähnlich der Geist von Gebilden der Löwen Und von dem Uebrigen allen erregt wird, das er gerad so Sieht, wie die Augen es sehn, wenn schon weit feiner und zarter.Aus nicht anderem Grund bleibt, wann sich der Körper in i Schlummer Hingießt, wacheick der Geist, als weil fortwährend dieselben Bilder noch reizen den Geist, die, während wir wachten, unS reizten:", "1795": "So sehr, daß wahrhaftig Denselben zu sehen wir glauben, Dessen der Tod schon längst sich bemächtiget hat und die Erde.", "1796": "Hiezu zwingt die Natur, weil alle Gefühle des Körpers, Die nun ^während des Schlafes) gehemmt sind, ruhn in den Glie­ dern Und durch Wirkliches nicht zu bestreiten vermögen das Falsche.", "1797": "Dann liegt auch die Erinnrung im Schlafe zu matt und zu kraftlos, Um zu erkennen den Trug, als sähe der Geist noch im Leben Einen, der lang vorher hinschied und hinab in das Grab stieg.Uebrigens wundre dich nicht, daß Bilder sich scheinen zu regen, Regelgemäß auch die Arm' und die anderen Glieder zu werfen Wie bisweilen im Traum uns vorkommt, daß eS geschehe.", "1798": "Eines ^der Bilder) verschwindet, ein andres, in anderer Stellung, Tritt an den Platz und das erstere scheint die Geberde zu wechseln, Denn, wie man wohl einsieht, vollzieht dieß äußerst geschwind sich:", "1799": "So groß ist der bewegliche Trieb, so groß ist der Bilder Zahl und die Menge der Theilchen, die jeder bemerkbare Zeitpunkt Führt von den Dingen herbei, daß niemals Mangel entstehn kann.", "1800": "Mancherlei wär' aus diesem Gebiet noch zu forschen und Manches Noch zu erörtern, wenn Alles genau entwickeln ich wollte.", "1801": "Allerst fragt sich, warum, was unsere Seele zu denken Irgend geneigt ist, dieses im Augenblick sie sich deutet?", "1802": "Nehmen die Bilder vielleicht Rücksicht auf unseren Willen, Daß sie sieh allsogleich darstellen, sobald wir es wollen?", "1803": "Was in den Sinn uns kommt:", "1804": "Meer, Erd' und Himmel, Zu­ sammen künste von Menschen und Festaufjüge, Gelage und Schlachten, Schafft und bereitet Natur das Alles nach unserem Winke?", "1805": "Selbst an dem nämlichen Ort, in der nämlichen Gegend, wo Andre Dinge vielleicht sich denken, die ganz abweichen von diesen?Was ist's ferner noch, wenn im Schlaf wir die Bilder einher­ gehn Sehn im geregelten Zug und biegsam regen die Glieder, Und nicht weniger biegsam die Arm' in einander verschränken, Auch zugleich mit den Augen der Beugung folgen des Fußes?", "1806": "Triefen dann etwa die Bilder von Kunst und schwärmen, belehrt schon, Nächtlicher Weil' umher, um ihr Scherzfpis da zu betreiben?", "1807": "Oder ist mehr Wahrheit darin:", "1808": "weil dieses Kur gleichen Zeit wir zusammenempfinden, daß auch, wie im einzelnen Wortlaut, Mehrere Zeiten im Punkte versteckt find, die der Verstand forscht?", "1809": "Daher kommt's, daß zu jeglicher Zeit und an jeglichem Orte Bilder von jeglicher Art vor Augen uns stehn und bereit sind;", "1810": "So groß ist der bewegliche Trieb, so groß ist die Menge:", "1811": "Eines sder Bilder^ verschwindet, ein andres, in anderer Stellung, Tritt an den Platz, und das erstere scheint die Geberde zu wechseln.", "1812": "Und da so zart sie sind, so kann auch die nur, aus welche Schärfer den Blick sie richtet, genau wahrnehmen die Seele;", "1813": "Alle, die nicht aus sich selbst sie bereitete, Sehen verloren.", "1814": "Selbst nun bereitet die Bilder sie sich und hofft, das sie künftig Jegliches Ding sehn werde, nach dem sie verlangt:", "1815": "und es ist so.Siehest du nicht, daß die Augen, sobald sie zartere Dinge Sich anschicken zu sehn, anstrengen fich müssen und schärfen Und, so sie daS nicht thun, Nichts deutlich zu sehen vermögen?", "1816": "Demnah ckannst du sogar bei leicht zu erkennenden Dingen, Wenn du den Geist nicht richtest darauf, wahrnehmen, daß solche Weit entfernt, nach der Zeit, wie auch nach dem Raume, von uns find.", "1817": "Weßhalb wolltest du nun dich wundern, daß für die Seele All die Bilder, auf die sie sich nicht anstrenget, zu Grund gehn?", "1818": "Dann auch vermuthen wir oft bei kleinen Ershceinungen Großes, Und wir verwickeln uns selbst in die Schlingen des Trugs und der Täuschung.So auch geschieht's manchmal, daß dem Bild ein andres von andrer Gattung sich unterschiebt;", "1819": "daß das, was eher ein Weib war, Unter den Händen zum Mann sich scheinet verwandelt zu haben, Auch aus dem einen ein andres Gesicht und Alter hervorgeht:", "1820": "Daß wir uns deß nicht wundern, dafür sorgt Schlaf und Vergessen.Suche jedoch bei all den Dingen dem schädlichen Irrthum Möglichst dich zu entziehn und sorglichst davor dich zu wahren, Daß du nicht wähnst, es seien die glänzenden Lichter der Augen Dazu geschaffen, damit hinsehen wir können, und daß nur Deßhalb Schenkel und Beine, gestützt auf die Füße, sich könnten Biegen, um stattliche Schritte zu machen, und auch so die Arme Lediglich deßhalb sei'n mit den kräftigen Schultern verbunden, Auch beidseits zur Bedienung die Hände denselben gegeben, Daß, was das Leben erheischt, wir damit zu verrichten vermögen.", "1821": "Alles das Uebrige noch, was auf derlei Art man erkläret, Ist unrichtig und gibt Anlaß zu verkehreten Schlüssen:", "1822": "Weil dem Gebrauche zulieb Nichts ist am Körper entstanden, Sondern das vorher schon Entstandene erst zum Gebrauch führt.", "1823": "Weder das Sehn war da vor entstandenem Lichte der Augen, Noch auch der Sprach' Anwendung vor anerschassener Zunge;", "1824": "Vielmehr ist ja der Zung' Ursprung weit älter, als alles Sprechen, und lang vorher schon waren die Ohren erschaffen, Ehe man Töne vernahm;", "1825": "kurzum, auch sämmtliche Glieder Sind schon vor dem Gebrauch — so wenigstens dünkt mich — gewesen:", "1826": "Demnach konnten sie nicht zum Zweck des Gebrauches erwahcsen.Gegen einander jedoch Faustkämpfe bestehen, die Glieder Sich zerfleischen und gräßlich den Körper mit Blut sich besudeln, War schon lange, bevor hinflogen die schimmernden Pfeile;", "1827": "Und vor Wunden sich hüten, das lehrte zuvor die Natur schon, Ehe der Linken den Schild, durch ihn sich zu decken, die Kunst gab.", "1828": "Auch den ermüdeten Leib hinstrecken, um Ruh' zu genießen, Ist weit älter, als weiche und üppig schwellende Betten;", "1829": "Und sich zu löschen den Durst war eher im Brauch, als die Becher.Derlei Dinge somit, zum Nutzen des Lebens erfunden, Magst du, als lediglich nur zum Gebrauche vorhanden betrachten;", "1830": "Anders verhält es jedoch sich mit allen den andern, die, vorher Schon entstanden für sich, den Begriff erst gaben von Nutzen, Wie vor allen wir das bei den Sinnen erblicken und Gliedern.", "1831": "Fern muß also von uns, fern bleiben die irrige Meinung, Als ob wegen des Nutzens allein sie wären erschaffen.Auch nicht darfst du dich wundern ob jegliches Thieres Naturtrieb, Nahrung, wie sein Körper sie eben erheischt, sich zu suchen.", "1832": "Daß auf mancherlei Art von den Körpern Theilchen in Menge Los sich machen und ihnen entfließen, ist oben gelehrt schon:", "1833": "Aber vor allen geschieht? bei den Thieren, die stets sich bewegen.", "1834": "Vieles von ihnen entweicht, durch Schweiß aus dem Innern gepresset, Vieles auch wird aus dem Munde gehaucht durch Keuchen und Athmen.", "1835": "Hiedurch magert der Körper nun ab und die ganze Natur wird Ueber den Haufen geworfen:", "1836": "die Folg' ist quälender Hunger.", "1837": "Drum ist Speise vonnöthen, damit durch selbe die Glieder Werden gestützt, aus's Neue die Kräfte belebt und der Eßlust Gnüge gethan, die in allen Gefäßen des Leibes sich kund gibt.", "1838": "Ebenso sondert das Flüssige sich in jeglichen Theil ab, Welcher das Flüssige braucht, und zerstreuet die vielen verdickten Säfte, die Glut erregen in unserem Magen, und diese Löscht der genossene Trank wie ^wirkliches) Feuer, damit nicht Ganz ausdörre die Glieder die Alles vertrocknende Hitze.", "1839": "So wird also der lechzende Durst aus unserem Körper Weggeshcwemmet, und so die Begierde nach Speise befriedigt.", "1840": "Nunmehr sag' ich dir noch, wie's komme, daß Schritte nach vor­ wärts Richten wir können nach Willen, gelenksam regen die Glieder;", "1841": "Dann auch, welcherlei Kraft die gewaltige Masse des Körpers Fortzustoßen vermöge:", "1842": "vernimm aufmerksam die Worte.Demnach sag' ich:", "1843": "es treffen zuerst auf unseren Geist die Bilder des GehnS und stoßen ihn an, wie oben bemerkt ward.", "1844": "Draus entstehet der Wille, denn Niemand macht sich an eine Sache, bevor nicht eher der Geist schon sah, was er wolle:", "1845": "Was nun eher er sieht, ist das Bild desselbigen Dinges.", "1846": "Ist im Geiste nun rege der Wille zu gehn und zu schreiten, Stößt urplötzlich er die durch alle Theile des Körpers Und durch sämmtliche Glieder zerstreuete seelische Kraft an:", "1847": "Dieses bewirket er leicht, da beide so nahe verwandt find.", "1848": "Weiter nun stößet die Seel' auf den Körper, und solchergestalt wird Mälig die ganze Masse bewegt und gestoßen nach vonvärts.Außerdem kommt auch das noch vor, daß der Körper sich ausdehnt, Wenn die beständig bewegliche Luft, die Allem sich mittheilt, Reichlich hinein in die Poren sich macht, in die Oeffnungen dringet Und somit sich vermischt mit den winzigsten Theilchen des Körpers.", "1849": "Also geschieht es in doppelter Weis' und aus doppeltem Grunde, Daß, wie das Schiff durch Wind und Segel, der Körper sich fortträgt.", "1850": "Niemals kann es jedoch hiebei als befremdend ershceinen, Daß solch winzigen Stoffen die Kraft inwohnt, den so großen Körper zu drehn und die ganze gewaltige Last zu bewegen.", "1851": "Treibet ja doch auch der Wind, der selber so dünn von Bestand ist, Vor sich mit starkem Bebahren ein mächtiges Schiff, das von einer Einzigen Hand nur, so rasch es dahin auch fegte, regiert wird;", "1852": "Auch ein Steuer nur lenkt es, wohin ihm immer beliebet;", "1853": "Und durch Winden und Hebel bewegen Maschinen die schwersten Lasten und heben empor sie mit gar nicht großem Bemühen.", "1854": "Nunmehr, wie mit Ruhe der Schlummer die Glieder bethaue, Und wie derselbe die Brust von den Sorgen des Geistes erlöse, Will ich in nicht zahlreichen, doch lieblichen Versen verlautbarn.", "1855": "Schwanengesang, der kurz nur dauert, ist besser, als jenes Kranichgekrächz, das schmettert in luftige Wolken des Auster.", "1856": "Schenke du nur aufmerksam Gehör und geschärseten Sinn mir, Daß nicht später du läugnest, was schon ich als möglich erwiesen, Nicht mit entgegenstrebender Brust vom Wahren dich Wendest Und durch eigene Schuld dich selber beraubest der Einsicht.Erstlich, der Schlaf entsteht, indem in den Gliedern die Kraft der Seele sich trennt, die theils sich zurück Ms ihnen gezogen, Theils sich zusammengedrängt und mehr in's Innre gesenkt hat:", "1857": "Dann erst lösen die Glieder sich aus und zerfließen erschlaffet.", "1858": "Denn es besteht kein Zweifel, daß durch Mitwirkung der Seele Wir Empfindung besitzen;", "1859": "da diese der Schlaf nun behindert, Ist zu vermuthen, es werde das Wesen der Seele verstöret Und nach außen gejagt:", "1860": "doch nicht vollständig;", "1861": "es läge Sonst ja der Leib umgössen mit ewigem Froste des Todes, Weil kein Theil von der Seele sodann in den Gliedern verborgen Bliebe zurück, wie unter der Asche das Feuer versteckt ist, Plötzlich daraus das Gefühl hervorzublasen im Körper Und aus der heimlichen Glut auflodern zu lassen die Flamme.Aber, aus was dieß neue Gefühl sich erwecket, wodurh cdie Seele gestört kann werden, erschlafft hinsinken der Körper, Will ich dir jetzt darthun:", "1862": "laß nicht mein Wort in den Wind gehn.Erstlich, dieweil allseits von außen der Körper berührt wird Von der umgebenden Lust, so wird nothwendig derselbe Angegriffen von ihr und erhält vielfältige Stöße:", "1863": "Drum siehst alle Geschöpfe du theils mit Bälgen versehen, Theils mit Schalen bedeckt und mit schwartigen Häuten und Hüllen.", "1864": "Ebenso schlägt die Luft bei den athmenden Thieren die innern Theile, so oft sie hinein sie saugen und wieder verhauchen.", "1865": "Das nun wirkt mit Gewalt auf den Körper von außen und innen;", "1866": "Und da weitere Stöße die winzigsten Theile desselben Noch durchdringen, bis hin zu den uranfänglichen Stoffen, Kommt's, daß die Kraft allmälig in unseren Gliedern erstirbet.", "1867": "Denn es erfolgt in der Lage des Urstoffs, wie bei dem Körper, Störung auch bei der Seele, so daß ein Theil von der letztern Wird nach außen getrieben, ein andrer im Innern sich birget;", "1868": "Wieder ein andrer, umher in den Gliedern zerstreuet, vermag nicht Sich zu verbinden und wechselnd die Regsamkeit zu bewirken, Denn die Natur umzäunt Zugäng' und innre Gemeinschaft, Und es entweicht das Gefühl tief bei der veränderten Regung.", "1869": "Da es nun Nichts mehr gibt, das die Glieder zu stützen vermöchte, Wird entkräftet der Körper und sämmtliche Glieder erschlaffen, Abwärts sinken die Arme, die Augenlider, und oft auch Werden die Bande der Kniee gelockert, die Kräfte gelöset.Schlaf folgt auch auf das Essen, dieweil ganz gleich auch die Speise Wirkt, wie die Luft:", "1870": "auch sie durchdringet das ganze Geäder.", "1871": "Immer der schwereste Schlaf tritt ein, wenn satt wir und müd sind;", "1872": "Denn dann werden zerstoßen mit angestrengtester Arbeit Und in einander gerüttelt die weitaus mehresten Stoffe.", "1873": "Ebendaher auch kommt's, daß einige Theile der Seele Tiefer in's Innre sich ziehn, mehr andere strömen nach außen, Hier mehr innere Theilung sich zeigt, dort größre Zerstreuung.", "1874": "Welchem Berufe man Nun mit besonderem Eifer sich widmet, Oder auf welchem Gebiet wir zuvor am längsten verweilten, Und der Verstand auf solchem den Fleiß am meisten geübt hat, Das auch sehn wir gewöhnlich im Traum vor Augen uns treten.", "1875": "Rechtsverständige führen Prozesse, verfassen Gesetze ;", "1876": "Feldherrn ziehn in die Schlacht und ordnen die Reihen der Kämpfer;", "1877": "Schiffer bestehen den Kampf, den sie mit den Winden-Beschlüssen;", "1878": "Und ich widme mich dem, daß der Dinge Mtur ich erforshce Und das Gefundene dann vortrag' im heimischen Liede.So nun scheinen auch andre Beschäftigungen und Künste Während des Schlafes den Geist in der Täuschung stets zu erhalten.", "1879": "Und so sehen wir denn bei Manchem, der mehrere Tage Hinter einander mit Fleiße das Schauspiel hatte besuchet, Wenn auch die Dinge bereits aufhörten die Sinne zu reizen, Daß im Geiste doch stets noch offen ihm bleiben die Wege, Durch die eben die Bilder dahin zu gelangen vermögen.", "1880": "Und so schweben sie noch ihm mehrere Tage vor Augen, Daß er sogar im Wkchen'die Tanzenden glaubet zu sehen, Wie die geschmeidigen Glieder sie regen;", "1881": "zur Zitherbegleitung Jenes so schmelzende Lied und die sprechenden Töne der SMdn Glaubt mit dem Ohr zu vernehmen, den nämlichen Kreis der Wer­ sainMüng Und noch alle die Reize des ^bunten Theaters zu sehen.So viel hängt von der steten Beschäftigung ab und dem WNen, Und wie i weit nntn mit Etwas sich abzugeben gewöhnt Hat, Nicht bei den Mi^Wen allem, nein, auch bei sämmtlschm TMren.", "1882": "Siehest du döih, tötnn die Glieder das muthige Mß m den'TchMicker Hinstreckt, daß fortwährend es gleichwohl schwitzet und schnaubet, Gleich als wollt' es die Palm' im strengesten Laufe gewinnen;", "1883": "[ Oder als thäten die Schranken sich auf im Moment der Entscheidung.", "1884": "]Ebenso wirft gar oft im ruhigen Schlafe der Jagdhund Plötzlich die Beine von sich und schlägt ein lautes Gebell auf, Zieht auch häufig die Luft mit der Nas' ein, als ob des Wildes Spuren bereits er hätte, gefunden und hielte sie fest schon.", "1885": "Wacht er dabei nun auf, so verfolgt er öfter

"Drauf, wenn nimmer die Wolke genüget dem wachsenden Andrang, Drückt mit Gewalt er sich los und fliegt mit erstaunlichem Fortschuß, Wie hinflieget die Last, aus schwerem Geschütze geschleudert.Füge noch bei, daß der Blitz aus glatten und winzigen Stoffen, Denen so leicht sich Nichts kann widersetzen, bestehet:", "2702": "Deßhalb fähret er auch und dringt durch die engesten Gänge.", "2703": "Und

dem Feuer zerschmettern:", "2732": "Weßhalb donnert von dort er, da hier wir hüten uns könnten?", "2733": "Weßhalb regt er zuvor Nacht auf und Gebraus und Gemurmel?Und dann, kannst du begreifen, wie

geschleudert umher und geräth in die höchste Bedrängniß.", "2741": "Dieses geschieht, wenn des Windes Gewalt die ergriffene Wolke Manchmal nicht zu durchbrechen im Stand ist, sondern herab sie Drückt,

Wolke zerrissen, so stürzet der Wind mit Gewalt sich Ueber das Meer und erregt in den Fluthen ein seltsames Kochen.", "2744": "Nämlich er fährt abwärts, im Wirbel sich drehend, und nimmt dann Mit sich hinunter die Wolke mit ihrem gedehneten Körper.", "2745": "Hat er hinab zur Fläche des Meeres die schwangre gedrückt nun, Stürzt urplötzlich er sich in die Wogen hinein und erreget Rings mit gewaltigem Brausen das Meer und zwingt es zu kochen.", "2746": "Auch kann's wohl sich ereignen, daß solch ein wirbelnder Windstoß Sich in die Wolken verwickelt, indem er wolkige Stoffe Rafft aus der Luft, und hinab vom Himmel sich neigt, wie der Prester.", "2747": "Ist nunmehr er zur Erde gelangt, und löst sich die Wolke, Stößt er gewaltige Wirbel hervor und stürmet sie von sich.", "2748": "Seltener aber geschieht auf dem Festland solches, wo Berge Sich in den Weg ihm stellen;", "2749": "es zeigt sich diese Erscheinung Oefter aus offener See, wo weiter der Himmel sich aufthut.Wolken entstehn alsdann, wann rauhere Körper in Menge, Die am oberen Raum Umschweifen des Himmels, zusammen Plötzlich sich thun und, wenn auch nur in loser Verbindung Einer verhängt in den andern, zusammengedrückt sich erhalten.", "2750": "Anfangs bilden sie nur zu kleineren Wolken sich aus, dann Fassen sie sich an einander und werden zu dichteren Haufen, Wachsen durch ihre Verbindung und werden gejagt von den Winden So lang, bis das Gewitter, das grausige, endlich erregt ist.Das auch geschieht, daß, je höher die Gipfel der Berge zum Himmel Ragen empor, sie um so viel mehr fortwährend auch rauchen, Dicht in die finstere Nacht blaßgelben Gewölkes gehüllet.", "2751": "Dieses erkläret sich so, weil, wenn sich die Wolken gebildet, Eh' noch das Auge vermag ihr dünnes Gewebe zu sehen, Zur höchstragenden Spitze des Bergs sie der tragende Wind drängt.", "2752": "Und so kommt es denn auch, daß, in größeren Haufen vereint, sie Dicht und gedrängt sich zeigen, zugleich vom Gipfel des

Sonn' auswallen das Wasser, Und es verdünnt beim Lichte des Tags von der zitternden Glut sich:", "2890": "Drum entweichen daraus auch die in demselben enthaltnen Samen des Feuers;", "2891": "wie oft auch die Stoffe des Frosts es entlässet, Daß es das Eis macht schmelzen und so von den Banden sich losmacht.Kalt ist ein anderer Brunnen auch noch;", "2892": "doch, schleudert von oben Werg man hinein, fangt plötzlich er Feuer und lodert in Flammen, Fackeln entzünden sich gleichergestalt an den Wellen desselben, Leuchten im Schwimmen, wohin auch immer die Lüfte sie treiben;", "2893": "Weil ja der feurigen Samen so viel' im Wasser sich finden, So daß feurige Körperchen selbst aus der Tiefe der Erde Steigen und überallhin im Brunnen verbreiten sich müssen, Athmen zugleich nach außen und frei in die Lüste hinausgehn, Nicht so lebendig jedoch, daß den Brunnen sie könnten erwärmen.", "2894": "Diese zerstreueten Körperchen nun zwingt eine verborgne Kraft, durchs Wasser zu brechen im Nu

sind viele vorhanden, allwo das Meer willkommene Hilfe gewähret den dürstenden Schiffern, Weil Süßwasser daselbst es hervorspeit zwischen der Salzflut.", "2897": "Ebenso können aus selbigem Quell auch die Samen des FeuerS Brechen, in's Werg einsprudeln;", "2898": "und haben sie dort sich gesammelt, Oder dem Körper der Fackel sich angehänget, so lodern Leicht und plötzlich sie auf:", "2899": "denn

an, Den sie nun ganz natürlich von innen erregt und in gleicher Richtung treibet, wohin fie selber einmal sich gestürzt hat, Nämlich zum ledigen Raum, zu welchem ihr Streben sich wendet.Das auch geschieht, daß das Eisen nach seiner Natur sich von diesem Stein abwendet, ihn flieht und darauf ihm wiederum nachfolgt.Sah ich doch hüpfen sogar samothracische Ringe von Eisen, Eiserne Spähn' aufkochen und wallen in ehernen Schalen, Wann der magnetische Stein denselbigen untergelegt ward.", "2961": "So sehr scheint vor dem Stein das erregete Eisen zu fliehen Durch Zwietracht, die das Erz,

Dingen es gibt, die das Leben uns wahren, Andre dagegen in Menge verbreiten sich müssen, die Krankheit Bringen und Tod.", "2979": "Hat irgend ein Zufall diese gesammelt, Und ist getrübet von ihnen die Luft, wird letztere krankhaft.", "2980": "Doch all diese Gewalt der Erkrankung, diese Verpestung Kommt entweder von innen heraus, wie Wolken und Nebel, Welche von oben die Luft durchzieh», wohl steiget sie oft auch Selbst aus der Erd' empor, wann Nässe sich bildet zu Fäulniß Durch unmäßige Regen und brennende Stiche der Sonne.Siehest du gleichfalls nicht, daß Wechsel der Luft und des Wassers

Glut­ strahl ? Gleichwie vier Regionen wir unter verschiedenen Winden, Unter verschiedenen Strichen des Himmels getheilet erblicken, Ebenso gehn auch die Menschen nach Färb' und Gestalt auseinander, Sind Krankheiten besonderer Art der Bevölkerung eigen.Vom Elephanten benennt sich die Krankheit, die um den Nilfluß, Mitten im Land AegyptuS, erscheint, und außerdem nirgends.Attica macht fußschwach, das Achäergebiet ist den Augen Fährlich, und so ist stets ein Land mehr feind, als das andre, Theilen und Gliedern des Leibs:", "2984": "es bewirkt die verschiedene Lust dieß.Wenn dann ebendie Luft, die uns vorzüglich zu Gift wird, Sich in Bewegung setzt und weiter zu ziehen sich anschickt, Schleicht allmälig sie fort wie Nebel und Wolken und trübet Alles, wohin sie gelangt, und zwinget es sich zu verändern.", "2985": "So kommt's, daß sie, sobald in unseren Himmel sie eintritt, Diesen verderbt, sich ähnlich ihn macht, uns widrig dagegen.Dieses nun plötzlich sich bildende Gift und diese Verpestung Fällt entweder in's Wasser, auch setzt sie sich wohl an den Saaten Fest, und an anderer Nahrung der Menschen und Futter der Thiere, Oder sie bleibt in der Lust selbst hängen, und wenn wir von dorlhcr Die mit derselben vermischete Luft einziehen, so muß auch Ganz nothwendig der Körper zugleich einsaugen den Giftstoff.", "2986": "Gleichergestalt stellt sich gar oft die verpestende Seuche Unter dem Hornvieh ein und den siechenden blöckenden Heerden.", "2987": "Auch liegt wenig daran, ob wir uns an Orte begeben, Die uns widerig sind, und wechseln des Himmels Umhüllung, Oder ob uns die Natur von
