hervorgebrachte Anschlag der eingeathmeten Lust an die sogenannte Luftröhre ^).", "877": "Stimme ist nemlich nicht jeder Ton des Thiers, wie oben bemerkt worden ist, (man kann nemlich auch mit der Zunge einen bloßen Ton hervorbringen und dasselbe ist der Fall beim Husten), sondern eS gehört nothwendig dazu, daß das Wesen, welches anschlägt, beseelt sei und mit einer ge­ wissen Vorstellung verfahre;", "878": "die Stimme ist nemlich ein Ton, der etwaS Bestimmtes ausdrücken soll und sie entsteht nicht einfach bei Einathmung der Luft, wie der Husten, sondern dadurch, daß das beseelte Wesen vermittelst der eingeathmeten Lust die in der Lust­ röhre befindliche Luft an die Luftröhre anschlage.", "879": "Der Beweis hiefür liegt darin, daß man nicht sprechen kann, wenn man ein­ fach ein- oder auS-athmet, vielmehr muß man beim Sprechen den Athem beherrschen, denn dann bringt man vermittelst der einge­ athmeten Lust eine Bewegung ') hervor.", "880": "ES ist auch klar, weß­ halb die Fische keine Stimme haben, weil sie nemlich keine Lust­ röhre haben, die Luströhre aber haben sie nicht, weil sie keine Luft einnehmen und nicht athmen.", "881": "Wie aber dieß zu erklären ist, davon ein andermal.Was den Geruchssinn und das Riechbare betrifft, so ist eS schwieriger, darüber genauere Bestimmungen aufzustellen, als über daS bisher Genannte;", "882": "denn daS eigentliche Wesen des Geruchs ist nicht so klar, wie daS deS Schalls oder der Farbe.", "883": "Die Ur­ sache ist die, daß dieser Sinn bei unS nicht so scharf ist, vielmehr schwächer, als bei vielen Thieren;", "884": "der Mensch nemlich hat nur ein geringes Riechvermögen, und wenn er etwas riecht, so geschieht es nie ohne daS Unangenehme oder Angenehme, woraus man sieht, daß daS Sinnesorgan nicht für sich scharf genug ist.", "885": "Man kann füglich annehmen, daß in derselben Weise auch die starr­ äugigen Thiere die Farbe wahrnehmen und daß ihnen die Unter­ schiede der Farben nicht vollkommen deutlich sind außer vermittelst deS Gefühls der Furcht oder der Furchtlosigkeit.", "886": "Ebenso verhält es sich mit dem Geruch beim Menschen.", "887": "ES scheint nemlich zwar, daß der Geruchssinn in Analogie stehe zum Geschmackssinn, und daß die Arten der Speisen den verschiedenen Gerüchen entsprechen, allein der Geschmack ist bei uns viel schärfer, weil er eine Art von Tastsinn ist, der Tastsinn aber ist bei dem Menschen am vollkommensten ausgebildet;", "888": "während nemlich der Mensch hinsicht­ lich der übrigen Sinne hinter vielen Thieren zurücksteht, ist bei ihm der Tastsinn weit schärfer und genauer als bei den übrigen Thieren.", "889": "Darum ist er auch das verständigste unter den Thieren;", "890": "der Beweis hiefür liegt darin, daß unter den Menschen eben die­ ses Sinnesorgan und nichts Anderes es ist, worauf der Unter­ schied von gut und schlecht Begabten sich gründet;", "891": "diejenigen Menschen nemlich, welche ein hartes Fleisch haben, sind auch geistig wenig begabt, diejenigen aber, die ein weiches Fleisch haben, haben gute geistige Anlagen.Wie nun der Geschmack theils ein süßer, theils ein bitterer ist, so ist eS auch beim Geruch.", "892": "Allein während manche Dinge hinsichtlich des Geruchs und Geschmacks einander entsprechen, — ich meine so, daß sie einen süßen Geruch und einen süßen Ge­ schmack haben, — so ist bei andern daS Gegentheil der Fall.", "893": "Ebenso gibt es nun auch einen herben und einen bitteren, einen scharfen und einen fettigen Geruch.", "894": "Allein weil, wie oben gesagt, die Gerüche nicht eben so vollkommen deutlich und bestimmt sind, wie die vershciedenen Geschmäcke, so haben die ersteren von den letzteren den Namen erhalten, da ja auch die Sache selbst sich bei beiden ähnlich verhält, man spricht daher von einem süßen Geruch, wie beim Krokus und beim Honig, und wieder von einem herben, wie beim Thymian und ähnlichen Dingen, und ebenso ist eS auch bei den andern Arten.", "895": "Derselbe Unterschied wie bei den übrigen Sinnen findet nun auch statt beim Geruch.", "896": "Wie nemlich beim Gehörsinn Hörbares und UnhörbareS zu unterscheiden ist, beim Gesichtssinn Sichtbares und Unsichtbares, so beim Geruchssinn Riechbares und Unriech­ bares.", "897": "Unriechbar ist etwas theils, weil eS durchaus keinen Ge­ ruch haben kann, theils weil eS einen geringen und schwachen Ge­ ruch hat.", "898": "Ebenso verhält eS sich auch bei dem Unshcmeckbaren.", "899": "— ES wirkt aber auch der Geruchssinn durch ein Mittleres, d. h. z. B. Lust oder Wasser hindurch, denn auch die Wasser« thiere scheinen den Geruchssinn zu haben ohne Unterschied, mögen sie Blut haben oder nicht, wie auch die in der Lust lebenden Thiere, indem ja auch einige von den letzteren schon von weitem zur Nahrung herbeikommen, wenn sie in die Riechweite derselben gelangt sind.ES scheint nun darin eine Schwierigkeit zu liegen, daß — wie doch wohl anzunehmen ist — alle Thiere riechen ohne Unter­ schied, während der Mensch zwar wohl riecht, wenn er einathmet, nicht aber wenn er auSathmet oder den Athem anhält, weder auS der Nähe noch aus der Ferne, ja nicht einmal dann, wenn man den betreffenden Gegenstand innen auf daS Nasenloch legt.", "900": "Was nun freilich den letzteren Punkt betrifft, daß ein Ding nicht mehr wahrnehmbar ist, wenn man eS unmittelbar auf daS Sinnesorgan legt, so ist daS allen Thieren gemein, daß aber ohne Einziehen deS Athems kein Riechen stattfindet, daS ist den Menschen eigen­ thümlich.", "901": "Man darf'S nur Probiren, um die Sache sich klar zu machen.", "902": "Also die blutlosen Thiere, die ja keinen Athem einziehen, müßten irgend eine von den bisher genannten verschiedene Wahr­ nehmung haben.", "903": "Dieß ist aber unmöglich, wenn sie doch den Geruch wahrnehmen, denn Geruch ist eben Wahrnehmung des Riechbaren, sei eS nun angenehm oder unangenehm zu riechen.", "904": "Ueberdieß macht man ja auch die Bemerkung, daß solche Thiere zu Grund gehen durch dieselben starken Gerüche wie der Mensch, z. B. durch den Geruch des Asphalts, des Schwefels und ähn­ licher Stoffe.", "905": "ES ist also nothwendig, daß sie riechen, aber so, daß sie dabei nicht athmen.", "906": "ES scheinen aber in Beziehung auf dieses Sinnesorgan die Menschen sich von den übrigen Thieren in ähnlicher Weise zu unterscheiden, wie sie sich in Beziehung auf die Augen unterscheiden von den hartäugigen Thieren:", "907": "während nemlich die Augen der Menschen eine Verzäunung haben, und eine Art von Deckel in den Augenlidern, welche man bewegen und emporziehen muß, um sehen zu können, haben die hartäugigen Thiere nichts dergleichen, sondern sie sehen im Durchsichtigen die Gegenstände unmittelbar.", "908": "So ist eS nun auch bei dem Riech­ organ:", "909": "während dasselbe nemlich wie die Augen bei den Einen unbedeckt ist, hat eS bei den Thieren, welche Lust einnehmen, einen Deckel, welcher beim Athmen aufgedeckt wird, indem nemlich die Aederchen und die Vermittlungsgänge sich erweitern.", "910": "Und dieß ist auch der Grund, weßhalb die athmenden Thiere im feuchten Element nicht riechen, sie müssen nemlich Athem einziehen, um zu riechen, und dieß können sie im Wasser unmöglich.", "911": "— Wie aber der Geschmack dem Feuchten zukommt, so der Geruch dem Trockenen und dem entspricht auch die Potenz deS RiechorganS.DaS Schmeckbare ist eine Art von Tastbarem und dieß ist die Ursache davon, daß eS nicht wahrnehmbar ist vermittelst deS Mittleren, welches ein fremder Körper wäre;", "912": "denn dieß ist auch beim Tastsinn nicht der Fall.", "913": "Der Körper aber, in welchem der Geschmack ') sich befindet, das Schmeckbare, ist im Feuchten als seiner Materie, dieses Feuchte aber ist etwas Tastbares.", "914": "Darum würden wir, auch wenn wir im Wasser wären, eS wahrnehmen, wenn man das Süße hineinwürfe, die Wahrnehmung würde uns aber nicht vermittelt durch das Medium, sondern sie gienge da­ durch vor sich, daß das Süße mit dem Wasser vermischt würde, wie eS beim Trinkbaren geschieht.", "915": "Dagegen die Farbe wird nicht auf diese Weise, durch eine Mischung, gesehen, aber auch nicht durch Ausströmungen 2).", "916": "Es ist also kein Mittleres anzunehmen, sonst aber ist der Geschmack der Dinge das Schmeckbare, gerade wie die Farbe das Sichtbare.", "917": "WaS aber die Wahrnehmung deS Geschmacks hervorbringt, ist einzig und allein die Feuchtigkeit, das Schmeckbare hat

beim Ge­ schmack ähnlich wie bei den anderen Sinnen.", "921": "Das Gesicht geht auf daS Sichtbare oder Unsichtbare (unsichtbar ist nemlich die Finsterniß und auch diese wird vom Gesicht

schwachen Geschmack hat oder den Ge­ schmackssinn verderbt 5).", "928": "Als Princip deS Geschmacks kann man wohl daS Trinkbare, resp.", "929": "Untrinkbare bezeichnen, denn beides ist Geschmack, aber daS letztere nur schwach und nur so, daß es den Geschmackssinn verderbt, das andere in naturgemäßer Weise.", "930": "DaS Trinkbare aber ist dem Tastsinn und dem Geschmackssinn gemein­ sam.", "931": "Da aber daS Schmeckbare feucht ist, so ist eS nothwendig, daß daS Organ deS Geschmacks zwar nicht aktuell feucht sei, aber doch die Potenz habe, feucht zu werden;", "932": "eS wird nemlich der Geschmackssinn vom Schmeckbaren als solchem auf irgend eine Weise afficirt.", "933": "ES ist also nothwendig, daß dasjenige *), welches feucht werden kann (sofern eS seine Natur festhält), feucht werde, nicht aber von selber feucht sei, nemlich daS Organ deS SchmeckenS.", "934": "Der Beweis hiefür liegt darin, daß die Zunge weder dann wahr­ nimmt, wann sie sehr trocken ist, noch wann sie sehr feucht ist;", "935": "im letzteren Fall wird nur daS erste Feuchte') gefühlt, wie wenn man etwas stark Schmeckendes vorher kostet, ehe man etwas An­ deres schmeckt, und so ist eS ähnlich, wenn den Kranken Alles bitter vorkommt, weil ihre Zunge, mit welcher sie wahrnehmen, voll von solcher eigenen Feuchtigkeit ist.", "936": "— WaS die vershciedenen Arten des Geschmacks betrifft, so sind diese (wie eS auch bei den Farben ist) theils schlechthin einander entgegengesetzt, so das Süße und das Bittere, theils schließen sie sich an diese Gegensätze an, so daS Fettige an das Süße, daS Salzige an das Bittere;", "937": "in der Mitte zwischen diesen stehen dann daS Beißende, Herbe, Saure und Scharfe;", "938": "dieß scheinen ungefähr die vershciedenen Arten des Geschmacks zu sein.", "939": "— So ist also der Geschmack dasjenige, WaS der Potenz nach diese bestimmte Beschaffenheit hat, der Gegen­ stand deS Geschmacks aber ist dasjenige, welches die letztere aktuell hervorbringt.WaS nun das Tastbare betrifft, so hat eS mit diesem die­ selbe Bewandtniß wie mit dem Tastsinn selbst;", "940": "ist nemlich der Tastsinn nicht ein einziger Sinn, sondern eine Mehrheit von Sinnen, so muß eS auch ein mehrfaches Tastbare geben als Gegenstand des Tastsinns.", "941": "Es ist nun aber hier eben die Frage, ob man mehrere Sinne anzunehmen hat oder bloß Einen und was eigentlich das Sinnesorgan ist, welches fähig ist, daS Tast­ bare zu tasten, nemlich ob eS das Fleisch ist (und bei andern Thieren 2) der analoge Theil) oder nicht, — oder ob vielmehr daS Fleisch nur daS Medium ist, während daS eigentliche Sinnes­ organ etwas Anderes, innen Liegendes wäre.", "942": "— Ferner nimmt man an, daß jeder Sinn einen einfachen Gegensatz in sich begreift, also daS Gesicht den Gegensatz von weiß und schwarz, daS Gehör den Gegensatz von tief und hoch, der Geschmackssinn den Gegen­ satz von bitter und süß, dagegen im Tastbaren liegt eine Mehr­ heit von Gegensätzen, nemlich das Heiße und Kalte, das Trockene und Feuchte, das Harte und Weiche u. s. w.", "943": "Man kann eine gewisse Lösung dieser Schwierigkeit allerdings darin finden, daß es in der That auch bei den andern Sinnen eine Mehrheit von Gegen« sähen gibt, z.", "944": "B. in der Stimme nicht nur Tiefe und Höhe, sondern auch Stärke und Schwäche, Weichheit und Rauheit u. dgl.", "945": "So gibt eS auch in Beziehung auf die Farbe noch mehrere Un­ terschiede.", "946": "Allein damit ist noch nicht erklärt, waS man unter dem einheitlichen Substrat sich zu denken hat, welches auch beim Tastsinn zu Grunde liegen muß, wie beim Gehör der Schall.", "947": "— Ferner, ob das Sinnesorgan innen liegt oder nicht, ob eS viel­ mehr unmittelbar das Fleisch ist, dafür scheint kein äußeres An­ zeichen darin zu liegen, daß die Wahrnehmung sofort mit der Berührung eintritt.", "948": "Denn wenn man um das Fleisch z.", "949": "B. ein Häutchen herumspannen würde, so würde dieses in gleicher Weise sofort mit der Berührung') die Wahrnehmung anzeigen, nun ist aber klar, daß in diesem Häutchen daS Sinnesorgan nicht ent­ halten ist 2);", "950": "würde dasselbe aber mit dem Fleisch zusammen­ wahcsen, so würde die Wahrnehmung noch schneller hindurchdringen.", "951": "ES scheint daher mit dem betreffenden Glied sich so zu verhal­ ten, wie wenn uns rings die Lust angewahcsen wäre, eS würde uns in diesem Fall vorkommen, als wäre eS Ein und dasselbe Organs, wodurch wir Schall, Farbe und Geruch wahrnehmen, und somit wären dann Gesicht, Gehör und Geruchssinn Ein und derselbe Sinn.", "952": "Nun aber ist die Luft, durch welche hindurch die Bewegungen stattfinden, von unsrem Körper geschieden, und daher ist klar, daß die betreffenden Sinnesorgane verschieden sind ^).", "953": "Beim Tastsinn nun aber ist dieß nicht ebenso klar, denn auS Luft oder Wasser kann der beseelte Körper unmöglich bestehen, sofern er ja etwas Festes sein muß.", "954": "ES bleibt also nur übrig, daß er gemischt sei auS Erde zugleich mit jenen Elementen, so wie man sich das Fleisch vorstellt und waS dem Fleisch sonst ent­ spricht, woraus sich die Nothwendigkeit ergibt, daß der Körper, welcher das Medium für den Tastsinn bildet, durch welchen die Wahrnehmungen als das Mehrfache stattfinden, .angewachsen sein muß.", "955": "— Daß aber im Tastsinn mehrfache Wahrnehmungen sind, zeigt deutlich die Berührung auf der Zunge, sofern diese ja alles Tastbare an derselben Stelle wahrnimmt, wie den Geschmack der Speisen^).", "956": "Wenn nun auch sonst daS Fleisch überall den Ge­ schmack wahrnähme, so könnte man sagen, der Geschmackssinn und der Tastsinn seien Ein und derselbe Sinn, nun aber, da man nicht durchaus einen für den andern setzen kann ^), müssen eS zwei Sinne sein.", "957": "Eine weitere Schwierigkeit ergibt sich auS der Voraussetzung, daß jeder Körper Tiefe hat;", "958": "die Tiefe ist nemlich die dritte Di­ mension;", "959": "wenn nun also zwischen zwei Körpern ein dritter in der Mittte ist, so ist es nicht möglich, daß jene zwei einander berühren.", "960": "Nun ist daS Feuchte nicht ohne Körper, und ebenso wenig daS Flüssige^), sondern das letztere muß nothwendig ent­ weder Wasser sein oder Wasser enthalten;", "961": "wenn aber im Wasser zwei Körper einander berühren sollen, so muß nothwendig zwi­ schen ihnen Wasser sich befinden, von welchem die Extremitäten angefüllt sind, da ja doch die äußersten Theile nicht trocken sind;", "962": "ist aber dieß richtig, so ist es unmöglich, daß im Wasser ein Gegenstand einen andern berühre.", "963": "Aus dieselbe Weise verhält es sich nun auch mit dem, was in der Luft ist;", "964": "denn die Luft ver­ hält sich zu dem, WaS in ihr ist, ebenso wie daS Wasser zu dem, was in ihm ist.", "965": "Allein daS können wir nun eben nicht deutlich erkennen, ob ein Flüssiges ein anderes Flüssiges berühre, wie es auch in Betreff der im Wasser befindlichen Thiere nicht recht klar ist.", "966": "Weiter ist die Frage:", "967": "ob die Wahrnehmung bei allen Sin­ nen auf die gleiche Weise vor sich geht oder beim einen Sinn so, beim andern anders?", "968": "Nimmt man ja doch gewöhnlich an, der Geschmackssinn und der Tastsinn empfinden durch unmittel­ bare Berührung, während die andern Sinne anS der Ferne wahr­ nehmen.", "969": "Allein dieß ist nicht wirklich so, sondern auch daS Harte und Weiche') nehmen wir wahr durch ein Medium, so gut als daS, was einen Schall erregt oder was sichtbar oder riechbar ist.", "970": "Der Unterschied ist nur der, daß wir beim einen auS der Ferne, beim andern in nächster Nähe wahrnehmen.", "971": "Hierin liegt aber die Schwierigkeit für die Erkenntniß der Sache ^), denn ein Me­ dium der Wahrnehmung ist überall vorhanden, aber beim Tast­ sinn ist eS nicht zu erkennen.", "972": "ES ist ja doch, wie wir oben ge­ sagt haben:", "973": "wenn wir durch ein Häutchen hindurch alles Tastbare wahrnähmen, ohne zu wissen, daß ein solches Medium vorhanden wäre, so würden wir die Sache gerade so ansehen, wie jetzt, wenn wir in der Lust oder im Wasser sind:", "974": "wir meinen, wir berühren die Gegenstände unmittelbar und eS sei kein Medium vorhanden.", "975": "Also daS Medium ist überall, auch beim Tastsinn, aber mit Unterschied:", "976": "nemlich daS Sichtbare und das Tönende nehmen wir dadurch wahr, daß das Medium uns in gewisser Weise afficirt, dagegen bei der Wahrnehmung durch den Tastsinn werden wir nicht durch daS Medium afficirt, sondern zugleich mit dem Medium;", "977": "eS ist gerade, wie wenn Einer durch den Schild hindurch getroffen wird:", "978": "eS ist nemlich nicht der Schild, welcher trifft, nachdem er selber getroffen worden ist, sondern eS werden beide, Mann und Schild, in demselben Augenblick getroffen.", "979": "Ueberhaupt kann man annehmen, daß sich daS Fleisch und die Zunge zum Sinnesorgan des TastenS gerade so verhalten, wie die Luft und das Wasser sich verhalten zum Gesichtssinn, Gehörsinn und Geruchssinn.", "980": "Wenn dagegen das Sinnesorgan selbst wahrnähme, so würde weder beim einen noch beim andern eine Wahrnehmung möglich sein, wie wenn man z.", "981": "B. einen wei­ ßen Körper unmittelbar auf die Oberfläche deS Auges legt.", "982": "Hier­ aus sieht man deutlich, daß daS Organ für'S Tasten innen liegt.", "983": "Bei dieser Voraussetzung ist der Vorgang ganz derselbe, wie bei den andern Sinnen:", "984": "während nemlich die andern Sinne nichts wahrnehmen, wenn der Gegenstand unmittelbar auf das Organ gelegt wird, so ist doch eine Wahrnehmung vorhanden, wenn man etwas auf das Fleisch legt, woraus denn klar ist, daß eben das Fleisch das Medium beim Tasten bildet.Gegenstand deS Tastsinns sind die Unterschiede des Körper­ lichen als solchen;", "985": "ich verstehe darunter die Unterschiede (Merk­ male), welche die Elemente bestimmen, nemlich daS Warme und Kalte, das Trockene und Feuchte, von welchen wir schon früher in der Schrift über die Elemente') gesprochen haben.", "986": "DaS Or­ gan zur Wahrnehmung dieser Unterschiede ist der Tastsinn und dasjenige ^), in welchem ursprünglich das wohnt, was man Tasten nennt, ist der Potenz nach ein solches Glied;", "987": "daS Empfinden oder Wahrnehmen ist nemlich eine Art von Asiscirt-werden, so daß also daS, waS afficirt, jenes, daS potenziell Seiende, so macht, wie eS selbst aktuell ist.", "988": "Daher kommt eS, daß wir daS gleich Wanne und Kalte, und das gleich Harte und Weiche nicht wahr­ nehmen^), sondern nur daS Mehr oder Weniger, indem daS Wahrnehmen gewissermaßen eine Mitte des im Wahrnehmbaren enthaltenen Gegensatzes darstellt.", "989": "Und deßwegen kann sie daS Wahrnehmbare unterscheiden.", "990": "DaS Mittlere nämlich ist fähig zu unterscheiden, indem eS zu jedem von den beiden Extremen in'S Verhältniß tritt und dasjenige, welches Weißes und Schwarzes wahrnehmen soll, keines von beiden aktuell sein darf, wohl aber beides potenziell;", "991": "(auch bei den übrigen Sinnen ist eS so;", "992": ") so darf auch der Tastsinn weder warm noch kalt sein, muß aber beides sein können.Wie nun ferner das Gesicht sich in gewisser Weise auf das Sichtbare und Unsichtbare bezieht, und ebenso die übrigen Sinne auf ihre betreffenden Gegenstände, so
