...............195MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, the greatest of Roman orators and the chief master of Latin prose style, was born at Arpinum, Jan. 3, 106 B. C.", "1": "His father, who was a man of property and belonged to the class of the “Knights” moved to Rome when Cicero was a child;", "2": "and the future statesman received an elaborate education in rhetoric, law, and philosophy, studying and practising under some of the most noted teachers of the time.", "3": "He began his career as an advocate at the age of twenty-five, and almost immediately came to be recognized not only as a man of brilliant talents but also as a courageous upholder of justice in the face of grave political danger.", "4": "After two years of practice he left Rome to travel in Greece and Asia, taking all the opportunities that offered to study his art under distinguished masters.", "5": "He returned to Rome greatly improved in health and in professional skill, and in 76 B. C. was elected to the office of quaestor.", "6": "He was assigned to the province of Lilybaeum in Sicily, and the vigor and justice of his administration earned him the gratitude of the inhabitants.", "7": "It was at their request that he undertook in 70 B. C. the prosecution of Verres, who as praetor had subjected the Sicilians to incredible extortion and oppression;", "8": "and his suc­ cessful conduct of this case, which ended in the conviction and banishment of Verres, may be said to have launched hint on his political career.", "9": "He became aedile in the same year, in 67 B. C. praetor, and in 64 B. C. was elected consul by a large majority.", "10": "The most important event of the year of his consulship was the conspiracy of Catiline.", "11": "This notorious criminal of patrician rank had conspired with a number of others, many of them young men of high birth but dissipated character, to seize the chief offices of the state, and to extricate themselves from the pecu­ niary and other difficulties that had resulted from their excesses, by the wholesale plunder of the city.", "12": "The plot was unmasked by the vigilance of Cicero, five of the traitors were summarily executed, and in the overthrow of the army that had been gath­ ered in their support Catiline himself perished.", "13": "Cicero regarded himself as the savior of his country, and his country for the moment seemed to give grateful assent.", "14": "But reverses were at hand.", "15": "During the existence of the politic cat combination of Pompey, Cesar, and Crassus, known as the first triumvirate, P. Clodius, an enemy of Cicero's, proposed a law banishing \"any one who had put Roman citizens to death without trial.”", "16": "This was aimed at Cicero on account of his share in the Catiline affair, and in March, 58 B. C., he left Rome.", "17": "The same day a law was passed by which he was banished by name, and his property was plundered and destroyed, a temple to Liberty being erected on the site of his house in the city.", "18": "During his exile Cicero's manliness to some extent deserted him.", "19": "He drifted from place to place, seeking the protection of officials against assassination, writing letters urging his supporters to agitate for his recall, sometimes accusing them of lukewarmness and even treachery, bemoaning the ingratitude of his country or regretting the course of action that had led to his outlawry, and suffering from extreme depression over his separation from his wife and children and the wreck of his political ambitions.", "20": "Finally in August, 57 B. C., the decree for his restoration was passed, and he returned to Rome the next month, being received with immense popular enthusiasm.", "21": "During the next few years the renewal of the understanding among the triumvirs shut.", "22": "Cicero out from any leading part in politics, and he resumed his activity in the law-courts, his most important case being, perhaps, the defence of Milo for the murder of Clodius, Cicero's most troublesome enemy.", "23": "This oration, in the revised form in which it has come down to us, is ranked as among the finest specimens of the art of the orator, though in its original form it failed to secure Milo's acquittal.", "24": "Meantime, Cicero was also devoting much time to literary composition, and his letters show great dejection over the political situation, and a somewhat wavering attitude towards the various parties in the state.", "25": "In 51 B. C. he went to Cilicia in Asia Minor as proconsul, an office which he administered with efficiency and integrity in civil affairs and with success in military.", "26": "He returned to Italy in the end of the following year, and he was publicly thanked by the senate for his services, but disappointed in his hopes for a triumph.", "27": "The war for supremacy between Cæsar and Pompey which had for some time been gradually growing more certain, broke out in 49 B. C., when Cæsar led his army across the Rubicon, and Cicero after much irresolution threw in his lot with Pompey, who was overthrown the next year in the battle of Pharsalus and later murdered in Egypt.", "28": "Cicero returned to Italy, where Cæsar treated him magnanimously, and for some time he devoted him­ self to philosophical and rhetorical writing.", "29": "In 46 B. C. he divorced his wife Terentia, to whom he had been married for thirty years and married the young and wealthy Publilia in order to relieve himself from financial difficulties;", "30": "but her also he shortly divorced.", "31": "Cæsar, who had now become supreme in Rome, was assassinated in 44 B. C., and though Cicero was not a sharer in the conspiracy, he seems to have approved the deed.", "32": "In the confusion which followed he supported the cause of the conspirators against Antony;", "33": "and when finally the triumvirate of Antony, Octavius, and Lepias was established, Cicero was included among the proscribed, and on December 7, 43 B. C., he was killed by agents of Antony.", "34": "His head and hand were cut off and exhibited at Rome.", "35": "The most important orations of the last months of his life were the fourteen “Philippies” delivered against Antony, and the price of this enmity he paid with his life.", "36": "To his contemporaries Cicero was primarily the great forensic and political orator of his time, and the fifty-eight speeches which have come down to us bear testimony to the skill, wit, eloquence, and passion which gave him s pre-eminence.", "37": "But these speeches of necessity deal with the minute details of the occasions which called them forth, and so require for their appreciation a full knowledge of the history, political and personal, of the time.", "38": "The letters, on the other hand, are less elaborate both in style and in the handling of current events, while they serve to reveal his personality, and to throw light upon Roman life in the last days of the Republic in an extremely vivid fashion.", "39": "Cicero as a man, in spite of his self-importance, the vacillation of his political conduct in desperate crises, and the whining despondency of his times of adversity, stands out as at bottom a patriotic Roman of substantial honesty, who gave his life to check the inevitable fall of the commonwealth to which he was devoted.", "40": "The evils which were undermining the Republic bear so many striking resemblances to those which threaten the civic and na­ tional life of America to-day that the interest of the period is by no means merely historical.", "41": "As a philosopher, Cicero's most important function was to make his countrymen familiar with the main schools of Greek thought.", "42": "Much of this writing is thus of secondary interest to as in comparison with his originals, but in the fields of religious theory and of the application of philosophy to life he made im­ portant first-hand contributions.", "43": "From these works have been selected the two treatises, on Old Age and on Friendship, which have proved of most permanent and widespread interest to pos­ terity, and which give a clear impression of the way in which a high-minded Roman thought about some of the main prob­ lems of human life.", "44": "T HE augur Quintus Mucius Scaevola used to recount a number of stories about his father-in-law Gaius Laelius, accurately remembered and charmingly told;", "45": "and whenever he talked about him always gave him the title of \" the wise \" without any hesitation.", "46": "I had been in­ troduced by my father to Scaevola as soon as I had as­ sumed the toga virilis, and I took advantage of the intro­ duction never to quit the venerable man's side as long as I was able to stay and he was spared to us.", "47": "The conse­ quence was that I committed to memory many disquisitions of his, as well as many short pointed apophthegms, and, in short, took as much advantage of his wisdom as I could.", "48": "When he died, I attached myself to Scaevola the Pontifex, whom I may venture to call quite the most distinguished of our countrymen for ability and uprightness.", "49": "But of this latter I shall take other occasions to speak.", "50": "To return to Scaevola the augur.", "51": "Among many other occasions I particu­ larly remember one.", "52": "He was sitting on a semicircular gar­ den-bench, as was his custom, when I and a very few intimate friends were there, and he chanced to turn the con­ versation upon a subject which about that time was in many people's mouths.", "53": "You must remember, Atticus, for you were very intimate with Publius Sulpicius, what ex­ pressions of astonishment, or even indignation, were called forth by his mortal quarrel, as tribune, with the consul Quin­ tus Pompeius, with whom he had formerly lived on terms of the closest intimacy and affection.", "54": "Well, on this occasion, happening to mention this particular circumstance, Scaevola detailed to us a discourse of Laelius on friendship delivered to himself and Laelius's other son-in-law Gaius Fannius, son of Marcus Fannius, a few days after the death of Afri­ canus.", "55": "The points of that discussion I committed to mem­ ory, and have arranged them in this book at my own discretion.", "56": "For I have brought the speakers, as it were, personally on to my stage to prevent the constant \"said I\" and \"said he\" of a narrative, and to give the discourse the air of being orally delivered in our hearing.", "57": "You have often urged me to write something on Friend­ ship, and I quite acknowledged that the subject seemed one worth everybody's investigation, and specially suited to the close intimacy that has existed between you and me.", "58": "Ac­ cordingly I was quite ready to benefit the public at your request.", "59": "As to the dramatis persona.", "60": "In the treatise on Old Age, which I dedicated to you, I introduced Cato as chief speaker.", "61": "No one, I thought, could with greater propriety speak on old age than one who had been an old man longer than any one else, and had been exceptionally vigorous in his old age.", "62": "Similarly, having learnt from tradition that of all friend­ ships that between Gaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was the most remarkable, I thought Laelius was just the person to support the chief part in a discussion on friendship which Scaevola remembered him to have actually taken.", "63": "Moreover, a discussion of this sort gains somehow in weight from the authority of men of ancient days, especially if they happen to have been distinguished.", "64": "So it comes about that in reading over what I have myself written I have a feeling at times that it is actually Cato that is speaking, not I.Finally, as I sent the former essay to you as a gift from one old man to another, so I have dedicated this On Friend­ ship as a most affectionate friend to his friend.", "65": "In the for­ mer Cato spoke, who was the oldest and wisest man of his day;", "66": "in this Laelius speaks on friendship—Laelius, who was at once a wise man (that was the title given him) and emi­ nent for his famous friendship.", "67": "Please forget me for a while;", "68": "imagine Laelius to be speaking.", "69": "Gaius Fannius and Quintus Mucius come to call on their father-in-law after the death of Africanus.", "70": "They start the subject;", "71": "Laelius answers them.", "72": "And the whole essay on friendship is his.", "73": "In reading it you will recognise a picture of yourself.", "74": "2. Fannius.", "75": "You are quite right, Laelius!", "76": "there never was a better or more illustrious character than Africanus.", "77": "But you should consider that at the present moment all eyes are on you.", "78": "Everybody calls you \"the wise\" par excellence, and thinks you so.", "79": "The same mark of respect was lately paid Cato, and we know that in the last generation Lucius Atilius was called \" the wise.\"", "80": "But in both cases the word was applied with a certain difference.", "81": "Atilius was so called from his reputation as a jurist;", "82": "Cato got the name as a kind of honorary title and in extreme old age because of his varied experience of affairs, and his reputation for foresight and firmness, and the sagacity of the opinions which he de­ livered in senate and forum.", "83": "You, however, are regarded as \" wise\" in a somewhat different sense — not alone on account of natural ability and character, but also from your industry and learning;", "84": "and not in the sense in which the vulgar, but that in which scholars, give that title.", "85": "In this sense we do not read of any one being called wise in Greece except one man at Athens;", "86": "and he, to be sure, had been declared by the oracle of Apollo also to be \"the su­ premely wise man.\"", "87": "For those who commonly go by the name of the Seven Sages are not admitted into the category of the wise by fastidious critics.", "88": "Your wisdom people be­ lieve to consist in this, that you look upon yourself as self­ sufficing and regard the changes and chances of mortal life as powerless to affect your virtue.", "89": "Accordingly they are always asking me, and doubtless also our Scaevola here, how you bear the death of Africanus.", "90": "This curiosity has been the more excited from the fact that on the Nones of this month, when we augurs met as usual in the suburban villa of Decimus Brutus for consultation, you were not present, though it had always been your habit to keep that appoint­ ment and perform that duty with the utmost punctuality.", "91": "Scaevola.", "92": "Yes, indeed, Laelius, I am often asked the question mentioned by Fannius.", "93": "But I answer in accord­ ance with what I have observed:", "94": "I say that you bear in a reasonable manner the grief which you have sustained in the death of one who was at once a man of the most illus­ trious character and a very dear friend.", "95": "That of course you could not but be affected—anything else would have been wholly unnatural in a man of your gentle nature--but that the cause of your non-attendance at our college meet­ ing was illness, not melancholy.", "96": "Laelius.", "97": "Thanks,", "98": "Scaevola!", "99": "You are quite right;", "100": "you spoke the exact truth.", "101":

that can happen will cause a man of principle to intermit a duty.", "103": "As for your telling me, Fannius, of the honourable appellation given me (an appellation to which I do not recognise my

philosophers to justify my conduct, but in point of fact I should be telling a lie.", "116": "Affected of course I am by the loss of a friend as I think there will never be again, such as I can fearlessly say there never was before.", "117": "But I stand in no need of medicine.", "118": "I can find my own consolation, and it consists chiefly in my being free from the mistaken notion which generally causes pain at the departure of friends.", "119": "To Scipio I am convinced no evil has befallen:", "120": "mine is the disaster, if disaster there be;", "121": "and to be severely dis­ tressed at one's own misfortunes does not show that you love your friend, but that you love yourself.", "122": "As for him, who can say that all is not more than well?", "123": "For, unless he had taken the fancy to wish for immortality, the last thing of which he ever thought, what is there for which mortal man\" may wish that he did not attain?", "124": "In his early manhood he more than

State.", "129": "By the overthrow of two cities which were the most bitter enemies of our Em­ pire, he put an end not only to the wars then raging, but also to the possibility of others in the future.", "130": "What need to mention the exquisite grace of his manners, his dutiful devotion to his mother, his generosity to his sisters, his liberality to his relations, the integrity of his conduct to every one?", "131": "You know all this already.", "132": "Finally, the esti­ mation in which his fellow-citizens held him has been shown by the signs of mourning which accompanied his obsequies.", "133": "What could such a man have gained by the addition of a few years ?", "134": "Though age need not be a burden, -as I remember Cato arguing in the presence of myself and Scipio two years before he died,-yet it cannot but take away the vigour and freshness which Scipio was still en­ joying.", "135": "We may conclude therefore that his life, from the good fortune which had attended him and the glory he had obtained, was so circumstanced that it could not be bettered, while the suddenness of his death saved him the sensation of dying.", "136": "As to the manner of his death it is difficult to speak;", "137": "you see what people suspect.", "138": "Thus much, however, I may say:", "139": "Scipio in his lifetime saw many days of supreme triumph and exultation, but

to be \" most wise,\" and who used to teach without the variation which is to be found in most philosophers that the souls of men are divine, and that when they have quitted the body a return to

Rome and served abroad;", "162": "and between us there was the most com­ plete harmony in our tastes, our pursuits, and our senti­ ments, which is the true secret of friendship.", "163": "It is not there­ fore in that reputation for wisdom mentioned just now by Fannius—especially as it happens to be groundless-that I find my happiness so much, as in the hope that the memory of our friendship will be lasting.", "164": "What makes me care the more about this is the fact that in all history there are scarcely three or four pairs of friends on record;", "165": "and it is classed with them that I cherish a hope of the friendship of Scipio and Laelius being known to posterity.", "166": "Fannius.", "167": "Of course that must be so, Laelius.", "168": "But since you have mentioned the word friendship, and we are at leisure, you would be doing me a great kindness, and I expect Scaevola also, if you would do as it is your habit to do when asked questions on other subjects, and tell us

professional philosophers, who are used, particularly if Greeks, to have the subject for discussion proposed to them on the spur of the moment.", "180": "It is a task of considerable difficulty, and requires no little practice.", "181": "Therefore for a set discourse on friendship you must go, I think, to pro- I fessional lecturers.", "182": "All I can do is to urge on you to regard friendship as the greatest thing in the world;", "183": "for there is nothing which so fits in with our nature, or is so exactly what we want in prosperity or adversity.", "184": "But I must at the very beginning lay down this principle- friendship can only exist between good men.", "185": "I do not, however, press this too closely, like the philosophers who push their definitions to a superfluous accuracy.",

me, that nature has so formed us that a certain tie unites us all, but that this tie becomes stronger from proximity.", "205": "So it is that fellow- citizens are preferred in our affections to foreigners, re­ lations to strangers;", "206": "for in their case Nature herself has caused a kind of friendship to exist, though it is one which lacks some of the elements of permanence.", "207": "Friendship excels relationship in this, that whereas you may eliminate affection from relationship, you cannot do so from friend­ ship.", "208": "Without it relationship still exists in name, friend­ ship does not.", "209": "You may best understand this friendship by considering that, whereas the merely natural ties uniting the human race are indefinite, this one is so concentrated, and confined

use the word virtue in the ordinary acceptation and meaning of the term, and do not let us define it in high-flown language.", "221": "Let us account as good the persons usually considered so, such as Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus.", "222": "Such men as these are good enough for everyday life;", "223": "and we need not trouble ourselves about those ideal characters which are nowhere to be met with.", "224": "Well, between men like these the advantages of friendship are almost more than I can say.", "225": "To begin with, how can life be worth living, to use the words of Ennius,

between the select few who are known to fame.", "236": "Such friendship enhances prosperity, and relieves adversity of its burden by halving and sharing it.", "237": "7.", "238": "And great and numerous as are the blessings of friend­ ship, this certainly is the sovereign one, that it gives us bright hopes for the future and forbids weakness and de­ spair.", "239": "In the face of a true

destruction from animosities and factions?", "250": "This may teach you the immense advantage of friendship.", "251": "They say that a certain philosopher of Agrigentum, in a Greek poem, pronounced with the authority of an oracle the doctrine that whatever in nature and the universe was unchangeable was so in virtue of the binding force of friend­ ship;", "252": "whatever was changeable was so by the solvent power of discord.", "253": "And indeed this is a truth which everybody understands and practically attests by experience.", "254": "For if any marked instance of loyal friendship in confronting or sharing danger comes to light, every one applauds it to the echo.", "255": "What cheers there were, for instance, all over the theatre at a passage in the new play of my friend and

what kind of force you use:", "280": "force it is.", "281": "For it is neither easy nor right to refuse a wish of my sons-in-law, particularly when the wish is a creditable one in itself.", "282": "Well, then, it has very often occurred to me when think­ ing about friendship, that the chief point to be considered was this:", "283": "is it weakness and want of means that make friendship desired?", "284": "I mean, is its object an interchange of good offices, so that each may give that in which he is strong, and receive that in which he is weak?", "285": "Or is it not rather true that, although this is an advantage naturally be­ longing to friendship, yet its original cause is quite other, prior in time, more noble in character, and springing more directly from our nature itself ?", "286": "The Latin word for friend­ ship—amicitia—is derived from that for love—amor;", "287": "and love is certainly the prime mover in contracting mutual af­ fection.", "288": "For as to material advantages, it often happens that those are obtained even by men who are courted by a mere show of friendship and treated with respect from in­ terested motives.", "289": "But friendship by its nature admits of no feigning, no pretence:", "290": "as far as it goes it is both genuine and spontaneous.", "291": "Therefore I gather that friendship springs from a natural impulse rather than a wish for help:", "292": "from an inclination of the heart, combined with a certain in­ stinctive feeling of love, rather than from a deliberate calculation of the material advantage it was likely to confer.", "293": "The strength of this feeling you may notice in certain ani­ mals.", "294": "They show such love to their offspring for a certain period, and are so beloved by them, that they clearly have a share in this natural, instinctive affection.", "295": "But of course it is more evident in the case of man:", "296": "first, in the natural affection between children and their parents, an affection which only shocking wickedness can sunder;", "297": "and next, when the passion of love has attained to a like strength—on our finding, that is, some one person with whose character and nature we are in full sympathy, because we think that we perceive in him what I may call the beacon-light of virtue.", "298": "For nothing inspires love, nothing conciliates affection, like virtue.", "299": "Why, in a certain sense we may be said to feel affection even for men we have never seen, owing to their honesty and virtue.", "300": "Who, for instance, fails to dwell on the memory of Gaius Fabricius and Manius Curius with some affection and warmth of feeling, though he has never seen them?", "301": "Or who but loathes Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius Cassius, Spurius Maelius?", "302": "We have fought for empire in Italy with two great generals, Pyrrhus and Hannibal.", "303": "For the former, owing to his probity, we entertain no great feelings of enmity:", "304": "the latter, owing to his cruelty, our coun­ try has detested and always will detest.", "305": "9.", "306": "Now, if the attraction of probity is so great that we can love it not only in those whom we have never seen, but, what is more, actually in an enemy, we need not be surprised if men's affections are roused when they fancy that they have seen virtue and goodness in those with whom a close intimacy is possible.", "307": "I do not deny that affection is strength­ ened by the actual receipt of benefits, as well as by the perception of a wish to render service, combined with a closer intercourse.", "308": "When these are added to the original impulse of the heart, to which I have alluded, a quite sur­ prising warmth of feeling springs up.", "309": "And if any one thinks that this comes from a sense of weakness, that each may have some one to help him to his particular need, all I can say is that, when he maintains it to be born of want and poverty, he allows to friendship an origin very base, and a pedigree, if I may be allowed the expression, far from noble.", "310": "If this had been the case, a man's inclination to friendship would be exactly in proportion to his low opinion of his own resources.", "311": "Whereas the truth is quite the other way.", "312": "For when a man's confidence in himself is greatest, when he is so fortified by virtue and wisdom as to want nothing and to feel absolutely self-dependent, it is then that he is most conspicuous for seeking out and keeping up friendships.", "313": "Did Africanus, for example, want anything of me?", "314": "Not the least in the world!", "315": "Neither did I of him.", "316": "In my case it was an admiration of his virtue, in his an opinion, may be, which he entertained of my character, that caused our affec­ tion.", "317": "Closer intimacy added to the warmth of our feelings.", "318": "But though many great material advantages did ensue, they were not the source from which our affection proceeded.", "319": "For as we are not beneficent and liberal with any view of extorting gratitude, and do not regard an act of kindness as an investment, but follow a natural inclination to lib­ erality ;", "320": "so 'we look on friendship as worth trying for, not because we are attracted to it by the expectation of ulterior gain, but in the conviction that what it has to give us is from first to last included in the feeling itself.", "321": "Far different is the view of those who, like brute beasts, refer everything to sensual pleasure.", "322": "And no wonder.", "323": "Men who have degraded all their powers of thought to an object so mean and contemptible can of course raise their eyes to nothing lofty, to nothing grand and divine.", "324": "Such persons indeed let us leave out of the present question.", "325": "And let us accept the doctrine that the sensation of love and the warmth of inclination have their origin in a spontaneous feeling which arises directly the presence of probity is in­ dicated.", "326": "When once men have conceived the inclination, they of course try to attach themselves to the object of it, and move themselves nearer and nearer to him.", "327": "Their aim is that they may be on the same footing and the same level in regard to affection, and be more inclined to do a good service than to ask a return, and that there should be this noble rivalry between them.", "328": "Thus both truths will be es­ tablished.", "329": "We shall get the most important material ad­ vantages from friendship;", "330": "and its origin from a natural impulse rather than from a sense of need will be at once more dignified and more in accordance with fact.", "331": "For if it were true that its material advantages cemented friendship, it would be equally true that any change in them would dis­ solve it.", "332": "But nature being incapable of change, it follows that genuine friendships are eternal.", "333": "So much for the origin of friendship.", "334": "But perhaps you would not care to hear any more.", "335": "Fannius.", "336": "Nay, pray go on;", "337": "let us have the rest, Laelius.", "338": "I take on myself to speak for my friend here as his senior.", "339": "Scaevola.",

be more eager, or rather greedy, for what is like itself than nature.", "460": "So, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we may look upon this as an established fact, that between good men there is, as it were of necessity, a kindly feeling, which is the source of friendship ordained by nature.", "461": "But this same kindliness affects the many also.", "462": "For that is no unsympathetic or selfish

our affection is not to go.", "500": "On this point I notice three opinions, with none of which I agree.", "501": "One is that we should love our friend just as much as we love ourselves, and no more;", "502": "another, that our affection to them should exactly cor­ respond and equal theirs to us;", "503": "a third, that a man should be valued at exactly the same rate as he values himself.",

things there are which we would never have done for our own sakes, but do for the sake of a friend!", "507": "We submit to make requests from unworthy people, to descend even to supplication;", "508":

limits friendship to an exact equality in mutual good offices and good feelings, But such a view reduces friendship to a question of figures in a spirit far too narrow and illiberal, as though the object were to have an exact balance in a debtor and creditor account.", "512": "True friendship appears to me to be something richer and more generous than that comes to;", "513": "and not to be so narrowly on its guard against giving more than it receives.", "514": "In such a matter we must not be always afraid of something being wasted or running over in our measure, or of more than is justly due being devoted to our friendship.", "515": "But the last limit proposed is the worst, namely, that a friend's estimate of himself is to be the measure of our esti­ mate of him.", "516": "It often happens that a man has too humble an idea of himself, or takes too despairing a view of his chance of bettering his fortune.", "517": "In such a case a friend ought not to take the view of him which he takes of him­ self.", "518": "Rather he should do all he can to raise his drooping spirits, and lead him to more cheerful hopes and thoughts.", "519": "We must then find some other limit.", "520": "But I must first men­ tion the sentiment which used to call forth Scipio's severest criticism.", "521": "He often said that no one ever gave utterance to anything more diametrically opposed to the spirit of friendship than the author of the dictum, \" You should love your friend with the consciousness that you may one day hate him.\"", "522": "He could not be induced to believe that it was rightfully attributed to Bias, who was counted as one of the Seven Sages.", "523": "It was the sentiment of some person with sinister motives or selfish ambition, or who regarded every­ thing as it affected his own supremacy.", "524": "How can a man be friends with another, if he thinks it possible that he may be his enemy?", "525": "Why, it will follow that he must wish and desire his friend to commit as many.", "526": "mistakes as possible, that he may have all the more handles against him;", "527": "and, conversely, that he must be annoyed, irritated, and jealous at the right actions or good fortune of his friends.", "528": "This maxim, then, let it be whose it will, is the utter destruction of friendship.", "529": "The true rule is to take such care in the selection of our friends as never to enter upon a friend­ ship with a man whom we could under any circumstances come to hate.", "530": "And even if we are unlucky in our choice, we must put up with it-according to Scipio—in preference to making calculations as to a future breach.", "531": "17. The real limit to be observed in friendship is this:", "532": "the characters of two friends must be stainless.", "533": "There must be complete harmony of interests, purpose, and aims, without exception.", "534": "Then if the case arises of a friend's wish (not strictly right in itself) calling for support in a matter involv­ ing his life or reputation, we must make some concession from the straight path-on condition, that is to say, that extreme disgrace is not the consequence.", "535": "Something must be conceded to friendship.", "536": "And yet we must not be entirely careless of our reputation, nor regard the good opinion of our fellow-citizens as a weapon which we can afford to despise in conducting the business of our life, however lower­ ing it may be to tout for it by flattery and smooth words.", "537": "We must by no means abjure virtue, which secures us affection.", "538": "But to return again to Scipio, the sole author of the dis­ course on friendship.", "539": "He used to complain that there was nothing on which men bestowed so little pains:", "540": "that every one could tell exactly how many goats or sheep he had, but not how many friends;", "541": "and while they took pains in pro­ curing the former, they were utterly careless in selecting friends, and possessed no particular marks, so to speak, or tokens by which they might judge of their suitability for friendship.", "542": "Now the qualities we ought to look out for in making our selection are firmness, stability, constancy.", "543": "There is a plentiful lack of men so endowed, and it is diffi­ cult to form a judgment without testing.", "544": "Now this testing can only be made during the actual existence of the friend­ ship;", "545": "for friendship so often precedes the formation of a judgment, and makes a previous test impossible.", "546": "If we are prudent then, we shall rein in our impulse to affection as we do chariot horses.", "547": "We make a preliminary trial of horses.", "548": "So we should of friendship;", "549": "and should test our friends' characters by a kind of tentative friendship.", "550": "It may often happen that the untrustworthiness of certain men is completely displayed in a small money matter;", "551": "others who are proof against a small sum are detected if it be large.", "552": "But even if some are found who think it mean to prefer money to friendship, where shall we look for those who put friendship before office, civil or military promotions, and political power, and who, when the choice lies between these things on the one side and the claims of friendship on the other, do not give a strong preference to the former?", "553": "It is not in human nature to be indifferent to political power;", "554": "and if the price men have to pay for it is the sacrifice of friend­ ship, they think their treason will be thrown into the shade by the magnitude of the reward.", "555": "This is why true friend­ ship is very difficult to find among those who engage in politics and the contest for office.", "556": "Where can you find the man to prefer his friend's advancement to his own?", "557": "And to say nothing of that, think how grievous and almost intolerable it is to most men to share political disaster.", "558": "You will scarcely find anyone who can bring himself to do that.", "559": "And though what Ennius says is quite true,-\" the hour of need shews the friend indeed,\"-yet it is in these two ways that most people betray their untrustworthiness and incon­ stancy, by looking down on friends when they are themselves prosperous, or deserting them in their distress.", "560": "A man, then, who has shewn a firm, unshaken, and unvarying friendship in both these contingencies we must reckon as one of a class the rarest in the world, and all but super­ human.", "561": "18.", "562": "Now, what is the quality to look out for as a warrant for the stability and permanence of friendship?", "563": "It is loyalty.", "564": "Nothing that lacks this can be stable.", "565": "We should also in making our selection look out for simplicity, a social disposition, and a sympathetic nature, moved by what moves us.", "566": "These all contribute to maintain loyalty.", "567": "You can never trust a character which is intricate and tortuous.", "568": "Nor, indeed, is it possible for one to be trust­ worthy and firm who is unsympathetic by nature and unmoved by what affects ourselves.", "569": "We may add, that he must neither take pleasure in bringing accusations against us himself, nor believe them when they are brought.", "570": "All these contribute to form that constancy which I have been endeavouring to describe.", "571": "And the result is, what I started by saying, that friendship is only possible between good men.", "572": "Now there are two characteristic features in his treat­ ment of his friends that a good (which may be regarded as equivalent to a wise) man will always display.", "573": "First, he will be entirely without any make-believe or pretence of feeling;", "574": "for the open display even of dislike is more becom­ ing to an ingenuous character than a studied concealment of sentiment.", "575": "Secondly, he will not only reject all accusations brought against his friend by another, but he will not be suspicious himself either, nor be always thinking that his friend has acted improperly.", "576": "Besides this, there should be a certain pleasantness in word and manner which adds no little flavour to friendship.", "577": "A gloomy temper and unvarying gravity may be very impressive;", "578": "but friendship should be a little less unbending, more indulgent and gracious, and more inclined to all kinds of good-fellowship and good-nature.", "579": "19.", "580": "But here arises a question of some little difficulty.", "581": "Are there any occasions on which, assuming their worthi­ ness, we should prefer new to old friends, just as we prefer young to aged horses?", "582": "The answer admits of no doubt whatever.", "583": "For there should be no satiety in friendship, as there is in other things.", "584": "The older the sweeter, as in wines that keep well.", "585": "And the proverb is a true one, \" You must eat many a peck of salt with a man to be thorough friends with him.\"", "586": "Novelty, indeed, has its advantage, which we must not despise.", "587": "There is always hope of fruit, as there is in healthy blades of corn.", "588": "But age too must have its proper position;", "589": "and, in fact, the influence of time and habit is very great.", "590": "To recur to the illustration of the horse which I have just now used.", "591": "Every one likes ceteris paribus to use the horse to which he has been accustomed, rather than one that is untried and new.", "592": "And it is not only in the case of a living thing that this rule holds good, but in inanimate things also;", "593": "for we like places where we have lived the longest, even though they are mountainous and covered with forest.", "594": "But here is another golden rule in friendship:", "595": "put yourself on a level with your friend.", "596": "For it often happens that there are certain superiorities, as for example Scipio's in what I may call our set.", "597": "Now he never assumed any airs of superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or over friends of a lower rank still.", "598": "For instance, he always shewed a deference to his brother Quintus Maximus because he was his senior, who, though a man no doubt of eminent character, was by no means his equal.", "599": "He used also to wish that all his friends should be the better for his support.", "600": "This is an example we should all follow.", "601": "If any of us have any advantage in personal character, intel­ lect, or fortune, we should be ready to make our friends sharers and partners in it with ourselves.", "602": "For instance, if their parents are in humble circumstances, if their relations are powerful neither in intellect nor means, we should sup­ ply their deficiencies and promote their rank and dignity.", "603": "You know the legends of children brought up as servants in ignorance of their parentage and family.", "604": "When they are recognized and discovered to be the sons of gods or kings, they still retain their affection for the shepherds whom they have for many years looked upon as their parents.", "605": "Much more ought this to be so in the case of real and undoubted parents.", "606": "For the advantages of genius and virtue, and in short of every kind of superiority, are never realized to their fullest extent until they are bestowed upon our nearest and dearest.", "607": "20.", "608": "But the converse must also be observed.", "609": "For in friendship and relationship, just as those who possess any superiority must put themselves on an equal footing with those who are less fortunate, so these latter must not be annoyed at being surpassed in genius, fortune, or rank.", "610": "But most people of that sort are forever either grumbling at something, or harping on their claims;", "611":

are a nui­ sance.", "613": "The recipient ought to remember them;", "614": "the performer should never mention them.", "615": "In the case of friends, then, as the superior are bound to descend, so are they bound in a certain sense to raise those below them.", "616": "For there are people who make their friendship disagreeable by imagining themselves undervalued.", "617": "This generally happens only to those who think that they deserve to be so;", "618": "and they ought to be shewn by deeds as well as by words the groundlessness of their opinion.", "619": "Now the measure of your benefits should be in the first place your own power to bestow, and in the second place the capacity to bear them on the part of him on whom you are bestowing affection and help.", "620": "For, however great your personal prestige may be, you cannot raise all your friends to the highest offices of the State.", "621": "For instance, Scipio was able to make Publius Rupilius consul, but not his brother Lucius.", "622": "But granting that you can give anyone anything you choose, you must have a care that it does not prove to be beyond his powers.", "623": "As a general rule, we must wait to make up our mind about friendships till men's characters and years have arrived at their full strength and development.", "624": "People must not, for instance, regard as fast friends all whom in their youthful enthusiasm for hunting or football they liked for having the same tastes.", "625": "By that rule, if it were a mere question of time, no one would have such claims on our affections as nurses and slave-tutors.", "626": "Not that they are to be neglected, but they stand on a different ground.", "627": "It is only these mature friendships that can be permanent.", "628": "For difference of character leads to difference of aims, and the result of such diversity is to estrange friends.", "629": "The sole reason, for instance, which prevents good men from making friends with bad, or bad with good, is that the divergence of their characters and aims is the greatest possible.", "630": "Another good rule in friendship is this:", "631": "do not let an excessive affection hinder the highest interests of your friends.", "632": "This very often happens.", "633": "I will go again to the region of fable for an instance.", "634": "Neoptolemus could never have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen to Ly­ comedes, who had brought him up, and with many tears tried to prevent his going there.", "635": "Again, it often happens that important business makes it necessary to part from friends:", "636": "the man who tries to baulk it, because he thinks that he cannot endure the separation, is of a weak and effeminate nature, and on that very account makes but a poor friend.", "637": "There are, of course, limits to what you ought to expect from a friend and to what you should allow him to demand of you.", "638": "And these you must take into calculation in every case.", "639": "21. Again, there is such a disaster, so to speak, as having to break off friendship.", "640": "And sometimes it is one we can­ not avoid.", "641": "For at this point the stream of our discourse is leaving the intimacies of the wise and touching on the friendship of ordinary people.", "642": "It will happen at times that an outbreak of vicious conduct affects either a man's friends themselves or strangers, yet the discredit falls on the friends.", "643": "In such cases friendships should be allowed to die out gradually by an intermission of intercourse.", "644": "They should, as I have been told that Cato used to say, rather be unstitched than torn in twain;", "645": "unless, indeed, the injurious conduct be of so violent and outrageous a nature as to make an instant breach and separation the only possible course consistent with honour and rectitude.", "646": "Again, if a change in character and aim takes place, as often happens, or if party politics produces an alienation of feeling (I am now speaking, as I said a short time ago, of ordinary friend... ships, not of those of the wise), we shall have to be on our guard against appearing to embark upon active enmity while we only mean to resign a friendship.", "647": "For there can be nothing more discreditable than to be at open war with a man with whom you have been intimate.", "648": "Scipio, as you are aware, had abandoned his friendship for Quintus Pompeius on my account;", "649": "and again, from differences of opinion in politics, he became estranged from my colleague Metellus.", "650": "In both cases he acted with dignity and modera­ tion, shewing that he was offended indeed, but without rancour.", "651": "Our first object, then, should be to prevent a breach;", "652": "our second, to secure that, if it does occur, our friendship should seem to have died a natural rather than a violent death.", "653": "Next, we should take care that friendship is not converted into active hostility, from which flow personal quarrels, abusive language, and angry recriminations.", "654": "These last, however, provided that they do not pass all reasonable limits of forbearance, we ought to put up with, and, in compliment to an old friendship, allow the party that inflicts the injury, not the one that submits to it, to be in the wrong.", "655": "Generally speaking, there is but one way of securing and providing oneself against faults and inconveniences of this sort—not to be too hasty in bestowing our affection, and not to bestow it at all on unworthy objects.", "656": "Now, by \"worthy of friendship” I mean those who have in themselves the qualities which attract affection.", "657": "This sort of man is rare;", "658": "and indeed all excellent things are rare;", "659": "and nothing in the world is so hard to find as a thing entirely and completely perfect of its kind.", "660": "But most people not only recognize nothing as good in our life unless it is profitable, but look upon friends as so much stock, caring most for those by whom they hope to make most profit.", "661": "Accordingly they never possess that most beautiful and most spontaneous friendship which must be sought solely for itself without any ulterior object.", "662": "They fail also to learn from their own feel­ ings the nature and the strength of friendship.", "663": "For every one loves himself, not for any reward which such love may bring, but because he is dear to himself independently of anything else.", "664": "But unless this feeling is transferred to another, what a real friend is will never be revealed;", "665": "for he is, as it were, a second self.", "666": "But if we find these two instincts shewing themselves in animals,-whether of the air or the sea or the land, whether wild or tame,—first, a love of self, which in fact is born in everything that lives alike;", "667": "and, secondly, an eagerness to find and attach themselves to other creatures of their own kind;", "668": "and if this natural action is accompanied by desire and by something resembling human love, how much more must this be the case in man by the law of his nature?", "669": "For man not only loves himself, but seeks another whose spirit he may so blend with his own as almost to make one being of two.", "670": "22. But most people unreasonably, not to speak of mod­ esty, want such a friend as they are unable to be themselves, and expect from their friends what they do not themselves give.", "671": "The fair course is first to be good yourself, and then to look out for another of like character.", "672": "It is between such that the stability in friendship of which we have been talking can be secured;", "673": "when, that is to say, men who are united by affection learn, first of all, to rule those passions which enslave others, and in the next place to take delight in fair and equitable conduct, to bear each other's burdens, never to ask each other for anything inconsistent with virtue and rec­ titude, and not only to serve and love but also to respect each other.", "674": "I say \" respect\";", "675": "for if respect is gone, friend­ ship has lost its brightest jewel.", "676": "And this shows the mis­ take of those who imagine that friendship gives a privilege to licentiousness and sin.", "677": "Nature has given us friendship as the handmaid of virtue, not as a partner in guilt:", "678": "to the end that virtue, being powerless when isolated to reach the highest objects, might succeed in doing so in union and partnership with another.", "679": "Those who enjoy in the present, or have enjoyed in the past, or are destined to enjoy in the future such a partnership as this, must be considered to have secured the most excellent and auspicious combination for reaching nature's highest good.", "680": "This is the partnership, I say, which combines moral rectitude, fame, peace of mind, serenity:", "681": "all that men think desirable because with them life is happy, but without them cannot be so.", "682": "This being our best and highest object, we must, if we desire to attain it, devote ourselves to virtue;", "683": "for without virtue we can obtain neither friendship nor anything else desirable.", "684": "In fact, if virtue be neglected, those who imagine themselves to possess friends will find out their error as soon as some grave dis­ aster forces them to make trial of them.", "685": "Wherefore, I must again and again repeat, you must satisfy your judgment be­ fore engaging your affections:", "686": "not love first and judge after­ wards.", "687": "We suffer from carelessness in many of our under­ takings:", "688": "in none more than in selecting and cultivating our friends.", "689": "We put the cart before the horse, and shut the stable door when the steed is stolen, in defiance of the old proverb.", "690": "For, having mutually involved ourselves in a long-standing intimacy or by actual obligations, all on a sudden some cause of offence arises and we break off our friendships in full career.", "691": "23.", "692": "It is this that makes such carelessness in a matter of supreme importance all the more worthy of blame.", "693": "I say “supreme importance,\" because friendship is the one thing about the utility of which everybody with one accord is agreed.", "694": "That is not the case in regard even to virtue itself;", "695": "for many people speak slightingly of virtue as though it were mere puffing and self-glorification.", "696": "Nor is it the case with riches.", "697": "Many look down on riches, being content with a little and taking pleasure in poor fare and dress.", "698": "And as to the

delight in science and philosophy, or those who follow a private way of life and care for nothing but their own business, or those lastly who have given themselves body and soul to sensuality-they all think, I say, that with­ out friendship life is no life, if they want some part of it, at any rate, to be noble.", "702": "For friendship, in one way or another, penetrates into the lives of us all, and suffers no career to be entirely free from its influence.", "703": "Though a man be of so churlish and unsociable a nature as to loathe and shun the company of mankind, as we are told was the case

victory over his plausible speech.", "768": "This took place in my praetorship, five years before I was elected consul, which shows that the cause was suc­ cessfully maintained more by the merits of

cleverness and charm, and whose death almost broke his heart.", "1544": "Most of Cicero's letters were written in ink on paper or parch­ ment with a reed pen;", "1545": "a few on tablets of wood or ivory covered with wax, the marks being cut with a stylus.", "1546": "The earlier letters he wrote with his own hand, the later were, except in rare cases, dictated to a secretary.", "1547": "There was, of course, no postal service, so the epistles were carried by private messengers or by the couriers who were constantly traveling between the provincial officials and the capital.", "1548": "Apart from the letters to Atticus, the collection, arrangement, and publication of Cicero's correspondence seems to have been due to Tiro, the learned freedman who served him as secretary, and to whom some of the letters are addressed.", "1549": "Titus Pomponius Atticus, who edited the large collection of the letters written to him­ self, was a cultivated Roman who lived more than twenty years in Athens for purposes of study.", "1550": "His seal for cultivation was combined with the successful pursuit of wealth;", "1551": "and though Cicero relied on him for aid and advice in public as well as private mat­ ters, their friendship did not prevent Atticus from being on good terms with men of the opposite party.", "1552": "Generous, amiable, and cultured, Atticus was not remarkable for the intensity of his devotion either to principles or persons.", "1553": "“That he was the lifelong friend of Cicero,\" says Professor Tyrrell, \"is the best title which Atticus has to remembrance.", "1554": "As a man he was kindly, careful, and shrewd, but nothing more:", "1555": "there was never anything grand or noble in his character.", "1556": "He was the quintessence of prudent mediocrity”The period covered by the letters of Cicero is one of the most interesting and momentous in the history of the world, and these letters afford a picture of the chief personages and most important events of that age from the pen of a man who was not only him­ self in the midst of the conflict, but who was a consummate literary artist.", "1557": "T HE state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that you are supremely interested, is this, as far as can be as yet conjectured.", "1558": "The only person actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius Galba.", "1559": "He meets with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or dis­ guise.", "1560": "In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not unfavourable to my interests;", "1561": "for the voters generally give as a reason for their refusal that they are under obliga­ tions to me.", "1562": "So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about that my friends are found to be numerous.", "1563": "My intention was to begin my own canvass just at the very time that Cincius tells me that your servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus at the time of the tribunician elections on the 17th of July.", "1564": "My fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q. Cornificius.", "1565": "At this I imagine you smiling or sighing.", "1566": "Well, to make you positively smite your forehead, there are people who actually think that Cæsonius will stand.", "1567": "I don't think Aquilius will, for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar.", "1568": "Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon.", "1569": "As for Aufidius and Palicanus, I don't think you will expect to hear from me about them.", "1570": "Of the candidates for this year's election Caesar is considered cer­ tain.", "1571": "Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus.", "1572": "These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems pas impossible to bring in Curius over their heads.", "1573": "But no one else thinks so.", "1574": "What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get in with Caesar.", "1575": "For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact thathe is commissioner of the via Flaminia, and when that has been finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected consul this election.", "1576": "Such in outline is the position of affairs in regard to candidates up to date.", "1577": "For myself I shall take the greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill I shall obtain a libera legatio and make an excursion in the course of September to visit Piso, but so as not to be back later than January.", "1578": "When I have ascertained the feelings of the nobility I will write you word.", "1579": "Everything else I hope will go smoothly, at any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town.", "1580": "You must undertake to secure for me the entourage of our friend Pompey, since you are nearer than I.", "1581": "Tell him I shall not be annoyed if lie doesn't come to my election.", "1582": "So much for that business.", "1583": "But there is a matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me.", "1584": "Your uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P. Varius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the property which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a collusive sale.", "1585": "He was joined in this action by the other creditors, among whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man whom they thought would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius Pontius;", "1586": "though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this stage in the proceed­ ings.", "1587": "Caecilius asked me to appear for him against Satyrus.", "1588": "Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my house.", "1589": "The chief object of his attentions is L. Domitius, but I am next in his regard.", "1590": "He has been of great service both to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections.", "1591": "I was very much embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success of my election depends more than on anyone else.", "1592": "I pointed out these facts to Caecilius;", "1593": "at the same time I assured him that if the case had been one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would have done what he wished.", "1594": "As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being concerned-and that two men of the highest rank, who, without the aid of anyone specially retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in maintain­ ing their common cause-it was only fair that he should have consideration both for my private friendship and my present situation.", "1595": "He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have wished, or than is usual among gentlemen;", "1596": "and from that time forth he has entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me which was only of a few days' standing.", "1597": "Pray forgive me, and believe that I was prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress, considering that he had shewn me every sort of kindness and attention.", "1598": "But if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the interests of my canvass prevented me.", "1599": "Yet, even granting that to be so, I think you should pardon me, \"since not for sacred beast or oxhide shield.”", "1600": "You see in fact the position I am in, and how necessary I regard it, not only to retain but even to acquire all possible sources of popularity.", "1601": "I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any rate anxious to have done so.", "1602": "The Hermathena you sent I am delighted with:", "1603": "it has been placed with such charming effect that the whole gymnasium seems arranged specially for it.", "1604": "I am ex­ ceedingly obliged to you.", "1605": "I HAVE to inform you that on the day of the election of L. Iulius Caesar and C. Marcius Figulus to the consulship, I had an addition to my family in the shape of a baby boy.", "1606": "Terentia doing well.", "1607": "Why such a time without a letter from you?", "1608": "I have already written to you fully about my circumstances.", "1609": "At this present time I am considering whether to undertake the defence of my fellow candidate, Catiline.", "1610": "We have a jury to

I shall bear it with resignation.", "1613": "Your early return is of great importance to me, for there is a very strong idea prevailing that some intimate friends of yours, persons of high rank, will be opposed to my election.", "1614": "To win me their favour I see that I shall want you very much.", "1615": "Wherefore be sure to be in Rome in January, as you have agreed to be.", "1616": "IF you and the army are well I shall be glad.", "1617": "From your official despatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest satisfaction;", "1618": "for you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which, in sole reliance on you, I was assuring everyone.", "1619": "But I must inform you that your old enemies-now posing as your friends-have received a stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the high hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly de­ pressed.", "1620": "Though your private letter to me contained a. somewhat slight expression of your affection, yet I can assure you it gave me pleasure:", "1621": "for there is nothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the con­ sciousness of serving my friend;", "1622": "and if on any occasion I do not meet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance of kindness in my favour.", "1623": "Of this I feel no doubt-even if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you to me-that the interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition between us.", "1624": "To let you know, however, what I missed in your letter I will write with the candour which my own disposition and our common friendship demand.", "1625": "I did expect some con­ gratulation in your letter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties between us and of the Republic.", "1626": "This I presume to have been omitted by you from a fear of hurting anyone's feelings.", "1627": "But let me tell you that what I did for the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment and testimony of the whole world.", "1628": "You are a much greater man that Africanus, but I am not much inferior to Laelius either;", "1629": "and when you come home you will recognize that I have acted with such prudence and spirit, that you will not now be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as in private friendship.", "1630": "YOUR letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has made me realize that my brother Quintus's feelings have undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and judg­ ments have varied widely from time to time.", "1631": "This has not only caused me all the pain which my extreme affection for both of you was bound to bring, but it has also made me wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such deep offence, or such an extraordinary change of feeling.", "1632": "And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had sunk deep into his heart.", "1633": "On trying on several previous occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of his offence was so great as your letter indicates;", "1634": "but on the other I did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished.", "1635": "However, I con­ soled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing you at Dyrrachium, or somewhere in your part of the country:", "1636": "and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview.", "1637": "For I need not say in writing to you, who knows it quite well, how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive in taking offence.", "1638": "But it most unfortunately happened that you did not see him anywhere.", "1639": "For the impression he had received from the artifices of others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the old affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the strongest influence of all.", "1640": "And yet, as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write:", "1641": "since I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours.", "1642": "For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it.", "1643": "But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet.", "1644": "As to the letter he sent to you from Thessalonica, and about the language which you sup­ pose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness.", "1645": "For if you will only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally signs of a good heart;", "1646": "and lastly-and this is the main thing-that we must mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?), or faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed away.", "1647": "I beg you to take this view, for it is the dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that there should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you and is not loved by you.", "1648": "That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city you let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship:", "1649": "for I am thoroughly per­ suaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in our choice of a career.", "1650": "Ambition led me to seek official advancement, while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an honourable privacy.", "1651": "In the true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you.", "1652": "In affec­ tion towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I put you first.", "1653": "For indeed, indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have cor­ responded with the variations of my fortunes.", "1654": "Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your con­ solation a welcome antidote to alarm.", "1655": "Nay, at this moment of your absence, it is not only your advice-in which you excel-but the interchange of speech-in which no one gives me so much delight as you do-that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection is always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by securing popularity, or in the mere business of my family?", "1656": "In all these I missed you and our conversa­ tions before my brother left Rome, and still more do I miss them since.", "1657": "Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum or at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation.", "1658": "The modest reserve which characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning these facts;", "1659": "but on this occasion it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your char­ acter \" put straight\" and “ cleared ” in my eyes.", "1660": "Yet, in the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger on his part, there is yet one fortunate circumstance-that your determination of not going to a province was known to me and your other friends, and had been at various times asserted by yourself;", "1661": "so that your not being with him may be attributed to your personal tastes and judgment, not to the quarrel and rupture between you.", "1662": "So those ties which have been broken will be restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will retain all their old inviolability.", "1663": "At Rome I find politics in a shaky condition;", "1664": "everything is unsatisfactory and foreboding change.", "1665": "For I have no doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are all but alienated from the senate.", "1666": "Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the authority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict.", "1667": "I happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfac­ tory nature of my cause.", "1668": "But here is another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light as possible!", "1669": "The companies which had contracted with the censors for Asia complained that in the heat of the com­ petition they had taken the contract at an excessive price;", "1670": "they demanded that the contract should be annulled.", "1671": "I led in their support, or rather, I was second, for it was Crassus who induced them to venture on this demand.", "1672": "The case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession of rash speculation.", "1673": "Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got no concession, they would be completely alienated from the senate.", "1674": "Here again I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and secured them a full and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December, delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders.", "1675": "The business is not yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the senate has been made manifest:", "1676": "for no one had spoken against it except the consul-designate, Metellus;", "1677": "while our hero Cato had still to speak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached.", "1678": "Thus I, in the mainte­ nance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's work;", "1679": "but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, I am constructing what I may call a road towards the main­ tenance of our power, a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will never­ theless give you a hint.", "1680": "I cultivate close intimacy with Pompey.", "1681": "I foresee what you will say.", "1682": "I will use all neces­ sary precautions, and I will write another time at greater length about my schemes for managing the Republic.", "1683": "You must know that Lucceius has it in his mind to stand for the consulship at once;", "1684": "for there are said to be only two candi­ dates in prospect.", "1685": "Caesar is thinking of coming to terms with him by the agency of Arrius, and Bibulus also thinks he may effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso.", "1686": "You smile?", "1687": "This is no laughing matter, believe me.", "1688": "What else shall I write to you ?", "1689": "What ?", "1690": "I have plenty to say, but must put it off to another time.", "1691": "If you mean to wait till you hear, let me know.", "1692": "For the moment I am satisfied with a modest request, though it is what I desire above every thing- that you should come to Rome as soon as possible.", "1693": "5 December.", "1694": "YES, I do write to you less often than I might, because, though I am always wretched, yet when I write to you or read a letter from you, I am in such floods of tears that I cannot endure it.", "1695": "Oh, that I had clung less to life!", "1696": "I should at least never have known real sorrow, or not much of it, in my life.", "1697": "Yet if fortune has reserved for me any hope of re­ covering at any time any position again, I was not utterly wrong to do so:", "1698": "if these miseries are to be permanent, I only wish, my dear, to see you as soon as possible and to die in your arms, since neither gods, whom you have worshipped with such pure devotion, nor men, whom I have ever served, have made us any return.", "1699": "I have been thirteen days at Brundisium in the house of M. Laenius Flaccus, a very excellent man, who has despised the risk to his fortunes and civil existence in comparison to keeping me safe, nor has been induced by the penalty of a most iniquitous law to refuse me the rights and good offices of hospitality and friendship.", "1700": "May I sometime have the opportunity of repay­ ing him Feel gratitude I always shall.", "1701": "I set out from Brundisium on the 29th of April, and intend going through Macedonia to Cyzicus.", "1702": "What a fall!", "1703": "What a disaster!", "1704": "What can I say?", "1705": "Should I ask you to come-a woman of weak health and broken spirit?", "1706": "Should I refrain from asking you?", "1707": "Am I to be without you, then?", "1708": "I think the best course is this:", "1709": "if there is any hope of my restoration, stay to promote it and push the thing on:", "1710": "but if, as I fear, it proves hopeless, pray come to me by any means in your power.", "1711": "Be sure of this, that if I have you I shall not think myself wholly lost.", "1712": "But what is to become of my darling Tullia?", "1713": "You must see to that now:", "1714": "I can think of nothing.", "1715": "But certainly, however things turn out, we must do everything to promote that poor little girl's married hap­ piness and reputation.", "1716": "Again, what is my boy Cicero to do?", "1717": "Let him, at any rate, be ever in my bosom and in my arms.", "1718": "I can't write more.", "1719": "A fit of weeping hinders me.", "1720": "I don't know how you have got on;", "1721": "whether you are left in possession of anything, or have been, as I fear, entirely plundered.", "1722": "Piso, as you say, I hope will always be our friend.", "1723": "As to the manumission of the slaves you need not be uneasy.", "1724":

"1726": "With the rest of the slaves the arrangement is that, if my property is forfeited, they should become my freedmen, supposing them to be able to main­ tain at law that status.", "1727": "But if my property remained in my ownership, they were to continue slaves, with the ex­ ception of a very few.", "1728": "But these are trifles.", "1729": "To return to your advice, that I should keep up my courage and not give up hope of recovering my position, I only wish that there were any good grounds for entertaining such a hope.", "1730": "As it is, when, alas!", "1731": "shall I get a letter from you ?", "1732": "Who will bring it me?", "1733": "I would have waited for it at Brundisium, but the sailors would not allow it, being unwilling to lose a favourable wind.", "1734": "For the rest, put as dignified a face on the matter as you can, my dear Terentia.", "1735": "Our life is over:", "1736": "we have had our day:", "1737": "it is not any fault of ours that has ruined us, but our virtue.", "1738": "I have made no false step, except in not losing my life when I lost my honours.", "1739": "But since our children preferred my living, let us bear everything else, however

mine you have grief for my fall and fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion.", "1763": "I not wish to see you?", "1764": "The truth is rather that I was unwilling to be seen by you.", "1765":

your province:", "1766": "not a trace even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the likeness of a living corpse.", "1767": "And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a corpse!", "1768": "Oh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my undiminished rank!", "1769": "But I call all the gods to witness that the one argu­ ment which recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some extent your life depended upon mine.", "1770": "In which matter I made an error and acted culpably.", "1771": "For if I had died, that death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you.", "1772": "As it is, I have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still living to need the help of others;", "1773": "and my voice, of all others, to fail when dangers threatened my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defence of the tnerest strangers.", "1774": "For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless deluge of tears and sorrows.", "1775": "How many tears do you sup­ pose these very words have cost me?", "1776": "As many as I know they will cost you to read them!", "1777": "Can I ever refrain from thinking of you or ever think of you without tears?", "1778": "For when I miss you, is it only a brother that I miss ?", "1779": "Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his advice!", "1780": "What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me ?", "1781": "And what must my case be when at the same time I miss a daughter:", "1782": "How affectionate!", "1783": "how modest!", "1784": "how clever!", "1785": "The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul!", "1786": "Or again a son, the prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart?", "1787": "Cruel in­ human monster that I am, I dismissed him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished:", "1788": "for the poor child began to understand what was going on.", "1789": "So, too, your own son, your own image, whom my little Cicero loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as an elder brother!", "1790": "Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife-the truest of helpmates-to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common children?", "1791": "Nevertheless, to the best of my ability, I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on;", "1792": "and in this I repeat the advice and entreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me by my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to Rome.", "1793": "For, in the first place, I desired your protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by my fall.", "1794": "In the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting would

the supreme pain of not seeing you-and nothing more painful or more wretched could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united of brothers-was a less misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting.", "1797": "Now, if you can, though I, whom you al­ ways regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself and collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront.", "1798": "I hope, if my hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection to you.", "1799": "But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do whatever you think can be done for me.", "1800": "In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great length and declare they have hopes;", "1801": "but I personally cannot see what hope there is, since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases deserted, in others even be­ trayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on their own treacherous conduct.", "1802": "But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain and report to me.", "1803": "In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in view of any danger you may have to undergo:", "1804": "longer than that I cannot go in this kind of life.", "1805": "For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient strength to sustain such a weight of grief.", "1806": "I know that there has been a time for dying, more honourable and more advantageous;", "1807": "and this is not the only one of my many omissions;", "1808": "which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity.", "1809": "But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact impossible-re­ main in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer than your necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall de­ mand.", "1810": "For I, who was lately supremely blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however, distinguished—I cannot, I repeat.", "1811": "go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin.", "1812": "Wherefore, what do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange?", "1813": "As though I were not now wholly dependent on your means!", "1814": "And that is just the very thing in which I see and feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no purpose the money which I received from the treasury in your name, while you have to satisfy your creditors out of the very vitals of yourself and your son.", "1815": "However, the sum mentioned in your letter has been paid to M. Antonius, and the same amount to Cæpio.", "1816": "For me the sum at present in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing.", "1817": "For in either case-whether I am restored or given up in de­ spair-I shall not want any more money.", "1818": "For yourself, if you are molested, I think you should apply to Crassus and Calidius.", "1819": "I don't know how far Hortensius is to be trusted.", "1820": "Myself, with the most elaborate presence of affection and the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and the most consummate treachery, and Q. Arrius helped him in it:", "1821": "acting under whose advice, promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster.", "1822": "But this you will keep dark for fear they might injure you.", "1823": "Take care also-and it is on this account that I think you should cultivate Hortensius himself by means of Pomponius-that the epigram on the lex Aurelia at­ tributed to you when candidate for the ædileship is not proved by false testimony to be yours.", "1824": "For there is nothing that I am so afraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your prayers and your acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the greater violence.", "1825": "Messalla", "1826": "I reckon as really attached to you:", "1827": "Pompey I regard as still pretending only.", "1828": "But may you never have to put these things to the test!", "1829": "And that prayer I would have offered to the gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine.", "1830": "However, I do pray that they may be content with these endless miseries of ours;", "1831": "among which, after all, there is no discredit for any wrong thing done-sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe when our conduct has been most unexceptionable.", "1832": "As to my daughter and yours and my young Cicero, why should I recommend them to you, my dear brother?", "1833": "Rather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow than it does me.", "1834": "Yet as long as you are uncon­ demned they will not be fatherless.", "1835": "The rest, by my hopes of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, my tears will not allow me to write!", "1836": "Terentia also I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on every subject.", "1837": "Be as brave as the nature of the case admits.", "1838": "Thessalonica, 13 June.DIRECTLY", "1839": "I arrived at Rome, and there was anyone to whom I could safely intrust a letter for you, I thought the very first thing I ought to do was to congratulate you in your absence on my return.", "1840": "For I knew, to speak candidly, that though in giving me advice you had not been more courageous or far-seeing than myself, nor-considering my devotion to you in the past-too careful in protecting me from disaster, yet that you-though sharing in the first instance in my mis­ take, or rather madness, and in my groundless terror-had nevertheless been deeply grieved at our separation, and had bestowed immense pains, zeal, care, and labour in securing my return.", "1841": "Accordingly, I can truly assure you of this, that in the midst of supreme joy and the most gratifying con­ gratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happi­ ness to the brim is the sight of you, or rather your embrace:", "1842": "and if I ever forfeit that again, when I have once got pos­ session of it, and if, too, I do not exact the full delights of your charming society that have fallen into arrear in the past, I shall certainly consider myself unworthy of this renewal of my good fortune.", "1843": "In regard to my political position, I have resumed what I thought there would be the utmost difficulty in recovering­ my brilliant standing at the bar, my influence in the senate, and a popularity with the loyalists even greater than I desired.", "1844": "In regard, however, to my private property-as to which you are well aware to what an extent it has been crippled, scattered, and plundered-I am in great difficulties, and stand in need, not so much of your means (which I look upon as my own), as of your advice for collecting and restoring to a sound state the fragments that remain.", "1845": "For the present, though I believe everything finds its way to you in the letters of your friends, or even by messengers and rumour, yet I will write briefly what I think you would like to learn from my letters above all others.", "1846": "On the 4th of August I started from Dyrrachium, the very day on which the law about me was carried.", "1847": "I arrived at Brundisium on the 5th of August.", "1848": "There my dear Tulliola met me on what was her own birthday, which happened also to be the name­ day of the colony of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety, near your house.", "1849": "This coincidence was noticed and cele­ brated with warm congratulations by the citizens of Brun­ disium.", "1850": "On the 8th of August, while still at Brundisium, I learnt by a letter from Quintus that the law had been passed at the comitia centuriata with a surprising enthusiasm on the part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible influx of voters from Italy.", "1851": "I then commenced my journey, amidst the compliments of the men of highest consideration at Brun­ disium, and was met at every point by legates bearing con­ gratulations.", "1852": "My arrival in the neighbourhood of the city was the signal for every soul of every order known to my nomenclator coming out to meet me, except those enemies who could not either dissemble or deny the fact of their being such.", "1853": "On my arrival at the Porta Capena, the steps of the temples were already thronged from top to bottom by the populace;", "1854": "and while their congratulations were dis­ played by the loudest possible applause, a similar throng and similar applause accompanied me right up to the Capitol, and in the forum and on the Capitol itself there was again a wonderful crowd.", "1855": "Next day, in the senate, that is, the 5th of September, I spoke my thanks to the senators.", "1856": "Two days after that-there having been a very heavy rise in the price of corn, and great crowds having flocked first to the theatre and then to the senate-house, shouting out, at the instigation of Clodius, that the scarcity of corn was my doing-meetings of the senate being held on those days to discuss the corn question, and Pompey being called upon to undertake the management of its supply in the common talk not only of the plebs, but of the aristocrats also, and being himself desirous of the commission, when the people at large called upon me by name to support a decree to that effect, I did so, and gave my vote in a care fully-worded speech.", "1857": "The other consulars, except Messalla and Afranius, having absented themselves on the ground that they could not vote with safety to themselves, a decree of the senate was passed in the sense of my motion, namely, that Pompey should be appealed to to undertake the business, and that a law should be proposed to that effect.", "1858": "This decree of the senate having been publicly read, and the people having, after the sense­ less and new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded the mention of my name, I delivered a speech.", "1859": "All the magistrates present, except one prætor and two tribunes, called on me to speak.", "1860": "Next day a full senate, including all the consulars, granted everything that Pompey asked for.", "1861": "Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the list, and said that he should regard me in all things as a second self.", "1862": "The consuls drew up a law by which complete control over the corn-supply for five years throughout the whole world was given to Pompey.", "1863": "A second law is drawn up by Messius, granting him power over all money, and adding a fleet and army, and an imperium in the provinces superior to that of their governors.", "1864": "After that our consular law seems moderate indeed:", "1865": "that of Messius is quite intoler­ able.", "1866": "Pompey professes to prefer the former;", "1867": "his friends the latter.", "1868": "The consulars led by Favonius murmur:", "1869": "I hold my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet given no answer in regard to my house.", "1870": "If they annul the con­ secration I shall have a splendid site.", "1871": "The consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, will value the cost of the building that stood upon it;", "1872": "but if the pontifices decide otherwise, they will pull down the Clodian building, give out a contract in their own name (for a temple), and value to me the cost of a site and house.", "1873": "So our affairs are \"For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.\"", "1874": "In regard to money matters I am, as you know, much embar­ rassed.", "1875": "Besides, there are certain domestic troubles, which I do not intrust to writing.", "1876": "My brother Quintus I love as he deserves for his eminent qualities of loyalty, virtue, and good faith.", "1877": "I am longing to see you, and beg you to hasten your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the benefit of your advice.", "1878": "I am on the threshold, as it were, of a second life.", "1879": "Already certain persons who defended me in my absence begin to nurse a secret grudge at me now that I am here, and to make no secret of their jealousy.", "1880": "I want you very much.", "1881": "I HAVE already told you the earlier proceedings;", "1882": "now let me describe what was done afterwards.", "1883": "The legations were postponed from the 1st of February to the 13th.", "1884": "On the former day our business was not brought to a settlement.", "1885": "On the 2nd of February Milo appeared for trial.", "1886": "Pompey came to support him.", "1887": "Marcellus spoke on being called upon by me.", "1888": "We came off with flying colours.", "1889": "The case was adjourned to the 7th.", "1890": "Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been postponed to the 13th, the business of allotting the quaestors and furnishing the outfit of the praetors was brought before the house.", "1891": "But nothing was done, because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic.", "1892": "Gaius Cato published his bill for the recall of Lentulus, whose son thereon put on mourning.", "1893": "On the 7th Milo appeared.", "1894": "Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak.", "1895": "For as soon as he got up Clodius's ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insult­ ing remarks.", "1896": "However, when he had finished his speech­ for he shewed great courage in these circumstances, he was not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times had by his commanding presence even secured silence for his words -well, when he had finished, up got Clodius.", "1897": "Our party received him with such a shout-for they had determined to pay him out-that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or control over his countenance.", "1898": "This went on up to two o'clock-Pompey having finished his speech at noon -and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency were uttered against Clodius and Clodia.", "1899": "Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque:", "1900": "\"Who was it who was starving the commons to death ?\"", "1901": "His ruffians answered, \"Pompey.\" \"Who wanted to be sent to Alexandria?\"", "1902": "They answered, \"Pompey.\" \"Who did they wish to go?\"", "1903": "They answered, \"Crassus.\"", "1904": "The latter was present at the time with no friendly feelings to Milo.", "1905": "About three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began spitting at our men.", "1906": "There was an outburst of rage.", "1907": "They began a movement for forcing us from our ground.", "1908": "Our men charged:", "1909": "his ruffians turned tail.", "1910": "Clodius was pushed off the rostra:", "1911": "and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot.", "1912": "The senate was summoned into the Curia:", "1913": "Pompey went home.", "1914": "However, I did not myself enter the senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defend­ ing Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus, Curio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offence to the loyalists.", "1915": "The business was adjourned to the next day.", "1916": "Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of February) for his pros­ ecution.", "1917": "On the 8th the senate met in the temple of Apollo, that Pompey might attend.", "1918": "Pompey made an impressive speech.", "1919": "That day nothing was concluded.", "1920": "On the 9th in the temple of Apollo a degree passed the senate \"that what had taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable.\"", "1921": "On this day Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar.", "1922": "He said a great deal about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms.", "1923": "When he attacked Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my enemies.", "1924": "Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said outright that \"he would take better precautions to protect his life than Africanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated.\"", "1925": "Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind.", "1926": "For Pompey understands what is going on, and imparts to me that plots, are being formed against his life, that Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied to Clodius, that both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors:", "1927": "that he must take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that demagogue-with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt.", "1928": "So he is making his preparations and summoning men from the country.", "1929": "On his part, Clodius is rallying his gangs:", "1930": "a body of men is being got together for the Quiri­ nalia.", "1931": "For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing to the forces brought up by Pompey himself:", "1932": "and a large contingent is expected from Picenum and Gallia, to enable us to throw out Cato's bills also about Milo and Lentulus.", "1933": "On the loth of February an indictment was lodged against Sestius for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the Pupi­ nian tribe, and on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for riot.", "1934": "He was ill.", "1935": "I went at once, as I was bound to do.", "1936": "to his house, and put myself wholly at his service:", "1937": "and that was more than people expected, who thought that I had good cause for being angry with him.", "1938": "The result is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made manifest both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my word.", "1939": "But this same informer Nerius also named Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to the commissioners.", "1940": "On the same day a decree passed the senate \"that political clubs and associations should be broken up, and that a law in regard to them should be brought in, enacting that those who did not break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those convicted of riot.", "1941": "\"On the 11th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia on a charge of bribery before the praetor Cn. Domitius, in the middle of the forum and in a very crowded court;", "1942": "and in the course of my speech I came to the incident of Sestius, after receiving many wounds in the temple of Castor, having been preserved by the aid of Bestia.", "1943": "Here I took occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got up against Sestius, and I passed a well­ deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of everybody.", "1944": "He was himself very much delighted with it.", "1945": "I tell you this because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the friendship of Sestius.", "1946": "I am writing this on the 12th of February before daybreak;", "1947": "the day on which I am to dine with Pomponius on the occasion of his wedding.", "1948": "Our position in other respects is such as you used to cheer my despondency by telling me it would be-one of great dignity and popularity:", "1949": "this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my brother, by your patience, high character, loyalty, and, I may also add, your conciliatory manners.", "1950": "The house of Licinius, near the grove of Piso, has been taken for you.", "1951": "But, as I hope, in a few months’ time, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own.", "1952": "Some excellent tenants, the Lamiae, have taken your house in Carinæ.", "1953": "I have received no letter from you since the one dated Olbia.", "1954": "I am anxious to hear how you are and what you find to amuse you, but above all to see you your­ self as soon as possible.", "1955": "Take care of your health, my dear brother, and though it is winter time, yet reflect that after all it is Sardinia that you arc In. IS February.", "1956": "IT will be delightful if you come to see us here.", "1957": "You will find that Tyrannic has made a wonderfully good arrange­ ment of my books, the remains of which are better than I had expected.", "1958": "Still, I wish you would send me a couple of your library slaves for Tyrannic to employ as gluers, and in other subordinate work, and tell them to get some fine parchment to make title-pieces, which you Greeks, I think, call \" sillybi.\"", "1959": "But all this is only if not inconvenient to you.", "1960": "In any case, be sure you come yourself, if you can halt for a while in such a place, and can persuade Pilia to accompany you.", "1961": "For that is only fair, and Tulia is anxious that she should come.", "1962": "My word!", "1963": "You have purchased a fine troop!", "1964": "Your gladiators, I am told, fight superbly.", "1965": "If you had chosen to let them out you would have cleared your expenses by the last two spectacles.", "1966":

with an inconceivably ardent desire, and one, as I think, of which I have no reason to be ashamed, that in a history written by you my name should be conspicuous and frequently mentioned with praise.", "1972": "And though you have often shewn me that you meant to do so, yet I hope you will pardon my impatience.", "1973": "For the style of your compo­ sition, though I had always entertained the highest expecta­ tions of it, has yet surpassed my hopes, and has taken such a hold upon me, or rather has so fired my imagination, that I was eager to have my achievements as quickly as possible put on record in your history.", "1974": "For it is not only the thought of being spoken of by future ages that makes me snatch at what seems a hope of immortality, but it is also the desire of fully enjoying in my lifetime an authoritative expression of your judgment, or a token of your kindness for me, or the charm of your genius.", "1975": "Not, however, that while thus writing I am unaware under what heavy burdens you are labouring in the portion of history you have undertaken, and by this time have begun to write.", "1976": "But because I saw that your his­ tory of the Italian and Civil Wars was now all but finished, and because also you told me that you were already em­ barking upon the remaining portions of your work, I de­ termined not to lose my chance for the want of suggesting to you to consider whether you preferred to weave your ac­ count of me into the main context of your history, or whether, as many Greek writers have done—Callisthenes, the Phocian War;", "1977": "Timaeus, the war of Pyrrhus;", "1978": "Polybius, that of Numantia;", "1979": "all of whom separated the wars I have named from their main narratives-you would, like them, separate the civil conspiracy from public and external wars.", "1980": "For my part, I do not see that it matters much to my reputa­ tion, but it docs somewhat concern my impatience, that you should not wait till you come to the proper place, but should at once anticipate the discussion of that question as a whole and the history of that epoch.", "1981": "And at the same time, if your whole thoughts are engaged on one incident and one person, I can see in imagination how much fuller your material will be, and how much more elaborately worked out.", "1982": "I am quite aware, however, what little modesty I display, first, in im­ posing on you so heavy a burden (for your engagements may well prevent your compliance with my request), and in the second place, in asking you to shew me off to advantage.", "1983": "What if those transactions are not in your judgment so very deserving of commendation ?", "1984": "Yet, after all, a man who has once passed the border-line of modesty had better put a bold face on it and be frankly impudent.", "1985": "And so I again and again ask you outright, both to praise those actions of mine in warmer terms than you perhaps feel, and in that respect to neglect the laws of history.", "1986": "I ask you, too, in regard to the personal predilection, on which you wrote in a certain introductory chapter in the most gratifying and explicit terms-and by which you shew that you were as incapable of being diverted as Xenophon's Hercules by Pleasure-not to go against it, but to yield to your affection for me a little more than truth shall justify.", "1987": "But if I can induce you to un­ dertake this, you will have, I am persuaded, matter worthy of your genius and your wealth of language.", "1988": "For from the beginning of the conspiracy to my return from exile it appears to me that a moderate-sized monograph might be composed, in which you will, on the one hand, be able to utilize your special knowledge of civil disturbances, either in unravelling the causes of the revolution or in proposing remedies for evils, blaming meanwhile what you think de­ serves denunciation, and establishing the righteousness of what you approve by explaining the principles on which they rest:", "1989": "and on the other hand, if you think it right to be more outspoken (as you generally do), you will bring out the perfidy, intrigues, and treachery of many people towards me.", "1990": "For my vicissitudes will supply you in your composition with much variety, which has in itself a kind of charm, capable of taking a strong hold on the imagination of readers, when you are the writer.", "1991": "For nothing is better fitted to inter­ est a reader than variety of circumstance and vicissitudes of fortune, which, though the reverse of welcome to us in actual experience, will make very pleasant reading:", "1992": "for the untroubled recollection of a past sorrow has a charm of its own.", "1993": "To the rest of the world, indeed, who have had no trouble themselves, and who look upon the misfortunes of others without any suffering of their own, the feeling of pity is itself a source of pleasure.", "1994": "For what man of us is not de­ lighted, though feeling a certain compassion too, with the death-scene of Epaminondas at Mantinea?", "1995": "He, you know, did not allow the dart to be drawn from his body until he had been told, in answer to his question, that his shield was safe, so that in spite of the agony of his wound he died calmly and with glory.", "1996": "Whose interest is not roused and sustained by the banishment and return of Themistocles ?", "1997": "Truly the mere chronological record of the annals has very little charm for us—little more than the entries in the fasti:", "1998": "but the doubtful and varied fortunes of a man, frequently of eminent charac­ ter, involve feelings of wonder, suspense, joy, sorrow, hope, fear:", "1999": "if these fortunes are crowned with a glorious death, the imagination is satisfied with the most fascinating delight which reading can give.", "2000": "Therefore it will be more in ac­ cordance with my wishes if you come to the resolution to separate from the main body of your narrative, in which you embrace a continuance history of events, what I may call the drama of my actions and fortunes:", "2001": "for it includes varied acts, and shifting scenes both of policy and circumstance.", "2002": "Nor am I afraid of appearing to lay snares for your favour by flattering suggestions, when I declare that I desire to be complimented and mentioned with praise by you above all other writers.", "2003": "For you are not the man to be ignorant of your own powers, or not to be sure that those who withhold their admiration of you are more to be accounted jealous, than those who praise you flatterers.", "2004": "Nor, again, am I so senseless as to wish to be consecrated to an eternity of fame by one who, in so consecrating me, does not also gain for himself the glory which right fully belongs to genius.", "2005": "For the famous Alexander himself did not wish to be painted by Apelles, and to have his statue made by Lysippus above all others, merely from personal favour to them, but because he thought that their art would be a glory at once to them and to himself.", "2006": "And, indeed, those artists used to make images of the person known to strangers:", "2007": "but if such had never ex­ isted, illustrious men would yet be no less illustrious.", "2008": "The Spartan Agesilaus, who would not allow a portrait of him­ self to be painted or a statue made, deserves to be quoted as an example quite as much as those who have taken trouble about such representations:", "2009": "for a single pamphlet of Xeno­ phon's in praise of that king has proved much more effective than all the portraits and statues of them all.", "2010": "And, more­ over, it will more redound to my present exultation and the honour of my memory to have found my way into your his­ tory, than if I had done so into that of others, in this, that I shall profit not only by the genius of the writer-as Timo­ leon did by that of Timaeus, Themistocles by that of He­ rodotus—but also by the authority of a man of a most illus­ trious and well-established character, and one well known and of the first repute for his conduct in the most important and weighty matters of state;", "2011": "so that I shall seem to have gained not only the fame which Alexander on his visit to Sigeum said had been bestowed on Achilles by Homer, but also the weighty testimony of a great and illustrious man.", "2012": "For I like that saying of Hector in Naevius, who not only re­ joices that he is \"praised,\" but adds, \"and by one who has himself been praised.\"", "2013": "But if I fail to obtain my request from you, which is equivalent to saying, if you are by some means prevented-for I hold it to be out of the question that you would refuse a request of mine—I shall perhaps be forced to do what certain persons have often found fault with, write my own panegyric, a thing, after all, which has a precedent of many illustrious men.", "2014": "But it will not escape your notice that there are the following drawbacks in a com­ position of that sort:", "2015": "men are bound, when writing of them­ selves, both to speak with greater reserve of what is praise­ worthy, and to omit what calls for blame.", "2016": "Added to which such writing carries less conviction, less weight;", "2017": "many people, in fine, carp at it, and say that the heralds at the public games are more modest, far after having placed garlands on the other recipients and proclaimed their names in a loud voice, when their own turn comes to be presented with a gar­ land before the games break up, they call in the services of another herald, that they may not declare themselves victors with their own voice.", "2018": "I wish to avoid all this, and, if you undertake my cause, I shall avoid it:", "2019": "and, accordingly, I ask you this favour.", "2020": "But why, you may well ask, when you have already often assured me that you intended to record in your book with the utmost minuteness the policy and events of my consulship, do I now make this request to you with such earnestness and in so many words?", "2021": "The reason is to be found in that burning desire, of which I spoke at the be­ ginning of my letter, for something prompt:", "2022": "because I am in a flutter of impatience, both that men should learn what I am from your book, while I am still alive, and that I may myself in my lifetime have the full enjoyment of my little bit of glory.", "2023": "What you intend doing on this subject I should like you to write me word, if not troublesome to you.", "2024": "For if you do undertake the subject, I will put together some notes of all occurrences:", "2025": "but if you put me off to some future time, I will talk the matter over with you.", "2026": "Meanwhile, do not relax your efforts, and thoroughly polish what you have already on the stocks, and-continue to love me.", "2027": "I HAD only just arrived from Arpinum when your letter was delivered to me;", "2028": "and from the same bearer I received a letter from Avianius, in which there was this most liberal offer, that when he came to Rome he would enter my debt to him on whatever day I chose.", "2029": "Pray put yourself in my place:", "2030": "is it consistent with your modesty or mine, first to prefer a request as to the day, and then to ask more than a yearns credit?", "2031": "But, my dear Gallus, everything would have been easy, if you had bought the things I wanted, and only up to the price that I wished.", "2032": "However, the purchases which, according to your letter, you have made shall not only be ratified by me, but with gratitude besides:", "2033": "for I fully under­ stand that you have displayed zeal and affection in purchas­ ing (because you thought them worthy of me) things which pleased yourself-a man, as I have ever thought, of the most fastidious judgment in all matters of taste.", "2034": "Still, I should like Damasippus to abide by his decision:", "2035": "for there is abso­ lutely none of those purchases that I care to have.", "2036": "But you, being unacquainted with my habits, have bought four or five of your selection at a price at which I do not value any statues in the world.", "2037": "You compare your Bacchæ with Metel­ lus's Muses.", "2038": "Where is the likeness?", "2039": "To begin with, I should never have considered the Muses worth all that money, and I think all the Muses would have approved my judgment:", "2040": "still, it would have been appropriate to a library, and in harmony with my pursuits.", "2041": "But Bacchae!", "2042": "What place is there in my house for them?", "2043": "But, you will say, they are pretty.", "2044": "I know them very well and have often seem them.", "2045": "I would have commissioned you definitely in the case of statues known to me, if I had decided on them.", "2046": "The sort of statues that I am accustomed to buy are such as may adorn a place in a palæstra after the fashion of gymnasia.", "2047": "What, again, have I, the promoter, of peace, to do with a statue of Mars ?", "2048": "I am glad there was not a statue of Saturn also:", "2049": "for I should have thought these two statues had brought me debt!", "2050": "I should have preferred some representation of Mercury:", "2051": "I might then, I suppose, have made a more favourable bargain with Arrianus.", "2052": "You say you meant the table-stand for yourself;", "2053": "well, if you like it, keep it.", "2054": "But if you have changed your mind I will, of course, have it.", "2055": "For the money you have laid out, indeed, I would rather have purchased a place of call at Tarracina, to prevent my being always a burden on my host.", "2056": "Altogether I perceive that the fault is with my freedman, whom I had distinctly commis­ sioned to purchase certain definite things, and also with Iunius, whom I think you know, an intimate friend of Avianius.", "2057": "I have constructed some new sitting-rooms in a miniature colonnade on my Tusculan property.", "2058": "I want to ornament them with pictures:", "2059": "for if I take pleasure in any­ thing of that sort it is in painting.", "2060": "However, if I am to have what you have bought, I should like you to inform me where they are, when they are to be fetched, and by what kind of conveyance.", "2061": "For if Damasippus doesn't abide by his decision, I shall look for some would-be Damasippus, even at a loss.", "2062": "As to what you say about the house, as I was going out of town I intrusted the matter to my daughter Tullia:", "2063": "for it was at the very hour of my departure that I got your letter.", "2064": "I also discussed the matter with your friend Nicias, because he is, as you know, intimate with Cassius.", "2065": "On my return, however, before I got your last letter, I asked Tullia what she had done.", "2066": "She said that she had approached Licinia (though I think Cassius is not very intimate with his sister), and that she at once said that she could venture, in the absence of her husband (Dexius is gone to Spain), to change houses without his being there and knowing about it.", "2067": "I am much gratified that you should value association with me and my domestic life so highly, as, in the first place, to take a house which would enable you to live not only near me, but absolutely with me, and, in the second place, to be in such a hurry to make this change of residence.", "2068": "But, upon my life, I do not yield to you in eagerness for that arrangement.", "2069": "So I will try every means in my power.", "2070": "For I see the advantage to myself, and, indeed, the advantages to us both.", "2071": "If I succeed in doing anything, I will let you know.", "2072": "Mind you also write me word back on everything, and let me know, if you please, when I am to expect you.", "2073": "IF some bodily pain or weakness of health has prevented your coming to the games, I put it down to fortune rather than your own wisdom:", "2074": "but if you have made up your mind that these things which the rest of the world admires are only worthy of contempt, and, though your health would have allowed of it, you yet were unwilling to come, then I rejoice at both facts-that you were free from bodily pain, and that you had the sound sense to disdain what others causelessly admire.", "2075": "Only I hope that some fruit of your leisure may be forthcoming, a leisure, indeed, which you had a splendid opportunity of enjoying to the full, seeing that you were left almost alone in your lovely country.", "2076": "For I doubt not that in that study of yours, from which you have opened a window into the Stabian waters of the bay, and obtained a view of Misenum, you have spent the morning hours of those days in light reading, while those who left you there were watching the ordinary farces half asleep.", "2077": "The remaining parts of the day, too, you spent in the pleasures which you had yourself arranged to suit your own taste, while we had to endure whatever had met with the approval of Spurius Maecius.", "2078": "On the whole, if you care to know, the games were most splendid, but not to your taste.", "2079": "I judge from my own.", "2080": "For, to begin with, as a special honour to the occasion, those actors had come back to the stage who, I thought, had left it for their own.", "2081": "Indeed, your favourite, my friend Æsop, was in such a state that no one could say a word against his retiring from the profession.", "2082": "On beginning to recite the oath his voice failed him at the words \"", "2083": "If I knowingly deceive.\"", "2084": "Why should I go on with the story?", "2085": "You know all about the rest of the games, which hadn't even that amount of charm which games on a moderate scale generally have:", "2086": "for the spectacle was so elaborate as to leave no room for cheerful enjoyment, and I think you need feel no regret at having missed it.", "2087": "For what is the pleasure of a train of six hundred mules in the \" Clytem­ nestra,\" or three thousand bowls in the \" Trojan Horse,\" or gay-colored armour of infantry and cavalry in some battle?", "2088": "These things roused the admiration of the vulgar;", "2089": "to you they would have brought no delight.", "2090": "But if during those days you listened to your reader Protogenes, so long at least as he read anything rather than my speeches, surely you had far greater pleasure than any one of us.", "2091": "For I don't suppose you wanted to see Greek or Oscan plays, especially as you can see Oscan farces in your senate-house over there, while you are so far from liking Greeks, that you generally won't even go along the Greek road to your villa", "2092": "Why, again, should I suppose you to care about missing the athletes, since you disdained the gladiators ?", "2093": "in which even Pompey himself confesses that he lost his trouble and his pains.", "2094": "There remain the two wild-beast hunts, lasting five days, mag­ nificent-nobody denies it-and yet, what pleasure can it be to a man of refinement, when either a weak man is torn by an extremely powerful animal, or a splendid animal is trans- fixed by a hunting spear?", "2095": "Things which, after all, if worth seeing, you have often seen before;", "2096": "nor did I, who was present at the games, see anything the least new.", "2097": "The last day was that of the elephants, on which there was a great deal of astonishment on the part of the vulgar crowd, but no pleasure whatever.", "2098": "Nay, there was even a certain feeling of compassion aroused by it, and a kind of belief created that that animal has something in common with mankind.", "2099": "However, for my part, during this day, while the theatrical exhibitions were on, lest by chance you should think me too Messed, I almost split my lungs in defending your friend Caninius Gallus.", "2100": "But if the people were as indulgent to me as they were to Æsop, I would, by heaven, have been glad to abandon my profession and live with you and others like us.", "2101": "The fact is I was tired of it before, even when both age and ambition stirred me on, and when I could also decline any defence that I didn't like;", "2102": "but now, with things in the state that they are, there is no life worth having.", "2103": "For, on the one hand, I expect no profit of my labor;", "2104": "and, on the other, I am sometimes forced to defend men who have been no friends to me, at the request of those to whom I am under obligations.", "2105": "Accordingly, I am on the look-out for every excuse for at last managing my life according to my own taste, and I loudly applaud and vehemently approve both you and your retired plan of life:", "2106": "and as to your infrequent appearances among us, I am the more resigned to that be­ cause, were you in Rome, I should be prevented from enjoy­ ing the charm of your society, and so would you of mine, if I have any, by the overpowering nature of my engagements;", "2107": "from which, if I get any relief-for entire release I don't ex­ pect—I will give even you, who have been studying nothing else for many years, some hints as to what it is to live a life of cultivated enjoyment.", "2108": "Only be careful to nurse your weak health and to continue your present care of it, so that you may be able to visit my country houses and make excursions with me in my litter.", "2109": "I have written you a longer letter than usual, from superabundance, not of leisure, but of affection, because, if you remember, you asked me in one of your let­ ters to write you something to prevent you feeling sorry at having missed the games.", "2110": "And if I have succeeded in that, I am glad:", "2111": "if not, I yet console myself with this reflexion, that in future you will both come to the games and come to see me, and will not leave your hope of enjoyment dependent on my letters.", "2112": "YOUR note by its strong language has drawn out this letter.", "2113": "For as to what actually occurred on the day of your start, it supplied me with absolutely no subject for writing.", "2114": "But as when we are together we are never at a loss for something to say, so ought our letters at times to digress into loose chat.", "2115": "Well then, to begin, the liberty of the Tenedians has received short shrift, no one speaking for them except my­ self, Bibulus, Calidius, and Favonius.", "2116": "A complimentary ref­ erence to you was made by the legates from Magnesia and Sipylum, they saying that you were the man who alone had resisted the demand of L. Sestius Pansa.", "2117": "On the re­ maining days of this business in the senate, if anything occurs which you ought to know, or even if there is nothing, I will write you something every day.", "2118": "On the 12th I will not fail you or Pomponius.", "2119": "The poems of Lucretius are as you say­ with many flashes of genius, yet very technical.", "2120": "But when you return, ... if you succeed in reading the Empedoclea of Sallustius, I shall regard you as a hero, yet scarcely human.", "2121": "AFTER extraordinary hot weather-I never remember greater heat—I have refreshed myself at Arpinum, and en­ joyed the extreme loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the charge of Philotimus.", "2122": "I was at Arcanum on the loth of September.", "2123": "There I found Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, for which they were making a course not far from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme drought, and they said they were going to collect it in much greater abundance.", "2124": "Everything is right with Herus.", "2125": "In your Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself in dilatoriness.", "2126": "Still, he had nothing left to construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary.", "2127": "I liked that villa very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity.", "2128": "I never appreciated this till now that the colonnade itself has been all laid open, and the columns have been polished.", "2129": "It all depends-and this I will look to-upon the stuccoing being prettily done.", "2130": "The pavements seemed to be being well laid.", "2131": "Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them to be changed.", "2132": "As to the place in which they say that you write word that a small entrance hall is to be built-namely, in the colonnade-I liked it better as it is.", "2133": "For I did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance hall;", "2134": "nor is it usual to have one, except in those buildings which have a larger court;", "2135": "nor could it have bedrooms and apartments of that kind attached to it.", "2136": "As it is, from the very beauty of its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer room.", "2137": "However, if you think differently, write back word as soon as possible.", "2138": "In the bath I have moved the hot chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its steampipe was immediately under the bedrooms.", "2139": "A fair-sized bed-room and a lofty winter one I admired very much, for they were both spacious and well­ situated-on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath.", "2140": "Diphilus had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, and not opposite each other.", "2141": "These, of course, he shall take down;", "2142": "he will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure.", "2143": "On the whole, I hope Diphilus's work will be completed in a few months:", "2144": "for Caesius, who was with me at the time, keeps a very sharp look-out upon him.", "2145": "Thence I started straight along the via Vitularia to your Fufidianum, the estate which we bought for you a few weeks ago at Arpinum for 100,000 sesterces (about £800).", "2146": "I never saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts of it, and abundant into the bargain.", "2147": "In short, Caesius thought that you would easily irrigate fifty iugera of the meadow land.", "2148": "For my part, I can assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvellously pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a palæstra, and a shrubbery.", "2149": "I am told that you wish to keep this Bovillæ estate.", "2150": "You will determine as you think good.", "2151": "Calvus said that, even if the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were established by the vendor, and thus an easement were im­ posed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in case we wish to sell.", "2152": "He said that he had agreed with you to do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three miles.", "2153": "It seemed to me more.", "2154": "But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be bet­ ter laid out.", "2155": "I had sent for Cillo from Venafrum, but on that very day four of his fellow servants and apprentices had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at Venafrum.", "2156": "On the 13th of September I was at Laterium.", "2157": "I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem almost like a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces­ for I measured it myself from the little bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of Satricum.", "2158": "There they had put down dust, not gravel (this shall be changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline.", "2159": "But I understood that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did not wish it to go through the property of Locusta or Varro.", "2160": "The latter alone had made the road very well where it skirted his own property.", "2161": "Locusta hadn't touched it;", "2162": "but I will call on him at Rome, and think I shall be able to stir him up, and at the same time I think I shall ask M. Tarus, who is now at Rome, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do so, about making a watercourse through his prop­ erty.", "2163": "I much approved of your steward Nicephorius and I asked him what orders you had given about that small build­ ing at Laterium, about which you spoke to me.", "2164": "He told me in answer that he had himself contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia (about £128), but that you had after­ wards made many additions to the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up.", "2165": "I quite approve by Hercules, of your making the additions you had deter­ mined upon;", "2166": "although the villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke the extravagance of other villas.", "2167": "Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing.", "2168": "I praised your landscape gardener:", "2169": "he has so covered every­ thing with ivy, both the foundation-wall of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy garden­ ing, and to be shewing off the ivy.", "2170": "Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the bath.", "2171": "That is about all I have to say about country matters.", "2172": "The gardener, indeed, as well as Philotimus and Cincius are press­ ing on the ornamentation of your town house;", "2173": "but I also often look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty.", "2174": "Where­ fore don't be at all anxious about that.", "2175": "As to your always asking me about your son, of course I \" excuse you \";", "2176": "but I must ask you to \" excuse \" me also, for I don't allow that you love him more than I do.", "2177": "And oh that he had been with me these last few days at Arpinum, as he had himself set his heart on being, and as I had no less done!", "2178": "As to Pomponia, please write and say that, when I go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy.", "2179": "I'll do wonders with him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure:", "2180": "for at Rome there is no time to breathe.", "2181": "You know I formerly promised to do so for nothing.", "2182": "What do you expect with such a reward as you.", "2183": "promise me?", "2184": "I now come to your letters which I received in several packets when I was at Arpinum.", "2185": "For I received three from you in one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the same time-one of considerable length, in which your first point was that my letter to you was dated earlier than that to Caesar.", "2186": "Oppius at times cannot help this:", "2187": "the reason is that, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having re­ ceived a letter from me, he is hindered by something turn­ ing up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had in­ tended;", "2188": "and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a letter which I have once handed to him.", "2189": "You write about Caesar's extreme affection for us.", "2190": "This affection you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase it by every means in my power.", "2191": "About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as you advise.", "2192": "That my permission to you to stay longer is a wel­ come one, though I grieve at your absence and miss you exceedingly, I am yet partly glad.", "2193": "What you can be think­ ing of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not understand.", "2194": "There is not one of those fel­ lows that won't expect a present from you equal to a sub­ urban estate.", "2195": "However, there is no reason for your classing ray friend Trebatius with them.", "2196": "I sent him to Caesar, and Caesar has done all I expected.", "2197": "If he has not done quite what he expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part.", "2198": "Your remark, that you are a greater favourite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying sat­ isfaction to me.", "2199": "As to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye.", "2200": "I am indeed glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other.", "2201": "As to what you say about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius, and Caesar wrote back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and chided me for my modesty in making the request.", "2202": "If I have asked one for anyone else-as I told Oppius to write and tell Cæsar—I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those who pester me for letters are annoyed at a re­ fusal from me.", "2203": "I like Curtius, as I have told him, not only because you asked me to do so, but from the character you gave of him;", "2204": "for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he shewed for my restoration.", "2205": "As for the British expedi­ tion, I conclude from your letter that we have no occasion either for fear or exultation.", "2206": "As to public affairs, about which you wish Tiro to write to you, I have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I knew that all events, small or great, were reported to Caesar.", "2207": "I have now answered your longest letter.", "2208": "Now hear what I have to say to your small one.", "2209": "The first point is about Clodius's letter to Caesar.", "2210": "In that matter I approve of Caesar's policy, in not having given way to your request so far as to write a single word to that Fury.", "2211": "The next thing is about the speech of Calventius \" Marius.\"", "2212": "I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought to an­ swer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech, unless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him as an exercise.", "2213": "My books, all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish them for some days yet The speeches for Scaurus and Plancius which you clamour for I have finished.", "2214": "The poem to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short.", "2215": "I will write what you ask me for, since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time.", "2216": "Now for the third letter.", "2217": "It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear from you that Balbus is soon coming to Rome, and so well accompanied!", "2218": "and will stay with me continu­ ously till the 15th of May.", "2219": "As to your exhorting me in the same letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you say:", "2220": "but when am I to enjoy any real life?", "2221": "Your fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, dated on the loth of August from Britain.", "2222": "In it there was nothing new except about your Erigona, and if I get that from Oppius I will write and tell you what I think of it.", "2223": "I have no doubt I shall like it.", "2224": "Oh yes!", "2225": "I had almost for­ gotten to remark as to the man who, you say in your letter, had written to Caesar about the applause given to Milo—", "2226": "I am not unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as warm as possible.", "2227": "And in point of fact it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to be given to me.", "2228": "I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the colonnade of Catulus.", "2229": "Both of these matters are being actively carried out.", "2230": "At the temple of Tellus I have even got your statue placed.", "2231": "So, again, as to your reminder about a suburban villa and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house has all the charm of such a pleasure-ground.", "2232": "On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of September I found the roof on your house fin­ ished:", "2233": "the part over the sitting-rooms, which you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of the lower colonnade.", "2234": "Our boy, in my absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric master.", "2235": "You have no reason for being anxious about his education, for you know his ability, and I see his application.", "2236": "Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee, with full consciousness that I am bound to make it good.", "2237": "As yet there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius:", "2238": "first, L.

you who in your overflowing affection make things, which cannot be omitted without criminal negligence, appear deserving of even gratitude.", "2313": "However, my feelings towards you would have been much more fully known and con­ spicuous, if, during all this time that we have been separated, we had been together, and together at Rome.", "2314": "For precisely in what you declare your intention of doing-what no one is more capable of doing, and what I confidently look forward to from you-that is to say, in speaking in the senate, and in every department of public life and political activity, we should together have been in a very strong position (what my feelings and position are in regard to politics I will explain shortly, and will answer the questions you ask), and at any rate I should have found in you a supporter, at once most warmly attached and endowed with supreme wisdom, while in me you would have found an adviser, perhaps not the most unskilful in the world, and at least both faithful and devoted to your interests.", "2315": "However, for your own sake, of course, I rejoice, as I am bound to do, that you have been greeted with the title of imperator, and are holding your pro­ vince and victorious army after a successful campaign.", "2316": "But certainly, if you had been here, you would have enjoyed to a fuller extent and more directly the benefit of the services which I am bound to render you.", "2317": "Moreover, in taking vengeance on those whom you know in some cases to be your enemies, because you championed the cause of my recall, in others to be jealous of the splendid position and renown which that measure brought you, I should have done you yeoman's service as your associate.", "2318": "However, that per­ petual enemy of his own friends, who, in spite of having been honoured with the highest compliments on your part, has selected you of all people for the object of his impotent and enfeebled violence, has saved me the trouble by punish­ ing himself.", "2319": "For he has made attempts, the disclosure of which has left him without a shred, not only of political position, but even of freedom of action.", "2320": "And though I should have preferred that you should have gained your experience in my case alone, rather than in your own also, yet in the midst of my regret I am glad that you have learnt what the fidelity of mankind is worth, at no great cost to yourself, which I learnt at the price of excessive pain.", "2321": "And I think that I have now an opportunity presented me, while answering the questions you have addressed

fault to find with that.", "2323": "But you express a wish to know what induced me to defend and compliment Vatinius,.", "2324": "In order to make my explanation plainer I must go a little farther back in the statement of my policy and its grounds.", "2325": "Well, Lentulus t", "2326": "At first—after the success of your efforts for my recall-I looked upon myself as having been re­ stored not alone to my friends, but to the Republic also;", "2327": "and seeing that I owed you an affection almost surpassing belief, and every kind of service, however great and rare, that could be bestowed on your person, I thought that to the Republic, which had much assisted you in restoring me, I at least was bound to entertain the feeling which I had in old times shewed merely from the duty incumbent on all citizens alike, and not as an obligation incurred by some special kindness to myself.", "2328": "That these were my sentiments I declared to the senate when you were consul, and you had yourself a full view of them in our conversations and discussions.", "2329": "Yet from the very first my feelings were hurt by many circumstances, when, on your mooting the question of the full restoration of my position, I detected the covert hatred of some and the equivocal attachment of others.", "2330": "For you received no support from either in regard to my monuments, or the illegal violence by which, in common with my brother, I had been driven from my house;", "2331": "nor, by heaven, did they shew the goodwill which I had ex­ pected in regard to those matters which, though necessary to me owing to the shipwreck of my fortune, were yet re­ garded by me as least valuable-I mean as to indemnifying me for my losses by decree of the senate.", "2332": "And though I saw all this-for it was not difficult to see-yet their present conduct did not affect me with so much bitterness as what they had done for me did with gratitude.", "2333": "And therefore, though according to your own assertion and testimony I was under very great obligation to Pompey, and though I loved him not only for his kindness, but also from my own feelings, and, so to speak, from my unbroken admiration of him, nevertheless, without taking any account of his wishes, I abode by all my old opinions in politics.", "2334": "With Pompey sitting in court, upon his having entered the city to give evidence in favour of Sestius, and when the witness Vatinius had asserted that, moved by the good fortune and success of Caesar, I had begun to be his friend, I said that I pre­ ferred the fortune of Bibulus, which he thought a humilia­ tion, to the triumphs and victories of everybody else;", "2335": "and I said during the examination of the same witness, in an­ other part of my speech, that the same men had prevented Bibulus from leaving his house as had forced me from mine:", "2336": "my whole cross-examination, indeed, was nothing but a denunciation of his tribuneship;", "2337": "and in it I spoke throughout with the greatest freedom and spirit about violence, neglect of omens, grants of royal titles.", "2338": "Nor, indeed, in the support of this view is it only of late that I have spoken:", "2339": "I have done so consistently on several occasions in the senate.", "2340": "Nay.", "2341": "even in the consulship of Marcellinus and Philippus, on the 5th of April the senate voted on my motion that the question of the Campanian land should be referred to a full meeting of the senate on the 15th of May.", "2342": "Could I more decidedly invade the stronghold of his policy, or shew more clearly that I forgot my own present interests, and re­ membered my former political career?", "2343": "On my delivery of this proposal a great impression was made on the minds not only of those who were bound to have been impressed, but also of those of whom I had never expected it.", "2344": "For, after this decree had passed in accordance with my motion, Pompey, without shewing the least sign of being offended with me, started for Sardinia and Africa, and in the course of that journey visited Caesar at Luca.", "2345": "There Caesar com­ plained a great deal about my motion, for he had already seen Crassus at Ravenna also, and had been irritated by him against me.", "2346": "It was well known that Pompey was much vexed at this, as I was told by others, but learnt most defi­ nitely from my brother.", "2347": "For when Pompey met him in Sar­ dinia, a few days after leaving Luca, he said:", "2348": "\" You are the very man I want to see;", "2349": "nothing could have happened more conveniently.", "2350": "Unless you speak very strongly to your brother Marcus, you will have to pay up what you guar­ anteed on his behalf.\"", "2351": "I need not go on.", "2352": "He grumbled a great deal:", "2353": "mentioned his own service to me:", "2354": "recalled what he had again and again said to my brother himself about the \"acts\" of Caesar, and what my brother had undertaken in regard to me;", "2355": "and called my brother himself to witness that what he had done in regard to my recall he had done with the consent of Caesar:", "2356": "and asked him to commend to me the latter's policy and claims, that I should not attack, even if I would not or could not support them.", "2357": "My brother having conveyed these remarks to me, and Pompey having, nevertheless, sent Vibullius to me with a message, begging me not to commit myself on the question of the Campanian land till his return, I reconsidered my position and begged the state itself, as it were, to allow me, who had suffered and done so much for it, to fulfil the duty which gratitude to my benefactors and the pledge which my brother had given demanded, and to suffer one whom it had ever re­ garded as an honest citizen to shew himself an honest man.", "2358": "Moreover, in regard to all those motions and speeches of mine which appeared to be giving offence to Pompey, the remarks of a particular set of men, whose names you must surely guess, kept on being reported to me;", "2359": "who, while in public affairs they were really in sympathy with my policy, and had always been so, yet said that they were glad that Pompey was dissatisfied with me, and that Caesar would be very greatly exasperated against me.", "2360": "This in itself was Vexatious to me:", "2361": "but much more so was the fact that they used, before my very eyes, so to embrace, fondle, make much of, and kiss my enemy-mine do I say?", "2362": "rather the enemy of the laws, of the law courts, of peace, of his country, of all loyal men!—that they did not indeed rouse my bile, for I have utterly lost all that, but imagined they did.", "2363": "In these circumstances, having, as far as is possible for human pru­ dence, thoroughly examined my whole position, and having balanced the items of the account, I arrived at a final result of all my reflexions, which, as well as I can, I will now briefly put before you.", "2364": "If I had seen the Republic in the hands of bad or prof­ ligate citizens, as we know happened during the supremacy of Cinna, and on some other occasions, I should not under the pressure, I don't say of rewards, which are the last things to influence me, but even of danger, by which, after all, the bravest men are moved, have attached myself to their party, not even if their services to me had been of the very highest kind.", "2365": "As it is, seeing that the leading statesman in the Republic was Pompey, a man who had gained this power and renown by the most eminent services to the state and the most glorious achievements, and one of whose position I had been a supporter from my youth up, and in my praetorship and consulship an active promoter also, and seeing that this same statesman had assisted me, in his own person by the weight of his influence and the expression of his opinion, and, in conjunction with you, by his counsels and zeal, and that he regarded my enemy as his own su­ preme enemy in the state-I did not think that I need fear the reproach of inconsistency, if in some of my senatorial votes I somewhat changed my standpoint, and contributed my zeal to the promotion of the dignity of a most distin­ guished man, and one to whom I am under the highest obligations.", "2366": "In this sentiment I had necessarily to include Caesar, as you see, for their policy and position were in­ separably united.", "2367": "Here I was greatly influenced by two things-the old friendship which you know that I and my brother Quintus have had with Caesar, and his own kindness and liberality, of which we have recently had clear and un­ mistakable evidence both by his letters and his personal attentions.", "2368": "I wa9 also strongly affected by the Republic itself, which appeared to me to demand, especially consider­ ing Cæsar’s brilliant successes, that there should be no quarrel maintained with these men, and indeed to forbid it in the strongest manner possible.", "2369": "Moreover, while en­ tertaining these feelings, I was above all shaken by the pledge which Pompey had given for me to Caesar, and my brother to Pompey.", "2370": "Besides, I was forced to take into consideration the state maxim so divinely expressed by our master Plato—“", "2371": "Such as are the chief men in a republic, such are ever wont to be the other citizens.\"", "2372": "I called to mind tEat in my consulship, from the very ist of January, such a foundation was laid of encouragement for the senate, that no one ought to have been surprised that on the 5th of December there was so much spirit and such commanding influence in that house.", "2373": "I also remember that when I be­ came a private citizen up to the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus, when the opinions expressed by me had great weight in the senate, the feeling among all the loyalists was invariable.", "2374": "Afterwards, while you were holding the prov­ ince of hither Spain with imperium and the Republic had no genuine consuls, but mere hucksters of provinces, mere slaves and agents of sedition, an accident threw my head as an apple of discord into the midst of contending factions and civil broils.", "2375": "And in that hour of danger, though a unanimity was displayed on the part of the senate that was surprising, on the part of all Italy surpassing belief, and of all the loyalists unparalleled, in standing forth in my defence, I will not say what happened-for the blame attaches to many, and is of various shades of turpitude—I will only say briefly that it was not the rank and file, but the leaders, that played me false.", "2376": "And in this matter, though some blame does attach to those who failed to defend me, no less attaches to those who abandoned me:", "2377": "and if those who were frightened deserve reproach, if there are such, still more are those to be blamed who pretended to be frightened.", "2378": "At any rate, my policy is justly to be praised for refusing to allow my fellow citizens (preserved by me and ardently de­ siring to preserve me) to be exposed while bereft of leaders to armed slaves, and for preferring that it should be made manifest how much force there might be in the unanimity of the loyalists, if they had been permitted to champion my cause before I had fallen, when after that fall they had proved strong enough to raise me up again.", "2379": "And the real feelings of these men you not only had the penetration to see, when bringing forward my case, but the power to en­ courage and keep alive.", "2380": "In promoting which measure-I will not merely not deny, but shall always remember also and gladly proclaim it—you found certain men of the highest rank more courageous in securing my restoration than they had been in preserving me from my fall:", "2381": "and, if they had chosen to maintain that frame of mind, they would have recovered their own commanding position along with my salvation.", "2382": "For when the spirit of the loyalists had been renewed by your consulship, and they had been roused from their dismay by the extreme firmness and rectitude of your official conduct;", "2383": "when, above all, Pompey's support had been secured;", "2384": "and when Caesar, too, with all the prestige of his brilliant achievements, after being honoured with unique and unprecedented marks of distinction and com­ pliments by the senate, was now supporting the dignity of the house, there could have been no opportunity for a dis­ loyal citizen of outraging the Republic.", "2385": "But now notice, I beg, what actually ensued.", "2386": "First of all, that intruder upon the women's rites, who had shewn no more respect for the Bona Dea than for his three sisters, secured immunity by the votes of those men who, when a tribune wished by a legal action to exact penalties from a seditious citizen by the agency of the loyalists, deprived the Republic of what would have been hereafter a most splendid precedent for the punishment of sedition.", "2387": "And these same persons, in the case of the monument, which was not mine, indeed-for it was not erected from the proceeds of spoils won by me, and I had nothing to do with it beyond giving out the contract for its construction-well, they allowed this monument of the senators to have branded upon it the name of a public enemy, and an inscription written in blood.", "2388": "That those men wished my safety rouses my liveliest gratitude, but I could have wished that they had not chosen to take my bare safety into consideration, like doctors, but, like trainers, my strength and complexion also!", "2389": "As it is, just as Apelles perfected the head and bust of his Venus with the most elaborate art, but left the rest of her body in the rough, so certain persons only took pains with my head, and left the rest of my body unfinished and unworked.", "2390": "Yet in this matter I have falsified the expec­ tation, not only of the jealous, but also of the downright hos­ tile, who formerly conceived a wrong opinion from the case of Quintus Metellus, son of Lucius—the most energetic and gallant man in the world, and in my opinion of surpassing courage and firmness-who, people say, was much cast down and dispirited after his return from exile.", "2391": "Now, in the first place, we are asked to believe that a man who accepted exile with entire willingness and remarkable cheerfulness, and never took any pains at all to get recalled, was crushed in spirit about an affair in whicH he had shewn more firmness and constancy than anyone else, even than the pre-eminent M. Scaurus himself!", "2392": "But, again, the account they had re­ ceived, or rather the conjectures they were indulging in about him, they now transferred to me, imagining that I should be more than usually broken in spirit:", "2393": "whereas, in fact, the Republic was inspiring me with even greater courage than I had ever had before, by making it plain that I was the one citizen it could not do without;", "2394": "and by the fact that while a bill proposed by only one tribune had re­ called Metellus, the whole state had joined as one man in recalling me—the senate leading the way, the whole of Italy following after, eight of the tribunes publishing the bill, a consul putting the question at the centuriate assembly, all orders and individuals pressing it on, in fact, with all the forces at its command.", "2395": "Nor is it the case that I afterwards made any pretension, or am making any at this day, which can justly offend anyone, even the most malevolent:", "2396": "my only effort is that I may not fail either my friends or those more remotely connected with me in either active service, or counsel, or personal exertion.", "2397": "This course of life per­ haps offends those who fix their eyes on the glitter and show of my professional position, but are unable to appreciate its anxieties and laboriousness.", "2398": "Again, they make no concealment of their dissatisfaction on the ground that in the speeches which I make in the senate in praise of Caesar I am departing from my old policy.", "2399": "But while giving explanations on the points which I put before you a short time ago, I will not keep till the last the following, which I have already touched upon.", "2400": "You will not find, my dear Lentulus, the sentiments of the loyalists the same as you left them-strengthened by my consulship, suffering relapse at intervals afterwards, crushed down be­ fore your consulship, revived by you:", "2401": "they have now been abandoned by those whose duty it was to have maintained them:", "2402": "and this fact they, who in the old state of things as it existed in our day used to be called Optimates, not only declare by look and expression of countenance, by which a false pretence is easiest supported, but have proved again and again by their actual sympathies and votes.", "2403": "Accord­ ingly, the entire view and aim of wise citizens, such as I wish both to be and to be reckoned, must needs have under­ gone a change.", "2404": "For that is the maxim of that same great Plato, whom I emphatically regard as my master:", "2405": "\"Main­ tain a political controversy only so far as you can convince your fellow citizens of its justice:", "2406": "never offer violence to parent or fatherland.\"", "2407": "He, it is true, alleges this as his motive for having abstained from politics, because, having found the Athenian people all but in its dotage, and seeing that it could not be ruled by persuasion, or by anything short of compulsion, while he doubted the possibility of persuasion, he looked upon compulsion as criminal.", "2408": "My position was different in this:", "2409": "as the people was not in its dotage, nor the question of engaging in politics still an open one for me, I was bound hand and foot.", "2410": "Yet I rejoiced that I was permitted in one and the same cause to support a policy at once advantageous to myself and acceptable to every loyalist.", "2411": "An additional motive was Caesar's memorable and almost superhuman kindness to myself and my brother, who thus would have deserved my support whatever he undertook;", "2412": "while as it is, considering his great success and his brilliant victories, he would seem, even if he had not behaved to me as he has, to claim a panegyric from me.", "2413": "For I would have you believe that, putting you aside, who were the authors of my recall, there is no one by whose good offices I would not only confess, but would even rejoice, to have been so much bound.", "2414": "Having explained this matter to you, the questions you ask about Vatinius and Crassus are easy to answer.", "2415": "For, since you remark about Appius, as about Caesar, \"that you have no fault to find,\" I can only say that I am glad you approve my policy.", "2416": "But as to Vatinius, in the first place there had been in the interval a reconciliation effected through Pompey, immediately after his election to the praetorship, though I had, it is true, impugned his candida­ ture in some very strong speeches in the senate, and yet not so much for the sake of attacking him as of defending and complimenting Cato.", "2417": "Again, later on, there followed a very pressing request from Caesar that I should undertake his defence.", "2418": "But my reason for testifying to his character I beg you will not ask, either in the case of this defendant or of others, lest I retaliate by asking you the same question when you come home:", "2419": "though I can do so even before you return:", "2420": "for remember for whom you sent a certificate of character from the ends of the earth.", "2421": "However, don't be afraid, for those same persons are praised by myself, and will continue to be so.", "2422": "Yet, after all, there was also the motive spurring me on to undertake his defence, of which, during the trial, when I appeared for him, I remarked that I was doing just what the parasite in the Eunuchus advised the captain to do:", "2423": "\"As oft as she names Phaedria, you retort With Pamphila.", "2424": "If ever she suggest, 'Do let us have in Phædria to our revel:", "2425": "'", "2426": "Quoth you, 'And let us call on Pamphila To sing a song.'", "2427": "If she shall praise his looks, Do you praise hers to match them:", "2428": "and, in fine, Give tit for tat, that you may sting her soul.\"", "2429": "So I asked the jurors, since certain men of high rank, who.", "2430": "had also done me very great favours, were much enamoured of my enemy, and often under my very eyes in the senate now took him aside in grave consultation, now embraced him familiarly and cheerfully—since these men had their Publius, to grant me another Publius, in whose person I might repay a slight attack by a moderate retort.", "2431": "And, indeed, I am often as good as my word, with the applause of gods and men.", "2432": "So much for Vatinius.", "2433": "Now about Crassus.", "2434": "I thought I had done much to secure his gratitude in having, for the sake of the general harmony, wiped out by a kind of volun­ tary act of oblivion all his very serious injuries, when he suddenly undertook the defence of Gabinius, whom only a few days before he had attacked with the greatest bitterness.", "2435": "Nevertheless, I should have borne that, if he had done so without casting any offensive reflexions on me.", "2436": "But on his attacking me, though I was only arguing and not in­ veighing against him, I fired up not only, I think, with the passion of the moment-for that perhaps would not have been so hot-but the smothered wrath at his many wrongs to me, of which I thought I had wholly got rid, having, unconsciously to myself, lingered in my soul, it suddenly shewed itself in full force.", "2437": "And it was at this precise time that certain persons (the same whom I frequently indicate by a sign or hint), while declaring that they had much en­ joyed my outspoken style, and had never before fully realized that I was restored to the Republic in all my old character, and when my conduct of that controversy had gained me much credit outside the house also, began saying that they were glad both that he was now my enemy, and that those who were involved with him would never be my friends.", "2438": "So when their ill-natured remarks were reported to me by men of most respectable character, and when Pompey pressed me as he had never done before to be reconciled to Crassus, and Caesar wrote to say that he was exceedingly grieved at that quarrel, I took into consideration not only my circum­ stances, but my natural inclination:", "2439": "and Crassus, that our reconciliation might, as it were, be attested to the Roman people, started for his province, it might almost be said, from my hearth.", "2440": "For he himself named a day and dined with me in the suburban villa of my son-in-law Crassipes.", "2441": "On this account, as you say that you have been told, I supported his cause in the senate, which I had undertaken on Pompey's strong recommendation, as I was bound in honour to do.", "2442": "I have now told you with what motives I have sup­ ported each measure and cause, and what my position is in politics as far as I take any part in them:", "2443": "and I would wish you to make sure of this-that I should have enter­ tamed the same sentiments, if I had been still perfectly uncommitted and free to choose.", "2444": "For I should not have thought it right to fight against such overwhelming power, nor to destroy the supremacy of the most distinguished citi­ zens, even if it had been possible;", "2445": "nor, again, should I have thought myself bound to abide by the same view, when cir­ cumstances were changed and the feelings of the loyalists altered, but rather to bow to circumstances.", "2446": "For the per­ sistence in the same view has never been regarded as a merit in men eminent for their guidance of the helm of state;", "2447": "but as in steering a ship one secret of the art is to run before the storm, even if you cannot make the harbour;", "2448": "yet, when you can do so by tacking about, it is folly to keep to the course you have begun rather than by changing it to arrive all the same at the destination you desire:", "2449": "so while we all ought in the administration of the state to keep always in view the object I have very frequently mentioned, peace combined with dignity, we are not bound always to use the same language, but to fix our eyes on the same object.", "2450": "Wherefore, as I laid down a little while ago, if I had had as free a hand as possible in everything, I should yet have been no other than I now am in politics.", "2451": "When, moreover, I am at once induced to adopt these sentiments by the kind­ ness of certain persons, and driven to do so by the injuries of others, I am quite content to think and speak about public affairs as I conceive best conduces to the interests both of myself and of the Republic.", "2452": "Moreover, I make this declara­ tion the more openly and frequently, both because my brother Quintus is Cæsar’s legate, and because no word of mine, however trivial, to say nothing of any act, in support of Caesar has ever transpired, which he has not received with such marked gratitude, as to make me look upon myself as closely bound to him.", "2453": "Accordingly, I have the advantage of his popularity, which you know to be very great, and his material resources, which you know to be immense, as though they were my own.", "2454": "Nor do I think that I could in any other way have frustrated the plots of unprincipled persons against me, unless I had now combined with those protections, which I have always possessed, the goodwill also of the men in power.", "2455": "I should, to the best of my belief, have followed this same line of policy even if I had had you here.", "2456": "For I well know the reasonableness and soberness of your judgment:", "2457": "I know your mind, while warmly attached to me, to be without a tinge of malevolence to others, but on the contrary as open and candid as it is great and lofty.", "2458": "I have seen certain persons conduct themselves' towards you as you might have seen the same persons conduct themselves towards me.", "2459": "The same things that have annoyed me would certainly have annoyed you.", "2460": "But whenever I shall have the enjoyment of your presence, you will be the wise critic of all my plans:", "2461": "you who took thought for my safety will also do so for my dignity.", "2462": "Me, indeed, you will have as the partner and associate in all your actions, sentiments, wishes -in fact, in everything;", "2463": "nor shall I ever in all my life have any purpose so steadfastly before me, as that you should rejoice more and more warmly every day that you did me such eminent service.", "2464": "As to your request that I would send you any books I have written since your departure, there are some speeches, which I will give Menocritus, not so very many, so don't be afraid!", "2465": "I have also written- for I am now rather withdraw­ ing from oratory and returning to the gentler Muses, which now give me greater delight than any others, as they have done since my earliest youth-well, then, I have written in the Aristotelian style, at least that was my aim, three books in the form of a discussion in dialogue \"On the Orator,\" which, I think, well be of some service to your Lentulus.", "2466": "For they differ a good deal from the current maxims, and embrace a discussion on the whole oratorical theory of the ancients, both that of Aristotle and Isocrates.", "2467": "I have also written in verse three books \"On my own Times,\" which I should have sent you some time ago, if I had thought they ought to be published-for they are wit­ nesses, and will be eternal witnesses, of your services to me and of my affection-but I refrained because I was afraid, not of those who might think themselves attacked, for I have been very sparing and gentle in that respect, but of my benefactors, of whom it were an endless task to mention the whole list.", "2468": "Nevertheless, the books, such as they are, if I find anyone to whom I can safely commit them, I will take care to have conveyed to you:", "2469": "and as far as that part of my life and conduct is concerned, I submit it entirely to your judgment.", "2470": "All that I shall succeed in accomplishing in literature or in learning—my old favourite relaxations-I shall with the utmost cheerfulness place be­ fore the bar of your criticism, for you have always had a fondness for such things.", "2471": "As to what you say in your letter about your domestic affairs, and all you charge me to do, I am so attentive to them that I don't like being reminded, can scarcely bear, indeed, to be asked without a very pain­ ful feeling.", "2472": "As to your saying, in regard to Quintus's busi­ ness, that you could not do anything last summer, because you were prevented by illness from crossing to Cilicia, but that you will now do everything in your power to settle it, I may tell you that the fact of the matter is that, if he can annex this property, my brother thinks that he will owe to you the consolidation of this ancestral estate.", "2473": "I should like you to write about all your affairs, and about the studies and training of your son Lentulus (whom I regard as mine also) as confidentially and as frequently as possible, and to believe that there never has been anyone either dearer or more con­ genial to another than you are to me, and that I will not only make you feel that to be the case, but will make all the world and posterity itself to the latest generation aware of it.", "2474": "Appius used some time back to repeat in conversation, and afterwards said openly, even in the senate, that if he were allowed to carry a law in the comitia curiata, he would draw lots with his colleague for their provinces;", "2475": "but if no curiatian law were passed, he would make an arrangement with his colleague and succeed you:", "2476": "that a curiatian law was a proper thing for a consul, but was not a necessity:", "2477": "that since he was in possession of a province by a decree of the senate, he should have imperium in virtue of the Cornelian law until such time as he entered the city.", "2478": "I don't know what your several connexions write to you on the subject:", "2479": "I understand that opinion varies.", "2480": "There are some who think that you can legally refuse to quit your province, be­ cause your successor is named without a curiatian law:", "2481": "some also hold that, even if you do quit it, you may leave some one behind you to conduct its government.", "2482": "For myself, I do not feel so certain about, the point of law-although there is not much doubt even about that-as I do of this, that it is for your greatest honour, dignity, and independ­ ence, which I know you always value above everything, to hand over your province to a successor without any delay, especially as you cannot thwart his greediness without rousing suspicion of your own.", "2483": "I regard my duty as two­ fold-to let you know what I think, and to defend what you have done.", "2484": "P.S.—I had written the above when I received your letter about the publicani, to whom I could not but admire the justice of your conduct.", "2485": "I could have wished that you had been able by some lucky chance to avoid running counter to the interests and wishes of that order, whose honour you have always promoted.", "2486": "For my part, I shall not cease to defend your decrees:", "2487": "but you know the ways of that class of men;", "2488": "you are aware how bitterly hostile they were to the famous Q. Scaevola himself.", "2489": "However, I advise you to reconcile that order to yourself, or at least soften its feelings, if you can by any means do so.", "2490": "Though difficult, I think it is, nevertheless, not beyond the reach of your sagacity.", "2491": "IN the \"Trojan Horse,\" just at the end, you remember the words, \"Too late they learn wisdom.\"", "2492": "You, however, old man, were wise in time.", "2493": "Those first snappy letters of yours were foolish enough, and then——!", "2494": "I don't at all blame you for not being over-curious in regard to Britain.", "2495": "For the present, however, you seem to be in winter quarters some­ what short of warm clothing, and therefore not caring to stir out:", "2496": "\"Not here and there, but everywhere, Be wise and ware:", "2497": "No sharper steel can warrior bear.", "2498": "\"If I had been by way of dining out, I would not have failed your friend Cn. Octavius;", "2499": "to whom, however, I did remark upon his repeated invitations, \"Pray, who are you?\"", "2500": "But, by Hercules, joking apart, he is a pretty fellow:", "2501": "I could have wished you had taken him with you!", "2502": "Let me know for certain what you are doing and whether you in­ tend coming to Italy at all this winter.", "2503": "Balbus has assured me that you will be rich.", "2504": "Whether he speaks after the simple Roman fashion, meaning that you will be well sup­ plied with money, or according to the Stoic dictum, that \"all are rich who can enjoy the sky and the earth,\" I shall know hereafter.", "2505": "Those who come from your part accuse you of pride, because they say you won't answer men who put questions to you.", "2506": "However, there is one thing that will please you:", "2507": "they all agree in saying that there is no better lawyer than you at Samarobriva!", "2508": "YES, I saw well enough what your feelings were as I parted from you;", "2509": "what mine were I am my own witness.", "2510": "This makes it all the more incumbent on you to prevent an additional decree being passed, so that this mutual regret of ours may not last more than a year.", "2511": "As to Annius Satur­ ninus, your measures are excellent.", "2512": "As to the guarantee, pray, during your stay at Rome, give it yourself.", "2513": "You will find several guarantees on purchase, such as those of the estates of Memmius, or rather of Attilius.", "2514": "As to Oppius, that is exactly what I wished, and especially your having en­ gaged to pay him the 800 sestertia (about £6,400), which I am determined shall be paid in any case, even if I have to borrow to do so, rather than wait for the last day of getting in my own debts.", "2515": "I now come to that last line of your letter written cross­ ways, in which you give me a word of caution about your sister.", "2516": "The facts of the matter are these.", "2517": "On arriving at my place at Arpinum, my brother came to see me, and our first subject of conversation was yourself, and we discussed it at great length.", "2518": "After this I brought the conversation round to what you and I had discussed at Tusculum, on the subject of your sister.", "2519": "I never saw anything so gentle and placable as my brother was on that occasion in regard to your sister:", "2520": "so much so, indeed, that if there had been any cause of quarrel on the score of expense, it was not apparent.", "2521": "So much for that day.", "2522": "Next day we started from Arpinum.", "2523": "A country festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum;", "2524": "I stopped at Aquinum;", "2525": "but we lunched at Arcanum.", "2526": "You know his property there.", "2527": "When we got there Quintus said, in the kindest manner, \" Pomponia, do you ask the ladies in, I will invite the men.\"", "2528": "Nothing, as I thought, could be more courteous, and that, too, not only in the actual words, but also in his intention and the expression of face.", "2529": "But she, in the hearing of us all, exclaimed, \" I am only a stranger here! \"", "2530": "The origin of that was, as I think, the fact that Statius had preceded as to look after the luncheon.", "2531": "There­ upon Quintus said to me, \" There, that's what I have to put up with every day!", "2532": "”You will say, \" Well, what does that amount to ? \"", "2533": "A great deal, and, indeed, she had irritated even me:", "2534": "her answer had been given with such unnecessary acrimony, both of word and look.", "2535": "I concealed my annoyance.", "2536": "We all took our places at table except her.", "2537": "However, Quintus sent her dishes from the table, which she declined.", "2538": "In short, I thought I never saw anything better tempered than my brother, or crosser than your sister:", "2539": "and there were many particulars which I omit that raised my bile more than did that of Quintus himself.", "2540": "I then went on to Aquinum;", "2541": "Quintus stopped at Arcanum, and joined me early the next day at Aquinum.", "2542": "He told me that she had refused to sleep with him, and when on the point of leaving she behaved just as I had seen her.", "2543": "Need I say more?", "2544": "You may tell her herself that in my judgment she shewed a marked want of kindness on that day.", "2545": "I have told you this story at greater length, perhaps, than was necessary, to convince you that you, too, have something to do in the way of giving her in­ struction and advice.", "2546": "There only remains for me to beg you to complete all my commissions before leaving town;", "2547": "to give Pomptinus a push, and make him start;", "2548": "to let me know as soon as you have left town, and to believe that, by heaven, there is nothing I love and find more pleasure in than yourself.", "2549": "I said a most affectionate good-bye to that best of men, A. Torquatus, at Minturnæ, to whom I wish you would remark, in the course of conversation, that I have mentioned him in my letter.", "2550": "YOUR own immense prestige and my unvarying belief in your consummate virtue have convinced me of the great importance it is to me that you should be acquainted with what I have accomplished, and that you should not be igno­ rant of the equity and disinterestedness with which I pro­ tected our allies and governed my province.", "2551": "For if you knew these facts, I thought I should with greater ease secure your approval of my wishes.", "2552": "Having entered my province on the last day of July, and seeing that the time of year made it necessary for me to make all haste to the army, I spent but two days at Laodicea, four at Apamea, three at Synnada, and the same at Philo­ melium.", "2553": "Having held largely attended assizes in these towns, I freed a great number of cities from very vexatious tributes, excessive interest, and fraudulent debt.", "2554": "Again, the army having before my arrival been broken up by something like a mutiny, and five cohorts-without a legate or a military tribune, and, in fact, actually without a single centurion- having taken up its quarters at Philomelium, while the rest of the army was in Lycaonia, I ordered my legate M. Anneius to bring those five cohorts to join the main army;", "2555": "and, hav­ ing thus got the whole army together into one place, to pitch a camp at Iconium in Lycaonia.", "2556": "This order having been energetically executed by him, I arrived at the camp myself on the 24th of August, having meanwhile, in accord­ ance with the decree of the senate, collected in the interven­ ing days a strong body of reserve men, a very adequate force of cavalry, and a contingent of volunteers from the free peoples and allied sovereigns.", "2557": "While this was going on, and when, after reviewing the army, I had on the 28th of August begun my march to Cilicia, some legates sent to me by the sovereign of Commagene announced, with every sign of panic, yet not without some foundation, that the Parthians had entered Syria.", "2558": "On hearing this I was rendered very anxious both for Syria and my own province, and, in fact, for all the rest of Asia.", "2559": "Accordingly, I made up my mind that I must lead the army through the district of Cappadocia, which adjoins Cilicia.", "2560": "For if I had gone straight down into Cilicia, I could easily indeed have held Cilicia itself, owing to the natural strength of Mount Amanus-for there are only two defiles opening into Cilicia from Syria, both of which are capable of being closed by insignificant garrisons owing to their narrowness, nor can anything be imagined better fortified than is Cilicia on the Syrian side-but I was dis­ turbed for Cappadocia, which is quite open on the Syrian side, and is surrounded by kings, who, even if they are our friends in secret, nevertheless do not venture to be openly hostile to the Parthians.", "2561": "Accordingly, I pitched my camp in the extreme south of Cappadocia at the town of Cybistra, not far from Mount Taurus, with the object at once of covering Cilicia, and of thwarting the designs of the neigh­ bouring tribes by holding Cappadocia.", "2562": "Meanwhile, in the midst of this serious commotion and anxious expectation of a very formidable war king Deiotarus, who has with good reason been always highly honoured in your judgment and my own, as well as that of the senate-a man distinguished for his goodwill and loyalty to the Roman people, as well as for his eminent courage and wisdom-sent legates to tell me that he was on his way to my camp in full force.", "2563": "Much affected by his zeal and kindness, I sent him a letter of thanks, and urged him to hasten.", "2564": "However, being detained at Cybistra five days while maturing my plan of campaign, I rescued king Ariobarzanes, whose safety had been in­ trusted to me by the senate on your motion, from a plot that, to his surprise, had been formed against him:", "2565": "and I not only saved his life, but I took pains also to secure that his royal authority should be respected.", "2566": "Metras and Ath­ enaeus (the latter strongly commended to me by yourself), who had been exiled owing to the persistent enmity of queen Athenais, I restored to a position of the highest influence and favour with the king.", "2567": "Then, as there was danger of serious hostilities arising in Cappadocia in case the priest, as it was thought likely that he would do, defended him­ self with arms-for he was a young man, well furnished with horse and foot and money, and relying on those all who desired political change of any sort—I contrived that he should leave the kingdom:", "2568": "and that the king, without civil war or an appeal to arms, with the full authority of the court thoroughly secured, should hold the kingdom with proper dignity.", "2569": "Meanwhile, I was informed by despatches and messen­ gers from many sides, that the Parthians and Arabs had approached the town of Antioch in great force, and that a large body of their horsemen, which had crossed into Cilicia, had been cut to pieces by some squadrons of my cavalry and the praetorian cohort then on garrison duty at Epiphanea.", "2570": "Wherefore, seeing that the forces of the Parthians had turned their backs upon Cappadocia, and were not far from the frontiers of Cilicia, I led my army to Amanus with the longest forced marches I could.", "2571": "Arrived there, I learnt that the enemy had retired from Antioch, and that Bibulus was at Antioch.", "2572": "I thereupon informed Deio­ tarus, who was hurrying to join me with a large and strong body of horse and foot, and with all the forces he could muster, that I saw no reason for his leaving his own do­ minions, and that in case of any new event, I would imme­ diately write and send to him.", "2573": "And as my intention in coming had been to relieve both provinces, should occasion arise, so now I proceeded to do what I had all along made up my mind was greatly to the interest of both provinces, namely, to reduce Amanus, and to remove from that moun­ tain an eternal enemy.", "2574": "So I made a feint of retiring from the mountain and making for other parts of Cilicia:", "2575": "and having gone a day's march from Amanus and pitched a camp, on the 12th of October, towards evening, at Epiphanea, with my army in light marching order I effected such a night march, that by dawn on the 13th I was already ascend­ ing Amanus.", "2576": "Having formed the cohorts and auxiliaries into several columns of attack-I and my legate Quintus (my brother) commanding one, my legate C. Pomptinus another, and my legates M. Anneius and L. Tullius the rest —we surprised most of the inhabitants, who, being cut off from all retreat, were killed or taken prisoners.", "2577": "But Erana, which was more like a town than a village, and was the capital of Amanus, as also Sepyra and Commons, which offered a determined and protracted resistance from before daybreak till four in the afternoon-Pomptinus being in command in that part of Amanus-we took, after killing a great number of the enemy, and stormed and set fire to several fortresses.", "2578": "After these operations we lay encamped for four days on the spurs of Amanus, near the Aræ Alexandri, and all that time we devoted to the destruction of the remaining inhabitants of Amanus, and devastating their lands on that side of the mountain which belongs to my province.", "2579": "Having accomplished this, I led the army away to Pindenissus, a town of the Eleutherocilices.", "2580": "And since this town was situated on a very lofty and strongly fortified spot, and was inhabited by men who have never submitted even to the kings, and since they were offering harbourage to deserters, and were eagerly expecting the arrival of the Parthians, I thought it of importance to the prestige of the empire to suppress their audacity, in order that there might be less difficulty in breaking the spirits of all such as were anywhere disaffected to our rule.", "2581": "I encircled them with a stockade and trench:", "2582": "I beleagured them with six forts and huge camps:", "2583": "I assaulted them by the aid of earth- works, pent-houses, and towers:", "2584": "and having employed nu­ merous catapults and bowmen, with great personal labour, and without troubling the allies or costing them anything, I reduced them to such extremities that, after every region of their town had been battered down or fired, they sur­ rendered to me on the fifty-seventh day.", "2585": "Their next neigh­ bours were the people of Tebra, no.", "2586": "less predatory and audacious:", "2587": "from them after the capture of Pindenissus I received hostages.", "2588": "I then dismissed the army to winter quarters;", "2589": "and I put my brother in command, with orders to station the men in villages that had either been captured or were disaffected.", "2590": "Well now, I would have you feel convinced that, should a motion be brought before the senate on these matters, I shall consider that the highest possible compliment has been paid me, if you give your vote in favour of a mark of honour being bestowed upon me.", "2591": "And as to this, though I am aware that in such matters men of the most respectable character are accustomed to ask and to be asked, yet I think in your case that it is rather a reminder than a request which is called for from me.", "2592": "For it is you who have on very many occasions complimented me in votes which you delivered, who have praised me to the skies in conversation, in pan­ egyric, in the most laudatory speeches in senate and public meeting:", "2593": "you are the man to whose words I ever attached such weight as to hold myself in possession of my utmost ambition, if your lips joined the chorus of my praise.", "2594": "It was you finally, as I recollect, who said, when voting against a supplicatio in honour of a certain illustrious and noble person, that you would have voted for it, if the motion had related to what he had done in the city as consul.", "2595": "It was you, too, who voted for granting me a supplicatio, though only a civilian, not as had been done in many instances, \"for good services to the state,\" but, as I remember, \"for having saved the state.\"", "2596": "I pass over your having shared the hatred I excited, the dangers I ran, all the storms that I have encountered, and your having been entirely ready to have shared them much more fully if I had allowed it;", "2597": "and finally your having regarded my enemy as your own;", "2598": "of whose death even-thus shewing me clearly how much you valued me—you manifested your approval by supporting the cause of Milo in the senate.", "2599": "On the other hand, I have borne a testimony to you, which I do not regard as consti­ tuting any claim on your gratitude, but as a frank ex­ pression of genuine opinion:", "2600": "for I did not confine myself to a silent admiration of your eminent virtues-who does not admire them?", "2601": "But in all forms of speech, whether in the senate or at the bar;", "2602": "in all kinds of writing, Greek or Latin;", "2603": "in fine, in all the various branches of my literary activity, I proclaimed your superiority not only to contemporaries, but also to those of whom we have heard in history.", "2604": "You will ask, perhaps, why I place such value on this or that modicum of congratulation or compliment from the senate.", "2605": "I will be frank with you, as our common tastes and mutual good services, our close friendship, nay, the intimacy of our fathers demand.", "2606": "If there ever was anyone by natural inclination, and still more, I think, by reason and reflexion, averse from the empty praise and comments of the vulgar, I am certainly the man.", "2607": "Witness my consulship, in which, as in the rest of my life, I confess that I eagerly pursued the objects capable of producing true glory:", "2608": "mere glory for its own sake I never thought a subject for ambition.", "2609": "Accord­ ingly, I not only passed over a province after the votes for its outfit had been taken, but also with it an almost certain hope of a triumph;", "2610": "and finally the priesthood, though, as I think you will agree with me, I could have obtained it without much difficulty, I did not try to get.", "2611": "Yet after my unjust disgrace-always stigmatized by you as, a disaster to the Republic, and rather an honour than a disaster to myself —I was anxious that some very signal marks of the appro­ bation of the senate and Roman people should be put on record.", "2612": "Accordingly, in the first place, I did subsequently wish for the augurship, about which I had not troubled my­ self before;", "2613": "and the compliment usually paid by the senate in the case of success in war, though passed over by me in old times, I now think an object to be desired.", "2614": "That you should approve and support this wish of mine, in which you may trace a strong desire to heal the wounds inflicted upon me by my disgrace, though I a little while ago declared that I would not ask it, I now do earnestly ask of you:", "2615": "but only on condition that you shall not think my humble services paltry and insignificant, but of such a nature and im­ portance, that many for far less signal successes have ob­ tained the highest honours from the senate.", "2616": "I have, too, I think, noticed this-for you know how attentively I ever listen to you-that in granting or withholding honours you are accustomed to look not so much to the particular achieve­ ments as to the character, the principles- and conduct of commanders.", "2617": "Well, if you apply this test to my case, you will find that, with a weak army, my strongest support against the threat of a very formidable war has been my equity and purity of conduct.", "2618": "With these as my aids I accomplished what I never could have accomplished by any amount of legions:", "2619": "among the allies I have created the warmest devo­ tion in place of the most extreme alienation;", "2620": "the most com­ plete loyalty in place of the most dangerous disaffection;", "2621": "and their spirits fluttered by the prospect of change I have brought back to feelings of affection for the old rule.", "2622": "But I have said too much of myself, especially to you, in whom singly the grievances of all our allies alike find a listener.", "2623": "You will learn the truth from those who think themselves restored to life by my administration.", "2624": "And while all with nearly one

"Dated the 765th day since the battle of Leuctra IT GLADLY obey the call of the state and of our friendship, in rejoicing that your virtue, integrity, and energy, already known at home in a most important crisis, when you were a civilian, should be maintained abroad with the same pains- taking care now that you have military command.", "2907": "Therefore what I could conscientiously do in setting forth in laudatory terms that the province had been defended by your wisdom;", "2908": "that the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, as well as the king .him­ self, had been preserved;", "2909": "and that the feelings of the allies had been won back to loyalty to our empire-that I have done by speech and vote.", "2910": "That a thanksgiving was decreed I am glad, if you prefer our thanking the gods rather than giving you the credit for a success which has been in no respect left to chance, but has been secured for the Republic by your own eminent prudence and self-control.", "2911": "But if you think a thanksgiving to be a presumption in favour of a triumph, and therefore prefer fortune having the credit rather than yourself, let me remind you that a triumph does not always follow a thanksgiving;", "2912": "and that it is an honour much more brilliant than a triumph for the senate to declare its opinion, that a province has been retained rather by the uprightness and mildness of its governor, than by the strength of an army or the favour of heaven:", "2913": "and that is what I meant to express by my vote.", "2914": "And I write this to you at greater length than I usually do write, because I wish above all things that you should think of me as taking pains to convince you, both that I have wished for you what I be­ lieved to be for your highest honour, and am glad that you have got what you preferred to it.", "2915": "Farewell:", "2916": "continue to love me;", "2917": "and by the way you conduct your home-journey, secure to the allies and the Republic the

congratulation contained in your letter, or the testimony borne to me in your senatorial speech:", "2921": "and it was at once the highest compliment and the greatest gratification to me, that you willingly conceded to friendship, what you transparently conceded to truth.", "2922": "And if, I don't say all, but if many were Catos in our state-in which it is a matter of wonder that there is even one-what triumphal chariot or laurel should I have compared with praise from you ?", "2923": "For in regard to my feelings, and in view of the ideal honesty and subtility of your judgment, nothing can be more complimentary than the speech of yours, which has been copied for me by my friends.", "2924": "But the reason of my wish, for I will not call it desire, I have explained to you in a former letter.", "2925": "And even if it does not appear to you to be entirely sufficient, it at any rate leads to this conclusion -not that the honour is one to excite excessive desire, but yet is one which, if offered by the senate, ought certainly not to be rejected.", "2926": "Now I hope that that House, considering the labours I have undergone on behalf of the state, will not think me undeserving of an honour, especially one that has become a matter of usage.", "2927": "And if this turns out to be so, all I ask of you is that-to use your own most friendly words- since you have paid me what in your judgment is the highest Compliment, you will still \"be glad\" if I have the good fortune to get what I myself have preferred.", "2928": "For I per­ ceive that you have acted, felt, and written in this sense:", "2929": "and the facts themselves shew that the compliment paid me of a supplicatio was agreeable to you, since your name ap­ pears on the decree:", "2930": "for decrees

you have preferred to con­ suit your politeness rather than your health, be careful for the future.", "2953": "I have sent orders to Curius for a douceur to be given to the physician, and that he

physician, to Curius, and to Lyso.", "2966": "Good-bye, and God bless you.", "2967": "I WAS charmed with your letter, in which, first of all, what I loved was the tenderness which prompted you to write, in alarm lest Silius should by his news have caused me any anxiety.", "2968": "About this news, not only had you written to me before-in fact twice, one letter being a duplicate of the other-shewing me clearly that you were upset, but I also had answered you in full detail, in order that I might, as far as such a business and such a crisis admitted, free you from your anxiety, or at any rate alleviate it.", "2969": "But since you shew in your last also how anxious you are about that matter-make up your mind to this, my dear Pætus that whatever could possibly be accomplished by art-for it is not enough nowadays to contend with mere prudence, a sort of system must be elaborated-however, whatever could be done or effected towards winning and securing the good­ will of those men I have done, and not, I think, in vain.", "2970": "For I receive such attentions, such politenesses from all Caesar's favourites as make me believe myself beloved by them.", "2971": "For, though genuine love is not easily distinguished from feigned, unless some crisis occurs of a kind to test faithful affection by its danger, as gold in the fire, there are other indications of a general

part for pre­ tending.", "2973": "In regard, again, to the man who now possesses all power, I see no reason for my being alarmed:", "2974": "except the fact that, once depart from law, everything is

privilege of mine, since to my exertions the existence of liberty in the state was owing, so, now that that is lost, I think it is my duty to say nothing calculated to offend either his wishes or those of his favourites.", "2979": "But if I want to avoid the credit of certain keen or witty epigrams, I must entirely abjure a reputation for genius, which I would not refuse to do, if I could.",

saying:", "2981": "\"This verse is not Plautus's, this is—” because he had acquired a sensitive ear by dint of classifying the various styles of poets and habitual read­ ing, so I am told that Caesar,

company almost every day.", "2983": "Now in tile course of our discursive talk many remarks are let fall, which perhaps at the time of my making them seem to them wanting neither in literary flavour

about me, he considers that he ought not to listen to it.", "2987": "Where­ fore I have no need of your (Enomaus, though your quota­ tion of Accius's verses was very much on the spot.", "2988": "But what is this jealousy, or what have I now of which anyone can be jealous?", "2989": "But suppose the worst.", "2990": "I find that the philosophers, who alone in my view grasp the true nature of virtue, hold that the wise man does not pledge himself against anything except doing wrong;", "2991": "and of this I consider myself clear in two ways, first in that my veiws were most absolutely cor­ rect;", "2992": "and second because, when I found that we had not sufficient material force to maintain them, I was against a trial of strength with the stronger party.", "2993": "Therefore, so far as the duty of a good citizen is concerned, I am certainly not open to reproach.", "2994": "What remains is that I should not say or do anything foolish or rash against the men in power:", "2995": "that too, I think, is the part of the wise man.", "2996": "As to the rest-what this or that man may say that I said, or the light in which he views it, or the amount of good faith with which those who continually seek me out and pay me at­ tention may be acting-for these things I cannot be re­ sponsible.", "2997": "The result is that I console myself with the con­ sciousness of my uprightness in the past and my moderation in the present, and apply that simile of Accius's not to jealousy, but to fortune, which I hold-as being incon­ stant and frail-ought to be beaten back by a strong and manly soul, as a wave is by a rock.", "2998": "For, considering that Greek history is full of examples of how the wisest men en­ dured tyrannies either at Athens or Syracuse, when, though their countries were enslaved, they themselves in a certain sense remained free—am I to believe that I cannot so main­ tain my position as not to hurt anyone's feelings and yet not blast my own character ?", "2999": "I now come to your jests, since as an afterpiece to Accius's (Enomaus, you have brought on the stage, not, as was his wont, an Atellan play, but, according to the pres­ ent fashion, a mime.", "3000":

close to business;", "3007": "but as things are now, seeing that you are losing money so cheer­ fully, all you have to do, when entertaining me, is to regard yourself as accepting a \"composition\";",

the senate would be broken, by its severance a civil war be provoked.", "3103": "And yet I was very intimate with Caesar, and had a very great regard for Pompey, but my advice was at once loyal to Pompey and in the best interests of both alike.", "3104": "My other predictions I pass over;", "3105": "for I would not have Caesar think that I gave Pompey advice, by which, if he had followed it, Caesar himself would have now been a man of illustrious character in the state indeed, and the first man in it, but yet not in possession of the great power he now wields.", "3106": "I gave it as my opinion that he should go to Spain;", "3107": "and if he had done so, there would have been no civil war at all.", "3108": "That Caesar should be allowed to stand for the consulship in his absence I

believed.", "3119": "Well, then, the prophecy I now give you does not rest on the flight of a bird nor the note of a bird of good omen on the left-according to the system of our augural college-nor

juster grounds for anger.", "3130": "\"What hope, then,\" you will say, \"from an angry man?\"", "3131": "Why, he knows very well that he will draw deep draughts of praise from the same fountain, from which he has been already-though sparingly-bespattered.", "3132": "Lastly, he is a man very acute and farseeing:", "3133": "he knows very well that a man like you—far and away the greatest noble in an important district of Italy, and in the state at large the equal of anyone of your generation, however eminent, whether in ability or popularity or reputation among the Roman people-cannot much longer

"3146": "Marcellus, with whom he was more angry than with anyone, he has re­ stored with the utmost consideration for his rank.", "3147": "To what, then, does all this tend?", "3148": "The nature of things and of the political situation will not suffer, nor will any constitutional theory—whether it remain as it is or is changed-permit, first, that the civil and personal position of all should not be alike when the merits of their cases are the same;", "3149": "and, secondly, that good men and good citizens of unblemished character should not return to a state, into which so many have returned after having been condemned of atrocious crimes.", "3150": "That is my prediction.", "3151": "If I had felt any doubt about it I would not have employed it in preference to a consolation which would have easily enabled me to support a man of spirit.", "3152": "It is this.", "3153": "If you had taken up arms for the Republic -for so you then thought-with the full assurance of vic­ tory, you would not deserve special commendation.", "3154": "But if, in view of the uncertainty attaching to all wars, you had taken into consideration the possibility of our being beaten, you ought not, while fully prepared to face success, to be yet utterly unable to endure failure.", "3155": "I would have urged also what a consolation the consciousness of your action, what a delightful distraction in adversity, literature ought to be.", "3156": "I would have recalled to your mind the signal dis­ asters not only of men of old times, but of those of our own day also, whether they were your leaders or your comrades.", "3157": "I would even have named many cases of illustrious for­ eigners:", "3158": "for the recollection of what I may call a common law and of the conditions of human existence softens grief.", "3159": "I would also have explained the nature of our life here in Rome, how bewildering the disorder, how universal the chaos:", "3160": "for it must needs cause less regret to be absent from a state in disruption, than from one well-ordered.", "3161": "But there is no occasion for anything of this sort.", "3162": "I shall soon see you, as I hope, or rather as I clearly perceive, in en­ joyment of your civil rights.", "3163": "Meanwhile, to you in your absence, as also to your son who is here-the express image of your soul and person, and a man of unsurpassable firm­ ness and excellence—I have long ere this both promised and tendered practically my zeal, duty, exertions, and labours:", "3164": "all the more so now that Caesar daily receives me with more open arms, while his intimate friends distinguish me above everyone.", "3165": "Any influence or favour I may gain with him I will employ in your service.", "3166": "Be sure, for your part, to sup­ port yourself not only with courage, but also with the bright­ est hopes.", "3167": "WHEN I received the news of your daughter Tullia's death, I was indeed much grieved and distressed as I was bound to be, and looked upon it as a calamity in which I shared.", "3168": "For, if I had been at home, I should not have failed to be at your side, and should have made my sorrow plain to you face to face.", "3169": "That kind of consolation involves much distress and pain, because the relations and friends, whose part it is to offer it, are themselves overcome by an equal sor­ row.", "3170": "They cannot attempt it without many tears, so that they seem to require consolation themselves rather than to be able to afford it to others.", "3171": "Still I have decided to set down briefly for your benefit such thoughts as have occurred to my mind, not because I suppose them to be unknown to you, but because your sorrow may perhaps hinder you from being so keenly alive to them.", "3172": "Why is it that a private grief should agitate you so deeply?", "3173": "Think how fortune has hitherto dealt with us.", "3174": "Reflect that we have had snatched from us what ought to be no less dear to human beings than their children-country , honour, rank, every political distinction.", "3175": "What additional wound to your feelings could be inflicted by this particular loss?", "3176": "Or where is the heart that should not by this time have lost all sensibility and learn to regard everything else as of minor importance?", "3177": "Is it on her account, pray, that you sorrow?", "3178": "How many times have you recurred to the thought-and I have often been struck with the same idea-that in times like these theirs is far from being the worst fate to whom it has been granted to exchange life for a painless death?", "3179": "Now what was there at such an epoch that could greatly tempt her to live?", "3180": "What scope, what hope, what hearts solace?", "3181": "That she might spend her life with some young and distinguished husband?", "3182": "How impossible for a man of your rank to select from the present generation of young men a son-in-law, to whose honour you might think your­ self safe in trusting your child!", "3183": "Was it that she might bear children to cheer her with the sight of their vigorous youth?", "3184": "who might by their own character maintain the position handed down to them by their parent, might be expected to stand for the offices in their order, might exercise their freedom in supporting their friends?", "3185": "What single one of these prospects has not been taken away before it was given?", "3186": "But, it will be said, after all it is an evil to lose one's children.", "3187": "Yes, it is:", "3188": "only it is a worse one to endure and submit to the present state of things.", "3189": "I wish to mention to you a circumstance which gave me no common consolation, on the chance of its also proving capable of diminishing your sorrow.", "3190": "On my voyage from Asia, as I was sailing from Ægina towards Megara, I began to survey the localities that were on every side of me.", "3191": "Be­ hind me was Ægina, in front Megara, on the right Piraeus, on my left Corinth:", "3192": "towns which at one time were most flourishing, but now lay before my eyes in ruin and decay.", "3193": "I began to reflect to myself thus:", "3194": "\"Hah!", "3195": "do we mannikins feel rebellious if one of us perishes or is killed—we whose life ought to be still shorter-when the corpses of so many towns lie in helpless ruin ?", "3196": "Will you please, Servius, restrain yourself and recollect that you are born a mortal man?\"", "3197": "Believe me, I was no little strengthened by that reflection.", "3198": "Now take the trouble, if you agree with me, to put this thought before your eyes.", "3199": "Not long ago all those most illustrious men perished at one blow:", "3200": "the empire of the Roman people suffered that huge loss:", "3201": "all the provinces were shaken to their foundations.", "3202": "If you have become the poorer by the frail spirit of one poor girl, are you agitated thus violently?", "3203": "If she had not died now, she would yet have had to die a few years hence, for she was mortal born.", "3204": "You, too, withdraw soul and thought from such things and rather remember those which become the part you have played in life:", "3205": "that she lived as long as life had anything to give her;", "3206": "that her life outlasted that of the Republic;", "3207": "that she lived to see you—her own father—prætor, consul, and augur;", "3208": "that she married young men of the highest rank;", "3209": "that she had enjoyed nearly every possible blessing;", "3210": "that, when the Republic fell, she departed from life.", "3211": "What fault have you or she to find with fortune on this score?", "3212": "In fine, do not forget that yott are Cicero, and a man accustomed to instruct and advise others;", "3213": "and do not imitate bad physicians, who in the diseases of others profess to under­ stand the art of healing, but are unable to prescribe for themselves.", "3214": "Rather suggest to yourself and bring home to your own mind the very maxims which you are accustomed to impress upon others.", "3215": "There is no sorrow beyond the power of time at length to diminish and soften:", "3216": "it is a re­ flexion on you that you should wait for this period, and not rather anticipate that result by the aid of your wisdom.", "3217": "But if here is any consciousness still existing in the world below, such was her love for you and her dutiful affection for all her family, that she certainly does not wish you to act as you are acting.", "3218": "Grant this to her-your lost one!", "3219": "Grant it to your friends and comrades who mourn with you in your sorrow!", "3220": "Grant it to your country, that if the need arises she may have the use of your services and advice.", "3221": "Finally-since we are reduced by fortune to the neces­ sity of taking precautions on this point also-do not allow anyone to think that you are not mourning so much for your daughter as for the state of public affairs and the victory of others.", "3222": "I am ashamed to say any more to you on this subject, lest I should appear to distrust your wisdom.", "3223": "There­ fore I will only make one suggestion before bringing my letter to an end.", "3224": "We have seen you on many occasions bear good fortune with a noble dignity which greatly en­ hanced your fame:", "3225": "now is the time for you to convince us that you are able to bear bad fortune equally well, and that it does not appear to you to be a heavier burden than you ought to think it.", "3226": "I would not have this to be the only one of all the virtues that you do not possess.", "3227": "As far as I am concerned, when I learn that your mind is more composed, I will write you an account of what is going on here, and of the condition of the province.", "3228": "Good-bye.", "3229": "YES, indeed, my dear Servius, I would have wished-as you say-that you had been by my side at the time of my grievous loss.", "3230": "How much help your presence might have given me, both by consolation and by your taking an almost equal share in my sorrow, I can easily gather from the fact that after reading your letter I experienced a great feeling of relief.", "3231": "For not only was what you wrote calculated to soothe a mourner, but in offering me consolation you manifested no slight sorrow of heart yourself.", "3232": "Yet, after all, your son Servius by all the kindness of which such a time admitted made it evident, both how much he person­ ally valued me, and how gratifying to you he thought such affection for me would be.", "3233": "His kind offices have of course often been pleasanter to me, yet never more acceptable.", "3234": "For myself again, it is not only your words and (I had almost said) your partnership in my sorrow that consoles me, it is your character also.", "3235": "For I think it a disgrace that I should not bear my loss as you—a man of such wisdom- think it should be borne.", "3236": "But at times I am taken by sur­ prise and scarcely offer any resistance to my grief, because those consolations fail me, which were not wanting in a similar misfortune to those others, whose examples I put before my eyes.", "3237": "For instance, Quintus Maximus, who lost a son who had been consul and was of illustrious character and brilliant achievements, and Lucius Paullus, who lost two within seven days, and your kinsman Gallus and M. Cato, who each lost a son of the highest character and valour,-all lived in circumstances which permitted their own great position, earned by their public services, to as­ suage their grief.", "3238": "In my case, after losing the honours which you yourself mention, and which I had gained by the greatest possible exertions, there was only that one solace left which has now been torn away.", "3239": "My sad musings were not interrupted by the business of my friends, nor by the management of public affairs:", "3240": "there was nothing I cared to do in the forum:", "3241": "I could not bear the sight of the senate- house;", "3242": "I thought-as was the fact-that I had lost all the fruits both of my industry and of fortune.", "3243": "But while I thought that I shared these losses with you and certain others, and while I was conquering my feelings and forcing myself to bear them with patience, I had a refuge, one bosom where I could find repose, one in whose conversation and sweet­ ness I could lay aside all anxieties and sorrows.", "3244": "But now, after such a crushing blow as this, the wounds which seemed to have healed break out afresh.", "3245": "For there is no republic now to offer me a refuge and a consolation by its good for­ tunes when I leave my home in sorrow, as there once was a home to receive me when I returned saddened by the state of public affairs.", "3246": "Hence I absent myself both from home and forum, because home can no longer console the sorrow which public affairs cause me, nor public affairs that which I suffer at home.", "3247": "All the more I look forward to your com­ ing, and long to see you as soon as possible.", "3248": "No reasoning can give me greater solace than a renewal of our inter­ course and conversation.", "3249": "However, I hope your arrival is approaching, for that is what I am told.", "3250": "For myself, while I have many reasons for wishing to see you as soon as possible, there is this one especially-that we may discuss beforehand on what principles we should live through this period of entire submission to the will of one man who is at once wise and liberal, far, as I think I perceive, from being hostile to me, and very friendly to you.", "3251": "But though that is so, yet it is a matter for serious thought what plans, I don't say of action, but of passing a quiet life by his leave and kindness, we should adopt.", "3252": "Good-bye.WELL, I have no reason after all to repent my formidable guest!", "3253": "For he made himself exceedingly pleasant.", "3254": "But on his arrival at the villa of Philippus on the evening of the second day of the Saturnalia, the villa was so choke full of soldiers that there was scarcely a dining-room left for Caesar himself to dine in.", "3255": "Two thousand men, if you please!", "3256": "I was in a great taking as to what was to happen the next day;", "3257": "and so Cassius Barba came to my aid and gave me guards.", "3258": "A camp was pitched in the open, the villa was put in a state of defence.", "3259": "He stayed with Philippus on the third day of the Saturnalia till one o'clock, without admitting anyone.", "3260": "He was engaged on his accounts, I think, with Balbus.", "3261": "Then he took a walk on the beach.", "3262": "After two he went to the bath.", "3263": "Then he heard about Mamurra without changing countenance.", "3264": "He was anointed:", "3265": "took his place at the table.", "3266": "He was under a course of emetics, and so ate and drank without scruple and as suited his taste.", "3267": "It was a very good dinner, and well served, and not only so, but \"Well cooked, well seasoned food, with rare discourse:", "3268": "A banquet in a word to cheer the heart.”", "3269": "Besides this, the staff were entertained in three rooms in a very liberal style.", "3270": "The freedmen of lower rank and the slaves had everything they could want.", "3271": "But the upper sort had a really recherché dinner.", "3272": "In fact, I shewed that I was somebody.", "3273": "However, he is not a guest to whom one would say, \"Pray look me up again on your way back.\"", "3274": "Once is enough.", "3275": "We didn't say a word about politics.", "3276": "There was plenty of literary talk.", "3277": "In short, he was pleased and enjoyed himself.", "3278": "He said he should stay one day at Puteoli, another at Baiæ.", "3279": "That's the story of the entertainment, or I might call it the billeting on me—trying to the temper, but not seriously inconvenient.", "3280": "I am staying on here for a short time and then go to Tusculum.", "3281": "When he was passing Dolabella's villa, the whole guard formed up on the right and left of his horse, and nowhere else.", "3282": "This I was told by Nicias.", "3283": "I HAVE come on a visit to the man, of whom J was talking to you this morning.", "3284": "His view is that \"the state of things is perfectly shocking:", "3285": "that there is no way out of the em­ broglio.", "3286": "For if a man of Caesar's genius failed, who can hope to succeed?\"", "3287": "In short, he says that the ruin is com­ plete.", "3288": "I am not sure that he is wrong;", "3289": "but then he rejoices in it, and declares that within twenty days there will be a rising in Gaul:", "3290": "that he has not had any conversation with anyone except Lepidus since the Ides of March:", "3291": "finally that these things can't pass off like this.", "3292": "What a wise man Oppius is, who regrets Caesar quite as much, but yet says nothing that can offend any loyalist!", "3293": "But enough of this.", "3294": "Pray don't be idle about writing me word of any­ thing new, for I expect a great deal.", "3295": "Among other things, whether we can rely on Sextus Pompeius;", "3296": "but above all about our friend Brutus, of whom my host says that Caesar was in the habit of remarking:", "3297": "\"It is of great importance what that man wishes;", "3298": "at any rate, whatever he wishes he wishes strongly\":", "3299": "and that he noticed, when he was pleading for Deiotarus at Nicæa, that he seemed to speak with great spirit and freedom.", "3300": "Also-for I like to jot down things as they occur to me—that when on the request of Sestius I went to Caesar's house, and was sitting waiting till I was called in, he remarked:", "3301": "\"Can I doubt that I am ex­ ceedingly disliked, when Marcus Cicero has to sit waiting and cannot see me at his own convenience?", "3302": "And yet if there is a good-natured man in the world it is he;", "3303": "still I feel no doubt that he heartily dislikes me.\"", "3304": "This and a good deal of the same sort.", "3305": "But to my purpose.", "3306": "Whatever the news, small as well as great, write and tell me of it.", "3307": "I will on my side let nothing pass.", "3308": "AT length a letter-carrier from my eon And, by Hercules, a letter elegantly expressed, shewing in itself some progress.", "3309": "Others also give me excellent reports of him.", "3310": "Leonides, however, still sticks to his favourite \"at present.\"", "3311": "But Herodes speaks in the highest terms of him.", "3312": "In short, r am glad

makes himself trouble­ some to the Buthrotians!", "3315": "I have drawn out a deposition which shall be signed and sealed whenever you please.", "3316": "As for the money of the Arpinates, if the ædile L. Fadius asks for it, pay him back every farthing.", "3317": "In a previous letter I mentioned to you a sum of no sestertia to be paid to Statics.", "3318": "If, then, Fadius applies for the money, I wish it paid to him, and to no one except Fadius.", "3319": "I think that amount was put into my hands, and I have written to Eros to pro­ duce it.", "3320": "I can't stand the Queen:", "3321": "and the voucher for her prom­ ises, Hammonius, knows that I have good cause for saying so.", "3322": "What she promised, indeed, were all things of the learned sort and suitable to my character-such as I could avow even in a public meeting.", "3323": "As for Sara, besides find­ ing him to be an unprincipled rascal, I also found him in­ clined to give himself airs to me.", "3324": "I only saw him once at my house.", "3325": "And when I asked him politely what I could do for him, he said that he had come in hopes of finding Atticus.", "3326": "The Queen's insolence, too, when she was living in Caesar's trans-Tiberine villa, I cannot recall without a pang.", "3327": "I won't have anything to do therefore with that lot.", "3328": "They think not so much that I have no spirit, as- that I have scarcely any proper pride at all.", "3329": "My leaving Italy is hindered by Eros's way of doing business.", "3330": "For whereas from the bal­ ances struck by him on the 5th of April I ought to be well off, I am obliged to borrow, while the receipts from those paying properties of mine I think have been put aside for building the shrine.", "3331": "But I have charged Tiro to see to all this, whom I am sending to Rome for the express purpose.", "3332": "I did not wish to add to your existing embarrassments.", "3333": "The steadier the conduct of my son, the more I am vexed at his being hampered.", "3334": "For he never mentioned the sub­ ject to me—the first person to whom he should have done so.", "3335": "But he said in a letter to Tiro that he had received nothing since the 1st of April-for that was the end of his financial year.", "3336": "Now I know that your own kind feeling always caused you to be of opinion that he ought to be treated not only with liberality, but with splendour and generosity, and that you also considered that to be due to my position.", "3337": "Where­ fore pray see—I would not have troubled you if I could have done it through anyone else-that he

doubled.", "3353": "Wherefore you may with confidence and assurance fulfil your promise of being the trumpeter of my reputation.", "3354": "For the errors of my youth have caused me so much remorse and suffering, that not only does my heart shrink from what I did, my very ears abhor the mention of it.", "3355": "And of this anguish and sorrow I know and am assured that you have taken your share.", "3356": "And I don't wonder at it!", "3357": "for while you wished me all success for my sake, you did so also for your own;", "3358": "for I have ever meant you to be my partner in all my

take pains to make his ac­ quaintance at the earliest possible opportunity.", "3366": "I need hardly mention Bruttius, whom I never allow to leave my side.", "3367": "He is a man of a strict and moral life, as well as being the most delightful company.", "3368": "For in him fun is not divorced from literature and the daily philosophical inquiries which we make in common.", "3369": "I have hired a

your letter on the character of Gorgias.", "3376": "The fact is, I found him very useful in my daily practice of declamation;", "3377": "but I subordinated everything to obeying my father's injunctions, for he had written ordering me to give him up at once.", "3378": "I wouldn't shilly-shally about the business, for fear my making a fuss should cause my father to har­ bour some suspicion.", "3379": "Moreover, it occurred to me that it would be offensive for me to express an opinion on a de­ cision of my father's.", "3380": "However, your interest and advice are welcome and acceptable.", "3381": "Your apology for lack of time I quite accept;", "3382": "for I know how busy you always are.", "3383": "I am very glad that you have bought an estate, and you have my best wishes for the success of your purchase.", "3384": "Don't be sur­ prised at my congratulations coming in at this point in my letter, for it was at the corresponding point in yours that you told me of your purchase.", "3385": "You are a man of property!", "3386": "You must drop your city manners:", "3387": "you have become a Ro­ man country-gentleman.", "3388": "How clearly I have your dearest face before my eyes at this moment!", "3389": "For I seem to see you buying things for the farm, talking to your bailiff, saving the seeds at dessert in the corner of your cloak.", "3390": "But as to the matter of money, I am as sorry as you that I was not on the spot to help you.", "3391": "But do not doubt, my dear Tiro, of my assisting you in the future, if fortune does but stand by me;", "3392":

remember my mother used to do.", "3402": "It was her custom to put a seal on wine-jars even when empty to prevent any being labelled empty that had been surreptitiously drained.", "3403": "In the same way, I beg you, even if you have nothing to write about, to write all the same, lest you be thought to have sought a cover for idleness:", "3404": "for I always find the news in your letters trustworthy and welcome.", "3405": "Love me, and good- bye.", "3406": "You have Messalla with you.", "3407": "What letter, therefore, can I write with such minute care as to enable me to explain to you what is being done and what is occurring in public affairs, more thoroughly than he will describe them to you, who has at once the most intimate knowledge of everything, and the talent for unfolding and conveying it to you in the best possible manner?", "3408": "For beware of thinking, Brutus -for though it is unnecessary for me to write to you what you know already, yet I cannot pass over in silence such eminence in every kind of greatness-beware of think­ ing, I say, that he has any parallel in honesty and firmness, care and zeal for the Republic.", "3409": "So much so that in him eloquence-in which he is extraordinarily eminent—scarcely seems to offer any opportunity for praise.", "3410": "Yet in this accom­ plishment itself his wisdom is made more evident;", "3411": "with such excellent judgment and with so much acuteness has he practised himself in the most genuine style of rhetoric.", "3412": "Such also is his industry, and so great the amount of midnight labour that he bestows on this study, that the chief thanks would not seem to be due to natural genius, great as it is in his case.", "3413": "But my affection carries me away:", "3414": "for it is not the purpose of this letter to praise Mesalla, especially to Brutus, to whom his excellence is not less known than it is to me, and these particular accomplishments of his which I am praising even better.", "3415": "Grieved as I was to let him go from my side, my one consolation was that in going to you who are to me a second self, he was performing a duty and following the path of the truest glory.", "3416": "But enough of this.", "3417": "I now come, after a long interval of time, to a certain letter of yours, in which, while paying me many compliments, you find one fault with me—that I was excessive and, as it were, extravagant in proposing votes of honour.", "3418": "That is your criticism:", "3419": "another's, perhaps, might be that I was too stern in inflicting punishment and exacting penalties, unless by chance you blame me for both.", "3420": "If that is so, I desire that my principle in both these things should be very clearly known to you.", "3421": "And I do not rely solely on the dictum of Solon, who was at once the wisest of the Seven and the only lawgiver among them.", "3422": "He said that a state was kept to­ gether by two things-reward and punishment.", "3423": "Of course there is a certain moderation to be observed in both, as in everything else, and what we may call a golden mean in both these things.", "3424": "But I have no intention to dilate on such an important subject in this place.", "3425": "But what has been my aim during this war in the motions I have made in the senate I think it will not be out of place to explain.", "3426": "After the death of Caesar and your ever memor­ able Ides of March, Brutus, you have not forgotten what I said had been omitted by you and your colleagues, and what a heavy cloud I declared to be hanging over the Republic.", "3427": "A great pest had been removed by your means, a great blot on the Roman people wiped out, immense glory in truth acquired by yourselves:", "3428": "but an engine for exercising kingly power had been put into the hands of Lepidus and Antony, of whom the former was the more fickle of the two, the latter the more corrupt, but both of whom dreaded peace and were enemies to quiet.", "3429": "Against these men, inflamed with the ambition of revolutionizing the state, we had no protecting force to oppose.", "3430": "For the fact of the matter was this:", "3431": "the state had become roused as one man to maintain its liberty;", "3432": "I at the time was even excessively warlike;", "3433": "you, perhaps with more wisdom, quitted the city which you had liberated, and when Italy offered you her services declined them.", "3434": "Accordingly, when I saw the city in the possession of parricides, and that neither you nor Cassius could remain in it with safety, and that it was held down by Antony's armed guards, I thought that I too ought to leave it:", "3435": "for a city held down by traitors, with all opportunity of giving aid cut off, was a shocking spectacle.", "3436": "But the same spirit as always had animated me, staunch to the love of country, did not admit the thought of a departure from its dangers.", "3437": "Accordingly, in the very midst of my voyage to Achaia, when in the period of the Etesian gales a south wind-as though remonstrating against my design-had brought me back to Italy, I saw you at Velia and was much distressed:", "3438": "for you were on the point of leav­ ing the country, Brutus—leaving it, I say, for our friends the Stoics deny that wise men ever \" flee.\"", "3439": "As soon as I reached Rome I at once threw myself in opposition to Antony's treason and insane policy:", "3440": "and having roused his wrath against me, I began entering upon a policy truly Brutus-like—for this is the distinctive mark of your family -that of freeing my country.", "3441": "The rest of the story is too long to tell, and must be passed over by me, for it is about myself.", "3442": "I will only say this much:", "3443": "that this young Caesar, thanks to whom we still exist, if we would confess the truth, was a stream from the fountain-head of my policy.", "3444": "To him I voted honours, none indeed, Brutus, that were not his due, none that were not inevitable.", "3445": "For directly we began the recovery of liberty, when the divine excellence of even Decimus Brutus had not yet bestirred itself sufficiently to give us an indication of the truth, and when our sole pro­ tection depended on the boy who had shaken Antony from our shoulders, what honour was there that he did not de­ serve to have decreed to him?", "3446": "However, all I then pro­ posed for him was a complimentary vote of thanks, and that too expressed with moderation.", "3447": "I also proposed a decree conferring imperium on him, which, although it seemed too great a compliment for one of his age, was yet necessary for one commanding an army-for what is an army without a commander with imperiumt Philippus proposed a statue;", "3448": "Servius at first proposed a license to stand for office before the regular time.", "3449": "Servilius afterwards proposed that the time should be still farther curtailed.", "3450": "At that time nothing was thought too good for him.", "3451": "But somehow men are more easily found who are liberal at a time of alarm, than grateful when victory has been won.", "3452": "For when that most joyful day of Decimus Brutus's relief from blockade had dawned on the Republic and happened also to be his birthday, I proposed that the name of Brutus should be entered in the fasti under that date.", "3453": "And in that I followed the example of our ancestors, who paid this honour to the woman Laurentia, at whose altar in the Velabrum you pontiffs are accustomed to offer service.", "3454": "And when I proposed this honor to Brutus I wished that there should be in the fasti an eternal memorial of a most welcome victory:", "3455": "and yet on that very day I discovered that the ill­ disposed in the senate were somewhat in a majority over the grateful.", "3456": "In the course of those same days I lavished honours-if you like that word-upon the dead Hirtius, Pansa, and even Aquila.", "3457": "And who has any fault to find with that, unless he be one who, no sooner an alarm is over, forgets the past danger?", "3458": "There was added to this grateful memorial of a benefit received some consideration of what would be for the good of posterity also;", "3459": "for I wished that there should exist some perpetual record of the popular execration of our most ruthless enemies.", "3460": "I suspect that the next step does not meet with your approbation.", "3461": "It was dis­ approved by your friends, who are indeed most excellent citizens, but inexperienced in public business.", "3462": "I mean my proposing an ovation for Caesar.", "3463": "For myself, however- though I am perhaps wrong, and I am not a man who be­ lieves his own way necessarily right—I think that in the course of this war I never took a more prudent step.", "3464": "The reason for this I must not reveal, lest I should seem to have a sense of favours to come rather than to be grateful for those received.", "3465": "I have said too much already:", "3466": "let us look at other points.", "3467": "I proposed honours to Decimus Brutus, and also to Lucius Plancus.", "3468": "Those indeed are noble spirits whose spur to action is glory:", "3469": "but the senate also is wise to avail itself of any means-provided that they are honourable -by which it thinks that a particular man can be induced to support the Republic.", "3470": "But—you say—I am blamed in re­ gard to Lepidus:", "3471": "for, having placed his statue on the rostra, I also voted for its removal.", "3472": "I tried by paying him a compliment to recall him from his insane policy.", "3473": "The in­ fatuation of that most unstable of men rendered my pru­ dence futile.", "3474": "Yet all the same more good was done by demolishing the statue of Lepidus, than harm by putting it up.", "3475": "Enough about honours;", "3476": "now I must say a few words about penalties.", "3477": "For I have gathered from frequent expres­ sions in your letters that in regard to those whom you have conquered in war, you desire that your clemency should be praised.", "3478": "I hold, indeed, that you do and say nothing but what becomes a philosopher.", "3479": "But to omit the punishment of a crime-for that is what \" pardoning \" amounts to-even if it is endurable in other cases, is mischievous in a war like this.", "3480": "For there has been no civil war, of all that have occurred in the state within my memory, in which there was not certain to be some form of constitution remaining, whichever of the two sides prevailed.", "3481": "In this war, if we are victorious, I should not find it easy to affirm what kind of constitution we are likely to have;", "3482": "if we are conquered, there will certainly never be any.", "3483": "I therefore proposed severe measures against Antony, and severe ones also against Lepidus, and not so much out of revenge as in order that I might for the present prevent unprincipled men by this terror from attacking their country, and might for the future establish a warning for all who were minded to imitate their infatuation.", "3484": "However, this proposal was not mine more than it was everybody's.", "3485": "The point in it which had the appearance of cruelty was that the penalty extended to the children who did not deserve any.", "3486": "But that is a thing of long standing and characteristic of all states.", "3487": "For instance, the children of Themistocles were in poverty.", "3488": "And if the same penalty attaches to citizens legally condemned in court, how could we be more indulgent to public enemies?", "3489": "What, moreover, can anyone say against me when he must confess that, had that man conquered, he would have been still more revenge­ ful towards me ?", "3490": "Here you have the principles which dictated my senatorial proposals, at any rate in regard to this class of honours and penalties.", "3491": "For, in regard to other matters, I think you have been told what opinions I have expressed and what votes I have given.", "3492": "But all this is not so very pressing.", "3493": "What is really pressing, Brutus, is that you should come to Italy with your army as soon as possible.", "3494": "There is the greatest anxiety for your arrival.", "3495": "Directly you reach Italy all classes will flock to you.", "3496": "For whether we win the victory-and we had in fact won a most glorious one, only that Lepidus set his heart on ruining everything and perishing himself with all his friends-there will be need of your counsel in establish­ ing some form of constitution.", "3497": "And even if there is still some fighting left to be done, our greatest hope is both in your personal influence and in the material strength of your army.", "3498": "But make haste, in God's name!", "3499": "You know the importance of seizing the right moment, and of rapidity.", "3500": "What pains I am taking in the interests of your sister's children, I hope you know from the letters of your mother and sister.", "3501": "In undertaking their cause I shew more regard to your affection, which is very precious to me, than, as some think, to my own consistency.", "3502": "But there is nothing in which I more wish to be and to seem consistent than in loving you.", "3503": "GAIUS PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS, usually known as Pliny the Younger, was born at Como in 62 A. D.", "3504": "He was only eight years old when his father Caecilius died, and he was adopted by his uncle, the elder Pliny, author of the Natural History.", "3505": "He was carefully educated, studying rhetoric under Quintilian and other famous teachers, and he became the most eloquent pleader of his time.", "3506": "In this and in much else he imitated Cicero, who had by this time come to be the recognized master of Latin style.", "3507": "While still young he served as military tribune in Syria, but he does not seem to have taken zealously to a soldier's life.", "3508": "On his return he entered politics under the Emperor Domitian;", "3509": "and in the year 100 A. D. was appointed consul by Trajan and ad­ mitted to confidential intercourse with that emperor.", "3510": "Later zvhile he was governor of Bithynia, he was in the habit of submitting every point of policy to his master, and the correspondence be­ tween Trajan and him, which forms the last part of the present selection, is of a high degree of interest, both on account of the subjects discussed and for the light thrown on the characters of the two men.", "3511": "He is supposed to have died about 113 A. D. Pliny's speeches are now lost, with the exception of one, a pane­ gyric on TrOjaM delivered in thanksgiving for the consulate.", "3512": "This, though diffuse and somewhat too complimentary for modern taste, became a model for this kind of composition.", "3513": "The others were mostly of two classes, forensic and political, many of the latter being, like Cicero's speech against Verres, impeachments of provincial governors for cruelty and extortion toward their subjects.", "3514": "In these, as in his public activities in general, he appears as a man of public spirit and integrity;", "3515": "and in his relations with his native town he was a thoughtful and munificent benefactor.", "3516": "The letters, on which to-day his fame mainly rests, were largely written with a view to publication, and were arranged by Pliny himself.", "3517": "They thus lack the spontaneity of Cicero’s impulsive ut­ terances, but to most modern readers who are not special students of Roman history they are even more interesting.", "3518": "They deal with a great variety of subjects:", "3519": "the description of a Roman villa;", "3520": "the charms of country life;", "3521": "the reluctance of people to attend authors' readings and to listen when they were present;", "3522": "a dinner party;", "3523": "legacy-hunting in ancient Rome;", "3524": "the acquisition of a piece of statuary;", "3525": "his love for his young wife;", "3526": "ghost stories;", "3527": "floating islands, a tame dolphin, and other marvels.", "3528": "But by far the best known are those describing the great eruption of Vesuvius in which his uncle perished, a martyr to scientific curi­ osity, and the letter to TrOjaM on his attempts to suppress Chris­ tianity in Bithynia, with Trajan's reply approving his policy.", "3529": "Taken altogether, these letters give an absorbingly vivid picture of the days of the early empire, and of the interests of a culti­ vated Roman gentleman of wealth.", "3530": "Occasionally, as in the last letters referred to, they deal with important historical events;", "3531": "but their chief value is in bringing before us, in somewhat the same manner as \"The Spectator\" pictures the England of the age of Anne, the life of a time which is not so unlike our own as its distance in years might indicate.", "3532": "And in this time by no means the least interesting figure is that of the letter-writer himself, with his vanity and self-importance, his sensibility and generous affection, his pedantry and his loyalty.y", "3533": "OU have frequently pressed me to make a select col­ lection of my Letters (if there really be any deserv­ ing of a special preference) and give them to the public.", "3534": "I have selected them accordingly;", "3535": "not, indeed, in their proper order of time, for I was not compiling a history;", "3536": "but just as each came to hand.", "3537": "And now I have only to wish that you may have no reason to repent

flowers of rhetoric of my favourite Marc-Tully, wherever I could with propriety step out of my direct road, to enjoy a more flowery path:", "3548": "for it was energy, not austerity, at which I aimed.", "3549": "I would not have you imagine by this that I am bespeaking your indulgence:", "3550": "on the contrary, to make your correcting pen more vigorous, I will confess that neither my friends nor myself are averse from the publication of this piece, if only you should join in the approval of what is perhaps my folly.", "3551": "The truth is, as I must publish something, I wish it might be this performance rather than any other, because it is already finished:", "3552": "(you hear the wish of laziness.)", "3553": "At all events, however, something I must publish, and for many

thoughts;", "3650": "next, it enabled me, by frequent dwelling upon them, to receive a perfect impression of their loveli­ ness, while it guarded at the same time against that re­ pentance which is sure to follow on an impulsive act of generosity.", "3651": "There arose also a further advantage from this method, as it fixed in me a certain habitual contempt of money.", "3652": "For, while mankind seem to be universally gov­ erned by an innate passion to accumulate wealth, the culti­ vation of a more generous affection in my own breast taught me to emancipate myself from the slavery of so predominant a principle:", "3653": "and I thought that my honest intentions would be the more meritorious as they should appear to proceed, not from sudden impulse, but from the dictates of cool and deliberate reflection.", "3654": "I considered, besides, that I was not engaging myself to exhibit public games or gladiatorial combats, but to establish an annual fund for the support and education of young men of good families but scanty means.", "3655": "The pleasures of the senses are so far from wanting the oratorical arts to recommend them that we stand in need of all the powers of eloquence to moderate and re­ strain rather than stir up their influence.", "3656": "But the work of getting anybody to cheerfully undertake the monotony and drudgery of education must be effected not by pay merely, but by a skilfully worked-up appeal to the emotions as well.", "3657": "If physicians find it expedient to use the most insinuating address in recommending to their patients a wholesome though, perhaps, unpleasant regimen, how much more occa­ sion had he to exert all the powers of persuasion who, out of regard to the public welfare, was endeavouring to recon­ cile it to a most useful though not equally popular bene­ faction?", "3658": "Particularly, as my aim was to recommend an institution, calculated solely for the benefit of those who were parents to men who, at present, had no children;", "3659": "and to persuade the greater number to wait patiently until they should be entitled to an honour of which a few only could immediately partake.", "3660": "But as at that time, when I attempted to explain and enforce the general design and benefit of my institution, I considered more the general good of my countrymen, than any reputation which might result to my­ self;", "3661": "so I am apprehensive lest, if I publish that piece, it may perhaps look as if I had a view rather to my own per­ sonal credit than the benefit of others.", "3662": "Besides, I am very sensible how much nobler it is to place the reward of virtue in the silent approbation of one's own breast than in the applause of the world.", "3663": "Glory ought to be the consequence, not the motive, of our actions;", "3664": "and although it happen not to attend the worthy deed, yet it is by no means the less fair for having missed the applause it deserved.", "3665": "But the world is apt to suspect that those who celebrate their own benefi­ cent acts performed them for no other motive than to have the pleasure of extolling them.", "3666": "Thus, the splendour of an action which would have been deemed illustrious if related by another is totally extinguished when it becomes the subject of one's own applause.", "3667": "Such is the disposition of mankind, if they cannot blast the action, they will censure its display;", "3668": "and whether you do what does not deserve par­ ticular notice, or set forth yourself what does, either way you incur reproach.", "3669": "In my own case there is a peculiar circumstance that weighs much with me:", "3670": "this speech was delivered not before the people, but the Decurii not in the forum, but the senate;", "3671": "I am afraid therefore it will look in­ consistent that I, who, when I delivered it, seemed to avoid popular applause, should now, by publishing this perform­ ance, appear to court it:", "3672": "that I, who was so scrupulous as not to admit even these persons to be present when I delivered this speech, who were interested in my benefaction, lest it might be suspected I was actuated in this affair by any am­ bitious views, should now seem to solicit admiration, by forwardly displaying it to such as have no other concern in my munificence than the benefit of example.", "3673": "These are the scruples which

him familiarly, and took some pains to gain his affection:", "3680": "though that, indeed, was not very difficult, for he is easy of access, unreserved, and actuated by those social principles he professes to teach.", "3681": "I should think myself extremely happy if I had as fully answered the expectations he, at that time, conceived of me, as he exceeds everything I had imagined of him.", "3682": "But, perhaps, I admire his excellencies more now than I did then, because I know better how to appreciate them;", "3683": "not that I sufficiently appreciate them even now.", "3684": "For as none but those who are skilled in painting, statuary, or the plastic art, can form a right judgment of any performance in those respective modes of representation, so a man must, himself, have made great advances in philosophy before he is capable of forming a just opinion of a philosopher.", "3685": "However, as far as I am qualified to determine, Euphrates is possessed of so many shining talents that he cannot fail to attract and impress the most ordinarily educated observer.", "3686": "He reasons with much force, acuteness, and elegance;", "3687": "and frequently rises into all the sublime and luxuriant eloquence of Plato.", "3688": "His style is varied and flowing, and at the same time so won­ derfully captivating that he forces the reluctant attention of the most unwilling hearer.", "3689": "For the rest, a fine stature, a comely aspect, long hair, and a large silver beard;", "3690": "circum­ stances which, though they may probably be thought trifling and accidental, contribute, however, to gain him much reverence.", "3691": "There is no affected negligence in his dress and appearance;", "3692": "his countenance is grave but not austere;", "3693": "and his approach commands respect without creating awe.", "3694": "Distinguished as he is by the perfect blamelessness of his life, he is no less so by the courtesy and engaging sweetness of his manner.",

lips;", "3697": "and even after the heart is con­ vinced, the ear still wishes to listen to the harmonious reasoner.", "3698": "His family consists of three children (two of which are sons), whom he educates with the utmost care.", "3699": "His father-in-law, Pompeius Julianus, as he greatly dis­ tinguished himself in every other part of his life, so par­ ticularly in this, that though he was himself of the highest rank in his province, yet, among many considerable matches, he preferred Euphrates for his son-in-law, as first in merit, though not in dignity.", "3700": "But why do I dwell any longer upon the virtues of a man whose conversation I am so unfortunate as not to have time sufficiently to enjoy?", "3701": "Is it to increase my regret and vexation that I cannot enjoy it?",

to console me, by affirming that, to be engaged in the public service, to hear and determine cases, to explain the laws, and administer justice, is a part, and the noblest part, too, of philosophy;",

business there is more fatiguing than pleasant.", "4139": "Trifling, inconsiderable cases, mostly;", "4140": "it is very seldom that anything worth speaking of, either from the importance of the question or the rank of the persons concerned, comes before them.", "4141": "There are very few lawyers either whom I take any pleasure in working with.", "4142": "The rest, a parcel of impudent young fellows, many of whom one knows nothing whatever about, come here to get some prac­ tice in speaking, and conduct themselves so forwardly and with such utter want of deference that my friend Attilius exactly hit it, I think, when he made the observation that \" boys set out at the bar with cases in the Court of the Hun­ dred as they do at school with Homer,\" intimating that at both places they begin where they should end.", "4143": "But in former times (so my elders tell me) no youth, even of the best families, was allowed in unless introduced by some person of consular dignity.", "4144":

in of their own free will.", "4145": "The audience at their heels are fit attendants upon such orators;", "4146": "a low rabble of hired mercenaries, supplied by contract.", "4147": "They get together in the middle of the court, where the dole is dealt round to them as openly as if they were in a dining-room:", "4148": "and at this noble price they run from court to court.", "4149": "The Greeks

"yet the dirty business al­ luded to increases every day.", "4151": "It was only yesterday two of my domestic officers, mere striplings, were hired to cheer somebody or other, at three denarii apiece:", "4152": "1 that is what the highest eloquence goes for.", "4153": "Upon these terms we fill as many benches as we please, and gather a crowd;", "4154": "this is how those rending shouts are raised, as soon as the individual standing up in the middle of the ring gives the signal.", "4155": "For, you must know, these honest fellows, who understand nothing of what is said, or, if they did, could not hear it, would be at a loss without a signal, how to time their applause:", "4156": "for many of them don't hear a syllable, and are as noisy as any of the rest.", "4157": "If, at any time, you should happen to be passing by when the court is sitting, and feel at all interested to know how any speaker is acquitting himself, you have no occasion to give yourself the trouble of getting up on the judge's plat­ form, no need to listen;", "4158": "it is easy enough to find out, for you may be quite sure he that gets most applause deserves it the least.", "4159": "Largius Licinus was the first to introduce this fashion;", "4160": "but then he went no farther than to go round and solicit an audience.", "4161": "I know, I remember hearing this from my tutor Quinctilian.", "4162": "\"I used,\" he told me, \"to go and hear Domitius Afer, and as he was pleading once before the Hundred in his usual slow and impressive manner, hearing, close to him, a most immoderate and unusual noise,

was that was speaking?", "4166": "He was told, Licinus.", "4167": "Upon which, he broke off the case, exclaiming, ' Eloquence is no more!' \" The truth is it had only begun to decline then, when in Afer's opinion it no longer existed:", "4168": "whereas now it is almost extinct.", "4169": "I am ashamed to tell you of the mincing and affected pronunci­ ation of the speakers, and of the shrill-voiced applause with which their effusions are received;", "4170": "nothing seems wanting to complete this sing-song performance except claps, or rather cymbals and tambourines.", "4171": "Howlings indeed (for I can call such applause, which would be indecent even in the theatre, by no other name) abound in plenty.", "4172": "Up to this time the interest of my friends and the consideration of my early time of life have kept me in this court, as I am afraid they might think I was doing it to shirk work rather than to avoid these indecencies, were I to leave it just yet:",

prefer the name) my Laurens:", "4176": "but you will cease to wonder when I acquaint you with the beauty of the villa, the advantages of its situation, and the extensive view of the sea-coast.", "4177": "It is only seventeen miles from Rome:", "4178": "so that when I have finished my business in town, I can pass my evenings here after a good satisfactory day's work.", "4179": "There are two different roads to it:", "4180": "if you go by that of Laurentum, you must turn off at the fourteenth mile-stone;", "4181": "if by Astia, at the eleventh.", "4182": "Both of them are sandy in places, which makes it a little heavier and longer by carriage, but short and easy on horseback.", "4183": "The landscape affords plenty of variety, the view in some places being closed in by woods, in others extending over broad meadows, where numerous flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, which the severity of the winter has driven from the mountains, fatten in the spring warmth, and on the rich pasturage.", "4184": "My villa is of a con­ venient size without being expensive to keep up.", "4185": "The court­ yard in front is plain, but not mean, through which you enter porticoes shaped into the form of the letter D, enclosing a small but cheerful area between.", "4186": "These make a capital retreat for bad weather, not only as they are shut in with windows, but particularly as they are sheltered by a pro­ jection of the roof.", "4187": "From the middle of these porticoes you pass into a bright pleasant inner court, and out of that into a handsome hall running out towards the sea-shore;", "4188": "so that when there is a south-west breeze, it is gently washed with the waves, which spend themselves at its base.", "4189": "On every side of this hall there are either folding-doors or windows equally large, by which means you have a view from the front and the two sides of three different seas, as it were:", "4190": "from the back you see the middle court, the portico, and the area;", "4191": "and from another point you look through the portico into the courtyard, and out upon the woods and dis­ tant mountains beyond.", "4192": "On the left hand of this hall, a little farther from the sea, lies a large drawing-room, and beyond that, a second of a smaller size, which has one window to the rising and another to the setting sun:", "4193": "this as well has a view of the sea, but more distant and agreeable.", "4194": "The angle formed by the projection of the dining-room with this draw­ in--room retains and intensifies the warmth of the sun, and this forms our winter quarters and family gymnasium, which is sheltered from all the winds except those which bring on clouds, but the clear sky comes out again before the warmth has gone out of the place.", "4195": "Adjoining this angle is a room forming the segment of a circle, the windows of which are so arranged as to get the sun all through the day:", "4196": "in the walls are contrived a sort of cases, containing a collection of authors who can never be read too often.", "4197": "Next to this is a bed-room, connected with it by a raised passage furnished with pipes, which supply, at a wholesome temperature, and distribute to all parts of this room, the heat they receive.", "4198": "The rest of this side of the house is appropriated to the use of my slaves and freedmen;", "4199": "but most of the rooms in it are respectable enough to put my guests into.", "4200": "In the opposite wing is a most elegant, tastefully fitted up bed-room;", "4201": "next to which lies another, which you may call either a large bed-room or a modified dining-room;", "4202": "it is very warm and light, not only from the direct rays of the sun, but by their reflection from the sea.", "4203": "Beyond this is a bed-room with an ante-room, the height of which renders it cool in summer, its thick walls warm in winter, for it is sheltered, every way from the winds.", "4204": "To this apartment another ante- room is joined by one common wall.", "4205": "From thence you enter into the wide and spacious cooling-room belonging to the bath, from the opposite walls of which two curved basins are thrown out, so to speak;", "4206": "which are more than large enough if you consider that the sea is close at hand.", "4207": "Ad­ jacent to this is the anointing-room, then the sweating­ room, and beyond that the bath-heating room:", "4208": "adjoining are two other little bath-rooms, elegantly rather than sumptu­ ously fitted up:", "4209": "annexed to them is a warm bath of wonder­ ful construction, in which one can swim and take a view of the sea at the same time.", "4210": "Not far from this stands the tennis-court, which lies open to the warmth of the afternoon sun.", "4211": "From thence you go up a sort of turret which has two rooms below, with the same number above, besides a dining-room commanding a very extensive look-out on to the sea, the coast, and the beautiful villas scattered along the shore line.", "4212": "At the other end is a second turret, containing a room that gets the rising and setting sun.", "4213": "Behind this is a large store-room and granary, and underneath, a spacious dining-room, where only the murmur and break of the sea can be heard, even in a storm:", "4214": "it looks out upon the garden, and the gestatio,1 running round the garden.", "4215": "The gestatio is bordered round with box, and, where that is de­ cayed, with rosemary:", "4216": "for the box, wherever sheltered by the buildings, grows plentifully, but where it lies open and exposed to the weather and spray from the sea, though at some distance from the latter, it quite withers up.", "4217": "Next the gestatio, and running along inside it, is a shady vine­ plantation, the path of which is so soft and easy to the tread that you may walk bare-foot upon it.", "4218": "The garden is chiefly planted with fig and mulberry trees, to which this soil is as favourable as it is averse from all others.", "4219": "Here is a dining- room, which, though it stands away from the sea enjoys the garden view which is just as pleasant:", "4220": "two apartments run round the back part of it, the windows of which look out upon the entrance of the villa, and into a fine kitchen-garden.", "4221": "From here extends an enclosed portico which, from its great length, you might take for a public one.", "4222": "It has a range of windows on either side, but more on the side facing the sea, and fewer on the garden side, and these, single windows and alternate with the opposite rows.", "4223": "In calm, clear, weather these are all thrown open;", "4224": "but if it blows, those on the weather side are closed, whilst those away from the wind can remain open without any inconvenience.", "4225": "Before this enclosed portico lies a terrace fragrant with the scent of violets, and warmed by the reflection of the sun from the portico, which, while it retains the rays, keeps away the north-east wind;", "4226": "and it is as warm on this side as it is cool on the side opposite:", "4227": "in the same way it is a protection against the wind from the south-west;", "4228": "and thus, in short, by means of its several sides, breaks the force of the winds, from whatever quarter they may blow.", "4229": "These are some of its winter advantages, they are still more appreciable in the summer time;", "4230": "for at that season it throws a shade upon the terrace during the whole of the forenoon, and upon the adjoining portion of the gestatio and garden in the after­ noon, casting a greater or less shade on this side or on that as the day increases or decreases.", "4231": "But the portico itself is coolest just at the time when the sun is at its hottest, that is, when the rays fall directly upon the roof.", "4232": "Also, by open­ ing the windows you let in the western breezes in a free current, which prevents the place getting oppressive with close and stagnant air.", "4233": "At the upper end of the terrace and por­ tico stands a detached garden building, which I call my favourite;", "4234": "my favourite indeed, as I put it up myself.", "4235": "It contains a very warm winter-room, one side of which looks down upon the terrace, while the other has a view of the sea, and both lie exposed to the sun.", "4236": "The bed-room opens on to the covered portico by means of folding-doors, while its win­ dow looks out upon the sea.", "4237": "On that side next the sea, and facing the middle wall, is formed a very elegant little recess, which, by means of transparent2 windows, and a curtain drawn to or aside, can be made part of the adjoining room, or separated from it.", "4238": "It contains a couch and two chairs:", "4239": "as you lie upon this couch, from where your feet are you get a peep of the sea;", "4240": "looking behind you see the neighbouring villas, and from the head you have a view of the woods:", "4241": "these three views may be seen either separately, from so many dif­ ferent windows, or blended together in one.", "4242": "Adjoining this is a bed-room, which neither the servants' voices, the murmur­ ing of the sea, the glare of lightning, nor daylight itself can penetrate, unless you open the windows.", "4243": "This profound tran­ quillity and seclusion are occasioned by a passage sepa­ rating the wall of this room from that of the garden, and thus, by means of this intervening space, every noise is drowned.", "4244": "Annexed to this is a tiny stove-room, which, by opening or shutting a little aperture, lets out or retains the heat from underneath, according as you require.", "4245": "Beyond this lie a bed-room and ante-room, which enjoy the sun, though obliquely indeed, from the time it rises, till the after­ noon.", "4246": "When I retire to this garden summer-house, I fancy myself a hundred miles away from my villa, and take especial pleasure in it at the feast of the Saturnalia,' when, by the licence of that festive season, every other part of my house resounds with my servants' mirth:", "4247": "thus I neither interrupt their amusement nor they my studies.", "4248": "Amongst the pleasures and conveniences of this situation, there is one drawback, and that is, the want of running water;", "4249": "but then there are wells about the place, or rather springs, for they lie close to the surface.", "4250": "And, altogether, the quality of this coast is remarkable;", "4251": "for dig where you may, you meet, upon the first turning up of the ground, with a spring of water, quite pure, not in the least salt, although so near the sea.", "4252": "The neighbouring woods supply us with all the fuel we require, the other necessaries Ostia furnishes.", "4253": "Indeed, to a moderate man, even the village (between which and my house there is only one villa) would supply all ordinary requirements.", "4254": "It has three public baths, which are a great convenience if it happen that friends come in unexpectedly, or make too short a stay to allow time in preparing my own.", "4255": "The whole coast is very pleasantly sprinkled with villas either in rows or de­ tached, which whether looking at them from the sea or the shore, present the appearance of so many different cities.", "4256": "The strand is, sometimes, after a long calm, perfectly smooth, though, in general, through the storms driving the waves upon it, it is rough and uneven.", "4257": "I cannot boast that our sea is plentiful in choice fish;", "4258": "however, it supplies us with capital soles and prawns;", "4259": "but as to other kinds of provisions, my villa aspires to excel even inland countries, particularly in milk:", "4260": "for the cattle come up there from the meadows in large numbers, in pursuit of water and shade.", "4261": "Tell me, now, have I not good reason for living in, staying in, loving, such a retreat, which, if you feel no appetite for, you must be morbidly attached to town ?", "4262": "And I only wish you would feel inclined to come down to it, that to so many charms with which my little villa abounds, it might have the very con­ siderable addition of your company to recommend it.", "4263": "Fare­ well.", "4264": "You advise me to read my late speech before an assem­ blage of my friends.", "4265": "I shall do so, as you advise it, though I have strong scruples.", "4266": "Compositions of this sort lose, I well know, all their force and fire, and even their very name almost, by a mere recital.", "4267": "It is the solemnity of the tribunal, the concourse of advocates, the suspense of the event, the fame of the several pleaders concerned, the different parties formed amongst the audience;", "4268": "add to this the gestures, the pacing, aye the actual running, to and fro, of the speaker, the body working1 in harmony with every inward emotion, that conspire to give a spirit and a grace to what he delivers.", "4269": "This is the reason that those who plead sitting, though they retain most of the advantages possessed by those who stand up to plead, weaken the whole force of their oratory.", "4270": "The eyes and hands of the reader, those important instruments of graceful elocution, being engaged, it is no wonder that the attention of the audience droops, without anything extrinsic to keep it up, no allurements of gesture to attract, no smart, stinging impromptus to enliven.", "4271": "To these general considerations I must add this particular disadvantage which attends the speech in question, that it is of the argumentative kind;", "4272": "and it is natural for an author to infer that what he wrote with labour will not be read with pleasure.", "4273": "For who is there so unprejudiced as not to prefer the attractive and sonorous to the sombre and unornamented in style?", "4274": "It is very unreasonable that there should be any distinction;", "4275": "however, it is certain the judges generally expect one style of pleading, and the audience another;", "4276": "whereas an auditor ought to be affected only by those parts which would espe­ cially strike him, were he in the place of the judge.", "4277": "Never­ the less it is possible the objections which lie against this piece may be surmounted in consideration of the novelty it has to recommend it:", "4278": "the novelty I mean with respect to us;", "4279": "for the Greek orators have a method of reasoning upon a different occasion, not altogether unlike that which I have employed.", "4280": "They, when they would throw out a law, as contrary to some former one unrepealed, argue by com­ paring those together;", "4281": "so I, on the contrary, endeavour to prove that the crime, which I was insisting upon as falling within the intent and meaning of the law relating to public extortions, was agreeable, not only to that law, but likewise to other laws of the same nature.", "4282": "Those who are ignorant of the jurisprudence of their country can have no taste for reasonings of this kind, but those who are not ought to be proportionably the more favourable in the judgments they pass upon them.", "4283": "I shall endeavour, there­ fore, if you persist in my reciting it, to collect as learned an audience as I can.", "4284": "But before you determine this point, do weigh impartially the different considerations I have laid before you, and then decide as reason shall direct;", "4285": "for it is reason that must justify you;", "4286": "obedience to your commands will be a sufficient apology for me.", "4287": "Farewell.", "4288": "GIVE me a penny, and I will tell you a story \"worth gold,\" or, rather, you shall hear two or three;", "4289": "for one brings to my mind another.", "4290": "It makes no difference with which I begin.", "4291": "Verania, the widow of Piso, the Piso, I mean, whom Galba adopted, lay extremely ill, and Regulus paid her a visit.", "4292": "By the way, mark the assurance of the man, visiting a lady who detested him herself, and to whose husband he was a declared enemy!", "4293": "Even barely to enter her house would have been bad enough, but he actually went and seated himself by her bed-side and began enquiring on what day and hour she was born.", "4294": "Being informed of these important particulars, he composes his countenance, fixes his eyes, mutters something to himself, counts upon his fingers, and all this merely to keep the poor sick lady in suspense.", "4295": "When he had finished, \"You are,\" he says, \"in one of your climacterics;", "4296": "however, you will

fice, and returns with the strongest assurances that the omens confirmed what he had promised on the part of the stars.", "4299": "Upon this the good woman, whose danger made her credulous, calls for her will and gives Regulus a legacy.", "4300": "She grew worse shortly after this;", "4301": "and in her last moments exclaimed against this wicked, treacherous, and worse than perjured wretch, who had sworn falsely to her by his own son's life.", "4302": "But imprecations of this sort are as common with Regulus as they are impious;", "4303": "and he continually devotes that unhappy youth to the curse of those gods whose vengeance his own frauds every day provoke.", "4304": "Velleius Blaesus, a man of consular rank, and remark­ able for his immense wealth, in his last illness was anxious to make some alterations in his will.", "4305": "Regulus, who had lately endeavoured to insinuate himself into his good graces, hoped to get something from the new will, and accordingly addresses himself to his physicians, and conjures them to exert all their skill to prolong the poor man's life.", "4306": "But after the will was signed, he changes his character, reversing his tone:", "4307": "\"How long,\" says he to these very same physicians, \"do you intend keeping this man in misery?", "4308": "Since you cannot preserve his life, why do you grudge him the happy release of death?\"", "4309":

rhetorical canon?", "4312": "If so, Regulus will supply you.", "4313": "You must know, then, that Aurelia, a lady of remarkable accomplishments, purposing to execute her will,1 had put on her smartest dress for the occasion.", "4314": "Regulus, who was present as a witness, turned to the lady, and \"Pray,\" says he, \"leave me these fine clothes.”", "4315": "Aurelia thought the man was joking:", "4316": "but he insisted upon it perfectly seriously, and, to be brief, obliged her to open her will, and insert the dress she had on as a legacy to him, watch­ ing as she wrote, and then looking over it to see that it was all down correctly.", "4317": "Aurelia, however, is still alive:", "4318": "though Regulus, no doubt, when he solicited this bequest, expected to enjoy it pretty soon.", "4319": "The fellow gets estates, he gets legacies, conferred upon him, as if he really deserved them!", "4320": "But why should I go on dwelling upon this in a city where wickedness and knavery have, for this time past, received, the same, do I say, nay, even greater encouragement, than modesty and virtue?", "4321": "Regulus is a glaring instance of this truth, who, from a state of poverty, has by a train of villainies acquired such immense riches that he once told me, upon consulting the omens to know how soon he should be worth sixty millions of ses­ terces,2 he found them so favourable as to portend he should possess double that sum.", "4322": "And possibly he may, if he continues to dictate wills for other people in this way:", "4323": "a sort of fraud, in my opinion, the most infamous

whom I would sooner choose for my model, for nothing can be more perfect in arrangement than his mode of life.", "4326": "I look upon order in human actions, especially at that advanced age, with the same sort of pleasure as I behold the settled course of the heavenly bodies.", "4327": "In young men, indeed, a little confusion and disarrangement is all well enough:", "4328": "but in age, when

interesting topic of conversation;", "4334": "if by himself, some book is read to him, sometimes when visitors are there even, if agreeable to the company.", "4335": "Then he has a rest, and after that either takes up a book or resumes his conversation in preference to reading.", "4336": "By-and-by he goes out for a drive in his carriage, either with his wife, a most admirable woman, or with

therefore of our mutual thanks, mine, for your giving me her, hers for your giving her me;", "4819": "for you have chosen us out, as it were, for each other.", "4820": "Farewell.", "4821": "LOOK here!", "4822": "The next time the court sits, you must, at all events, take your place there.", "4823": "In vain would your in­ dolence repose itself under my protection, for there is no absenting oneself with impunity.", "4824": "Look at that severe, deter­ mined, praetor, Licinius Nepos, who fined even a senator for the same neglect!", "4825": "The senator pleaded his cause in person, but in suppliant tone.", "4826": "The fine, it is true, was remitted, but sore was his dismay, humble his intercession, and he had to ask pardon.", "4827": "\"All praetors are not so severe as that,\" you will reply;", "4828": "you are mistaken—for though indeed to be the author and reviver of an example of this kind may be an act of severity, yet, once introduced, even lenity herself may fol­ low the precedent.", "4829": "Farewell.", "4830": "I HAVE brought you as a little present out of the country a query which well deserves the consideration of your ex­ tensive knowledge.", "4831": "There is a spring which rises in a neighbouring mountain, and running among the rocks is received into a little banqueting-room, artificially formed for that purpose, from whence, after being detained a short time, it falls into the Larian lake.", "4832": "The nature of this spring is extremely curious;", "4833": "it ebbs and flows regularly three times a day.", "4834": "The increase and decrease is plainly visible, and exceedingly interesting to observe.", "4835": "You sit down by the side of the fountain, and while you are taking a repast and drinking its water, which is extremely cool, you see it gradually rise and fall.", "4836": "If you place a ring, or anything else at the bottom, when it is dry, the water creeps gradually up, first gently washing, finally covering it entirely, and then little by little subsides again.", "4837": "If you wait long enough, you may see it thus alternately advance and recede three suc­ cessive times.", "4838": "Shall we say that some secret current of air stops and opens the fountain-head, first rushing in and check­ ing the flow and then, driven back by the counter-resistance of the water, escaping again;", "4839": "as we see in bottles, and other vessels of that nature, where, there not being a free and open passage, though you turn their necks perpendicularly or obliquely downwards, yet, the outward air obstructing the vent, they discharge their contents as it were by starts?", "4840": "Or, may not this small collection of water be successively con­ tracted and enlarged upon the same principle as the ebb and flow of the sea?", "4841": "Or, again, as those rivers which discharge themselves into the sea, meeting with contrary winds and the swell of the ocean, are forced back in their channels, so, in the same way, may there not be something that checks this fountain, for a time, in its progress?", "4842": "Or is there rather a certain reservoir that contains these waters in the bowels of the earth, and while it is recruiting its discharges, the stream in consequence flows more slowly and in less quantity, but, when it has collected its due measure, runs on again in its usual strength and fulness?", "4843": "Or lastly, is there I know not what kind of subterranean counterpoise, that throws up the water when the fountain is dry, and keeps it back when it is full?", "4844": "You, who are so well qualified for the enquiry, will examine into the causes of this wonderful phenomenon;", "4845": "it will be sufficient for me if I have given you an adequate description of it.", "4846": "Farewell.", "4847": "A SMALL legacy was lately left me, yet one more accept­ able than a far larger bequest would have been.", "4848": "How more acceptable than a far larger one?", "4849": "In this way.", "4850": "Pomponia Gratilla, having disinherited her son Assidius Curianus, appointed me of one of her heirs, and Sertorius Severus, of praetorian rank, together with several eminent Roman knights, co-heirs along with me.", "4851": "The son applied to me to give him my share of the inheritance, in order to use my name as an example to the rest of the joint-hetrs, but offered at the same time to enter into a secret agree­ ment to return me my proportion.", "4852": "I told him, it was by no means agreeable to my character to seem to act one way while in reality I was acting another, besides it was not quite honourable making presents to a man of his fortune, who had no children;", "4853": "in a word, this would not at all answer the purpose at which he was aiming, whereas, if I were to withdraw my claim, it might be of some service to him, and this I was ready and willing to do, if he could clearly prove to me that he was unjustly disinherited.", "4854": "\"Do then,\" he said, \"be my arbitrator in this case.\"", "4855": "After a short pause I answered him, \"I will, for I don't see why I should not have as good an opinion of my own impartial disinterestedness as you seem to have.", "4856": "But, mind, I am not to be prevailed upon to decide the point in question against your mother, if it should appear she had just reason for what she has done.\"", "4857": "\"As you please,\" he replied, \"which I am sure is always to act according to justice.\"", "4858": "I called in, as my assistants, Corellius and Frontinus, two of the very best lawyers Rome at that time afforded.", "4859": "With these in attendance, I heard the case in my own chamber.", "4860": "Curianus said everything which he thought would favour his pretensions, to whom (there being nobody but myself to defend the character of the deceased) I made a short reply;", "4861": "after which I retired with my friends to deliberate, and, being agreed upon our verdict, I said to him, \"Curi­ anus.", "4862": "it is our opinion that your conduct has justly drawn upon you your mother's displeasure.\"", "4863": "Sometime afterwards, Curianus commenced a suit in the Court of the Hundred against aN the co-heirs except myself.", "4864": "The day appointed for the trial approaching, the rest of the co-heirs were anxious to compromise the affair and have done with it, not out of any diffidence of their cause, but from a distrust of the times.", "4865": "They were apprehensive of what had hap­ pened to many others, happening to them, and that from a civil suit it might end in a criminal one, as there were some among them to whom the friendship of Gratilla and Rusticus might be extremely prejudicial:", "4866": "they therefore desired me to go and talk with Curianus.", "4867": "We met in the temple of Concord;", "4868": "\"Now supposing,\" I said, \"your mother had left you the fourth part of her estate, or even suppose she had made you sole heir, but had exhausted so much of the estate in legacies that there would not be more than fourth part remaining to you, could you justly complain?", "4869": "You ought to be content, therefore, if, being absolutely disinherited as you are, the heirs are willing to relinquish to you a fourth part, which however I will increase by contributing my proportion.", "4870": "You know you did not com­ mence any suit against me, and two years have now elapsed, which gives me legal and indisputable possession.", "4871": "But to induce you to agree to the proposals on the part of the other co-heirs, and that you may be no sufferer by the peculiar respect you shew me, I offer to advance my pro­ portion with them.\"", "4872": "The silent approval of my own con­ science is not the only result out of this transaction;", "4873": "it has contributed also to the honour of my character.", "4874": "For it is this same Curianus who has left me the legacy I have mentioned in the beginning of my letter, and I received it as a very notable mark of his approbation of my conduct, if I do not flatter myself.", "4875": "I have written and told you all this, because in all my joys and sorrows I am wont to look upon you as myself, and I thought it would be unkind not to communicate to so tender a friend whatever occasions me a sensible gratification;", "4876": "for I am not philosopher enough to be indifferent, when I think I have acted like an honour­ able man, whether my actions meet with that approval which is in some sort their due.", "4877": "Farewell.", "4878": "AMONG the many agreeable and obliging instances I have received of your friendship, your not concealing from me the long conversations which lately took place at your house concerning my verses, and the various judgments passed upon them (which served to prolong the talk,) is by no means the least.", "4879": "There were some, it seems, who did not disapprove of my poems in themselves, but at the same time censured me in a free and friendly way, for employing myself in composing and reciting them.", "4880": "I am so far, however, from desiring to extenuate the charge that I willingly acknowledge myself still more deserving of it, and confess that I sometimes amuse myself with writing verses of the gayer sort.", "4881": "I compose comedies, divert my­ self with pantomimes, read the lyric poets, and enter into the spirit of the most wanton muse, besides that, I indulge myself sometimes in laughter, mirth, and frolic, and, to sum up every kind of innocent relaxation in one word, I am a man.", "4882": "I am not in the least offended, though, at their low opinion of my morals, and that those who are ignorant of the fact that the most learned, the wisest, and the best of men have employed themselves in the same way, should be surprised at the tone of my writings:", "4883": "but from those who know what noble and numerous examples I follow, I shall, I am confident, easily obtain permission to err with those whom it is an honour to imitate, not only in their most serious occupations but their lightest triflings.", "4884": "Is it unbe­ coming me (I will not name any living example, lest I should seem to flatter), but is it unbecoming me to practise what became Tully, Calvus, Pollio, Messala, Hortensius, Brutus, Sulla, Catulus, Scaevola, Sulpitius, Varro, the Tor­ quati, Memmius, Gaetulicus, Seneca, Lucceius, and, within our own memory, Verginius Rufus?", "4885": "But if the examples of private men are not sufficient to justify me, I can cite Julius Caesar, Augustus, Nerva, and Tiberius Caesar.", "4886": "I for­ bear to add Nero to the catalogue, though I am aware that what is practised by the worst of men does not therefore degenerate into wrong:", "4887": "on the contrary, it still maintains its credit, if frequently countenanced by the best.", "4888": "In that number, Virgil, Cornelius Nepos, and prior to these, Ennius and Attius, justly deserve the most distinguished place.", "4889": "These last indeed were not senators, but goodness knows no distinction of rank or title.", "4890": "I recite my works, it is true, and in this instance I am not sure I can support myself by their examples.", "4891": "They, perhaps, might be satisfied with their own judgment, but I have too humble an opinion of mine to suppose my compositions perfect, because they appear so to my own mind.", "4892": "My reason then for reciting are, that, for one thing, there is a certain deference for one's au­ dience, which excites a somewhat more vigorous applica­ tion, and then again, I have by this means an opportunity of settling any doubts I may have concerning my performance, by observing the general opinion of the audience.", "4893": "In a. word, I have the advantage of receiving different hints from different persons:", "4894": "and although they should not declare their meaning in express terms, yet the expression of the countenance, the movement of the head, the eyes, the motion of a hand, a whisper, or even silence itself will easily dis­ tinguish their real opinion from the language of politeness.", "4895": "And so if any one of my audience should have the curiosity to read over the same performance which he heard me read, he may find several things altered or omitted, and perhaps too upon his particular judgment, though he did not say a single word to me.", "4896": "But I am not defending my conduct in this particular, as if I had actually recited my works in public, and not in my own house before my friends, a num­ erous appearance of whom has upon many occasions been held an honour, but never, surely, a reproach.", "4897": "Farewell.", "4898": "I AM deeply afflicted with the news I have received of the death of Fannius;", "4899": "in the first place, because I loved one so eloquent and refined, in the next, because I was accustomed to be guided by his judgment-and indeed he possessed great natural acuteness, improved by practice, rendering him able to see a thing in an instant.", "4900": "There are some circum­ stances about his death, which aggravate my concern.", "4901": "He left behind him a will which had been made a considerable time before his decease, by which it happens that his estate is fallen into the hands of those who had incurred his displeasure, whilst his greatest favourites are excluded.", "4902": "But what I particularly regret is, that he has left unfinished a very noble work in which he was employed.", "4903": "Notwith­ standing his full practice at the bar, he had begun a history of those persons who were put to death or banished by Nero, and completed three books of it.", "4904": "They are written with great elegance and precision, the style is pure, and preserves a proper medium between the plain narrative and the historical:", "4905": "and as they were very favourably received by the public, he was the more desirous of being able to finish the rest.", "4906": "The hand of death is ever, in my opinion, too untimely and sudden when it falls upon such as are employed in some immortal work.", "4907": "The sons of sensuality, who have no outlook beyond the present hour, put an end every day to all motives for living, but those who look for­ ward to posterity, and endeavour to transmit their names with honour to future generations by their works-to such, death is always immature, as it still snatches them from amidst some unfinished design.", "4908": "Fannius, long before his death, had a presentiment of what has happened:", "4909": "he dreamed one night that as he was lying on his couch, in an undress, all ready for his work, and with his desk,1 as usual, in front of him, Nero entered, and placing himself by his side, took up the three first books of this history, which he read through and then departed.", "4910": "This dream greatly alarmed him, and he regarded it as an intimation, that he should not carry on his history any farther than Nero had read, and so the event has proved.", "4911": "I cannot reflect upon this accident with­ out lamenting that he was prevented from accomplishing a work which had cost him so many toilsome vigils, as it suggests to me, at the same time, reflections on my own mortality, and the fate of my writings:", "4912": "and I am persuaded the same apprehensions alarm you for those in which you are at present employed.", "4913": "Let us then, my friend, while life permits, exert all our endeavours, that death, whenever it arrives, may find as little as possible to destroy.", "4914": "Farewell.THE kind concern you expressed on hearing of my design to pass the summer at my villa in Tuscany, and your oblig­ ing endeavours to dissuade me from going to a place which you think unhealthy, are extremely pleasing to me.", "4915": "It is quite true indeed that the air of that part of Tuscany which lies towards the coast is thick and unwholesome;", "4916": "but ray house stands at a good distance from the sea, under one of the Apennines which are singularly healthy.", "4917": "But, to re­ lieve you from all anxiety on my account, I will give you a description of the temperature of the climate, the situation of the country, and the beauty of my villa, which, I am persuaded, you will hear with as much pleasure as I shall take in giving it.", "4918": "The air in winter is sharp and frosty, so that myrtles, olives, and trees of that kind which delight in constant warmth, will not flourish here:", "4919": "but the laurel thrives, and is remarkably beautiful, though now and then the cold kills it-though not oftener than it does in the neighbourhood of Rome.", "4920": "The summers are extraordinarily mild, and there is always a refreshing breeze, seldom high winds.", "4921": "This accounts for the number of old men we have about, you would see grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those now grown up to be young men, hear old stories and the dialect of our ancestors, and fancy yourself born in some former age were you to come here.", "4922": "The character of the country is exceedingly beautiful.", "4923": "Picture to yourself an immense amphitheatre, such as nature only could create.", "4924": "Before you lies a broad, extended plain bounded by a range of mountains, whose summits are covered with tall and ancient woods, which are stocked with all kinds of game.", "4925": "The descending slopes of the mountains are planted with underwood, among which are a number of little risings with a rich soil, on which hardly a stone is to be found.", "4926": "In fruit- fulness they are quite equal to a valley, and though their harvest is rather later, their crops are just as good.", "4927": "At the foot of these, on the mountain-side, the eye, wherever it turns, runs along one unbroken stretch of vineyards ter­ initiated by a belt of shrubs.", "4928": "Next you have meadows and the open plain.", "4929": "The arable land is so stiff that it is necesr sary to go over it nine times with the biggest oxen and the strongest ploughs.", "4930": "The meadows are bright with flowers, and produce trefoil and other kinds of herbage as fine and tender as if it were but just sprung up, for all the soil is refreshed by never failing streams.", "4931": "But though there is plenty of water, there are no marshes;", "4932": "for the ground be­ ing on a slope, whatever water it receives without absorbing runs off into the Tiber.", "4933": "This river, which winds through the middle of the meadows, is navigable only in the winter and spring, at which seasons it transports the produce of the lands to Rome:", "4934": "but in summer it sinks below its banks, leaving the name of a great river to an almost empty channel:", "4935": "towards the autumn, however, it begins again to renew its claim to that title.", "4936": "You would be charmed by taking a view of this country from the top of one of our neighbouring mountains, and would fancy that not a real, but some im­ aginary landscape, painted by the most exquisite pencil, lay before you, such an harmonious variety of beautiful ob­ jects meets the eye, whichever way it turns.", "4937": "My house, although at the foot of a hill, commands as good a view as if it stood on its brow, yet you approach by so gentle and gradual a rise that you find yourself on high ground without perceiving you have been making an ascent.", "4938": "Behind, but at a great distance, is the Apennine range.", "4939": "In the calmest days we get cool breezes from that quarter, not sharp and cutting at all, being spent and broken by the long distance they have travelled.", "4940": "The greater part of the house has a southern aspect, and seems to invite the afternoon sun in summer (but rather earlier in the winter) into a broad and proportionately long portico, consisting of several rooms, particularly a court of antique fashion.", "4941": "In front of the portico is a sort of terrace, edged with box and shrubs cut into different shapes.", "4942": "You descend, from the terrace, by an easy slope adorned with the figures of animals in box, facing each other, to a lawn overspread with the soft, I had almost said the liquid, Acanthus:", "4943": "this is surrounded by a walk enclosed with evergreens, shaped into a variety of forms.", "4944": "Beyond it is the gestatio, laid out in the form of a circus running round the multiform box-hedge and the dwarf-trees, which are cut quite close.", "4945": "The whole is fenced in with a wall completely covered by box cut into steps all the way up to the top.", "4946": "On the outside of the wall lies a meadow that owes as many beauties to nature as all I have been describing within does to art;", "4947": "at the end of which are open plain and numerous other meadows and copses.", "4948": "From the extremity of the portico a large dining-room runs out, opening upon one end of the terrace, while from the windows there is a very extensive view over the meadows up into the country, and from these you also see the terrace and the projecting wing of the house together with the woods enclosing the adjacent hippodrome.", "4949": "Almost opposite the centre of the portico, and rather to the back, stands a sum­ mer-house, enclosing a small area shaded by four plane-trees, in the midst of which rises a marble fountain which gently plays upon the roots of the plane-trees and upon the grass- plots underneath them.", "4950": "This summer-house has a bed-room in it free from every sort of noise, and which the light itself can­ not penetrate, together with a common dining-room I use when I have none but intimate friends with me.", "4951": "A second portico looks upon this little area, and has the same view as the other I have just been describing.", "4952": "There is, besides, another room, which, being situate close to the nearest plane-tree, enjoys a constant shade and green.", "4953": "Its sides are encrusted with carved marble up to the ceiling, while above the marble a foliage is painted with birds among the branches, which has an effect altogether as agreeable as that of the carving, at the foot of which a little fountain, playing through several small pipes into a vase it encloses, produces a most pleasing murmur.", "4954": "From a corner of the portico you enter a very large bed-chamber opposite the large dining- room, which from some of its windows has a view of the terrace, and from others, of the meadow, as those in the front look upon a cascade, which entertains at once both the eye and the ear;", "4955": "for the water, dashing from a great height, foams over the marble basin which receives it below.", "4956": "This room is extremely warm in winter, lying much ex­ posed to the sun, and on a cloudy day the heat of an ad­ joining stove very well supplies his absence.", "4957": "Leaving this room, you pass through a good-sized, pleasant, undressing- room into the cold-bath-room, in which is a large gloomy bath:", "4958": "but if you are inclined to swim more at large, or in warmer water, in the middle of the area stands a wide basin for that purpose, and near it a reservoir from which you may be supplied with cold water to brace yourself again, if you should find you are too much relaxed by the warm.", "4959": "Adjoin­ ing the cold bath is one of a medium degree of heat, which enjoys the kindly warmth of the sun, but not so intensely as the hot bath, which projects farther.", "4960": "This last consists of three several compartments, each of different degrees of heat;", "4961": "the two former lie open to the full sun, the latter, though not much exposed to its heat, receives an equal share of its light.", "4962": "Over the undressing-room is built the tennis-court, which admits of different kinds of games and different sets of players.", "4963": "Not far from the baths is the staircase leading to the enclosed portico, three rooms inter­ vening.", "4964": "One of these looks out upon the little area with the four plane-trees round it, the other upon the meadows, and from the third you have a view of several vineyards, so that each has a different one, and looks towards a different point of the heavens.", "4965": "At the upper end of the enclosed portico, and indeed taken off from it, is a room that looks out upon the hippodrome, the vineyards, and the mountains;", "4966": "adjoining is a room which has a full exposure to the sun, especially in winter, and out of which runs another con­ necting the hippodrome with the house.", "4967": "This forms the front.", "4968": "On the side rises an enclosed portico, which not only looks out upon the vineyards, but seems almost to touch them.", "4969": "From the middle of this portico you enter a dining-room cooled by the wholesome breezes from the Apennine valleys:", "4970": "from the windows behind, which are ex­ tremely large, there is a close view of the vineyards, and from the folding doors through the summer portico.", "4971": "Along that side of the dining-room where there are no windows runs a private staircase for greater convenience in serving up when I give an entertainment;", "4972": "at the farther end is a sleeping-room with a look-out upon the vineyards, and (what is equally agreeable) the portico.", "4973": "Underneath this room is an enclosed portico resembling a grotto, which, enjoying in the midst of summer heats its own natural coolness, neither admits nor wants external air.", "4974": "After you have passed both these porticoes, at the end of the dining-room stands a third, which according as the day is more or less advanced, serves either for winter or summer use.", "4975": "It leads to two different apartments, one containing four chambers, the other, three, which enjoy by turns both sun and shade.", "4976": "This arrangement of the different parts of my house is exceed­ ingly pleasant, though it is not to be compared with the beauty of the hippodrome,1 lying entirely open in the middle of the grounds, so that the eye, upon your first entrance, takes it in entire in one view.", "4977": "It is set round with plane- trees covered with ivy, so that, while their tops flourish with their own green, towards the roots their verdure is borrowed from the ivy that twines round the trunk and branches, spreads from tree to tree, and connects them together.", "4978": "Be­ tween each plane-tree are planted box-trees, and behind these stands a grove of laurels which blend their shade with that of the planes.", "4979": "This straight boundary to the hippo­ drome alters its shape at the farther end, bending into a semicircle, which is planted round, shut in with cypresses, and casts a deeper and gloomier shade, while the inner cir­ cular walks (for there are several), enjoying an open exposure, are filled with plenty of roses, and correct, by a very pleasant contrast, the coolness of the shade with the warmth of the sun.", "4980": "Having passed through these several winding alleys, you enter a straight walk, which breaks out into a variety of others, partitioned off by box-row hedges.", "4981": "In one place you have a little meadow, in another the box is cut in a thousand different forms, sometimes into letters, expressing the master's name, sometimes the artificer's, whilst here and there rise little obelisks with fruit-trees alter­ nately intermixed, and then on a sudden, in the midst of this elegant regularity, you are surprised with an Imitation of the negligent beauties of rural nature.", "4982": "In the centre of this lies a spot adorned with a knot of dwarf plane-trees.", "4983": "Beyond these stands art acacia, smooth and bending in places, then again various other shapes and names.", "4984": "At the upper end is an alcove of white marble, shaded with vines and supported by four small Carystian columns.", "4985": "From this semicircular couch, the water, gushing up through several little pipes, as though pressed out by the weight of the persons who recline themselves upon it, falls into a stone cistern underneath, from whence it is received into a fine polished marble basin, so skilfully contrived that it is al­ ways full without ever Overflowing.", "4986": "When I sup here, this basin serves as a table, the larger sort of dishes being placed round the margin, while the smaller ones swim about in the form of vessels and water-fowl.", "4987": "Opposite this is a fountain which is incessantly emptying and filling, for the water which it throws up to a great height, falling back again into it, is by means of consecutive apertures returned as fast as it is received.", "4988": "Facing the alcove (and reflecting upon it as great an ornament as it borrows from it) stands a summer-house of exquisite marble, the doors of which pro­ ject and open into a green enclosure, while from its upper and lower windows the eye falls upon a variety of different greens.", "4989": "Next to this is a little private closet (which, though it seems distinct, may form part of the same room), furnished with a couch, and notwithstanding it has windows on every side, yet it enjoys a very agreeable gloom, by means of a spreading vine which climbs to the top, and entirely overshadows it.", "4990": "Here you may lie and fancy your­ self in a wood, with this only difference, that you are not exposed to the weather as you would be there.", "4991": "Here too a fountain rises and instantly disappears-several marble seats are set in different places, which are as pleasant as the summer-house itself after one is tired out with walking.", "4992": "Near each is a little fountain, and throughout the whole hippodrome several small rills run murmuring along through pipes, wherever the hand of art has thought proper to con­ duct them, watering here and there different plots of green, and sometimes all parts at once.", "4993": "I should have ended before now, for fear of being too chatty, had I not proposed in this letter to lead you into every corner of my house and gardens.", "4994": "Nor did I apprehend your thinking it a trouble to read the description of a place which I feel sure would please you were you to see it;", "4995": "especially as you can stop just when you please, and by throwing aside my letter, sit down as it were, and give yourself a rest as often as you think proper.", "4996": "Besides, I gave my little passion indulgence, for I have a passion for what I have built, or finished, myself.", "4997": "In a word, (for why should I conceal from my friend either my deliberate opinion or my prejudice?)", "4998": "I look upon it as the first duty of every writer to frequently glance over his title-page and consider well the subject he has proposed to himself;", "4999": "and he may be sure, if he dwells on his subject, he cannot justly be thought tedious, whereas if, on the contrary, he introduces and drags in anything irrelevant, he will be thought exceedingly so.", "5000": "Homer, you know, has employed many verses in the description of the arms of Achilles, as Virgil has also in those of Aeneas, yet neither of them is prolix, because they each keep within the limits of their original design.", "5001": "Aratus, you observe, is not considered too circumstantial, though he traces and enumerates the minutest stars, for he does not go out of his way for that purpose, but only follows where his subject leads him.", "5002": "In the same way (to compare small things with great), so long as, in endeav­ ouring to give you an idea of my house, I have not intro­ duced anything irrelevant or superfluous, it is not my letter which describes, but my villa which is described, that is to be considered large.", "5003": "But to return to where I

sea;", "5259": "she earnestly en­ treated him therefore to come to her assistance.", "5260": "He ac­ cordingly changed his first intention, and what he had begun from a philosophical, he now carries out in a noble and generous spirit.", "5261": "He ordered the galleys to be put to sea, and went himself on board with an intention of assisting not only Rectina, but the several other towns which lay thickly strewn along that beautiful coast.", "5262": "Hastening then to the place from whence others fled with the utmost terror, he steered his course direct to the point of danger, and with so much calmness and presence of mind as to be able to make and dictate his observations upon the motion and all the phenomena of that dreadful scene.", "5263": "He was now so close to the mountain that the cinders, which grew thicker and hotter the nearer he approached, fell into the ships, together with pumice-stones, and black pieces of burning rock:", "5264": "they were in danger too not only of being a-ground by the sudden retreat of the sea, but also from the vast fragments which rolled down from the mountain, and obstructed all the shore.", "5265": "Here he stopped to consider whether he

in actual danger, yet being within sight of it, and in­ deed extremely near, if it should in the least increase, he was determined to put to sea as soon as the wind, which was blowing dead in-shore, should go down.", "5271": "It was favour­ able, however, for carrying my uncle to Pomponianus, whom he found in the greatest consternation:", "5272": "he embraced him tenderly, encouraging and urging him to keep up his spirits, and, the more effectually to soothe his fears by seeming unconcerned himself, ordered a bath to be got ready, and then, after having bathed, sat down to supper with great cheerfulness, or at least (what is just as heroic) with every appearance of it.", "5273": "Meanwhile broad flames shone out in several places from Mount Vesuvius, which the darkness of the night contributed to render still brighter and clearer.", "5274": "But my uncle, in order to soothe the apprehensions of his friend, assured him it was only the burning of the villages, which the country people had abandoned to the flames:", "5275": "after this he retired to rest, and it is most certain he was so little disquieted as to fall into a sound sleep:", "5276": "for his breath­ ing, which, on account of his corpulence, was rather heavy and sonorous, was heard by the attendants outside.", "5277": "The court which led to his apartment being now almost filled with stones and ashes, if he had continued there any time longer, it would have been impossible for him to have made his way out.", "5278": "So he was awoke and got up, and went to Pomponianus and the rest of his company, who

threatened destruction.", "5281": "In this choice of dan­ gers they resolved for the fields:", "5282": "a resolution which, while the rest of the company were hurried into by their fears, my uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate consideration.", "5283": "They went out then, having pillows tied upon their heads with napkins;", "5284": "and this was their whole defence against the storm of stones that fell round them.", "5285": "It was now day every­ where else, but there a deeper darkness prevailed than in the thickest night;", "5286": "which however was in some degree alle­ viated by torches and other lights of various kinds.", "5287": "They thought proper to go farther down upon the shore to see if they might safely put out to sea, but found the waves still running extremely high, and boisterous.", "5288": "There my uncle, laying himself down upon a sail cloth, which was spread for him, called twice for some cold water, which he drank, when immediately the flames, preceded by a strong whiff of sulphur, dispersed the rest of the party, and obliged him to rise.", "5289": "He raised himself up with the assistance of two of his servants, and instantly fell down dead;", "5290": "suffocated, as I conjecture, by some gross and noxious vapour, having always had a weak throat, which was often inflamed.", "5291": "As soon as it was light again, which was not till

uncle having left us, I spent such time as was left on my studies (it was on their account indeed that I had stopped behind), till it was time for my bath.", "5301": "After which I went to supper, and

suggestion seems more prudent than its own) pressed on us in dense array to drive us forward as we came out.", "5314": "Being at a convenient distance from the houses, we stood still, in the midst of a most dan­ gerous and dreadful scene.", "5315": "The chariots, which we had ordered to be drawn out, were so agitated backwards and forwards, though upon the most level ground, that we could not keep them steady, even by supporting them with large stones.", "5316": "The sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks by the convulsive motion of the earth;", "5317": "it is

task, I own, thus to re-enflame the mind after the first heat is over, to recover an impulse when its force has been checked and spent, and, worse than all, to put new limbs into a body already

coming out of the ship, the same figure met him upon the shore.", "5719": "It is certain, at least, that being seized with a fit of illness, though there were no symptoms in his case that led those about him to despair, he instantly gave up all hope of recovery;", "5720": "judg­ ing, apparently, of the truth of the future part of the pre­ diction by what had already been fulfilled, and of the approaching misfortune from his former prosperity.", "5721": "Now the following story, which I am going to tell you just as I heard it, is it not more terrible than the former, while quite as wonderful?", "5722": "There was at Athens a large and roomy house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live there.", "5723": "In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees:", "5724": "immediately af­ terwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands.", "5725": "The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imag­ inable.", "5726": "This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued.", "5727": "Even in the day time, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm.", "5728": "Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable;", "5729": "so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost.", "5730": "How­ ever, in hopes that some tenant might be found who was ignorant of this very alarming circumstance, a bill was put up, giving notice that it was either to be let or sold.", "5731": "It happened that Athenodorus1 the philosopher came to Athens at this time, and, reading the bill, enquired the price.", "5732": "The extraordinary cheapness raised his suspicion;", "5733": "nevertheless, when he heard the whole story, he was so far from being discouraged that he was more strongly inclined to hire it, and, in short, actually did so.", "5734": "When it grew towards even­ ing, he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in the front part of the house, and, after calling for a light, together with his pencil and tablets, directed all his people to retire.", "5735": "But that his mind might not, for want of employment, be open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and spirits, he applied himself to writing with the utmost attention.", "5736": "The first part of the night passed in entire silence, as usual;", "5737": "at length a clanking of iron and rattling of chains was heard:", "5738": "however, he neither lifted up his eyes nor laid down his pen, but in order to keep calm and collected tried to pass the sounds off to himself as something else.", "5739": "The noise in­ creased and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door, and at last in the chamber.", "5740": "He looked up, saw, and recognized the ghost exactly as it had been described to him:", "5741": "it stood before him, beckoning with the finger, like a person who calls another.", "5742": "Athenodorus in reply made a sign with his hand that it should wait a little, and threw his eyes again upon his papers;", "5743": "the ghost then rattled its chains over the bead of the philosopher, who looked up upon this, and seeing it beckoning as before, immediately arose, and, light in hand, followed it.", "5744": "The ghost slowly stalked along, as if encumbered with its chains, and, turning into the area of the house, suddenly vanished.", "5745": "Athenodorus, being thus deserted, made a mark with some grass and leaves on the spot where the spirit left him.", "5746": "The next day he gave in­ formation to the magistrates, and advised them to order that spot to be dug up.", "5747": "This was accordingly done, and the skeleton of a man in chains was found there;", "5748": "for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters.", "5749": "The bones being collected together were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.", "5750": "This story I believe upon the credit of others;", "5751": "what I am going to mention, I give you upon my own.", "5752": "I have a freedman named Marcus, who is by no means illiterate.", "5753": "One night, as he and his younger brother were lying together, he fancied he saw somebody upon his bed, who took out a pair of scissors, and cut off the hair from the top part of his own head, and in the morning, it appeared his hair was actually cut, and the clippings lay scattered about the floor.", "5754": "A short time after this, an event of a similar nature contributed to give credit to the former story.", "5755": "A young lad of my family was sleeping in his apart­ ment with the rest of his companions, when two persons clad in white came in, as he says, through the windows, cut off his hair as he lay, and then returned the same way they entered.", "5756": "The next morning it was found that this boy had been served just as the other, and there was the hair again, spread about the room.", "5757": "Nothing remarkable indeed fol­ lowed these events, unless perhaps that I escaped a pro­ secution, in which, if Domitian (during whose reign this happened) had lived some time longer, I should certainly have been involved.", "5758": "For after the death of that emperor, articles of impeachment against me were found in his scrutore, which had been exhibited by Carus.", "5759": "It may there­ fore be conjectured, since it is customary for persons under any public accusation to let their hair grow, this

usual, balance between two opinions, yet I hope you will lean more on one side than on the other, lest, whilst I consult you in order to have my doubt settled, you should dismiss me in the same suspense and indecision that occasioned you the present application.", "5764": "Farewell.", "5765": "You tell me certain persons have blamed me in your com­ pany, as being upon all occasions too lavish in the praise I give my friends.", "5766": "I not only acknowledge the charge, but glory in it;", "5767": "for can there be a nobler error than an over­ flowing benevolence?", "5768": "But

Boebius Massa.", "5779": "He was condemned, and the house ordered his effects to be seized into the hands of the public officer.", "5780": "Shortly after, Senecio, having learnt that the consuls intended to sit to hear petitions, came and said to me, \"Let us go together, and petition them with the same unanimity in which we executed the office which had been enjoined us, not to suffer

opinion, and went over to the party for exile:", "5950": "fearing perhaps, if the votes were taken separately (which he saw would be the case), the freed­ men would be acquitted:", "5951": "for the numbers were far greater on that side than on either of the other two, separately counted.", "5952": "The consequence was that those who had been influenced by his authority, when they saw themselves forsaken by his going over to the other party, gave up a motion which they found abandoned by the first proposer, and deserted, as it were, with their leader.", "5953": "Thus the three opinions were re­ solved at length into two;", "5954": "and of those two, one prevailed, and the other was rejected;", "5955": "while the third, as it was not powerful enough to conquer both the others, had only to choose to which of the two it would yield.", "5956": "Farewell.THE sickness lately in my family, which has carried off several of my servants, some of them, too, in the prime of their years, has been a great affliction to me.", "5957": "I have two consolations, however, which, though by no means equiva­ lent to such a grief, still are consolations.", "5958": "One is, that as I have always readily manumitted my slaves, their death does not seem altogether immature, if they lived long enough to receive their freedom:", "5959": "the other, that I have allowed them to make a kind of will,1 which I observe as religiously as if they were legally entitled to that privilege.", "5960": "I receive and obey their last requests and injunctions as so many authoritative commands, suffering them to dispose of their effects to whom they please;", "5961": "with this single restriction, that they leave them to some one in my household, for to slaves the house they are in is a kind of state and com­ monwealth, so to speak.", "5962": "But though I endeavor to ac­ quiesce under these reflections, yet the same tenderness which led me to show them these indulgences weakens and gets the better of me.", "5963": "However, I would not wish on that account to become harder:", "5964": "though the generality of the world, I know, look upon losses of this kind in no other view than as a diminution of their property, and fancy, by cherishing such an unfeeling temper, they show a superior fortitude and philosophy.", "5965": "Their fortitude and philosophy I will not dispute.", "5966": "But humane, I am sure, they are not;", "5967": "for it is the very criterion of true manhood to feel those impressions of sorrow which it endeavors to resist, and to admit not to be above the want of consolation.", "5968": "But perhaps I have de­ tained you too long upon this subject, though not so long as I would.", "5969": "There is a certain pleasure even in giving vent to one's grief;", "5970": "especially when we weep on the bosom of a friend who will approve, or, at least, pardon, our tears.", "5971": "Farewell.", "5972": "Is the weather with you as rude and boisterous as it is with us?", "5973": "All here is in tempest and inundation.", "5974": "The Ti­ ber has swelled its channel, and overflowed its banks far and wide.", "5975": "Though the wise precaution of the emperor had guarded against this evil, by cutting several outlets to the river, it has nevertheless flooded all the fields and valleys and entirely overspread the whole face of the flat country.", "5976": "It seems to have gone out to meet those rivers which it used to receive and carry off in one united stream, and has driven them back to deluge those countries it could not reach itself.", "5977": "That most delightful of rivers, the Anio, which seems invited and detained in its course by the villas built along its banks, has almost entirely rooted up and carried away the woods which shaded its borders.", "5978": "It has overthrown whole mountains, and, in endeavouring to find a passage through the mass of ruins that obstructed its way, has forced down houses, and risen and spread over the de­ solation it has occasioned.", "5979": "The inhabitants of the hill COWl­ tries, who are situated above the reach of this inundation, have been the melancholy spectators of its dreadful effects, having seen costly furniture, instruments of husbandry, ploughs, and oxen with their drivers, whole herds of cattle, together with the trunks of trees, and beams of the neigh­ bouring villas, floating about in different parts.", "5980": "Nor indeed have these higher places themselves, to which the waters could not reach up, escaped the calamity.", "5981": "A continued heavy rain and tempestuous hurricane, as destructive as the river itself, poured down upon them, and has destroyed all the enclosures which divided that fertile country.", "5982": "It has damaged likewise, and even overturned, some of the public buildings, by the fall of which great numbers have been maimed, smothered, bruised.", "5983": "And thus lamentation over the fate of friends has been added to losses.", "5984": "I am extremely uneasy lest this extensive ruin should have spread to you:", "5985": "I beg therefore, if it has not, you will immediately relieve my anxiety;", "5986": "and indeed I desire you would inform me though it should have done so;", "5987": "for the difference is not great between fearing a danger, and feeling it;", "5988": "except that the evil one feels has some bounds, whereas one's ap­ prehensions have none.", "5989": "For we can suffer no more than what actually has happened but we fear all that possibly could happen.", "5990": "Farewell.THE common notion is certainly quite a false one, that a man's will is a kind of mirror in which we may clearly discern his real character, for Domitius Tullus appears a much better man since his death than he did during his lifetime.", "5991": "After having artfully encouraged the expectations of those who paid court to him, with a view to being his heirs, he has left his estate to his niece whom he adopted.", "5992": "He has given likewise several very considerable legacies among his grandchildren, and also to his great-grandson.", "5993": "In a word, he has shown himself a most kind relation throughout his whole will;", "5994": "which is so much the more to be admired as it was not expected of him.", "5995": "This affair has been very much talked about, and various opinions ex­ pressed:", "5996": "some call him false, ungrateful, and forgetful, and, while thus railing at him in this way as if they were actually disinherited kindred, betray their own dishonest designs:", "5997": "others, on the contrary, applaud him extremely for having disappointed the hopes of this infamous tribe of men, whom, considering the disposition of the times, it is but prudence to deceive.", "5998": "They add that he was not at liberty to make any other will, and that he cannot so properly be said to have bequeathed, as returned, his estate to his adopted daughter, since it was by her means it came to him.", "5999": "For Curtilius Mancia, whose daughter Domitius Lucanus, brother to this Tullus, married, having taken a dislike to his son-in-law, made this young lady (who was the issue of that marriage) his heiress, upon condition that Lucanus her father would emancipate her.", "6000": "He accordingly did so, but she being after­ wards adopted by Tullus, her uncle, the design of Mancia's will was entirely frustrated.", "6001": "For these two brothers having never divided their patrimony, but living together as joint- tenants of one common estate, the daughter of Lucanus, not­ withstanding the act of emancipation, returned back again, together with her large fortune, under the dominion of her father, by means of this fraudulent adoption.", "6002": "It seems in­ deed to have been the fate of these two brothers to be en­ riched by those who had the greatest aversion to them.", "6003": "For Domitius Afer, by whom they were adopted, left a will in their favour, which he had made eighteen years before his death;", "6004": "though it was plain he had since altered his opinion with regard to the family, because he was instrumental in procuring the confiscation of their father's estate.", "6005": "There is something extremely singular in the resentment of Afer, and the good fortune of the other two;", "6006": "as it was very extraordi­ nary, on the one hand, that Domitius should endeavour to extirpate from the privileges of society a man whose chil­ dren he had adopted, and, on the other, that these brothers should find a parent in the very person that ruined their father.", "6007": "But Tullus acted justly, after having been appointed sole heir by his brother, in prejudice to his own daughter, to make her amends by transferring to her this estate, which came to him from Afer, as well as all the rest which he had gained in partnership with his brother.", "6008": "His will there­ fore deserves the higher praise, having been dictated by nature, justice, and sense of honour;", "6009": "in which he has returned his obligations to his several relations, according to their respective good offices towards him, not forgetting his wife, having bequeathed to that excellent woman, who patiently endured much for his sake, several delightful villas, besides a large sum of money.", "6010": "And indeed she de­ served so much the more at his hands, in proportion to the displeasure she incurred on her marriage with him.", "6011": "It was thought unworthy a person of her birth and repute, so long left a widow by her former husband, by whom she had issue, to marry, in the decline of her life, an old man, merely for his wealth, and who was so sickly and infirm that, even had he passed the best years of his youth and health with her, she might well have been heartily tired of him.", "6012": "He had so entirely lost the use of all his limbs that he could not move himself in bed without assistance;", "6013": "and the only enjoy­ ment he had of his riches was to contemplate them.", "6014": "He was even (sad and disgusting to relate) reduced to the necessity of having his teeth washed and scrubbed by others:", "6015": "in allusion to which he used frequently to say, when he was complaining of the indignities which his infirmities obliged him to suffer, that he was every day compelled to lick his servant's fingers.", "6016": "Still, however, he lived on, and was will­ ing to accept of life upon such terms.", "6017": "That he lived so long as he did was particularly owing, indeed, to the care of his wife, who, whatever reputation she might lose at first by her marriage, acquired great honour by her unwearied devotion as his wife.-", "6018": "Thus I have given you all the news of the town, where nothing is talked of but Tullus.", "6019": "It is expected his curiosities will shortly be sold by auction.", "6020": "He had such an abundant collection of very old statues that he actually filled an extensive garden with them, the very same day he purchased it;", "6021": "not to mention numberless other antiques, lying neglected in his lumber-room.", "6022": "If you have anything worth telling me in return, I hope you will not refuse the trouble of writing to me:", "6023": "not only as we are all of us natu­ rally fond, you know, of news, but because example has a very beneficial influence upon our own conduct.", "6024": "Farewell.", "6025": "THOSE works of art or nature which are usually the motives of our travels are often overlooked and neglected if they lie within our reach:", "6026": "whether it be that we are nat­ urally less inquisitive concerning those things which are near us, while our curiosity is excited by remote objects;", "6027": "or because the easiness of gratifying a desire is always sure to damp it;", "6028": "or, perhaps, that we put off from time to time going and seeing what we know we have an opportunity of seeing when we please.", "6029": "Whatever the reason be, it is certain there are numberless curiosities in and near Rome which we have not only never seen, but even never so much as heard of:", "6030": "and yet had they been the produce of Greece, or Egypt, or Asia, or any other country which we admire as fertile and pro­ ductive of belief in wonders, we should long since have heard of them, read of them, and enquired into them.", "6031": "For myself at least, I confess, I have lately been entertained with one of these curiosities, to which I was an entire stranger before.", "6032": "My wife's grandfather desired I would look over his estate near Ameria.", "6033": "1", "6034": "As I was walking over his grounds, I was shown a lake that lies below them, called Vadimon,2 about which several very extraordinary things are told.", "6035": "I went up to this lake.", "6036": "It is perfectly circular in form, like a wheel lying on the ground;", "6037": "there is not the least curve or projection of the shore, but all is regular, even, and just as if it had been hollowed and cut out by the hand of art.", "6038": "The water is of a clear sky-blue, though with somewhat of a greenish tinge;", "6039": "its smell is sulphurous, and its flavour has medicinal properties, and is deemed of great efficacy in all fractures of the limbs, wh.ch it is supposed to heal.", "6040": "Though of but moderate extent, yet the winds have a great effect upon it, throwing it into violent agitation.", "6041": "No vessels are suffered to sail here, as its waters are held sacred;", "6042": "but several float­ ing islands swim about it, covered with reeds and rushes, and with whatever other plants the surrounding marshy ground and the edge itself of the lake produce in greater abundance.", "6043": "Each island has its peculiar shape and size, but the edges of all of them are worn away by their frequent collision with the shore and one another.", "6044": "They are all of the same height and motion;", "6045": "as their respective roots, which are formed like the keel of a boat, may be seen hanging not very far down in the water, and at an equal depth, on whichever side you stand.", "6046": "Sometimes they move in a cluster, and seem to form one entire little continent;", "6047": "some­ times they are dispersed into different quarters by the wind;", "6048": "at other times, when it is calm, they float up and down separately.", "6049": "You may frequently see one of the larger islands sailing along with a lesser joined to it, like a ship with its long boat;", "6050": "or, perhaps, seeming to strive which shall out-swim the other:", "6051": "then again they are all driven to the same spot, and by joining themselves to the shore, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, lessen or restore the size of the lake in this part or that, accord­ ingly, till at last uniting in the centre they restore it to its usual size.", "6052": "The sheep which graze upon the borders of this lake frequently go upon these islands to feed, without per­ ceiving that they have left the shore, until they are alarmed by finding themselves surrounded with water;", "6053": "as though they had been forcibly conveyed and placed there.", "6054": "After­ wards, when the wind drives them back again, they as little perceive their return as their departure.", "6055": "This lake empties itself into a river, which, after running a little way, sinks under ground, and, if anything is thrown in, it brings it up again where the stream emerges.", "6056": "—I have given you this account because I imagined it would not be less new, nor less agreeable, to you than it was to me;", "6057": "as I know you take the same pleasure as myself in contemplating the works of nature.", "6058": "Farewell.", "6059": "NOTHING, in my opinion, gives a more amiable and be­ coming grace to our studies, as well as manners, than to temper the serious with the gay, lest the former should degenerate into melancholy, and the latter run up into levity.", "6060": "Upon this plan it is that I diversify my graver works with compositions of a lighter nature.", "6061": "I had chosen a convenient place and season for some productions of that sort to make their appearance in;", "6062": "and designing to ac­ custom them early to the tables of the idle, I fixed upon the month of July, which is usually a time of vacation to the courts of justice, in order to read them to some of my friends I had collected together;", "6063": "and accordingly I placed a desk before each couch.", "6064": "But as I happened that morning to be unexpectedly called away to attend a cause, I took occasion to preface my recital with an apology.", "6065": "I entreated my audience not to impute it to me as any want of due regard for the business to which I had invited them that on the very day I had appointed for reading my per­ formances to a small circle of my friends I did not refuse my services to others in their law affairs.", "6066": "I assured them I would observe the same rule in my writings, and should always give the preference to business, before pleasure;", "6067": "to serious engagements before amusing ones;", "6068": "and to my friends before myself.", "6069": "The poems I recited consisted of a variety of subjects in different metres.", "6070": "It is thus that we who dare not rely for much upon our abilities endeavour to avoid satiating our readers.", "6071": "In compliance with the earnest solicitation of my audience, I recited for two days successively;", "6072": "but not in the manner that several practise, by passing over the feebler passages, and making a merit of so doing:", "6073": "on the contrary, I omitted nothing, and freely confessed it.", "6074": "I read the whole, that I might correct the whole;", "6075": "which it is impossible those who only select particu­ lar passages can do.", "6076": "The latter method, indeed, may have more the appearance of modesty, and perhaps respect;", "6077": "but the former shows greater simplicity, as well as a more affec­ tionate disposition towards the audience.", "6078": "For the belief that a man's friends have so much regard for him as not to be weary on these occasions, is a sure indication of the love he bears them.", "6079": "Otherwise, what good do friends do you who assemble merely for their own amusement?", "6080": "He who had rather find his friend's performance correct, than make it so, is to be regarded as a stranger, or one who is too lackadaisical to give himself any trouble.", "6081": "Your affection for me leaves me no room to doubt that you are impatient to read my book, even in its present very imperfect condi­ tion.", "6082": "And so you shall, but not until I have made those corrections which were the principal inducement of my recital.", "6083": "You are already acquainted with some parts of it;", "6084": "but even those, after they have been improved (or perhaps spoiled, as is sometimes the case by the delay of excessive revision) will seem quite new to you.", "6085": "For when a piece has undergone various changes, it gets to look new, even in those very parts which remain unaltered.", "6086": "Farewell.", "6087": "My affection for you obliges me, not indeed to direct you (for you are far above the want of a guide), but to admonish you carefully to observe and resolutely to put in practice what you already know, that is, in other words, to know it to better purpose.", "6088": "Consider that you are sent to that noble province, Achaia, the real and genuine Greece, where politeness, learning, and even agriculture itself, are supposed to have taken their first rise;", "6089": "sent to regulate the condition of free cities;", "6090": "sent, that is, to a society of men who breathe the spirit of true manhood and liberty;", "6091": "who Irave maintained the rights they received from Nature, by courage, by virtue, by alliances;", "6092": "in a word, by civil and religious faith.", "6093": "Revere the gods their founders;", "6094": "their ancient glory, and even that very antiquity itself which, venerable in men, is sacred in states.", "6095": "Honour them there­ fore for their deeds of old renown, nay, their very legendary traditions.", "6096": "Grant to every one his full dignity, privileges, yes, and the indulgence of his very vanity.", "6097": "Remember it was from this nation we derived our laws;", "6098": "that she did not receive ours by conquest, but gave us hers by favour.", "6099": "Remember, it is Athens to which you go;", "6100": "it is Lacedaemon you govern;", "6101": "and to deprive such a people of the declining shadow, the remaining name of liberty, would be cruel, in­ human, barbarous.", "6102": "Physicians, you see, though in sickness there is no difference between freedom and slavery, yet treat persons of the former rank with more tenderness than those of the latter.", "6103": "Reflect what these cities once were;", "6104": "but so reflect as not to despise them for what they are now.",

ensigns of authority, can he fail of meeting with respect, unless by pursuing base and sordid measures, and first breaking through that reverence he owes to himself?", "6108": "Ill, believe me, is power proved by insult;", "6109": "ill can terror command veneration, and far more effectual is affection in obtaining one's purpose than fear.", "6110": "For terror operates no longer than its object is present, but love produces its effects with its object at a distance:", "6111": "and as absence changes the former into hatred, it raises the latter into respect.", "6112": "And therefore you ought ( and I cannot but repeat it too often), you ought to well consider the nature of your office, and to represent to yourself how great and important the task is of governing a free state.", "6113": "For what can be better for society than such government, what can be more precious than freedom?", "6114": "How ignominious then must his conduct be who turns good government into anarchy, and liberty into slavery?", "6115": "To these considerations let me add, that you have an established reputation to maintain:", "6116": "the fame you acquired by the administration of the quaestorship in Bithynia,1 the good opinion of the emperor, the credit you obtained when you were tribune and praetor, in a word, this very government, which may be looked upon as the reward of your former services, are all so many glorious weights which are incumbent upon you to support with suitable dignity.", "6117": "The more strenuously therefore you ought to endeavour that it may not be said you showed greater urbanity, integrity, and ability in a province remote from Rome, than in one which lies so much nearer the capital;", "6118": "in the midst of a nation of slaves, than among a free peo­ ple;", "6119": "that it may not be remarked, that it was chance, and not judgment, appointed you to this office;", "6120": "that your char­ acter was unknown and unexperienced, not tried and ap­ proved.", "6121": "For (and it is a maxim which your reading and conversation must have often suggested to you) it is a far greater disgrace losing the name one has once acquired than never to have attained it.", "6122": "I again beg you to be per­ suaded that I did not write this letter with a design of instruction, but of reminder.", "6123": "Though indeed, if I had, it would have only been in consequence of the great affection I bear you:", "6124": "a sentiment which I am in no fear of carrying beyond its just bounds:", "6125": "for there can be no danger of excess where one cannot love too well.", "6126": "Farewell.", "6127": "OTHERS may think as they please;", "6128": "but the happiest man, in my opinion, is he who lives in the conscious anticipa­ tion of an honest and enduring name, and secure of future glory in the eyes of posterity.", "6129": "I confess, if I had not the reward of an immortal reputation in view, I should prefer a life of uninterrupted ease and indolent retirement to any other.", "6130": "There seems to be two points worthy every man's attention:", "6131": "endless fame, or the short duration of life.", "6132": "Those who are actuated by the former motive ought to exert themselves to the very utmost of their power;", "6133": "while such as are influenced by the latter should quietly resign themselves to repose, and not wear out a short life in perishable pursuits, as we see so many doing-and then sink at last into utter self-contempt, in the midst of a wretched and fruitless course of false industry.", "6134": "These are my daily reflections, which I communicate to you, in order to renounce them if you do not agree with them;", "6135": "as undoubtedly you will, who are for ever meditating some glorious and immortal enterprise.", "6136": "FarewelLI HAVE spent these several days past, in reading and writing, with the most pleasing tranquillity imaginable.", "6137": "You will ask, \" How that can possibly be in the

recommend them, nothing, in short, one would wish to see twice.", "6141": "It does the more sur­ prise me therefore that so many thousand people should be possessed with the childish passion of desiring so often to see a parcel of horses gallop, and men standing upright in their chariots.", "6142": "If, indeed, it were the swiftness of the horses, or the skill of the men that attracted them, there might be some pretence of reason for it.", "6143": "But it is the dress1 they like;", "6144": "it is the dress that takes their fancy.", "6145": "And if, in the midst of the course and contest,

appeared again and came to the boy, who, together with his companions, swam away with the utmost precipita­ tion.", "6440": "The dolphin, as though to invite and call them back, leaped and dived up and down, in a series of circular move­ ments.", "6441": "This he practised the next day, the day after, and for several days together, till the people (accustomed from their infancy to the sea) began to be ashamed of their timidity.", "6442": "They ventured, therefore, to advance nearer, play­ ing with him and calling him to them, while he, in return, suffered himself to be touched and stroked.", "6443": "Use rendered them courageous.", "6444": "The boy, in particular, who first made the experiment, swam by the side of him, and, leaping upon his back, was carried backwards and forwards in that manner, and thought the dolphin knew him and was fond of him, while he too had grown fond of the dolphin.", "6445": "There seemed, now, indeed, to be no fear on either side, the con­ fidence of the one and tameness of the other mutually in­ creasing ;", "6446": "the rest of the boys, in the meanwhile, surrounding and encouraging their companion.", "6447": "It is very remarkable that this dolphin was followed by a second, which seemed only as a spectator and attendant on the former;", "6448": "for he did not at all submit to the same familiarities as the first, but only escorted him backwards and forwards, as the boys did their comrade.", "6449": "But what is further surprising, and no less true than what I have already related, is that this dolphin, who thus played with the boys and carried them upon his back, would come upon the shore, dry himself in the sand, and, as soon as he grew warm, roll back into the sea.", "6450": "It is a fact that Octavius Avitus, deputy governor of the province, actuated by an absurd piece of superstition, poured some ointment1 over him as he lay on the shore:", "6451": "the novelty and smell of which made him retire into the ocean, and it was not till several days after that he was seen again, when he appeared dull and languid;", "6452": "however, he recov­ ered his strength and continued his usual playful tricks.", "6453": "All the magistrates round flocked hither to view this sight, whose arrival, and prolonged stay, was an additional expense, which the slender finances of this little community would ill afford;", "6454": "besides, the quiet and retirement of the place was utterly destroyed.", "6455": "It was thought proper, therefore, to remove the occasion of this concourse, by privately killing the poor dolphin.", "6456": "And now, with what a flow of tenderness will you describe this affecting catastrophe!", "6457": "2 and how will your genius adorn and heighten this moving story!", "6458": "Though, indeed, the subject does not require any fictitious embel­ lishments;", "6459": "it will be sufficient to describe the actual facts of the case without suppression or diminution.", "6460": "FarewelLYou want to know how I portion out my day, in my summer villa at Tuscum?", "6461": "I get up just when I please;", "6462": "generally about sunrise, often earlier, but seldom later than this.", "6463": "I keep the shutters closed, as darkness and silence wonderfully promote meditation.", "6464": "Thus free and abstracted from these outward objects which dissipate attention, I am left to my own thoughts;", "6465": "nor suffer my mind to wander with my eyes, but keep my eyes in subjection to my mind, which, when they are not distracted by a multiplicity of external objects, see nothing but what the imagination represents to them.", "6466": "If I have any work in hand, this is the time I choose for thinking it out, word for word, even to the minutest accuracy of expression.", "6467": "In this way I com­ pose more or less, according as the subject is more or less difficult, and I find myself able to retain it.", "6468": "I then call my secretary, and, opening the shutters, dictate to him what 1 have put into shape, after which I dismiss him, then call him in again, and again dismiss him.", "6469": "About ten or eleven o'clock (for I do not observe one fixed hour), according to the weather, I either walk upon my terrace or in the covered portico, and there I continue to meditate or dictate what remains upon the subject in which I am engaged.", "6470": "This completed, I get into my chariot, where I employ myself as before, when I was walking, or in my study;", "6471": "and find this change of scene refreshes and keeps up my attention.", "6472": "On my return home, I take a little nap, then a walk, and after that repeat out loud and distinctly some Greek or Latin speech, not so much for the sake of strengthening my voice as my digestion;", "6473": "1 though indeed the voice at the same time is strengthened by this practice.", "6474": "I then take another walk, am anointed, do my exercises, and go into the bath.", "6475": "At supper, if I have only my wife or a few friends with me, some author is read to us;", "6476": "and after supper we are entertained either with music or an interlude.", "6477": "When that is finished, I take my walk with my family, among whom I am not without some scholars.", "6478": "Thus we pass our evenings in varied conversation;", "6479": "and the day, even when at the longest, steals imperceptibly away.", "6480": "Upon some occa­ sions I change the order in certain of the articles above- mentioned.", "6481": "For instance, if I have studied longer or walked more than usual, after my second sleep, and reading a speech or two aloud, instead of using my chariot I get on horseback;", "6482": "by which means I ensure as much exercise and lose less time.", "6483": "The visits of my friends from the neigh­ bouring villages claim some part of the day;", "6484": "and sometimes, by an agreeable interruption, they come in very seasonably to relieve me when I am feeling tired.", "6485": "I now and then amuse myself with hunting, but always take my tablets into the field, that, if I should meet with no game, I may at least bring home something.", "6486": "Part of my time too (though not so much as they desire) is allotted to my tenants;", "6487": "whose rustic complaints, along with these city occupations, make my literary studies still more delightful to me.", "6488": "Farewell.", "6489": "As you are not of a disposition to expect from your friends the ordinary ceremonial observances of society when they cannot observe them without inconvenience to them­ selves, so I love you too steadfastly to be apprehensive of your taking otherwise than I wish you should my not wait­ ing upon you on the first day of your entrance upon the consular office, especially as I am detained here by the necessity of letting my farms upon long leases.", "6490": "I am obliged to enter upon an entirely new plan with my tenants:", "6491": "for under the former leases, though I made them very con­ siderable abatements, they have run greatly in arrear.", "6492": "For this reason several of them have not only taken no sort of care to lessen a debt which they found themselves incapable of wholly discharging, but have even seized and consumed all the produce of the land, in the belief that it would now be of no advantage to themselves to spare it.", "6493": "I must there­ fore obviate this increasing evil, and endeavour to find out some remedy against it.", "6494": "The only one I can think of is, not to reserve my rent in money, but in kind, and so place some of my servants to overlook the tillage, and guard the stock;", "6495": "as indeed there is no sort of revenue more agreeable to reason than what arises from the bounty of the soil, the seasons, and the climate.", "6496": "It is true, this method will require great honesty, sharp eyes, and many hands.", "6497": "However, I must risk the ex­ periment, and, as in an inveterate complaint, try every change of remedy.", "6498":

bor­ rowing a good piece of the night before daybreak and after sunset for study:", "6503": "and if business is very urgent (which in winter very frequently happens), instead of having inter­ ludes or music after supper, I reconsider whatever I have previously dictated, and improve my memory at the same time by this frequent mental revision.", "6504": "Thus I have given you a general sketch of my mode of life in summer and winter;", "6505": "to which you may add the intermediate seasons of spring and autumn, in which, while losing nothing out of the day, I gain but little from the night.",

every valuable privilege to the bounty of your generous dispen­ sations.", "6518": "And indeed the pleasure of being a father will be so much more acceptable to me now, that I can enjoy it in full security and happiness.", "6519": "THE experience, most excellent Emperor, I have had of your unbounded generosity to me, in my own person, encour­ ages me to hope I may be yet farther obliged to it,

your sacred father to promote him to the dignity of the sena­ torial order.", "6522": "But the completion of my request is reserved to your goodness;", "6523": "for his mother had not then advanced,

advice she has since done, having made over certain estates to him, as well as completed every other act necessary to make the conveyance valid.", "6525": "The difficulties therefore being removed which deferred the gratification of our wishes, it is with full confidence I venture to assure you of the worth of my friend Romanus, heightened and adorned as it is not only by liberal culture, but by his extraordinary tender­ ness to his parents as well.", "6526": "It is to that virtue he owes the present liberality of his mother;", "6527": "as well as his immediate succession to his late father's estate, and his adoption by his father-in-law.", "6528": "To these personal qualifications, the wealth and rank of his family give additional lustre;", "6529": "and I persuade myself it will be some further recommendation that I solicit in his behalf.", "6530": "Let me, then, entreat you, Sir, to enable me to congratulate Romanus on so desirable an occasion, and at the same time to indulge an eager and, I hope, laudable ambition, of having it in my power to boast that your favourable regards are extended not only to my­ self, but also to my friend.", "6531": "WHEN by your gracious indulgence, Sir, I was appointed to preside at the treasury of Saturn, I immediately re­ nounced all engagements of the bar ( as indeed I never blended business of that kind with the functions of the state), that no avocations might call off my attention from the post to which I was appointed.", "6532": "For this reason, when the province of Africa petitioned the senate that I might undertake their cause against Marius Priscus, I excused my­ self from that office;", "6533": "and my excuse was allowed.", "6534": "But when afterwards the consul elect proposed that the senate should apply to us again, and endeavour to prevail with us to yield to its inclinations, and suffer our names to be thrown into the urn, I thought it most agreeable to that tranquillity and good order

illness, I employed a physician, whose care and diligence, Sir, I cannot sufficiently reward, but by your gracious assistance.", "6539": "I entreat you therefore to make him a denizen of Rome;",

great merit.", "6544": "It is at her desire I make this request.", "6545": "I RETURN you thanks,", "6546": "Sir, for your ready compliance with my desire, in granting the complete privileges of a Roman to the freedwomen of a lady to whom I am allied and also for making Harpocras, my physician, a denizen of Rome.", "6547": "But when, agreeably to your directions, I gave in an account of his age, and estate, I was informed by those who are better skilled in the affairs than I pretend to be that, as he is an Egyptian, I ought first to have obtained for him the freedom of Alexandria before he was made free of Rome.", "6548": "I confess, indeed, as I was ignorant of any difference in this case be­ tween those of Egypt and other countries, I contented my­ self with only acquainting you that he had been manumitted by a foreign lady long since deceased.", "6549": "However, it is an ignorance I cannot regret, since it affords me an opportunity of receiving from you a double obligation in favour of the same person.", "6550": "That I may legally therefore enjoy the bene­ fit of your goodness.", "6551": "I beg you would be pleased to grant him the freedom of the city of Alexandria, as well as that of Rome.", "6552": "And that your gracious intentions may not meet with any further obstacles, I have taken care, as you directed, to send an account to your freedman of his age and possessions.", "6553": "IT is my resolution, in pursuance of the maxim observed by the princes my predecessors, to be extremely cautious in granting the freedom of the city of Alexandria:", "6554": "however, since you have obtained of me the freedom of Rome for your physician Harpocras, I cannot refuse you this other request.", "6555": "You must let me know to what district he be­ longs, that I may give you a letter to my friend Pompeius Planta, governor of Egypt.", "6556": "I CANNOT express, Sir, the pleasure your letter gave me, by which I am informed that you have made my physician Harpocras a denizen of Alexandria;", "6557": "notwithstanding your resolution to follow the maxim of your predecessors in this point, by being extremely cautious in granting that privilege.", "6558": "Agreeably to your directions, I acquaint you that Harpocras belongs to the district of Memphis.", "6559": "1 I entreat you then, most gracious Emperor, to send me, as you promised, a letter to your friend Pompeius Planta, governor of Egypt.", "6560": "As I purpose (in order to have the earliest enjoyment of your presence, so ardently wished for here) to come to meet you, I beg, Sir, you would permit me to extend my journey as far as possible.", "6561": "I WAS greatly obliged, Sir, in my late illness, to Post­ humius Marinus, my physician;", "6562": "and I cannot make him a suitable return, but by the assistance of your wonted gracious indulgence.", "6563": "I entreat you then to make Chrysippus Mith­ ridates and his wife Stratonica (who are related to Marinus) denizens of Rome.", "6564": "I entreat likewise the same privilege in favour of Epigonus and Mithridates, the two sons of Chrysippus;", "6565": "but with this restriction1 that they may remain under the dominion of their father, and yet reserve their right of patronage over their own freedmen.", "6566": "I further en­ treat you to grant the full privileges of a Roman to L. Satrius Abascantius, P. Caesius Phosphorus, and Pancharia Soteris.", "6567": "This request I make with the consent of their patrons.", "6568": "AFTER your late sacred father, Sir, had, in a noble speech, as well as by his own generous example, exhorted and en­ couraged the public to acts of munificence, I implored his permission to remove the several statues which I had of the former emperors to my corporation, and at the same time requested permission to add his own to the number.", "6569": "For as I had hitherto let them remain in the respective places in which they stood when they were left to me by several different inheritances, they were dispersed in distant parts of my estate.", "6570": "He was pleased to grant my request, and at the same time to give me a very ample testimony of his ap­ probation.", "6571": "I immediately, therefore, wrote to the decurii, to desire they would allot a piece of ground, upon which I might build a temple at my own expense;", "6572": "and they, as a mark of honour to my design, offered me the choice of any site I might think proper.", "6573": "However, my own ill-health in the first place, and later that of your father, together with the duties of that employment which you were both pleased to entrust me, prevented my proceeding with that design.", "6574": "But I have now, I think, a convenient opportunity of mak­ ing an excursion for the purpose, as my monthly attendance1 ends on the ist of September, and there are several festivals in the month following.", "6575": "My first request, then, is that you would permit me to adorn the temple I am going to erect with your statue, and next (in order to the execution of my design with all the expedition possible) that you would in­ dulge me with leave of absence.", "6576": "It would ill become the sincerity I profess, were I to dissemble that your goodness in complying with this desire will at the same time be ex­ tremely serviceable to me in 'my own private affairs.", "6577": "It is absolutely necessary I should not defer any longer the let­ ting of my lands in that province;", "6578": "for, besides that they amount to above four hundred thousand sestei ces,' the time for dressing the vineyards is approaching, and that business must fall upon my new tenants.", "6579": "The unfruitfulness of the seasons besides, for several years past, obliges me to think of making some abatements in my rents;", "6580": "which I cannot possibly settle unless I am present.", "6581": "I shall be indebted then to your indulgence, Sir, for the expedition of my work of piety, and the settlement of my own private affairs, if you will be pleased to grant me leave of absences for thirty days.", "6582": "I cannot give myself a shorter time, as the town and the estate of which I am speaking lie above a hundred and fifty miles from Rome.", "6583": "You have given me many private reasons, and every public one, why you desire leave of absence;", "6584": "but I need no other than that it is your desire:", "6585": "and I doubt not of your returning as soon as possible to the duty of an office which so much requires your attendance.", "6586": "As I would not seem to check any instance of your affection towards me, I shall not oppose your erecting my statue in the place you desire;", "6587": "though in general I am extremely cautious in giving any encourage­ ment to honours of that kind.", "6588": "As I am sensible, Sir, that the highest applause my actions can receive is to be distinguished by so excellent a prince, I beg you would be graciously pleased to add either the office of augur or septemvir1 (both which are now va­ cant) to the dignity I already enjoy by your indulgence;", "6589": "that I may have the satisfaction of publicly offering up those vows for your prosperity, from the duty of my office, which I daily prefer to the gods in private, from the affection of my heart.", "6590": "HAVING safely passed the promontory of Malea, I am ar­ rived at Ephesus with all my retinue, notwithstanding I was detained for some time by contrary winds:", "6591": "a piece of in­ formation, Sir, in which, I trust, you will feel yourself con­ cerned.", "6592": "I propose pursuing the remainder of my journey to the province1 partly in light vessels, and partly in post- chaises :", "6593": "for as the excessive heats will prevent my travelling altogether by land, so the Etesian winds,2 which are now set in, will not permit me to proceed entirely by sea.", "6594": "YOUR information, my dear Pliny, was extremely agreeable to me, as it does concern me to know in what manner you arrive at your province.", "6595": "It is a wise intention of yours to travel either by sea or land, as you shall find most convenient.", "6596": "As I had a very favourable voyage to Ephesus, so in travelling by post-chaise from thence I' was extremely troubled by the heats, and also by some slight feverish at­ tacks, which kept me some time at Pergamus.", "6597": "From there, Sir, I got on board a coasting vessel, but, being again de­ tained by contrary winds, did not arrive at Bithynia so soon as I had hoped.", "6598": "However, I have no reason to complain of this delay, since (which indeed was the most auspicious circumstance that could attend me) I reached the province in time to celebrate your birthday.", "6599": "I am at present engaged in examining the finances of the Prusenses,1 their expenses, revenues, and credits;", "6600": "and the farther I proceed in this work, the more I am convinced of the necessity of my enquiry.", "6601": "Several large sums of money are owing to the city from private persons, which they neglect to pay upon various pre­ tences;", "6602": "as, on the other hand, I find the public funds are, in some instances, very unwarrantably applied.", "6603": "This,", "6604": "Sir, I write to you immediately on my arrival.", "6605": "I entered this province on the 17th of September,2 and found in it that obedience and loyalty towards yourself which you justly merit from all mankind.", "6606": "You will consider, Sir, whether it would not be proper to send a surveyor here;", "6607": "for I am in­ clined to think much might be deducted from what is charged by those who have the conduct of the public works if a faithful admeasurement were to be taken:", "6608": "at least I am of that opinion from what I have already seen of the ac­ counts of this city, which I am now going into as fully as is possible.", "6609": "I SHOULD have rejoiced to have heard that you arrived at Bithynia without the smallest inconvenience to yourself or any of your retinue, and that your journey from Ephesus had been as easy as your voyage to that place was favourable.", "6610": "For the rest, your letter informs me, my dearest Secundus, on what day you reached Bithynia.", "6611": "The people of that province will be convinced, I persuade myself, that I am attentive to their interest;", "6612": "as your conduct towards them will make it manifest that I could have chosen no more proper person to supply my place.", "6613": "The examination of the public accounts ought certainly to be your first employment, as they are evidently in great disorder.", "6614": "I have scarcely sur­ veyors sufficient to inspect those works3 which I am carrying on at Rome, and in the neighbourhood;", "6615": "but persons of in­ tegrity and skill in this art may be found, most certainly, in every province, so that they will not fail you if only you will make due enquiry.", "6616": "THOUGH I am well assured, Sir, that you, who never omit any opportunity of exerting your generosity, are not unmindful of the request I lately made to you, yet, as you have often indulged me in this manner, give me leave to remind and earnestly entreat you to bestow the praetorship now vacant upon Attius Sura.", "6617": "Though his ambition is extremely moderate, yet the quality of his birth, the inflexible integrity he has preserved in a very narrow fortune, and, more than all, the felicity of your times, which encourages conscious virtue to claim your favour, induce him to hope he may experience it in the present instance.", "6618": "I CONGRATULATE both you and the public, most excellent Emperor, upon the great and glorious victory you have ob­ tained;", "6619": "so agreeable to the heroism of ancient Rome.", "6620": "May the immortal gods grant the same happy success to'all your designs, that, under the administration of so many princely virtues, the splendour of the empire may shine out, not only in its former, but with additional lustre.", "6621": "1", "6622": "My lieutenant, Servilius Pudens, came to Nicomedia,1 Sir, on the 24th of November, and by his arrival freed me, at length, from the anxiety of a very uneasy expectation.", "6623": "YOUR generosity to me, Sir, was the occasion of uniting me to Rosianus Geminus, by the strongest ties;", "6624": "for he was my quaestor when I was consul.", "6625": "His behaviour to me during the continuance of our offices was highly respectful, and he has treated me ever since with so peculiar a regard that, besides the many obligations I owe him upon a public account, I am indebted to him for the strongest pledges of private friend­ ship.", "6626": "I entreat you, then, to comply with my request for the advancement of one whom (if my recommendation has any weight) you will even distinguish with your particular favour;", "6627": "and whatever trust you shall repose in him, he will endeavour to show himself still deserving of an higher.", "6628": "But I am the more sparing in my praises of him, being persuaded his integrity, his probity, and his vigilance are well known to you, not only from those high posts which he has exercised in Rome within your immediate inspection, but from his behaviour when he served under you in the army.", "6629": "One thing, however, my affection for him inclines me to think, I have not yet sufficiently done;", "6630": "and therefore, Sir, I repeat my entreaties that you will give me the pleasure, as early as possible, of rejoicing in the advancement of my quaestor, or, in other words, of receiving an addition to my own honours, in the person of my friend.", "6631": "IT is not easy, Sir, to express the joy I received when I heard you had, in compliance with the request of my mother- in-law and myself, granted Coelius Clemens the proconsulship of this province after the expiration of his consular office;", "6632": "as it is from thence I learn the full extent of your goodness towards me, which thus graciously extends itself through my whole family.", "6633": "As I dare not pretend to make an equal return to those obligations I so justly owe you, I can only have recourse to vows, and ardently implore the gods that I may not be found unworthy of those favours which you are the repeatedly conferring upon me.", "6634": "I RECEIVED, Sir, a dispatch from your freedman, Lycor­ mas, desiring me,

courier passing through this place from the king of Sarmatia,3 I embrace the opportunity which ac­ cidentally offers itself, of sending with him the messenger which Lycormas despatched hither, that you might be in­ formed by both their letters of what, perhaps, it may be expedient you should be acquainted with at one and the same time.", "6637": "I AM informed by a letter from the king of Sarmatia that there are certain affairs of which you ought to be informed as soon as possible.", "6638": "In order, therefore, to hasten the des­ patches which his courier was charged with to you, I granted him an order to make use of the public post.", "6639": "1THE ambassador from the king of Sarmatia having re­ mained two days, by his own choice, at Nicea, I did not think it reasonable, Sir, to detain him any longer:", "6640": "because, in the first place, it was still uncertain when your freed­ man, Lycormas, would arrive, and then again some indis­ pensable affairs require my presence in a different part of the province.", "6641": "Of this I thought it necessary that you should be informed, because I lately acquainted you in a letter that Lycormas had desired, if any embassy should come this way from Bosporus, that I would detain it till his arrival.", "6642": "But I saw no plausible pretext for keeping him back any longer, especially as the despatches from Lycormas, which (as I mentioned before) I was not willing to detain, would prob­ ably reach you some days sooner than this ambassador.", "6643": "I RECEIVED a letter, Sir, from Apuleius, a military man, belonging to the garrison at Nicomedia, informing me that one Callidromus, being arrested by Maximus and Dionysius (two bakers, to whom he had hired himself), fled for refuge to your statue;", "6644": "1 that, being brought before a magistrate, he declared he was formerly slave to Laberius Maximus, but being taken prisoner by Susagus* in Moesia,8 he was sent as a present from Decebalus to Pacorus, king of Parthia, in whose service he continued several years, from whence he made his escape, and came to Nicomedia.", "6645": "When he was examined before me, he confirmed this account, for which reason I thought it necessary to send4 him to you.", "6646": "This I should have done sooner, but I delayed his journey in order to make an inquiry concerning a seal ring which he said was taken from him, upon which was engraven the figure of Pacorus in his royal robes;", "6647": "I was desirous (if it could have been found) of transmitting this curiosity to you, with a small gold nugget which he says he brought from out of the Parthian mines.", "6648": "I have affixed my seal to it, the impression of which is a chariot drawn by four horses.", "6649": "YOUR freedman and procurator,6 Maximus, behaved, Sir, during all the time we were together, with great probity, attention, and diligence;", "6650": "as one strongly attached to your interest, and strictly observant of discipline.", "6651": "This testi­ mony I willingly give him;", "6652": "and I give it with all the fidelity I owe you.", "6653": "AFTER having experienced, Sir, in Gabius Bassus, who commands on the Pontic1 coast, the greatest integrity, honour, and diligence, as well as the most particular re­ spect to myself, I cannot refuse him my best wishes and suffrage;", "6654": "and I give them to him with all that fidelity which is due to you.", "6655": "I have found him abundantly qualified by having served in the army under you;", "6656": "and it is owing to the advantages of your discipline that he has learned to merit your favour.", "6657": "The soldiery and the people here, who have had full experience of his justice and humanity, rival each other in that glorious testimony they give of his con­ duct, both in public and in private;", "6658": "and I certify this with all the sincerity you have a right to expect from me.", "6659": "NYMPHIDIUS Lupus,2 Sir, and myself, served in the army together;", "6660": "he commanded a body of the auxiliary forces at the same time that I was military tribune;", "6661": "and it was from thence my affection for him began.", "6662": "A long acquaintance has since mutually endeared and strengthened our friend­ ship.", "6663": "For this reason I did violence to his repose, and in­ sisted upon his attending me into Bithynia, as my assessor in council.", "6664": "He most readily granted me this proof of his friendship;", "6665": "and without any regard to the plea of age, or the ease of retirement, he shared, and continues to share, with me, the fatigue of public business.", "6666": "I consider his relations, therefore, as my own;", "6667": "in which number Nymphi­ dius Lupus, his son, claims my particular regard.", "6668": "He is a youth of great merit and indefatigable application, and in every respect well worthy of so excellent a father.", "6669": "The early proof he gave of his merit, when he commanded a regiment of foot, shows him to be equal to any honour you may think proper to confer upon him;", "6670": "and it gained him the strongest testimony of approbation from those most illustrious personages, Julius Ferox and Fuscus Salinator.", "6671": "And I will add, Sir, that I shall rejoice in any accession of dignity which he shall receive as an occasion of particular satisfaction to myself.", "6672": "I BEG your determination, Sir, on a point I am exceed­ ingly doubtful about:", "6673": "it is whether I should place the public slaves1 as sentries round the prisons of the several cities in this province (as has been hitherto the practice) or employ a party of soldiers for that purpose?", "6674": "On the one hand, I am afraid the public slaves will not attend this duty with the fidelity they ought;", "6675": "and on the other, that it will engage too large a body of the soldiery.", "6676": "In the meanwhile I have joined a few of the latter with the former.", "6677": "I am appre­ hensive, however, there may be some danger that this method will occasion a general neglect of duty, as it will afford them a mutual opportunity of throwing the blame upon each other.", "6678": "THERE is no occasion, my dearest Secundus, to draw off any soldiers in order to guard the prisons.", "6679": "Let us rather persevere in the ancient customs observed in this province, of employing the public slaves for that purpose;", "6680": "and the fidelity with which they shall execute their duty will depend much upon your care and strict discipline.", "6681": "It is greatly to be feared, as you observe, if the soldiers should be mixed with the public slaves, they will mutually trust to each other, and by that means grow so much the more negligent.", "6682": "But my principal objection is that as few soldiers as possible should be withdrawn from their standard.", "6683": "GABIUS BASSUS, who commands upon the frontiers of Pontica, in a manner suitable to the respect and duty which he owes you, came to me, and has been with me, Sir, for several days.", "6684": "As far as I could observe, he is a person of great merit and worthy of your favour.", "6685": "I acquainted him it was your order that he should retain only ten beneficiary1 soldiers, two horse-guards, and one centurion out of the troops which you were pleased to assign to my command.", "6686": "He assured me those would not be sufficient, and that he would write to you accordingly;", "6687": "for which reason I thought it proper not immediately to recall his supernumeraries.", "6688": "I HAVE received from Gabius Bassus the letter you men­ tion, acquainting me that the number of soldiers I had ordered him was not sufficient;", "6689": "and for your information I have directed my answer to be hereunto annexed.", "6690": "It is very material to distinguish between what the exigency of affairs requires and what an ambitious desire of ex­ tending power may think necessary.", "6691": "As for ourselves, the public welfare must be our only guide:", "6692": "accordingly it is incumbent upon us to take all possible care that the soldiers shall not be absent from their standard.", "6693": "THE Prusenses, Sir, having an ancient bath which lies in a ruinous state, desire your leave to repair it;", "6694": "but, upon examination, I am of opinion it ought to be rebuilt.", "6695": "I think, therefore, you may indulge them in this request, as there will be a sufficient fund for that purpose, partly from those debts which are due from private persons to the public which I am now collecting in;", "6696": "and partly from what they raise among themselves towards furnishing the bath with oil, which they are willing to apply to the carrying on of this building;", "6697": "a work which the dignity of the city and the splendour of your times seem to demand.", "6698": "IF the erecting a public bath will not be too great a charge upon the Prusenses, we may comply with their request;", "6699": "pro­ vided, however, that no new tax be levied for this purpose, nor any of those taken off which are appropriated to necessary services.", "6700": "I AM assured, Sir, by your freedman and receiver-general Maximus, that it is necessary he should have a party of soldiers assigned to him, over and besides the beneficiarii, which by your orders I allotted to the very worthy Gemel­ linus.", "6701": "Those therefore which I found in his service, I thought proper he should retain, especially as he was going into Paphlagonia, in order to procure corn.", "6702": "For his better protection likewise, and because it was his request, I added two of the cavalry.", "6703": "But I beg you would inform me, in your next despatches, what method you would have me observe for the future in points of this nature.", "6704": "As my freedman Maximus was going upon an extraordi­ nary commission to procure corn, I approve of your having supplied him with a file of soldiers.", "6705": "But when he- shall return to the duties of his former post, I think two from you and as many from his coadjutor, my receiver-general Virdius Gemellinus, will be sufficient.", "6706": "THE very excellent young man Sempronius Caelianus, having discovered two slaves2 among the recruits, has sent them to me.", "6707": "But I deferred passing sentence till I had con­ sulted you, the restorer and upholder of military discipline, concerning the punishment proper to be inflicted upon them.", "6708": "My principal doubt is that, whether, although they have taken the military oath, they are yet entered into any par­ ticular legion.", "6709": "I request you therefore, Sir, to inform me what course I should pursue in this affair, especially as it concerns example.", "6710": "SEMPRONIUS CAELINUS has acted agreeably to my orders, in sending such persons to be tried before you as appear to deserve capital punishment.", "6711": "It is material however, in the case in question, to inquire whether these slaves in­ listed themselves voluntarily, or were chosen by the officers, or presented as substitutes for others.", "6712": "If they were chosen, the officer is guilty;", "6713": "if they are substitutes, the blame rests with those who deputed them;", "6714": "but if, conscious of the legal inabilities of their station, they presented themselves volun­ tarily, the punishment must fall upon their own heads.", "6715": "That they are not yet entered into any legion, makes no great difference in their case;", "6716": "for they ought to have given a true account of themselves immediately, upon their being ap­ proved as fit for the service.", "6717": "As I have your permission, Sir, to address myself to you in all my doubts, you will not consider it beneath your dignity to descend to those humbler affairs which concern my administration of this province.", "6718": "I find there are in several cities, particularly those of Nicomedia and Nicea, certain persons who take upon themselves to act as public slaves, and receive an annual stipend accordingly;", "6719": "notwith­ standing they have been condemned either to the mines, the public games,1 or other punishments of the like nature.", "6720": "Hav­ ing received information of this abuse I have been long debating with myself what I ought to do.", "6721": "On the one hand, to send them back again to their respective punish­ ments (many of them being now grown old, and behaving, as I am assured, with sobriety and modesty) would, I thought, be proceeding against them too severely;", "6722": "on the other, to retain convicted criminals in the public service, seemed not altogether decent.", "6723": "I considered at the same time to support these people in idleness would be an use­ less expense to the public;", "6724": "and to leave them to starve would be dangerous.", "6725": "I was obliged therefore to suspend the determination of this matter till I could consult with you.", "6726": "You will be desirous, perhaps, to be informed how -it happened that these persons escaped the punishments to which they were condemned.", "6727": "This enquiry I have also made, but cannot return you any satisfactory answer.", "6728": "The decrees against them were indeed produced;", "6729": "but no record appears of their having ever been reversed.", "6730": "It was as­ serted, however, that these people were pardoned upon their petition to the proconsuls, or their lieutenants;", "6731": "which seems likely to be the truth, as it is improbable any person would have dared to set them at liberty without authority.", "6732": "You will remember you were sent into Bithynia for the particular purpose of correcting those many abuses which appeared in need of reform.", "6733": "Now none stands more so than that of criminals who have been sentenced to punish­ ment should not only be set at liberty (as your letter in­ forms me) without authority, but even appointed to em­ ployments which ought only to be exercised by persons whose characters are irreproachable.", "6734": "Those therefore among them who have been convicted within these ten years, and whose sentence has not been reversed by proper authority, must be sent back again to their respective punish­ ments:", "6735": "but where more than ten years have elapsed since their conviction, and they are grown old and infirm, let them be disposed of in such employments as are but few degrees removed from the punishments to which they were sentenced;", "6736": "that is, either to attend upon the public baths, cleanse the common sewers, or repair the streets and high­ ways, the usual offices assigned to such persons.", "6737": "WHILE I was making a progress in a different part of the province, a most extensive fire broke out at Nicomedia, which not only consumed several private houses, but also two public buildings;", "6738": "the town-house and the temple of Isis, though they stood on contrary sides of the street.", "6739": "The occasion of its spreading thus far was partly owing to the violence of the wind, and partly to the indolence of the people, who, manifestly, stood idle and motionless spectators of this terrible calamity.", "6740": "The truth is.", "6741": "the city was not furnished with either engines,1 buckets, or any single instrument suitable for extinguishing fires;", "6742": "which I have now however given directions to have prepared.", "6743": "You will consider, Sir, whether it may not be advisable to institute a company of fire-men, consisting only of one hundred and fifty members.", "6744": "I will take care none but those of that business shall be admitted into it, and that the privileges granted them shall not be applied to any other purpose.", "6745": "As this corporate body will be restricted to so small a number of members, it will be easy to keep them under proper regulation.", "6746": "You are of opinion it would be proper to establish a com­ pany of fire-men in Nicomedia, agreeably to what has been practised in several other cities.", "6747": "But it is to be remembered that societies of this sort have greatly disturbed the peace of the province in general, and of those cities in particular.", "6748": "Whatever name we give them, and for whatever purposes they may be founded, they will not fail to form themselves into factious assemblies, however short their meetings may be.", "6749": "It will therefore be safer to provide such machines as are of service in extinguishing fires, enjoining the owners of houses to assist in preventing the mischief from spread­ ing, and, if it should be necessary, to call in the aid of the populace.", "6750": "WE have acquitted, Sir, and renewed our annual vows1 for your prosperity, in which that of the empire is essen­ tially involved, imploring the gods to grant us ever thus to pay and thus to repeat them.", "6751": "I RECEIVED the satisfaction, my dearest Secundus, of being informed by your letter that you, together with the people under your government, have both discharged and renewed your vows to the immortal gods for my health and happiness.", "6752": "THE citizens of Nicomedia, Sir, have expended three mil­ lions three hundred and twenty-nine sesterces2 in building an aqueduct;", "6753": "but, not being able to finish it, the works are entirely falling to ruin.", "6754": "They made a second attempt in another place, where they laid out two millions.'", "6755": "But this likewise is discontinued;", "6756": "so that, after having been at an immense charge to no purpose, they must still be at a further expense, in order to be accommodated with water.", "6757": "I have examined a fine spring from whence the water may be conveyed over arches (as was attempted in their first design) in such a manner that the higher as well as level and low parts of the city may be supplied.", "6758": "There are still remaining a very few of the old arches;", "6759": "and the square stones, however, employed in the former building, may be used in turning the new arches.", "6760": "I am of opinion part should be raised with brick, as that will be the easier and cheaper material.", "6761": "But that this work may not meet with the same ill-success as the former, it will be necessary to send here an architect, or some one skilled in the con­ struction of this kind of waterworks.", "6762": "And I will venture to say, from the beauty and usefulness of the design, it will be an erection well worthy the splendour of your times.", "6763": "CARE must be taken to supply the city of Nicomedia with water;", "6764": "and that business, I am well persuaded, you will perform with all the diligence you ought.", "6765": "But really it is no less incumbent upon you to examine by whose mis­ conduct it has happened that such large sums have been thrown away upon this, lest they apply the money to private purposes, and the aqueduct in question, like the preceding, should be begun, and afterwards left unfinished.", "6766": "You will let me know the result of your inquiry.", "6767": "THE citizens of Nicea, Sir, are building a theatre, which, though it is not yet finished, has already exhausted, as I am informed (for I have not examined the account myself), above ten millions of sesterces;", "6768": "1 and, what is worse, I fear to no purpose.", "6769": "For either from the foundation being laid in soft, marshy ground, or that the stone itself is light and crumbling, the walls are sinking, and cracked from top to bottom.", "6770": "It deserves your consideration, therefore, whether it would be best to carry on this work, or entirely discon­ tinue it, or rather, perhaps, whether it would not be most prudent absolutely to destroy it:", "6771": "for the buttresses and foun­ dations by means of which it is from time to time kept up appear to me more expensive than solid.", "6772": "Several private per­ sons have undertaken to build the compartment of this theatre at their own expense, some engaging to erect the portico, others the galleries over the pit:", "6773": "' but this design cannot be executed, as the principal building which ought first to be completed is now at a stand.", "6774": "This city is also rebuilding, upon a far more enlarged plan, the gymnasium,3 which was burnt down before my arrival in the province.", "6775": "They have already been at some (and, I rather fear, a fruitless) expense.", "6776": "The structure is not only irregular and ill-proportioned, but the present architect (who, it must be owned, is a rival to the person who was first employed) asserts that the walls, al­ though twenty-two feet4 in thickness, are not strong enough to support the superstructure, as the interstices are filled up with quarrystones, and the walls are not overlaid with brickwork.", "6777": "Also the inhabitants of Claudiopolis* are sink­ ing (I cannot call it erecting) a large public bath, upon a low spot of ground which lies at the foot of a mountain.", "6778": "The fund appropriated for the carrying on of this work arises from the money which those honorary members you were pleased to add to the senate paid (or, at least, are ready to pay whenever I call upon them) for their ad­ mission.*", "6779": "As I am afraid, therefore, the public money in the city of Nicea, and (what is infinitely more valuable than any pecuniary consideration) your bounty in that of Nico­ polis, should be ill applied, I must desire you to send hither an architect to inspect, not only the theatre, but the bath;", "6780": "in order to consider whether, after all the expense which has already been laid out, it will be better to finish them upon the present plan, or alter the one, and remove the other, in as far as may seem necessary:", "6781": "for otherwise we may perhaps throw away our future cost in endeavouring not to lose what we have already expended.", "6782": "You, who are upon the spot, will best be able to con­ eider and determine what is proper to be done concerning the theatre which the inhabitants of Nicea are building;", "6783": "as for myself, it will be sufficient if you let me know your determination.", "6784": "With respect to the particular parts of this theatre which are to be raised at a private charge, you will see those engagements fulfilled when the body of the build­ ing to which they are to be annexed shall be finished.-", "6785": "These paltry Greeks1 are, I know, immoderately fond of gymnastic diversions, and therefore, perhaps, the citizens of Nicea have planned a more magnificent building for this purpose than is necessary;", "6786": "however, they must be content with such as will be sufficient to answer the purpose for which it is intended.", "6787": "I leave it entirely to you to persuade the Claudiopolitani as you shall think proper with regard to their bath, which they have placed, it seems, in a very im­ proper situation.", "6788": "As there is no province that is not fur­ nished with men of skill and ingenuity, you cannot possibly want architects;", "6789": "unless you think it the shortest way to procure them from Rome, when it is generally from Greece that they come to us.", "6790": "WHEN I reflect upon the splendour of your exalted sta­ tion, and the magnanimity of your spirit, nothing, I am persuaded, can be.", "6791": "more suitable to both than to point out to you such works as are worthy of your glorious and immortal name, as being no less useful than magnificent.", "6792": "Bordering upon the territories of the city of Nicomedia is a most extensive lake;", "6793": "over which marbles, fruits, woods, and all kinds of materials, the commodities of the country, are brought over in boats up to the high-road, at little trouble and expense, but from thence are conveyed in car­ riages to the sea-side, at a much greater charge and with great labour.", "6794": "To remedy this inconvenience, many hands will be in request;", "6795": "but upon such an occasion they cannot be wanting:", "6796": "for the country, and particularly the city, is ex­ ceedingly populous;", "6797": "and one may assuredly hope that every person will readily engage in a work which will be of uni­ versal benefit.", "6798": "It only remains then to send hither, if you shall think proper, a surveyor or an architect, in order to examine whether the lake lies above the level of the sea;", "6799": "the engineers of this province being of opinion that the former is higher by forty cubits.", "6800": "1", "6801": "I find there is in the neighbourhood of this place a large canal, which was cut by a king of this country;", "6802": "but as it is left unfinished, it is uncertain whether it was for the purpose of draining the adjacent fields, or making a communication between the lake and the river.", "6803": "It is equally doubtful too whether the death of the king, or the despair of being able to accomplish the design, prevented the completion of it.", "6804": "If this was the rea­ son, I am so much the more eager and warmly desirous, for the sake of your illustrious character (and I hope you will pardon me the ambition), that you may have the glory of executing what kings could only attempt.", "6805": "THERE is something in the scheme you propose of opening a communication between the lake and the sea, which may, perhaps, tempt me to consent.", "6806": "But you must first carefully examine the situation of this body of water, what quantity it contains, and from whence it is supplied;", "6807": "lest, by giving it an opening into the sea, it should be totally drained.", "6808": "You may apply to Calpurnius Macer for an engineer, and I will also send you from hence some one skilled in works of this nature.", "6809": "UPON examining into the public expenses of the city of Byzantium, which, I find, are extremely great, I was in­ formed, Sir, that the appointments of the ambassador whom they send yearly to you with their homage, and the decree which passes in the senate upon that occasion, amount to twelve thousand sesterces.", "6810": "1", "6811": "But knowing the generous maxims of your government, I thought proper to send the decree without the ambassador, that, at the same time they discharged their public duty to you, their expense incurred in the manner of paying it might be lightened.", "6812": "This city is likewise taxed with the sum of three thousand sesterces' towards defraying the expense of an envoy, whom they annually send to compliment the governor of Moesia:", "6813": "this expense I have also directed to be spared.", "6814": "I beg, Sir, you would deign either to confirm my judgment or correct my error in these points, by acquainting me with your senti­ ments.", "6815": "I ENTIRELY approve, my dearest Secundus, of your having excused the Byzantines that expense of twelve thousand sesterces in sending an ambassador to me.", "6816": "I shall esteem their duty as sufficiently paid, though I only receive the act of their senate through your hands.", "6817": "The governor of Moesia must likewise excuse them if they compliment him at a less expense.", "6818": "I BEG, Sir, you would settle a doubt I have concerning your diplomas;", "6819": "1 whether you think proper that those diplomas the dates of which are expired shall continue in force, and for how long?", "6820": "For I am apprehensive I may, through ignorance, either confirm such of these instruments as are illegal or prevent the effect of those which are necessary.", "6821": "THE diplomas whose dates are expired must by no means be made use of.", "6822": "For which reason it is an inviolable rule with me to send new instruments of this kind into all the provinces before they are immediately wanted.", "6823": "UPON intimating, Sir, my intention to the city of Apamea,1 of examining into the state of their public dues, their revenue and expenses, they told me they were all extremely willing I should inspect their accounts, but that no proconsul had ever yet looked them over, as they had a privilege (and that of a very ancient date) of administering the affairs of their corporation in the manner they thought proper.", "6824": "I re­ quired them to draw up a memorial of what they then as­ serted, which I transmit to you precisely as I received it;", "6825": "though I am sensible it contains several things foreign to the question.", "6826": "I beg you will deign to instruct me as to how I am to act in this affair, for I should be extremely sorry either to exceed or fall short of the duties of my commission.", "6827": "THE memorial of the Apameans annexed to your letter has saved me the necessity of considering the reasons they suggest why the former proconsuls forbore to inspect their accounts, since they are willing to submit them to your ex­ amination.", "6828": "Their honest compliance deserves to be re­ warded;", "6829": "and they may be assured the enquiry you are to make in pursuance of my orders shall be with a full reserve to their privileges.", "6830": "THE Nicomedians, Sir, before my arrival in this province, had begun to build a new forum adjoining their former, in a corner of which stands an ancient temple dedicated to the mother of the gods.", "6831": "1", "6832": "This fabric must either be re­ paired or removed, and for this reason chiefly, because it is a much lower building than that very lofty one which is now in process of erection.", "6833": "Upon enquiry whether this temple had been consecrated, I was informed that their ceremonies of dedication differ from ours.", "6834": "You will be pleased therefore, Sir, to consider whether a temple which has not been consecrated according to our rites may be removed,2 consistently with the reverence due to religion:", "6835": "for, if there should be no objection from that quarter, the removal in every other respect would be extremely con­ venient.", "6836": "You may without scruple, my dearest Secundus, if the situation requires it, remove the temple of the mother of the gods, from the place where it now stands, to any other spot more convenient.", "6837": "You need be under no difficulty with respect to the act of dedication;", "6838": "for the ground of a foreign city3 is not capable of receiving that kind of consecration which is sanctified by our laws.", "6839": "WE have celebrated, Sir (with those sentiments of joy your virtues so justly merit), the day of your accession to the empire, which was also its preservation, imploring the gods to preserve you in health and prosperity;", "6840": "for upon your welfare the security and repose of the world depends.", "6841": "I renewed at the same time the oath of allegiance at the head of the army, which repeated it after me in the usual form, the people of the province zealously concurring in the same oath.", "6842": "YOUR letter, my dearest Secundus, was extremely accept­ able, as it informed me of the zeal and affection with which you, together with the army and the provincials, solemnised the day of my accession to the empire.", "6843": "THE debts which we are owing to the public are, by the prudence, Sir, of your counsels, and the care of my admin­ istration, either actually paid in or now being collected:", "6844": "but I am afraid the money must lie unemployed.", "6845": "For as on one side there are few or no opportunities of purchasing land, so, on the other, one cannot meet with any person who is willing to borrow of the public1 (especially at 12 per cent. interest) when they can raise money upon the same terms from private sources.", "6846": "You will consider then, Sir, whether it may not be advisable, in order to invite responsible persons to take this money, to lower the interest;", "6847": "or if that scheme should not succeed, to place it in the hands of the decurii, upon their giving sufficient security to the public.", "6848": "And though they should not be willing to receive it, yet as the rate of interest will be diminished, the hard­ ship will be so much the less.", "6849": "I AGREE with you, my dear Pliny, that there seems to be no other method of facilitating the placing out of the public money than by lowering the interest;", "6850": "the measure of which you will determine according to the number of the borrow­ ers.", "6851": "But to compel persons to receive it who are not dis­ posed to do so, when possibly they themselves may have no opportunity of employing it, is by no means consistent with the justice of my government.", "6852": "I RETURN you my warmest acknowledgments, Sir, that, among the many important occupations in which you are engaged you have condescended to be my guide on those points on which I have consulted you:", "6853": "a favour which I must now again beseech you to grant me.", "6854": "A certain person presented himself with a complaint that his ad­ versaries, who had been banished for three years by the illustrious Servilius Calvus, still remained in the province:", "6855": "they, on the contrary, affirmed that Calvus had revoked their sentence, and produced his edict to that effect.", "6856": "I thought it necessary therefore to refer the whole affair to you.", "6857": "For as I have your express orders not to restore any person who has been sentenced to banishment either by myself or others so I have no, directions with respect to those who, having been banished by some of my prede­ cessors in this government, have by them also been restored.", "6858": "It is necessary for me, therefore, to be- you would inform me, Sir, how I am to act with regard to the above-mentioned persons, as well as others, who, after having been con­ demned to perpetual banishment, have been found in the province without permission to return;", "6859": "for cases of that nature have likewise fallen under my cognisance.", "6860": "A person was brought before me who had been sentenced to perpetual exile by the proconsul Julius Bassus, but knowing that the acts of Bassus, during his administration, had been rescinded, and that the senate had granted leave to all those who had fallen under his condemnation of appealing from his decision at any time within the space of two years, I enquired of this man whether he had, accordingly, stated his case to the proconsul.", "6861": "He replied he had not.", "6862": "I beg then you would inform me whether you would have him sent back into exile or whether you think some more severe and what kind of punishment should be inflicted upon him, and such others who may hereafter be found under the same circumstances.", "6863": "I have annexed to my letter the decree of Calvus, and the edict by which the persons above-mentioned were restored, as also the decree of Bassus.", "6864": "I WILL let you know my determination concerning those exiles which were banished for three years by the pro­ consul P. Servilius Calvus, and soon afterwards restored to the province by his edict, when I shall have informed my­ self from him of the reasons of this proceeding.", "6865": "With respect to that person who was sentenced to perpetual banishment by Julius Bassus, yet continued to remain in the province, without making his appeal if he thought himself aggrieved (though he had two years given him for that purpose), I would have sent in chains to my praetorian prefects:", "6866": "1 for, only to remand him back to a punishment which he has contumaciously eluded will by no means be a sufficient punishment.", "6867": "WHEN I cited the judges, Sir, to attend me at a sessions' which I was going to hold, Flavius Archippus claimed the privilege of being excused as exercising the profession of a philosopher.'", "6868": "It was alleged by some who were present that he ought not only to be excused from that office, but even struck out of the rolls of judges, and remanded back to the punishment from which he had escaped, by breaking his chains.", "6869": "At the same time a sentence of the proconsul Velius Paullus was read, by which it appeared that Ar­ chippus had been condemned to the mines for forgery.", "6870": "He had nothing to produce in proof of this sentence having ever been reversed.", "6871": "He alleged, however, in favour of his restitution, a petition which he presented to Domitian, together with a letter from that prince, and a decree of the Prusensians in his honour.", "6872": "To these he subjoined a letter which he had received from you;", "6873": "as also an edict and a letter of your august father confirming the grants which had been made to him by Domitian.", "6874": "For these reasons, notwithstanding crimes of so atrocious a nature were laid to his charge, I did not think proper to determine anything concerning him, without first consulting with you, as it is an affair which seems to merit your particular de­ cision.", "6875": "I have transmitted to you, with this letter, the sev­ eral allegations on both sides.", "6876": "\"", "6877": "Flavius Archippus the philosopher has prevailed with me to give an order that six hundred thousand sesterces3 be laid out in the purchase of an estate for the support of him and his family, in the neighbourhood of Prusias,4 his native country.", "6878": "Let this be accordingly done;", "6879": "and place that sum to the account of my benefactions.\"“", "6880": "I recommend, my dear Maximus, to your protection that worthy philosopher Archippus;", "6881": "a person whose moral conduct is agreeable to the principles of the philosophy he professes;", "6882": "and I would have you pay entire regard to what­ ever he shall reasonably request.", "6883": "\"There are some points no doubt, Quirites, concerning which the happy tenour of my government is a sufficient indication of my sentiments;", "6884": "and a good prince need not give an express declaration in matters wherein his inten­ tion cannot but be clearly understood.", "6885": "Every citizen in the empire will bear me witness that I gave up my private repose to the security of the public, and in order that I might have the pleasure of dispensing new bounties of my own, as also of confirming those which had been granted by predecessors.", "6886": "But lest the memory of him6 who con­ ferred these grants, or the diffidence of those who received them, should occasion any interruption to the public joy, I thought it as necessary as it is agreeable to me to obviate these suspicions by assuring them of my indulgence.", "6887": "I do not wish any man who has obtained a private or a public privilege from one of the former emperors to imagine he is to be deprived of such a privilege, merely that he may owe the restoration of it to me;", "6888": "nor need any who have received the gratifications of imperial favour petition me to have them confirmed.", "6889": "Rather let them leave me at leisure for conferring new grants, under the assur­ ance that I am only to be solicited for those bounties which have not already been obtained, and which the happier fortune of the empire has put it in my power to bestow.\"“", "6890": "Since I have publicly decreed that all acts begun and accomplished in former reigns should be confirmed, the let­ ters of Domitian must remain valid.\"", "6891": "FLAVIUS ARCHIPPUS has conjured me, by all my vows for your prosperity, and by your immortal glory, that I would transmit to you the memorial which he presented to me.", "6892": "I could not refuse a request couched in such terms;", "6893": "how­ ever, I acquainted the prosecutrix with this my intention, from whom I have also received a memorial on her part.", "6894": "I have annexed them both to this letter;", "6895": "that by hearing, as it were, each party, you may the better be enabled to decide.", "6896": "IT is possible that Domitian might have been ignorant of the circumstances in which Archippus was when he wrote the letter so much to that philosopher's credit.", "6897": "However, it is more agreeable to my disposition to suppose that prince designed he should be restored to his former situation;", "6898": "especially since he so often had the honour of a statue de­ creed to him by those who could not be ignorant of the sentence pronounced against him by the proconsul Paullus.", "6899": "But I do not mean to intimate, my dear Pliny, that if any new charge should be brought against him, you should be the less disposed to hear his accusers.", "6900": "I have examined the memorial of his prosecutrix, Furia Prima, as well as that of Archippus himself, which you sent with your last letter.", "6901": "THE apprehensions you express, Sir, that the lake will be in danger of being entirely drained if a communication should be opened between that and the sea, by means of the river, are agreeable to that prudence and forethought you so eminently possess;", "6902": "but I think I have found a method to obviate that inconvenience.", "6903": "A channel may be cut from the lake up to the river so as not quite to join them, leaving just a narrow strip of land between, pre­ serving the lake;", "6904": "by this means it will not only be kept quite separate from the river, but all the same purposes will be answered as if they were united:", "6905": "for it will be extremely easy to convey over that little intervening ridge whatever goods shall be brought down by the canal.", "6906": "This is a scheme which may be pursued, if it should be found necessary;", "6907": "but I hope there will be no occasion to have re­ course to it.", "6908": "For, in the first place, the lake itself is pretty deep;", "6909": "and in the next, by damming up the river which runs from it on the opposite side and turning its course as we shall find expedient, the same quantity of water may be retained.", "6910": "Besides, there are several brooks near the place where it is proposed the channel shall be cut which, if skilfully collected, will supply the lake with water in pro­ portion to what it shall discharge.", "6911": "But if you should rather approve of the channel's being extended farther and cut narrower, and so conveyed directly into the sea, without running into the river, the reflux of the tide will return whatever it receives from the lake.", "6912": "After all, if the nature of the place should not admit of any of these schemes, the course of the water may be checked by sluices.", "6913": "These, how­ ever, and many other particulars, will be more skilfully examined into by the engineer, whom, indeed, Sir, you ought to send, according to your promise, for it is an enter­ prise well worthy of your attention and magnificence.", "6914": "In the meanwhile, I have written to the illustrious Calpurnius Macer, in pursuance of your orders, to send me the most skilful engineer to be had.", "6915": "IT is evident, my dearest Secundus, that neither your prudence nor your care has been wanting in this affair of the lake, since, in order to render it of more general benefit, you have provided so many expedients against the danger of its being drained.", "6916": "I leave it to your own choice to pur­ sue whichever of the schemes shall be thought most proper.", "6917": "Calpurnius Macer will furnish you, no doubt, with an engineer, as artificers of that kind are not wanting in his province.", "6918": "A VERY considerable question, Sir, in which the whole province is interested, has been lately started, concerning the state!", "6919": "and maintenance of deserted children.", "6920": "2", "6921": "I have examined the constitutions of former princes upon this head, but not finding anything in them relating, either in general or particular, to the Bithynians, I thought it necessary to apply to you for your directions:", "6922": "for in a point which seems to require the special interposition of your authority, I could not content myself with following prec­ edents.", "6923": "An edict of the emperor Augustus (as pretended) was read to me, concerning one Annia;", "6924": "as also a letter from Vespasian to the Lacedaemonians, and another from Titus to the same, with one likewise from him to the Achaeans, also some letters from Domitian, directed to the proconsuls Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, together with one from that prince to the Lacedaemonians:", "6925": "but I have not transmitted them to you, as they were not correct (and some of them too of doubtful authenticity), and also because I im­ agine the true copies are preserved in your archives.", "6926": "THE question concerning children who were exposed by their parents, and afterwards preserved by others, and educated in a state of servitude, though born free, has been frequently discussed;", "6927": "but I do not find in the constitutions of the princes my predecessors any general regulation upon this head, extending to all the provinces.", "6928": "There are, indeed, some rescripts of Domitian to Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, which ought to be observed;", "6929": "but Bithynia is not comprehended in the provinces therein mentioned.", "6930": "I am of opinion therefore that the claims of those who assert their right of freedom upon this footing should be allowed;", "6931": "with­ out obliging them to purchase their liberty by repaying the money advanced for their maintenance.", "6932": "1HAVING been petitioned by some persons to grant them the liberty (agreeably to the practice of former proconsuls) of removing the relics of their deceased relations, upon the suggestion that either their monuments were decayed by age or ruined by the inundations of the river, or for other reasons of the same kind, I thought proper, Sir, know­ ing that in cases of this nature it is usual at Rome to apply to the college of priests, to consult you, who are the sovereign of that sacred order, as to how you would have me act in this case.", "6933": "IT will be a hardship upon the provincials to oblige them to address themselves to the college of priests whenever they may have just reasons for removing the ashes of their ancestors.", "6934": "In this case, therefore, it will be better you should follow the example of the governors your predecessors, and grant or deny them this liberty as you shall see reasonable.", "6935": "I HAVE enquired, Sir, at Prusa, for a proper place on which to erect the bath you were pleased to allow that city to build, and I have found one to my satisfaction.", "6936": "It is upon the site where formerly, I am told, stood a very beautiful mansion, but which is now entirely fallen into ruins.", "6937": "By fixing upon that spot, we shall gain the advan­ tage of ornamenting the city in a part which at present is exceedingly deformed, and enlarging it at the same time without removing any of the buildings;", "6938": "only restoring one which is fallen to decay.", "6939": "There are some circumstances attending this structure of which it is proper I should inform you.", "6940": "Claudius Polyaenus bequeathed it to the emperor Claudius Caesar, with directions that a temple should be erected to that prince in a colonnade-court, and that the remainder of the house should be let in apartments.", "6941": "The city received the rents for a considerable time;", "6942": "but partly by its having been plundered, and partly by its being neg­ lected, the whole house, colonnade-court, and all, is entirely gone to ruin, and there is now scarcely anything remaining of it but the ground upon which it stood.", "6943": "If you shall think proper, Sir, either to give or sell this spot of ground to the city, as it lies so conveniently for their purpose, they will receive it as a most particular favour.", "6944": "I intend, with your permission, to place the bath in the vacant area, and to extend a range of porticoes with seats in that part where the former edifice stood.", "6945": "This new erection I purpose dedi­ cating to you, by whose bounty it will rise with all the elegance and magnificence worthy of your glorious name.", "6946": "I have sent you a copy of the will, by which, though it is inaccurate, you will see that Polyaenus left several articles of ornament for the embellishment of this house;", "6947": "but these also are lost with all the rest:", "6948": "I will, however, make the strictest enquiry after them that I am able.", "6949": "I HAVE no objection to the Prusenses making use of the ruined court and house, which you say are untenanted, for the erection of their bath.", "6950": "But it is not sufficiently clear by your letter whether the temple in the centre of the colonnade-court was actually dedicated to Claudius or not;", "6951": "for if it were, it is still consecrated ground.", "6952": "1I HAVE been pressed by some persons to take upon my­ self the enquiry of causes relating to claims of freedom by birth-right, agreeably to a rescript of Domitian's to Minucius Rufus, and the practice of former proconsuls.", "6953": "But upon casting my eye on the decree of the senate concerning cases of this nature, I find it only mentions the proconsular provinces.", "6954": "2", "6955": "I have therefore, Sir, de­ ferred interfering in this affair, till I shall receive your instructions as to how you would have me proceed.", "6956": "IF you will send me the decree of the senate, which occasioned your doubt, I shall be able to judge whether it is proper you should take upon yourself the enquiry of causes relating to claims of freedom by birth-right.", "6957": "JULIUS LARGUS, of Ponus1 (a person whom I never saw nor indeed ever heard his name till lately), in confidence, Sir, of your distinguishing judgment in my favour, has entrusted me with the execution of the last instance of his loyalty towards you.", "6958": "He has left me, by his will, his estate upon trust, in the first place to receive out of it fifty thousand sesterces2 for my own use, and to apply the re­ mainder for the benefit of the cities of Heraclea and Tios,8 either by erecting some public edifice dedicated to your honour or instituting athletic games, according as I shall judge proper.", "6959": "These games are to be celebrated every five years, and to be called Trajan's games.", "6960": "My principal reason for acquainting you with this bequest is that I may receive your directions which of the respective alternatives to choose.", "6961": "By the prudent choice Julius Largus has made of a trustee, one would imagine he had known you perfectly well.", "6962": "You will consider then what will most tend to perpetuate his memory, under the circumstances of the respective cities, and make your option accordingly.", "6963": "You acted agreeably, Sir, to your usual prudence and foresight in ordering the illustrious Calpurnius Macer to send a legionary centurion to Byzantium:", "6964": "you will con- sider whether the city of Juliopolis1 does not deserve the same regard, which, though it is extremely small, sustains very great burthens, and is so much the more exposed to injuries as it is less capable of resisting them.", "6965": "Whatever benefits you shall confer upon that city will in effect be advantageous to the whole country;", "6966": "for it is situated at the entrance of Bithynia, and is the town through which all who travel into this province generally pass.", "6967": "THE circumstances of the city of Byzantium are such, by the great confluence of strangers to it, that I held it in­ cumbent upon me, and consistent with the customs of former reigns, to send thither a legionary centurion's guard to preserve the privileges of that state.", "6968": "But if we should distinguish the city of Juliopolis in the same way, it will be introducing a precedent for many others, whose claim to that favour will rise in proportion to their want of strength.", "6969":

have enjoined, let them be instantly corrected;", "6971": "or if they happen to be soldiers, and their crimes should be too enormous for immediate chas­ tisement, I would have them sent to their

law of Pompey's2 concerning the Bithynians, it is enacted, Sir, that no person shall be a magistrate, or be chosen into the senate, under the age of thirty.", "6974": "By the same law it is declared that those who have exercised the office of magistrate are qualified to be members of the senate.", "6975": "Subsequent to this law, the emperor Augustus published an edict, by which it was ordained that persons of the age of twenty-two should be capable of being magistrates.", "6976": "The question therefore is whether those who have exercised the functions of a magistrate before the age of thirty may be legally chosen into the senate by the censors?", "6977": "2", "6978": "And if so, whether, by the same kind of construction, they may be elected senators, at the age which entitles them to be magistrates, though they should net actually have borne any office?", "6979": "A custom which, it seems, has hitherto been observed, and is said to be expedient, as it is rather better that persons of noble birth should be admitted into the senate than those of plebeian rank.", "6980": "The censors elect having desired my sentiments upon this point, I was of opinion that both by the law of Pompey and the edict of Augustus those who had exercised the magistracy before the age of thirty might be chosen into the senate;", "6981": "and for this reason, because the edict allows the office of magistrate to be undertaken before thirty;", "6982": "and the law declares that whoever has been a magistrate should be eligible for the senate.", "6983": "But with respect to those who never discharged any office in the state, though they were of the age required for that purpose, I had some doubt:", "6984": "and therefore, Sir, I apply to you for your directions.", "6985": "I have

into the senate of their respective cities.", "6987": "But I think that they who are under thirty years of age, and have not discharged the function of a magis­ trate, cannot, upon pretence that in

apartments in Prusa, at the foot of Olympus, with the in­ tention of leaving that city the same day, the magistrate Asclepiades informed me that Eumolpus had appealed to me from a motion which

he had not acted in the manner he ought.", "6993": "He added, at the same time, that in this building, in which your statue is erected, the bodies of Dion's wife and son are entombed,2 and urged me to hear this cause in the public court of judicature.", "6994": "Upon my at once assenting to his request, and deferring my journey for that purpose, he desired a longer day in order to prepare matters for hearing, and that I would try this cause in some other city.", "6995": "I appointed the city of Nicea;", "6996": "where, when I had taken my seat, the same Eumolpus, pre­ tending not to be yet sufficiently instructed, moved that the trial might be again put off:", "6997": "Dion, on the contrary, insisted it should be heard.", "6998": "They debated this point very fully on both sides, and entered a little into the merits of the cause;", "6999": "when being of opinion that it was reasonable it should be adjourned, and thinking it proper to consult with you in an affair which was of consequence in point of precedent, I directed them to exhibit the articles of their respective alle­ gations in writing;", "7000": "for I was desirous you should judge from their own representations of the state of the question between them.", "7001": "Dion promised to comply with this direction and Eumolpus also assured me he would draw up a memorial of what he had to allege on the part of the community.", "7002": "But he added that, being only concerned as advocate on behalf of Archippus, whose instructions he had laid before me, he had no charge to bring with respect to the sepulchres.", "7003": "Archippus, however, for whom Eumolpus was counsel here, as at Prusa, assured me he would himself present a charge in form upon this head.", "7004": "But neither Eumolpus nor Archip­ pus

of a court, which is enclosed with a colonnade.", "7008": "Deign, therefore, I entreat you, Sir, to direct my judgment in the determination of this cause above all others as it is a point to which the public is greatly atten­ tive, and necessarily so.", "7009": "since the fact is not only acknowl­ edged, but countenanced by many precedents.", "7010": "You well know, my dearest Secundus, that it is my standing maxim not to create an awe of my person by severe and rigorous measures, and by construing every slight offence into an act of treason;", "7011": "you had no reason, therefore, to hesitate a moment upon the point concerning which you thought proper to consult me.", "7012": "Without entering therefore into the merits of that question (to which I would by no means give any attention, though there were ever so many instances of the same kind), I recommend to your care the examination of Dion's accounts relating to the public works which he has finished;", "7013": "as it is a case

uttering impreca­ tions at the same time against the name of Christ.", "7069": "They affirmed the whole of their guilt, or their error, was, that they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity, binding them­ selves by a solemn oath, not for the purposes of any wicked design, but never to commit any fraud, theft, or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up;", "7070": "after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.", "7071": "From this custom, however, they de­ sisted after the publication of my edict, by which, according to your commands, I forbade the meeting of any assemblies.", "7072": "After receiving this account, I judged it so much the more necessary to endeavor to extort the real truth, by putting two female slaves to the torture, who were said to offici­ ate8 in their religious rites:", "7073": "but all I could discover was evidence of an absurd and extravagant superstition.", "7074": "I deemed it expedient, therefore, to adjourn all further pro­ ceedings, in order to consult you.", "7075": "For it appears to be a matter highly deserving your consideration, more espe­ cially as great numbers must be involved in the danger of these prosecutions, which have already extended, and are still likely to extend, to persons of all ranks and ages, and even of both sexes.", "7076": "In fact, this contagious superstition is not confined to the cities only, but has spread its infec­ tion among the neighbouring villages and country.", "7077": "Never­ theless, it still seems possible to restrain its progress.", "7078": "The temples, at least, which were once almost deserted, begin now to be frequented;", "7079": "and the sacred rites, after a long intermission, are again revived;", "7080": "while there is a gen­ eral demand for the victims, which till lately found very few purchasers.", "7081": "From all this it is easy to conjecture what numbers might be reclaimed if a general pardon were granted to those who shall repent of their error.", "7082": "You have adopted the right course, my dearest Secundus, in investigating the charges against the Christians who were brought before you.", "7083": "It is not possible to lay down any general rule for all such cases.", "7084": "Do not go out of your way to look for them.", "7085": "If indeed they should be brought before you, and the crime is proved, they must be punished ;", "7086": "l with the restriction, however, that where the party denies he is a Christian, and shall make it evident that he is not, by invoking our gods, let him (notwithstanding any former suspicion) be pardoned upon his repentance.", "7087": "Anonymous informations ought not to be received in any sort of prose­ cution.", "7088": "It is introducing a very dangerous precedent, and is quite foreign to the spirit of our age.", "7089": "THE elegant and beautiful city of Amastris,' Sir, has, among other principal constructions, a very fine street and of considerable length, on one entire side of which runs what is called indeed a river, but in fact is no other than a vile common sewer, extremely offensive to the eye, and at the same time very pestilential on account of its noxious smell.", "7090": "It will be advantageous, therefore, in point of health, as well as decency, to have it covered;", "7091": "which shall be done with your permission:", "7092": "as I will take care, on my part, that money be not wanting for executing so noble and necessary a work.", "7093": "IT is highly reasonable, my dearest Secundus, if the water which runs through the city of Amastris is preju­ dicial, while uncovered, to the health of the inhabitants, that it should be covered up.", "7094": "I am well assured you will, with your usual application, take care that the money necessary for this work shall not be wanting.", "7095": "WE have celebrated, Sir, with great joy and festivity, those votive solemnities which were publicly proclaimed as formerly, and renewed them the present year, accom­ panied by the soldiers and provincials, who zealously joined with us in imploring the gods that they would be graciously pleased to preserve you and the republic in that state of prosperity which your many and great virtues, particularly your piety and reverence towards them, so justly merit.", "7096": "IT was agreeable to me to learn by your letter that the army and the provincials seconded you, with the most joyful unanimity, in those vows which you paid and re­ newed to the immortal gods for my preservation and pros­ perity.", "7097": "WE have celebrated, with all the warmth of that pious zeal we justly ought, the day on which, by a most happy succession, the protection of mankind was committed over into your hands;", "7098": "recommending to the gods, from whom you received the empire, the object of your public vows and congratulations.", "7099": "I WAS extremely well pleased to be informed by your letter that you had, at the head of the soldiers and the provincials, solemnised my accession to the empire with all due joy and zeal.", "7100": "VALERIUS PAULINUS, Sir, having bequeathed to me the right of patronage1 over all his freedmen, except one, I intreat you to grant the freedom of Rome to three of them.", "7101": "To desire you to extend this favour to all of them would, I fear, be too unreasonable a trespass upon your indul­ gence;", "7102": "which, in proportion as I have amply experienced, I ought to be so much the more cautious in troubling.", "7103": "The persons for whom I make this request are C. Valerius Astraeus, C. Valerius Dionysius, and C. Valerius Aper.", "7104": "You act most generously in so early soliciting in favour of those whom Valerius Paulinus has confided to your trust.", "7105": "I have accordingly granted the freedom of the city to such of his freedmen for whom you requested it, and have directed the patent to be registered:", "7106": "I am ready to confer the same on the rest, whenever you shall desire me.P. ATTIUS AQUILA, a centurion of the sixth equestrian cohort, requested me, Sir, to transmit his petition to you, in favour of his daughter.", "7107": "I thought it would be unkind to refuse him this service, knowing, as I do, with what patience and kindness you attend to the petitions of the soldiers.", "7108": "I HAVE read the petition of P. Attius Aquila, centurion of the sixth equestrian cohort, which you sent to me;", "7109": "and in compliance with his request, I have conferred upon his daughter the freedom of the city of Rome.", "7110": "I send you at the same time the patent, which you will deliver to him.", "7111": "I REQUEST, Sir, your directions with respect to the recover­ ing those debts which are due to the cities of Bithynia and Pontus, either for rent, or goods sold, or upon any other consideration.", "7112": "I find they have a privilege conceded to them by several proconsuls, of being preferred to other creditors;", "7113": "and this custom has prevailed as if it had been established by law.", "7114": "Your prudence, I imagine, will think it necessary to enact some settled rule, by which their rights may always be secured.", "7115": "For the edicts of others, how wisely soever founded, are but feeble and temporary ordinances, unless confirmed and sanctioned by your authority.", "7116": "THE right which the cities either of Pontus or Bithynia claim relating to the recovery of debts of whatever kind, due to their several communities, must be determined agree­ ably to their respective laws.", "7117": "Where any of these com­ munities enjoy the privilege of being preferred to other creditors, it must be maintained;", "7118": "but, where no such privi­ lege prevails, it is not just I should establish one, in preju­ dice of private property.", "7119": "THE solicitor to the treasury of the city of Amisis insti­ tuted a claim, Sir, before me against Julius Piso of about forty thousand denarii,1 presented to him by the public above twenty years ago, with the consent of the general council and assembly of the city:", "7120": "and he founded his demand upon certain of your edicts, by which donations of this kind are prohibited.", "7121": "Piso, on the other hand, asserted that he had conferred large sums of money upon the community, and, indeed, had thereby expended almost the whole of his estate.", "7122": "He insisted upon the length of time which had intervened since this donation, and hoped that he should not be com­ pelled, to the ruin of the remainder of his fortunes, to refund a present which had been granted him long since, in return for many good offices he had done the city.", "7123": "For this reason, Sir, I thought it necessary to suspend giving any judgment in this cause till I shall receive your directions.", "7124": "THOUGH by my edicts I have ordained that no largesses shall be given out of the public money, yet, that numberless private persons may not be disturbed in the secure pos­ session of their fortunes, those donations which have been made long since ought not to be called in question or revoked.", "7125": "We will not therefore enquire into anything that has been transacted in this affair so long ago as twenty years;", "7126": "for I would be no less attentive to secure the repose of every private man than to preserve the treasure of every public community.", "7127": "THE Pompeian law, Sir, which is observed in Pontus and Bithynia, does not direct that any money for their admission shall be paid in by those who are elected into the senate by the censors.", "7128": "It has, however, been usual for such members as have been admitted into those assemblies, in pursuance of the privilege which you were pleased to grant to some par­ ticular cities, of receiving above their legal number, to pay one or two thousand denarii* on their election.", "7129": "Subsequent to this, the proconsul Anicius Maximus ordained (though in­ deed his edict related to some few cities only) that those who were elected by the censors should also pay into the treasury a certain sum, which varied in different places.", "7130": "It remains, therefore, for your consideration whether it would not be proper to settle a certain sum for each member who is elected into the councils to pay upon his entrance;", "7131": "for it well be­ comes you, whose every word and action deserves to be im­ mortalized, to establish laws that shall endure for ever.", "7132": "I CAN give no general directions applicable to all the cities of Bithynia, in relation to those who are elected members of their respective councils, whether they shall pay an hon­ orary fee upon their admittance or not.", "7133": "I think that the safest method which can be pursued is to follow the particu­ lar laws of each city;", "7134": "and I also think that the censors ought to make the sum less for those who are chosen into the senate contrary to their inclinations than for the rest.", "7135": "THE Pompeian law, Sir, allows the Bithynians to give the freedom of their respective cities to any person they think proper, provided he is not a foreigner, but native of some of the cities of this province.", "7136": "The same law specifies the par­ ticular causes for which the censors may expel any member the senate, but makes no mention of foreigners.", "7137": "Certain of the censors therefore have desired my opinion whether they ought to expel a member if he should happen to be a for­ eigner.", "7138": "But I thought it necessary to receive your instruc­ tions in this case;", "7139": "not only because the law, though it for­ bids foreigners to be admitted citizens, does not direct that a senator shall be expelled for the same reason, but because I am informed that in every city in the province a great number of the senators are foreigners.", "7140": "If, therefore, this clause of the law, which seems to be antiquated by a long custom to the contrary, should be enforced, many cities, as well as private persons, must be injured by it.", "7141": "I have an­ nexed the heads of this law to my letter.", "7142": "You might well be doubtful, my dearest Secundus, what reply to give to the censors, who consulted you concerning their right to elect into the senate foreign citizens, though of the same province.", "7143": "The authority of the law on one side, and long custom prevailing against it on the other, might justly occasion you to hesitate.", "7144": "The proper mean to observe in this case will be to make no change in what is past, but to allow those senators who are already elected, though con­ trary to law, to keep their seats, to whatever city they may belong;", "7145": "in all future elections, however, to pursue the direc­ tions of the Pompeian law:", "7146": "for to give it a retrospective operation would necessarily introduce great confusion.", "7147": "IT is customary here upon any person taking the manly robe, solemnising his marriage, entering upon the office of a magistrate, or dedicating any public work, to invite the whole senate, together with a considerable part of the com­ monalty, and distribute to each of the company one or two denarii.", "7148": "1", "7149": "I request you to inform me whether you think proper this ceremony should be observed, or how far you approve of it.", "7150": "For myself, though I am of opinion that upon some occasions, especially those of public festivals, this kind of invitation may be permitted, yet, when carried so far as to draw together a thousand persons, and sometimes more, it seems to be going beyond a reasonable number, and has somewhat the appearance of ambitious largesses.", "7151": "You very justly apprehended that those public invitations which extend to an immoderate number of people, and where the dole is distributed, not singly to a few acquaintances, but, as it were, to whole collective bodies, may be turned to the factious purposes of ambition.", "7152": "But I appointed you to your present government, fully relying upon your prudence, and in the persuasion that you would take proper measures for regulating the manners and settling the peace of the province.", "7153": "THE athletic victors, Sir, in the Iselastic1 games, conceive that the stipend you have established for the conquerors be­ comes due from the day they are crowned:", "7154": "for it is not at all material, they say, what time they were triumphantly conducted into their country, but when they merited that honour.", "7155": "On the contrary, when I consider the meaning of the term Iselastic, I am strongly inclined to think that it is intended the stipend should commence from the time of their public entry.", "7156": "They likewise petition to be allowed the treat you give at those combats which you have converted into Iselastic, though they were conquerors before the appoint­ ment of that institution:", "7157": "for it is but reasonable, they assert, that they should receive the reward in this instance, as they are deprived of it at those games which have been divested of the honour of being Iselastic, since their victory.", "7158": "But I am very doubtful, whether a retrospect should be admitted in the case in question, and a reward given, to which the claim- ants had no right at the time they obtained the victory.", "7159": "I beg, therefore, you would be pleased to direct my judgment in these points, by explaining the intention of your own bene­ factions.", "7160": "THE stipend appointed for the conqueror in the Iselastic games ought not, I think, to commence till he makes his triumphant entry into his city.", "7161": "Nor are the prizes, at those combats which I thought proper to make Iselastic, to be ex­ tended backwards to those who were victors before that alteration took place.", "7162": "With regard to the plea which these athletic combatants urge, that they ought to receive the Iselastic prize at those combats which have been made Ise­ lastic subsequent to their conquests, as they are denied it in the same case where the games have ceased to be so, it proves nothing in their favour;", "7163": "for notwithstanding any new arrangements which has been made relating to these games, they are not called upon to return the recompense which they received prior to such alteration.", "7164": "I HAVE hitherto never, Sir, granted an order for post- chaises to any person, or upon any occasion, but in affairs that relate to your administration.", "7165": "I find myself, however, at present under a sort of necessity of breaking through this fixed rule.", "7166": "My wife having received an account of her grandfather's death, and being desirous to wait upon her aunt with all possible expedition, I thought it would be un­ kind to deny her the use of this privilege;", "7167": "as the grace of so tender an office consists in the early discharge of it, and as I well knew a journey which was founded in filial piety could not fail of your approbation.", "7168": "I should think myself highly ungrateful therefore, were I not to acknowledge that, among other great obligations which I owe to your indulgence, I have this in particular, that, in confidence of your favour, I have ventured to do, without consulting you, what would have been too late had I waited for your consent.", "7169": "You did me justice, my dearest Secundus, in confiding in my affection towards you.", "7170": "Without doubt, if you had waited for my consent to forward your wife in her journey by means of those warrants which I have entrusted to your care, the use of them would not have answered your purpose;", "7171": "since it was proper this visit to her aunt should have the ad­ ditional recommendation of being paid with all possible expedition."}}, "cicero_1855-1892_5": {"aligns_idx": {"null": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,

erheischen schienen, daß ich nämlich von dem Appu- lejischen Gesetze redete, daß ich den Begriff der Hoheitsverletzung entwickelte, nur sehr kurz und oberflächlich berührt.", "2657": "Aber die beiden Arten der Beredsamkeit, von denen die eine sich mit der Aufregung der Leidenschaft, die andere mit der Erwirkung der Zuneigung beschäf­ tigt, die beide am Wenigsten durch Kunstregeln ausgebildet find, wur­ den von mir in der Behandlung meiner ganzen Sache benutzt, so daß ich einerseits, als ich den Haß gegen Cäpio erneuerte, sehr heftig, an­ dererseits, als ich meine Gesinnung gegen meine Schutzbefohlenen an den Tag legte, sehr sanstmüthig erschien.", "2658": "So gelang es mir mehr durch Rührung der Gemüther als durch Belehrung der Richter über deine Anklage, Sulpicius, den Sieg zu erringen.I«. 202.", "2659": "Da erwiderte Sulpicius:", "2660": "Wahrlich du erwähnst dieß mit Recht, Antonius.", "2661": "Denn noch nie sah ich Etwas so aus den Händen entschlüpfen, wie mir damals jene Sache entschlüpfte.", "2662": "Denn als ich dir, wie du bemerktest ^), nicht ein Gericht, sondern einen Feuerbrand übergeben hatte;", "2663": "wie, unsterbliche Götter, war da der An­ fang deiner Rede! welche Besorgniß, welche Bedenklichkeit!", "2664": "wie stot­ ternd und lang gedehnt deine Worte!", "2665": "Aber kaum hattest du zu An­ fang das, was dir allein die Nach ficht der Menschen gewann, erreicht, daß du nämlich für einen dir nahestehenden Mann, deinen Quästor, als Vertheidiger auftretest:", "2666": "wie wußtest du da vorerst dir die Bahn zu brechen, um dir Gehör zu verschaffen!", "2667": "203.", "2668": "Aber siehe!", "2669": "Da ich' meinte, du hättest Nichts weiter ausgerichtet, als daß die Menschen dir die Vertheidigung eines schlechten Bürgers wegen der Amtsgenossen­ schaft verzeihen zu müssen meinten;", "2670": "begannst du unmerklich weiter um dich zu greisen, indeß die Anderen Nichts ahnten, ich aber äußerst besorgt wurde, du möchtest die Sache nicht als einen Aufruhr des Norbanus, sondern als die Wirkung von dem Zorne des Römischen Volkes, und zwar von einem nicht ungerechten, sondern verdienten und schuldigen, vertheidigen.", "2671": "Ferner welcher Umstand wurde von dir bei dem Angriffe auf Cäpio unbeachtet gelassen?", "2672": "Wie verstandst du in Allem Haß, Unwillen, Mitleid durcheinander zu mischen!", "2673": "Und das nicht allein bei der Vertheidigung, sondern auch gegen Scaurus und meine übrigen Zeugen, deren Zeugnisse du nicht durch Widerlegung, sondern dadurch, daß du deine Zuflucht zu demselben Ungestüme des Volkes nahmst, entkräftetest.", "2674": "204.", "2675": "Als du dieses so eben erzähltest, vermißte ich darin keine Regeln der Kunst;", "2676": "doch glaube ich, daß es an sich schon eine nicht unerhebliche Unterweisung in sich schließt ^).", "2677": "— Nun denn, wenn es euch so gefällt, sagte Antonius, so will ich euch vortragen, was ich in meinen Reden zu befolgen und worauf ich mein Augenmerk zu richten pflege;", "2678": "denn ein langes Leben und die Erfah­ rung in den wichtigsten Angelegenheiten hat mich die Mittel erlernen lassen, durch welche die Gemüther der Menschen in Bewegung gesetzt werden.1,1. 205.", "2679": "Ich pflege daher zuerst zu überlegen, ob die Sache so Etwas erfordere.", "2680": "Denn weder bei geringfügigen Gegenständen darf man diese Feuerbrände der Rede anwenden, noch auch bei einer sol­ chen Stimmung der Menschen, bei welcher wir durch unseren Vortrag aus die Rührung der Gemüther durchaus nicht einwirken können, ja uns der Gefahr aussetzen verspottet zu werden und uns verhaßt zu ma­ chen, wenn wir bei Possen Trauerspiele aufführen wollen oder das Unbewegliche in Bewegung zu setzen versuchen.", "2681": "206.", "2682": "Weil es näm­ lich in der Regel besonders folgende Empfindungen find, welche in den Gemüthern der Richter oder sonstiger Zuhörer, vor denen wir re­ den, in Bewegung gesetzt werden müssen:", "2683": "Liebe, Haß, Zorn, Neid, Mitleiden, Hoffnung, Freude, Furcht, Verdruß:", "2684": "so sehen wir ein, daß wir Liebe gewinnen, wenn man das, was gerade denen nützlich ist, vor denen man redet, zu vertheidigen, oder wenn man sich für recht­ schaffene Männer oder wenigstens für solche, welche in ihren Augen rechtschaffen und tüchtig find, zu bemühen scheint.", "2685": "Denn das Letztere gewinnt mehr Liebe, das Erstere hingegen, die Vertheidigung der Tu­ gend, mehr Hochachtung, und mehr richtet man aus, wenn man die Hoffnung auf künftigen Vortheil ankündigt, als wenn man eine ver­ gangen« Wohlthat erwähnt.", "2686": "207. Man muß sich Mühe geben zu zei­ gen, daß die Sache, die man vertheidigt, entweder mit Ehre oder mit Nutzen verbunden ist, und anzudeuten, daß der, dem man diese Liebe gewinnen will, Nichts auf seinen Vortheil bezogen und über­ haupt Nichts in eigennütziger Absicht gethan habe.", "2687": "Denn die Vor­ theile der Menschen selbst beneidet man;", "2688": "ihren Bemühungen aber An­ deren Vortheile zu gewähren ist man günstig.", "2689": "208.", "2690": "Auch muß man sich hierbei vorsehen, daß wir nicht von den Männern, die wir wegen ihrer guten Handlungen geachtet wissen wollen, Lob und Ruhm, die man am Meisten zu beneiden pflegt, allzu sehr zu erheben scheinen.", "2691": "Aus denselben Quellen schöpfen wir auch die Kunst Haß sowol gegen Andere aufzuregen als von uns und den Unsrigen zu entfernen, und ein gleiches Verfahren müssen wir bei Erregung und Besänftigung des Zornes anwenden.", "2692": "Denn wenn man das, was den Zuhörern selbst verderblich oder schädlich ist, mit erhöhter Farbe darstellt, so erzeugt man Haß;", "2693": "wenn man aber in gleicher Weise bei der Erwähnung schlechter Handlungen, die man gegen brave Männer oder gegen solche, die es am Wenigsten verdient hatten, oder gegen den Staat ausgeübt hat, verfahrt, so erregt man, wenn auch nicht einen gleich bitteren Haß, doch eine dem Unwillen oder dem Hasse nicht unähnliche Abnei­ gung.", "2694": "209.", "2695": "Auf gleiche Weise jagt man Furcht durch die Beschrei­ bung eigener oder gemeinsamer Gefahren ein.", "2696": "Tiefer in's Herz dringt die Furcht vor eigener Gefahr;", "2697": "aber auch die gemeinsamen müssen so ge­ schildert werden, daß sie jener gleich zu kommen scheinen.I^II.", "2698": "Ein ganz gleiches Verhältniß findet bei der Hoffnung, der Freude und dem Verdrusse statt;", "2699": "doch unter allen Gemüthsbewegun­ gen dürste der Neid wol die heftigste sein, und es ist nicht weniger An­ strengung erforderlich, um ihn zu unterdrücken, als um ihn zu erregen.", "2700": "Es beneiden aber die Menschen vorzüglich die ihnen gleich Gestellten oder auch Niedrigere, wenn sie meinen, daß sie zurückgeblieben find, und die schmerzliche Bemerkung machen, daß diese sie überflügelt ha­ ben.", "2701": "Aber auch gegen Höhere empfindet man oft heftigen Neid, und um so mehr, je unerträglicher sie sich brüsten und wegen ihres Vorran­ ges an Würde und Glück die Gränze deS Allen gleichmäßig zukom­ menden Rechtes überschreiten.", "2702": "Sollen diese Vorzüge zur Entflammung des Neides benutzt werden, so muß man vor Allem behaupten, daß sie nicht durch Tugend, und dann, daß sie sogar durch Laster und Ver­ gehungen erworben seien;", "2703": "ferner wenn sie zu ehrenvoll und bedeutend sein sollten, so erkläre man, daß doch kein Verdienst einen so hohen Werth habe, daß es der Anmaßung und dem schnöden Stolze des Menschen gleich komme.", "2704": "210.", "2705": "Zur Beschwichtigung des Neides hin­ gegen muß man zeigen, daß jene Vorzüge durch große Anstrengung unter großen Gefahren erworben seien, daß ihr Besitzer dieselben nicht zu eigenem, sondern zu Anderer Nutzen verwendet habe, daß er an dem Ruhme, den er sich etwa erworben zu haben scheine, obwol er kein unbilliger Lohn der Gefahr sei, doch kein Vergnügen finde, ihn vielmehr ganz fallen lasse und aufgebe.", "2706": "Und weil die meisten Men­ schen neidisch sind, und dieses Laster so allgemein und überall verbrei­ tet ist, ein hervorragendes und blühendes Glück aber der Gegenstand des Neides zu sein pflegt;", "2707": "so muß man überhaupt sich eifrig bemühen diese Meinung hiervon den Leuten auszureden und zu zeigen, daß jenes dem Scheine nach so glänzende Glück durch Mühseligkeiten und Kümmernisse verbittert werde.", "2708": "211.", "2709": "Das Mitleid ferner wird er­ regt, wenn der Zuhörer in die Gemüthsstimmung versetzt werden kann, daß er das Traurige, was an einem Anderen beklagt wird, nach den eigenen bitteren Schicksalen, die er entweder erduldet hat oder befürch­ tet, bemißt oder bei der Betrachtung eines Anderen häufig auf sich selbst zurückblickt.", "2710": "Sowie nun alle Zufälle des menschlichen Elendes schmerzlich empfunden werden, wenn man sie mit theilnehmender Rüh­ rung schildert;", "2711": "so ist es besonders die gemißhandelte und mit Füßen getretene Tugend, welche tiefe Betrübniß hervorruft;", "2712": "und sowie die eine Art der Beredsamkeit, welche den Charakter eines Menschen durch die Empfehlung seiner Rechtschaffenheit in einem vortheilhaften Lichte zeigen soll, einen sanften und gelassenen Vortrag, wie ich schon oft be­ merkte, erfordert, so muß die andere, deren sich der Redner bedient, um die Gemüther umzustimmen und auf jede Weise zu lenken, mit gespannter Kraft und Feuer vorgetragen werden.I^III. 212.", "2713": "Aber zwischen diesen beiden Arten, von denen wir die eine sanft, die andere feurig wissen wollen, findet eine gewisse, schwer zu unterscheidende Ähnlichkeit statt.", "2714": "Denn sowie von jener Sanftheit, durch die wir uns bei den Zuhörern beliebt machen, Etwas in diesen leidenschaftlichen Nachdruck, durch den wir sie erre­ gen, einfließen muß;", "2715": "so müssen wir hingegen von diesem Nachdrucke zu­ weilen etwas Belebendes in jene Sanftheit hineinbringen ^), und keine i Rede hat eine bessere Mischung als die, in welcher die Rauheit des leidenschaftlichen Vortrages durch die Freundlichkeit des Redners selbst gemildert, und die Schlaffheit der Sanstmuth durch Ernst und Nach­ druck gekräftigt wird.", "2716": "213.", "2717": "Bei beiden Arten des Vortrages aber, sowol bei jener, in der Kraft und Nachdruck erforderlich ist, als bei dieser, deren man sich bei der Schilderung des Lebens und Charakters bedient 2), müssen die Eingänge langsam sein, aber auch die Aus­ gänge sich Zeit nehmen und gedehnt sein.", "2718": "Man darf nämlich weder sogleich zu jener Art des Vortrages überspringen;", "2719": "denn sie geht ganz von dem Streitpunkte ab, und die Menschen wünschen zuerst den eigentlichen Gegenstand der gerichtlichen Untersuchung zu erfahren;", "2720": "noch auch, wenn man diesen Ton einmal angestimmt hat, ihn schnell verlassen.", "2721": "214.", "2722": "Denn ein Beweisgrund wird allerdings, sobald er vorgelegt ist, gefaßt, und ein zweiter und dritter wird verlangt;", "2723": "aber nicht auf gleiche Weise kann man Mitleid oder Neid oder Zorn so schnell, als man davon zu reden begonnen hat, erregen.", "2724": "Der Beweis­ grund erhält seine Kraft durch den vernünftigen Gedanken selbst, der, sobald er ausgesprochen ist, sofort im Geiste haftet;", "2725": "jene Art des Vor­ trages aber legt es nicht auf Belehrung des Richters an, sondern mehr auf seine Erschütterung, und diese kann Niemand auf eine an;", "2726": "dere Weise hervorbringen als durch einen umfangreichen, mannigfal­ tigen und reichhaltigen Vortrag, der von einer entsprechenden Lebhaf­ tigkeit des Mienen- und Gebärdenspieles begleitet ist.", "2727": "215.", "2728": "Wer da­ her kurz oder in sanftem Tone redet, der kann den Richter belehren, aber ihn zu erschüttern vermag er nicht:", "2729": "woraus doch Alles beruht.", "2730": "Ferner ist auch das einleuchtend, daß die Fähigkeit über alle Gegen­ stünde dafür oder dagegen zu reden aus denselben Quellen geschöpft wird.", "2731": "Aber den Beweisgrund des Gegners muß man entkräften theils dadurch, daß man das verwirft, was zur Bestätigung desselben ange­ . führt wird, theils dadurch, daß man zeigt, daß das, was die Gegner daraus schließen wollen, nicht aus ihren Vordersätzen erwiesen werde und nicht folgerichtig sei;", "2732": "oder wenn auf diese Weise die Widerlegung nicht möglich ist, so muß man für das Gegentheil Beweisgründe bei­ bringen, die entweder stärker oder gleich stark sind.", "2733": "216. Was aber der Gegner entweder, um die Gemüther zu gewinnen, sanft, oder, um sie zu erschüttern, leidenschaftlich vorträgt, das muß man durch Erre­ gung entgegengesetzter Gemüthsbewegungen zu entkräften suchen, in­ dem man Haß durch Wohlwollen, Mitleid durch Neid aufhebt.I<IV. Angenehm aber und oft ausnehmend nützlich ist der Scherz und die witzigen Einfälle;", "2734": "aber wenn sich alles Andere durch Kunstregeln vortragen läßt, so sind diese doch Naturgaben und bedür­

den Witz gibt, oder gibt es solche, so wirst du uns hierin den besten Unterricht geben.", "2737": "— 217.", "2738": "Ja wahrlich, erwiderte er, über jeden Gegenstand, glaube ich, kann ein Mann von einiger Bildung leichter reden als über den Witz.", "2739": "Als ich nun einige Griechische Bücher sah, die die Aufschrift „Von dem Lächerlichen\" führten;", "2740": "so machte ich mir einige Hoffnung hieraus et­ was erlernen zu können.", "2741": "Ich fand allerdings viele lächerliche und witzige Aeußerungen der Griechen;", "2742": "denn die Sikuler, die Rhodier, die Byzantiner und vor Allen die Attiker zeichnen sich hierin aus;", "2743": "aber diejenigen, welche versucht haben Kunstregeln und ein Lehrgebäude hiervon aufzustellen, zeigen sich so alles Witzes bar, daß man über nichts Anderes bei ihnen lachen kann als eben über, ihre Witzlosigkeit.", "2744": "218.", "2745": "Daher läßt sich meines Erachtens ein kunstmäßiger Unterricht über diesen Gegenstand auf keine Weise ertheilen.", "2746": "Allerdings gibt es zwei Arten des Witzes, von denen die eine gleichmäßig über die ganze Rede verbreitet ist, die andere in kurzen, scharf treffenden Einfällen besteht;", "2747": "die erstere

für die erstere Art, für die gemüthliche Laune, die sich durch den ganzen Vortrag hindurchzieht, keine Kunstregeln ver­ mißt;", "2754": "denn die Natur bildet und schafft die witzigen Nachahmer und

sich in schnellen scharf treffenden Einfüllen äußert.", "2763": "221.", "2764": "Denn diese ganze Vertheidigung des Cu­ rius 7) gegen den Scävola floß durchweg von Heiterkeit und Scherz über;",

Willen nicht zurückhal­ ten können, und wie es zugleich Brust, Mund, Adern, Augen, Mie- nen ergreife:", "2868": "das mag Demokritus ') zum Gegenstande seiner Unter­ suchungen machen.", "2869": "Denn dieß steht in keiner näheren Beziehung zu unserem Gespräche, und wäre dieß auch der Fall, so würde ich mich meiner Unwissenheit in einer Sache nicht schämen, die nicht einmal denen bekannt ist, welche

kommen, so kommt es dem Redner zu Lachen zu erregen, theils, weil die Heiterkeit an sich dem Wohl­ wollen gewinnt, durch den sie erregt worden ist, theils, weil Alle den Scharfsinn bewundern, der oft in einem einzigen Worte liegt, vorzüg­ lich in Antworten, zuweilen auch im Angriffe, theils, weil dadurch der Gegner entmuthigt, verwirrt, geschwächt, abgeschreckt, zurückge­ schlagen wird, theils, weil es den Redner selbst als einen fein gebilde­ ten, aufgeklärten, geistreichen Mann ankündigt, und ganz besonders, weil es den ifnsteren Ernst mildert und mäßigt, und oft verdrießliche Angelegenheiten, die sich durch Beweisgründe nicht leicht widerlegen lassen, durch Scherz und Lachen entschieden werden.", "2874": "237.", "2875": "In wie weit aber der Redner das Lächerliche

solche Dinge zu scherzen erlauben, welche weder großen Haß noch sehr großes Mit­ leid verdienen.", "2882": "Aus diesem Grunde liegt der ganze Stoff des Lacher­ lichen in den Fehlern, welche sich im Leben von Menschen zeigen, die weder geachtet noch unglücklich find noch auch wegen ihrer Handlun­ gen die Todesstrafe zu verdienen scheinen, und eine seine Verspottung solcher Fehler ist geeignet Lachen zu erregen.", "2883": "239.", "2884": "Einen recht hüb­ schen Stoff zum Scherzen bieten auch Mißgestalt und körperliche Ge­ brechen;", "2885": "aber wir stellen hier dieselbe Frage aus, die man

man sagt, zuerst die Kunst des Gedächtnisses gelehrt hat.", "3594": "352.", "3595": "Man erzählt nämlich, Simo­ nides habe einst zu Kranon in Thessalien bei Skopas, einem begüter­ ten und vornehmen

Cratippus, and that, too, at Athens, you ought to be well furnished with the rules and principles of philosophy, on account of the pre-eminent reputation both of the master and the city, the one of which can improve you by his learning, the other by its examples;", "3": "yet as I, for my own advantage, have always combined the Latin with the Greek, not only in philosophy but even in the practice of speak- ing, I recommend to you the same method, that you may excel equally in both kinds of composition.", "4": "In this respect, indeed, if I mistake not, I was of great service to our countrymen;", "5": "so that not only such of them as are ignorant of Greek learning, but even men of letters, think they have pro- fited somewhat by me both in speaking and reasoning.", "6": "Wherefore you shall study, nay, study as long as you desire, under the best philosopher of this age — and you ought to desire it, as long as you are not dissatisfied with the degree of your improvement;", "7": "but in reading my works, which are not very different from the Peripatetic—because we profess in common to be followers both of Socrates and Plato—as to the subject matter itself, use your own judg- ment;", "8": "but be assured you will, by reading my writings, render your Latin style more copious.", "9": "I would not have it supposed that this is said in ostentation;", "10": "for, while I yield the superiority in philosophy to many, if I claim to myself the province peculiar to an orator-that of speaking with pro- priety, perspicuity, and elegance—I seem, since I have spent my life in that pursuit, to lay claim to it with a certain degree of right.", "11": "Wherefore, my dear Cicero, I most earnestly recommend that you carefully peruse not only my Orations, but even my philosophical works, which have now nearly equalled them in extent;", "12": "for there is in the former the greater force of language, but you ought to cultivate, at the same time, the equable and sober style of the latter.", "13": "And, indeed, I find that it has not happened in the case of any of the Greeks, that the same man has laboured in both departments, and pursued both the former-that of forensic speaking- and the latter quiet mode of argumentation;", "14": "unless, perhaps, Demetrius Phalereus may be reckoned in that number- a refined reasoner, a not very animated speaker, yet of so much sweetness that you might recognize the pupil of Theophrastus.", "15": "How far I have succeeded in both, others must determine;", "16": "certain it is that I have attempted both.", "17": "Indeed, I am of opinion that Plato, had he attempted forensic oratory, would have spoken with copiousness and power;", "18": "and that had Demosthenes retained and repeated the lessons of Plato, he would have delivered them with gracefulness and beauty.", "19": "I form the same judgment of Aristotle and Iso- crates, each of whom was so pleased with his own pursuit that he neglected that of the other.", "20": "II.", "21": "But having resolved at this time to write to you some- what, and a great deal in time to come, I have thought proper to set out with that subject which is best adapted to your years and to my authority.", "22": "For, while many subjects in phi- losopby, of great weight and utility, have been accurately and copiously discussed by philosophers, the most extensive seems to be what they have delivered and enjoined concerning the duties of mankind;", "23": "for there can be no state of life, amidst public or private affairs, abroad or at home-whether you transact anything with yourself or contract anything with another-that is without its obligations.", "24": "In the due discharge of that consists all the dignity, and in its neglect all the disgrace, of life.", "25": "This is an inquiry common to all philosophers;", "26": "for where is the man who will presume to style himself a philosopher, and lay down no rules of duty?", "27": "But there are certain schools which pervert all duty by the ultimate objects of good and evil which they propose.", "28": "For if a man should lay down as the chief good, that which has no connexion with virtue, and measure it by his own interests, and not according to its moral merit;", "29": "if such a man shall act con- sistently with his own principles, and is not sometimes influ- enced by the goodness of his heart, he can cultivate neither friendship, justice, nor generosity.", "30": "In truth, it is impossible for the man to be brave who shall pronounce pain to be the greatest evil, or temperate who shall propose pleasure as the highest good.", "31": "*Though these truths are so self-evident that they require no philosophical discussion, yet they have been treated by me elsewhere.", "32": "I say, therefore, that if these schools are self-consistent, they can say nothing of the moral duties.", "33": "Neither can any firm, permanent, or natural rules of duty be laid down, but by those who esteem virtue to be solely, or by those who deem it to be chiefly, desirable for its own sake.", "34": "The teaching of duties, therefore, is the peculiar study of the Stoics, of the Academics, and the Peripatetics;", "35": "because the sentiments of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Herillus, have been long exploded.", "36": "Yet even those professors would have been entitled to have treated upon the duties of men, had they left us any distinction of things, so that there might have been a path open to the discovery of duty.", "37": "We shall, therefore, upon this occasion, and in this inquiry, chiefly follow the Stoics, not as their expositors, but by drawing, as usual, from their sources, at our own option and judgment, so much and in such manner as we please.*", "38": "I therefore think proper, as my entire argument is on moral obligation, to define what a duty is, a definition which I am surprised has been omitted by Panætius, because every investigation which is rationally undertaken, concerning any subject, ought to set out with a definition, that it may be understood what is the subject of discussion.", "39": "III.", "40": "All questions concerning duty are of two sorts.", "41": "The first relates to the final good;", "42": "the second consists of those rules which arc to regulate the practice of life in all its rela- tions.*", "43": "Examples of the former are as follow:", "44": "-Whether all duties are perfect in themselves ?", "45": "Whether one duty is of more importance than another ?", "46": "together with other ques- tions of the same nature.", "47": "Now the rules for moral duties relate, indeed, to the final good;", "48": "but it is not so perceptible that they do, because they seem chiefly to refer to the regu- lation of ordinary life, and of them we are to treat in this book.", "49": "But there is another division of duty:", "50": "for one is called a mean duty, the other a perfect duty.", "51": "If I mistake not, the complete or perfect duty is the same with what we call a direct one, and by the Greeks is called ϰατόρθωμα.", "52": "As to that duty which is mean they call it ϰαθήϰον, and they thus define those terms.", "53": "Whatever duty is absolute, that they call a perfect duty;", "54": "and they call that duty, for the per- to the authority of any.", "55": "Horace makes a similar profession respecting himself- \" Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri, Quo me cumque rapit tempestas deferor hospes.\"", "56": "First Epist.—First Book, lines 14, 15.", "57": "formance of which a probable reason can be assigned, a mean duty.", "58": "*In the opinion, therefore, of Panætius, there is a threefold consideration for determining our resolution;", "59": "for men doubt whether the thing which falls under their consideration be of itself virtuous or disgraceful, and in this deliberation minds are often distracted into opposite sentiments.", "60": "They then examine and deliberate whether or not the subject o their consideration conduces to the convenience or enjoyment of life, to the improvement of their estate and wealth, to their interest and power, by which they may profit themselves or their relations ;", "61": "all which deliberation falls under the category of utility.", "62": "The third kind of doubtful deliberation", "63": "Is, when an apparent utility seems to clash with moral recti- tude ;", "64": "for when utility hurries us to itself, and virtue, on the other hand, seems to call us back, it happens that the mind is distracted in the choice, and these occasion a double anxiety in deliberation.", "65": "In this division (although an omission is of the worst consequence in divisions of this kind), two things are omitted;", "66": "for we are accustomed to deliberate not only whether a thing be virtuous or shameful in itself, but, of two things that are virtuous, which is the more excellent ?", "67": "And, in like manner, of two things which are profitable which is the more profitable ?", "68": "Thus, it is found that the deliberation, which he considered to be threefold, ought to be distributed into five divisions.", "69": "We must, therefore, first treat of what is virtuous in itself, and that under two heads ;", "70": "in like manner, of what is profitable;", "71": "and we shall next treat of them comparatively.", "72": "IV.", "73": "In the first place, a disposition has been planted by nature in every species of living creatures to cherish them- selves, their life, and body;", "74": "to avoid those things that appear hurtful to them;", "75": "and to look out for and procure whatever is necessary for their living, such as food, shelter, and the like.", "76": "Now the desire of union for the purpose of procreating their own species is common to all animals, as well as a certain degree of concern about what is procreated.", "77": "But the greatest distinction between a man and a brute lies in this, that the latter is impelled only by instinct, and applies itself solely to that object which is present and before it, with very little sensibility to what is past or to come ;", "78": "* but man, because endowed with reason, by which he discerns consequences, looks into the causes of things and their progress, and being acquainted, as it were, with precedents, he compares their analogies, and adapts and connects the present with what is to come.", "79": "It is easy for him to foresee the future direction of all his life, and therefore he prepares whatever is necessary for passing through it.", "80": "Nature, likewise, by the same force of reason, conciliates man to man, in order to a community both of language and of life:", "81": "above all, it implants in them a strong love for their offspring ;", "82": "it impels them to desire that companies and societies should be formed, and that they should mingle in them ;", "83": "and that for those reasons, man should take care to provide for the supply of clothing and of food;", "84": "and that not only for himself, but for his wife, his children, and for all whom he ought to hold dear and to protect.", "85": "This is an affection which arouses the spirit and makes it more strenuous for action.", "86": "The distinguishing property of man is to seareh for and to follow after truth.", "87": "Therefore, when relaxed from our necessary cares and concerns, we then covet to see, to hear, and to learn somewhat;", "88": "and we esteem knowledge of things either obscure or wonderful to be the indispensable means of living happily.*", "89": "From this we understand that truth, simplicity, and candour, are most agreeable to the nature of mankind.", "90": "To this passion for discovering truth, is.", "91": "added a desire to direct;", "92": "for a mind, well formed by na- ture, is unwilling to obey any man but him who lays down rules and instructions to it, or who, for the general advan- tage, exercises equitable and lawful government.", "93": "From this proceeds loftiness of mind, and contempt for worldly inte- rests.", "94": "*Neither is it a mean privilege of nature and reason, that man is the only animal who is sensible of order, of decency, and of propriety, both in acting and speaking.", "95": "In like manner, no other creature perceives the beauty, the gracefulness, and the harmony of parts, in those objects which are discerned by the sight.", "96": "An analogous perception to which nature and reason convey from the sight to the mind;", "97": "and consider that beauty, regularity, and order in counsels and actions should be still more preserved.", "98": "She is cautious not to do aught that is indecent or effeminate, or to act or think wantonly in any of our deliberations or deeds.", "99": "The effect and result of all this produces that honestum which we are now in search of;", "100": "that virtue which is honourable even without being ennobled;", "101": "and of which we may truly say, that even were it praised by none it would be commendable in itself.", "102": "V. My Son Marcus, you here perceive at least a sketch, and, as it were, the outline of virtue;", "103": "which, could we perceive her with our eyes,† would, as Plato says, kindle a wonderful love of wisdom.", "104": "But whatever is virtuous arises from some one of those four divisions:", "105": "for it consists either in sagacity and the perception of truth;", "106": "or in the preservation of human society, by giving to every man his due, and by observing the faith of contracts;", "107": "or in the greatness and firmness of an elevated and unsubdued mind;", "108": "or in observing order and regularity in all our words and in all our actions, in which consists moderation and temperance.", "109": "Though these four divisions are connected and interwoven with one another, yet certain kinds of duties arise from each of them.", "110": "As, for instance, in that part which I first de- scribed, and under which I comprehend sagacity or wisdom, consists the search after and discovery of truth;", "111": "and this is the characteristic function of that virtue:", "112": "for the man who is most sagacious in discovering the real truth in any subject, and who can, with the greatest perspicacity and quickness, both see and explain the grounds of it, is justly esteemed a man of the greatest understanding and discernment.", "113": "From hence it follows that truth is, as it were, the subject matter which this faculty handles, and on which it employs itself.", "114": "As to the other three virtues, they necessarily consist in acquiring and preserving those things with which the conduct of life is connected, in order to preserve the community and relations of mankind, and to display that excellence and greatness of soul, which exhibits itself as well in acquiring resources and advantages both for ourselves and for our friends, as, still more conspicuously, in prop rly disregarding them.", "115": "As to order, resolution, moderation, and the like, they come into that rank of virtues which require not only an operation of the mind, but a certain degree of personal activity;", "116": "for it is in observing order end moderation in those things which constitute the objects of active life, that we shall preserve virtue and decency.", "117": "VI.", "118": "Now, of the four divisions under which I have ranged the nature and essence of virtue, that which consists in the knowledge of truth principally affects the nature of man.", "119": "For all of us are impelled and carried along to the love of knowledge and learning, in which we account it glorious to excel, but consider every slip, mistake, ignorance, and de- ception in it, to be hurtful and shameful.", "120": "In this pursuit, which is both natural and virtuous, two faults are to be avoided.", "121": "The first is, the regarding things which we do not know as if they were understood by us, and thence rashly giving them our assent.*", "122": "And he that wishes, as every man ought to wish, to avoid this error, must devote both his time and nis industry to the study of things.", "123": "The other fault is, that some people bestow too much study and pains upon things that are obscure,* difficult, and even immaterial in themselves.", "124": "When those faults are avoided, all the pains and care a man bestows upon studies that are virtuous in themselves, and worthy of his knowledge, will be deservedly commended.", "125": "Thus we have heard how Caius Sulpiciust ex- celled in astronomy, and Sextus Pompeius, to my own know- ledge, in mathematics;", "126": "many also in logic, and more in the civil law, all which are arts that serve to investigate truth, in the pursuit of which our duty forbids us to be diverted from transacting our business, because the whole glory of virtue consists in activity.", "127": "Yet this is often intermitted, and frequent are our returns to our studies.", "128": "Then there is an incessant working of the mind, which, without our taking pains, is sufficient to keep us in the practice of thinking.", "129": "Now, all our thoughts, and every motion of the mind, should be devoted either to the forming of plans for virtuous actions, and such as belong to a good and a happy life, or else to the pursuits of science and knowledge.", "130": "I have now treated of at least the first source of duty.", "131": "VII.", "132": "Now, as to the other three, the most extensive system is that by which the mutual society of mankind, and, as it were, the intercourse of life, is preserved.", "133": "Of this there are two parts:", "134": "justice, in which virtue displays itself with the most distinguished lustre, and from which men are termed good;", "135": "and allied to this, beneficence, which may likewise be termed benevolence, or liberality.", "136": "Now, the chief province of justice is, that no person injure another, unless he is pro- voked* by suffering wrong;", "137": "next, that public property be appropriated to public, and private to individual, use.", "138": "Now, by nature no property is private, but dependent either on ancient possession (as when men formerly came into unoccupied territories);", "139": "or victory (as when they have taken possession of it in war);", "140": "or public constitution, contract, terms, or lot.", "141": "By those, the land of Arpinum is regarded as belonging to the Arpinates;", "142": "the Tusculan, to the Tusculans.", "143": "The like division holds with regard to matters of private property.", "144": "Thus, as every man holds his own, each should possess that portion which fell to his share of those things that by nature were common ;", "145": "and it follows, that no man can covet another's property without violating the laws of humau society.", "146": "†But (as has been strikingly said by Plato) we are not born for ourselves alone, and our country claims her share, and our friends their share of us ;", "147": "and, as the Stoics hold, all that the earth produces is created for the use of mau, so men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutually do good to one another;", "148": "in this we ought to take nature for our guide, to throw into the public stock the offices of general utility by a reciprocation of duties ;", "149": "sometimes by receiving, sometimes by giving, and sometimes to cement human society by arts, by industry, and by our resources.", "150": "Now the foundation of justice is faithfulness, which is a perseverance and truth in all our declarations and in all our promises.", "151": "Let us therefore (though some people may think it over nice) imitate the Stoics, who curiously examine whence terms are derived, and consider that the wordfides, or faith- fulness, is no other than a performance of what we have promised.*", "152": "But there are two kinds of injustice;", "153": "the first is of those who offer an injury, the second of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not.", "154": "For if a man, prompted either by anger or any sudden perturbation, unjustly assaults another man, such a one seems as it were to lay violent hands on one's ally ;", "155": "and the man who does not repel or withstand the injury, if he can, is as much to blame as if he deserted the cause of his parents, his friends, or his country.", "156": "Those wrongs, however, which are inflicted for the very purpose of doing an injury, often proceed from fear ;", "157": "as for instance, when a man who is contriving to injure another is afraid, unless he executes what he is meditating, that he may himself sustain some disadvantage ;", "158": "but the great incentive to doing wrong is to obtain what one desires, and in this crime avarice is the most pervading motive.", "159": "VIH.", "160": "Now riches are sought after, both for the necessary purposes of life and for the enjoyment of pleasure.", "161": "But in men of greater minds the coveting of money is with a view to power and to the means of giving gratification.", "162": "As M. Crassus lately used to declare, that no man who wanted to have a direction in the government had money enough, unless by the interest of it he could maintain an army.", "163": "Mag- nificent equipages, likewise, and a style of living made up of elegance and abundance give delight, and hence the desire for money becomes boundless.", "164": "Nor indeed is the mere desire to improve one's private fortune, without injury to another, deserving of blame ;", "165": "but injustice must ever be avoided.", "166": "But the main cause why most men are led to a forgetful- ness of justice is their falling into a violent ambition after empire, honours, and glory.", "167": "For what Ennius observes, that \"", "168": "No social bonds, no public faith remains Inviolate ;", "169": "\"— has a still more extensive application ;", "170": "for where the object of ambition is of such a nature as that several cannot ob- tain pre-eminence, the contest for it is generally so violent, that nothing can be more difficult than to preserve the sacred ties of society.", "171": "This was shown lately in the presumption of C. Coesar, who, in order to obtain that direction in the government which the wildness of his imagination had planned out, violated all laws, divine and human.", "172": "But what is deplorable in this matter is, that the desire after honour, empire, power, and glory, is generally most prevalent in the greatest soul and the most exalted genius ;", "173": "* for which reason every crime of that sort is the more carefully to be guarded against.", "174": "But in every species of injustice it is a very material question, whether it is committed through some agitation of passion, which commonly is short-lived and tem- porary, or from deliberate, prepense, malice;", "175": "for those things which proceed from a short, sudden fit, are of slighter moment than those which are inflicted by forethought and prepara- tion.", "176": "But enough has been said concerning inflicting injury.", "177": "IX.", "178": "Various are the causes of men omitting the defence of others, or neglecting their duty towards them.", "179": "They are either unwilling to encounter enmity, toil, or expense ;", "180": "or, perhaps, they do it through negligence, listlessness, or lazi- ness ;", "181": "or they are so embarrassed in certain studies and pursuits, that they suffer those they ought to protect to be neglected.", "182": "Hence we must take care lest Plato's observa- tion with respect to philosophers should be falsified :", "183": "\"", "184": "That they are men of integrity, because they are solely engaged in the pursuit of truth, and despise and neglect those con- siderations which others value, and which mankind are wont to contend for amongst themselves.\"", "185": "For, while they abstain from hurting any by the infliction of injury, they indeed assert one species of honesty or justice, but they fail in another;", "186": "because, being entangled in the pursuits of learn- in-, they abandon those they ought to protect.", "187": "Some, therefore, think that they would have no concern with the government unless they were forced to it;", "188": "but still, it would be more just that it should be done voluntarily;", "189": "for an action which is intrinsically right is only morally good in so far as it is voluntary.*", "190": "There are others who, either from a desire to improve their private fortune, or from some per- sonal resentments, pretend that they mind their own affairs only that they may'appear not to do wrong to another.", "191": "Now such persons are free from one kind of injustice, but fall into another ;", "192": "because they abandon the fellowship of life by employing in it none of their zeal, none of their labour, none of their abilities.", "193": "Having thus stated the two kinds of dis- honesty or injustice, and assigned the motives for each kind, and settled previously the considerations by which justice is limited, we shall easily (unless we are extremely selfish) be able to form a judgment of our duty on every occasion.", "194": "For, to concern ourselves in other people's affairs is a delicate matter.", "195": "Yet Chremes, a character in Terence, thinks, that there is nothing which has a relation to mankind in which he has not a concern.†", "196": "Meanwhile, because we have the quicker perception and sensation of whatever happens favourably or untowardly to ourselves than to others, which we see as it were at a greater distance, the judgment we form of them is very different from what we form of ourselves.", "197": "Those therefore are wise monitors who teach us to do nothing of which we are doubtful, whether it is honest or unjust ;", "198": "for whatever is honest manifests itself by its own lustre, but doubt implies the entertainment of injustice.", "199": "X.", "200": "But occasions frequently happen in which those duties which are most worthy of an honest, and of such as we call a worthy man, are altered and changed to their contraries.", "201": "For example, to return a deposit, to perform a promise, and other matters that are relative to truth and honesty, some- times alter so, that it is just they should not be observed ;", "202": "for it is proper to have recourse to those fundamentals of honesty which I laid down in the commencement:", "203": "in the first place, that of injuring no person ;", "204": "and, secondly, that of being sub- servient to the public good.", "205": "When these conditions are altered by circumstances, the moral obligation, not being in- variably identical, is similarly altered.", "206": "A promise, as a paction, may happen to be made, the performance of which may be prejudicial either to the party promising, or to the party to whom the promise is made.", "207": "For (as we see in the play) had not Neptune performed his promise to Theseus, the latter would not have been bereaved of his son, Hippolytus ;", "208": "for it is recorded, that of three wishes to be granted him, the third, which he made in a passion, was the death of Hippolytus, which, having been granted, he sunk into the most dreadful distress.", "209": "Therefore, you are not to perform those promises which may be prejudicial to the party to whom you promise, nor if they may be more hurtful to you than they can be serviceable to him.", "210": "It is inconsistent with our duty that the greater obligation should be postponed to the less.", "211": "For instance, suppose you should promise to appear as the advocate of another person while his cause is depending:", "212": "now, if your son was to be seized violently ill in the meantime, it would be no breach of duty in you not to perform what you promise ;", "213": "the other person would rather depart from his duty if he should complain that he had been abandoned.", "214": "Who, then, does not see that a man is not bound by those promises which he makes either when coerced by fear,* or seduced by deceit ?", "215": "Many such promises are cancelled by the edict of the prætor's court, some by the laws;", "216": "for very often wrongs arise through a quirk, and through a too artful but fraudulent construction of the law.", "217": "Hence, \" the rigour of law is the rigour of injustice,\" is a saying that has now passed into a proverb.", "218": "Many injuries of this kind happen even in state affairs:", "219": "thus, when a general had con- cluded a truce with his enemy for thirty days, yet ravaged that enemy's territories every night, because the truce was only for so many days, not for the nights.", "220": "Nor, indeed, if it is true, is the conduct of our countryman, Quintus Fabius Labeo, to be approved of, or whoever he was (for I have the story only by report), who, being appointed an arbiter by the senate to settle a boundary between the people of Nola and those of Naples, counselled each of those people separately to do nothing covetously, and that each ought rather to draw back than advance.", "221": "Both of them taking this advice, a space of unoccupied ground was left in the middle.", "222": "He, therefore, adjudged to each people the boundary to which they had confined themselves, and all that was in the middle to the people of Rome.", "223": "This was not to give judgment but to cheat;", "224": "wherefore we ought to avoid all chicane of that kind in every transaction.", "225": "†XI. Certain duties are also to be observed, even towards those who have wronged you;", "226": "for there is a mean even in revenge and punishments.", "227": "Nay, I am not certain whether it is not sufficient for the person who has injured you to repent of the wrong done, so that he may never be guilty of the like in future, and that others may not be so forward to offend in the same manner.*", "228": "Now, in government the laws of war are to be most especially observed;", "229": "for since there are two manners of disputing, one by debating, the other by fighting, though the former characterises men, the latter, brutes, if the former cannot be adopted, recourse must be had to the latter.", "230": "Wars, therefore, are to be undertaken for this end, that we may live in peace without being injured;", "231": "but when we obtain the victory, we must preserve those enemies who behaved without cruelty or inhumanity during the war:", "232": "for example, our forefathers received, even as members of their state, the Tuscans, the .AEqui, the Volscians, the Sabines, and the Hernici, but utterly destroyed Carthage and Nu- mantia.", "233": "I am unwilling to mention Corinth;", "234": "but I believe they had some object in it, and particularly they were induced to destroy it, lest the advantages of its situation should invite the inhabitants to make war in future times.", "235": "In my opinion, we ought always to consult for peace, which should have in it nothing of perfidy.", "236": "Had my voice been followed on this head, we might still have had some form of government (if not the best), whereas now we have none.", "237": "And, while we are bound to exercise consideration toward those whom we have conquered by force, so those should be received into our protection who throw themselves upon the honour of our general, and lay down their arms, even though the battering rams should have struck their walls.", "238": "In which matter justice was cultivated with so much care among our countrymen, that it was a custom among our ancestors that they who received under their protection cities, or nations conquered in war, became their patrons.", "239": "Now, the justice of war was most religiously pointed out by the fecial law of the Romans.", "240": "From this it may be understood that no war is just unless it is undertaken to reclaim property,* or unless it is solemnly denounced and proclaimed beforehand.", "241": "Popilius, as general, held a province where Cato's son served in his army.", "242": "It happened that Popilius thought proper to disband one legion ;", "243": "he dismissed, at the same time, Cato's son, who was serving in that legion.", "244": "When, however, through love of a military life, he remained in the army, his father wrote to Popilius, that if he suffered him to continue in the service he should, for a second time bind him by the military oath ;", "245": "because the obligation of the former having been annulled, he could not lawfully fight with the enemy.", "246": "So very strict was their observance of laws in making war.", "247": "There is extant a letter of old Cato to his soil on this occasion, in which he writes, \" That he heard he had got his discharge from the consul, while he was serving as a soldier in Macedonia, during the war with Perseus.", "248": "He, therefore, enjoins him to take care not to enter upon action ;", "249": "for he declares that it is not lawful for a man who is not a soldier to fight with an enemy.", "250": "XII.", "251": "And, indeed, there is another thing that I should observe, that he who ought properly be termed perduellis, that is, a stubborn foe, is called a hostis, and thereby the softness of the appellation lessens the horror of the thing ;", "252": "for by our ancestors he was called hostis whom we now call a stranger.", "253": "This the twelve tables demonstrate:", "254": "as in the words, \"a day appointed for the hostis to plead;", "255": "\" and again, \"a Roman's right of property, as against a hostis, never terminates.\"", "256": "What can exceed the gentleness of this, to call those with whom you were at war by so soft an appellation ?", "257": "It is true that length of time has affixed a harsher significa- tion to this word, which has now ceased to be applied to the stranger, and remains peculiar to him who carries arms against us.", "258": "Meanwhile, when we fight for empire, and when we seek glory in arms, all those grounds of war which I have already enumerated to be just ones, must absolutely be in force.", "259": "But wars that are founded upon the glory of con- quest alone, are to be carried on with less rancour;", "260": "for, as we treat a fellow citizen in a different manner as a foe, than we do as an antagonist;", "261": "-as with the latter the struggle is for glory and power, as the former for life and reputation;", "262": "- thus we fought against the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians as against enemies, the question being not who should com- mand but who should exist;", "263": "but we fought for empire against the Latines, the Sabines, the Samnites, the Cartha- ginians, and Pyrrhus.", "264": "The Carthaginians, 'tis true, were faithless, and Hannibal was cruel, but the others were better principled.", "265": "The speech of Pyrrhus about ransoming the captives is a noble one:", "266": "-In war not crafty, but in battle bold, No wealth I value, and I spurn at gold.", "267": "Be steel the only metal shall decree", "268": "The fate of empire, or to you or me.", "269": "The gen'rous conquest be by courage tried, And all the captives on the Roman side, I swear, by all the gods of open war, As fate their lives, their freedom I will spare.", "270": "This sentiment is truly noble, and worthy the descendant of the Æacidæ.", "271": "XIII.", "272": "Nay, if even private persons should, induced by circumstances, make a promise to the enemy, even in this fidelity should be observed.", "273": "Thus Regulus, when be was made a prisoner by the Carthaginians in the first Punic war, being sent to Rome to treat of an exchange of prisoners, he swore that he would return.", "274": "The first thing he did when he came to Rome was to deliver his opinion in the senate that the prisoners should not be restored;", "275": "and after that, when he was detained by his relations and friends, he chose to deliver himself up to a cruel death rather than to falsify his word to the enemy.", "276": "But in the second Punic war, after the battle of Cannæ, Hannibal sent ten Romans to Rome, under an oath that they would return to him unless they procured the prisoners to be ransomed ;", "277": "but the censors disfranchised, as long as they lived, all of them that were perjured, as well as him who had devised a fraudulent evasion of his oath.", "278": "For when, by the leave of Hannibal, he had left the camp, he returned soon after, to say that he had forgotten something;", "279": "and then again leaving the camp he considered himself free from the obligations of his oath, which he was with regard to the words but not the meaning of them;", "280": "for in a promise, what you thought, and not what you said, is always to be consi- dered.*", "281": "But our forefathers set us a most eminent example of justice towards an enemy;", "282": "for when a deserter from Pyrrhus offered to the senate to despatch that prince by poison, the senate and C. Fabricius delivered the traitor up to Pyrrhus.", "283": "Thus they disapproved of taking off by treachery an enemy who was powerful, and was carrying on against them an aggressive war.", "284": "Enough has now been said respecting the duties connected with warfare ;", "285": "but we must bear in mind, that justice is due even to the lowest of mankind ;", "286": "and nothing can be lower than the condition and fortune of a slave.", "287": "And yet those prescribe wisely who enjoin us to put them upon the same footing as hired labourers, obliging them to do their work, but giving them their dues.", "288": "Now, as injustice may be done two ways, by force or fraud ;", "289": "fraud being the property of a fox, force that of a lion ;", "290": "both are utterly repugnant to society, but fraud is the more detestable.", "291": "But in the whole system of villainy, none is more capital than that of the men, who, when they most deceive, so manage as that they may seem to be virtuous men.", "292": "Thus much, then, on the subject of justice.", "293": "XIV.", "294": "Let me now, as I proposed, speak of beneficence and liberality, virtues that are the most agreeable to the nature of man, but which involve many precautionary con- siderations.", "295": "For, in the first place, we are to take care lest our kindness should hurt both those whom it is meant to assist, and others.", "296": "In the next place, it ought not to exceed our abilities;", "297": "and it ought to be rendered to each in proportion to his worth.", "298": "This is the fundamental standard of justice to which all these things should be referred.", "299": "And they who do kindnesses which prove of disservice to the person they pretend to oblige, should not be esteemed beneficent nor generous, but injurious sycophants.", "300": "And they who injure one party in order to be liberal to another, are guilty of the same dishonesty as if they should appropriate to themselves what belongs to another.", "301": "*Now many, and they especially who are the most ambitious after grandeur and glory, rob one party to enrich another ;", "302": "and account themselves generous to their friends if they enrich them by whatever means.", "303": "This is so far from being consistent with, that nothing can be more contrary to, our duty.", "304": "We should therefore take care to practise that kind of generosity that is serviceable to our friends, but hurtful to none.", "305": "Upon this principle, when Lucius Sylla and Caius Cæsar took property from its just owners and transferred it to strangers, in so doing they ought not to be accounted generous ;", "306": "for nothing can be generous that is not at the same time just.", "307": "Our next part of circumspection is, that our generosity never should exceed our abilities.", "308": "For they who are more generous than their circumstances admit of are, first, guilty in this, that they wrong their relations;", "309": "because they bestow upon strangers those means which they might, with greater justice, give or leave to those who are nearest to them.", "310": "Now a generosity of this kind is generally attended with a lust to ravish and to plunder, in order to be furnished with the means to give away.", "311": "For it is easy to observe, that most of them are not so much by nature generous, as they are misled by a kind of pride to do a great many things in order that they may seem to be generous ;", "312": "which things seem to spring not so much from good will as from osten- tation.", "313": "Now such a simulation is more nearly allied to duplicity than to generosity or virtue.", "314": "The third head proposed was, that in our generosity we should have regard to merit;", "315": "and, consequently, examine both the morals of the party to whom we are generous, and his disposition towards us, together with the general good of society, and how far he may have already contributed to our own interest.", "316": "Could all those considerations be united, it were the more desirable ;", "317": "but the object in whom is united the most numerous and the most important of them, ought to have the greatest weight with us.XV.", "318": "But as we live not with men who are absolutely perfect and completely wise, but with men who have great merit if they possess the outlines of worth, we are, I think, from thence to infer, that no man is to be neglected in whom there appears any indication of virtue ;", "319": "and that each should be regarded in proportion as he is adorned with the milder virtues of modesty, temperance, and that very justice of which I have so largely treated.", "320": "For fortitude and greatness of spirit is commonly too violent in a man who is not com- pletely wise and perfect;", "321": "but the aforesaid virtues seem to belong more to a good man.", "322": "Having said thus much of morals ;", "323": "with regard to the kindness which a person expresses for us, our first duty is, to perform the most for him by whom we are most beloved.", "324": "Now we are to judge of kindness, not like children, by a sort of ardour of affection, but by its stability and constancy.", "325": "But if its merits are such, that we are not to court but to requite the kindness, the greater ought our care to be;", "326": "for there is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kind- ness.", "327": "Now if, as Hesiod enjoins, we ought, if it is in our power, to repay what we have received for mere use with interest, how ought we to act when called upon by kindness ?", "328": "Are we not to imitate those fertile fields which yield far more than they have received ?", "329": "For, if we readily oblige those who we are in hopes will serve us, how ought we to behave towards those who have served us already ?", "330": "For as generosity is of two kinds, the one conferring a favour, the other repaying it, whether we confer it or not is at our own option, but the not repaying it is not allowable in a good man, provided he can do so without injury to any.", "331": "Now there are distinctions to be made as to the benefits received ;", "332": "and it is clear that the greatest return is due in each case to the greatest obligation.", "333": "Meanwhile, we are above all things to consider the spirit, the zeal, and the meaning with which a favour is conferred.", "334": "For many confer numerous favours with a sort of recklessness, without any judgment or prin- ciple, upon all mankind promiscuously, or influenced by sudden perturbation of mind, as if by a hurricane :", "335": "such favours are not to be esteemed so highly as those which result from judgment, consideration, and consistency.", "336": "But in conferring or requiting kindness, the chief rule of our duty ought to be, if all other circumstances are equal, to confer most upon the man who stands in greatest need of assistance.", "337": "The reverse of this is practised by the generality, who direct their greatest services to the man from whom they hope the most, though he may stand in no need of them.", "338": "XVI.", "339": "Now society and alliances amongst men would be best preserved if the greatest kindness should be manifested where there is the nearest relation.", "340": "But we ought to go higher, if we are to investigate the natural principles of intercourse and community amongst men.", "341": "The first is, that which is perceived in the society of the whole human race.", "342": "and of this the bond is speech and reason, which by teaching, learning, communicating, debating, and judging, conciliate men together, and bind them into a kind of natural society.", "343": "There is nothing in which we differ more from the nature of brutes than in tills ;", "344": "for we very often allow them to have courage, as for instance, horses and lions;", "345": "but we never admit that they possess justice, equity, and goodness ;", "346": "because they are void of reason and speech.", "347": "Now this is the kind of society that is most extensive with mankind amongst themselves, and it goes through all;", "348": "for here a community of all things that nature has produced for the common use of mankind is preserved, so as that they may be possessed in the manner prescribed by laws and civil statutes:", "349": "of which laws themselves some are to be observed in accordance with the Greek proverb, \"that all things amongst friends are to be in common.\"", "350": "Now this community consists of things which are of that nature which, though placed by Ennius under one head, may be applied to many. \" He (says that author) who kindly shows the bewildered traveller the right road.", "351": "does as it were light his lamp by his own ;", "352": "which affords none the less light to himself after it has lighted the other.", "353": "\"By this single example he sufficiently enjoins on us to perform, even to a stranger, all the service we can do without detriment to ourselves.", "354": "Of which service the following are common illustrations :", "355": "\"That we are to debar no man from the running stream;", "356": "\" \"", "357": "That we are to suffer any who desire it to kindle fire at our fire \"", "358": "That we are to give faithful counsel to a person who is in doubt:", "359": "\" all which are particulars that are serviceable to the receiver without being detrimental to the bestower.", "360": "We are therefore to practise them, and be constantly contributing somewhat to the common good.", "361": "As the means, however, of each par- ticular person are very confined and the numbers of the indigent are boundless, our distributive generosity ought still to be bounded by the principle of Ennius,—\"it nevertheless gives light to one's self,\"—that we may still be possessed of the means to be generous to our friends.", "362": "XVII.", "363": "Now the degrees of human society are many.", "364": "For, to quit the foregoing unbounded kind, there is one more confined, which consists of men of the same race, nation, and language, by which people are more intimately connected among themselves.", "365": "A more contracted society than that consists of men inhabiting the same city;", "366": "for many things are in common among fellow citizens, such as their forum, their temples, their porticoes, their streets, their laws, their rites, their courts of justice, their trials, not to mention their customs, and intimacies, with a great number of particular dealings and intercourses of numbers with numbers.", "367": "There is a still more contracted degree of society, which is that of relatives;", "368": "and this closes, in a narrow point, the unbounded general association of the human race.", "369": "For, as it is a common natural principle among all animated beings that they have a desire to propagate their own species, the first principle of society consists in the marriage tie, the next in children, the next in a family within one roof, where everything is in common.", "370": "This society gives rise to the city, and Is, as it were, the nursery of the commonwealth.", "371": "Next follows the connexion of brotherhood, next that of cousins, in their different degrees;", "372": "and, when they grow too numerous to be contained under one roof, they are trans- planted to different dwellings, as it were to so many colonies.", "373": "Then follow marriages and alliances, whence spring more numerous relationships.", "374": "The descendants, by this propa- gation, form the origin of commonwealths;", "375": "but the ties and affections of blood bind mankind by affection.", "376": "*For there is something very powerful in having the monu- merits of our ancestors the same, in practising the same religious rites, and in having the same places of interment.", "377": "But amongst all the degrees of society, none is more excel- lent, none more stable, than when worthy meu, through a similarity of manners, are intimately connected together;", "378": "for, as I have often said, even when we discern the honestum in another it touches us, and makes us friends to the man in whom it resides.", "379": "Now, though virtue of every kind attracts and charms us to the love of those who possess it, yet that love is strongest that is effected by justice and generosity.", "380": "For nothing is more lovely, nothing is more binding, than a similarity of good dispositions;", "381": "* because amongst those whose pursuits and pleasures are the same, every man is pleased as much with another as he is with himself, and that is effected which Pythagoras chiefly contemplates in friendship, \"that many become one.\"", "382": "A strong community is likewise effected by good offices mutually conferred and received;", "383": "and, provided these be reciprocal and agreeable, those amongst whom they happen are bound together in close association.", "384": "But when you view everything with reason and reflection, of all connections none is more weighty, none is more dear, than that between every individual and his country.", "385": "Our parents are dear to us;", "386": "our children, our kinsmen, our friends, are dear to us;", "387": "but our country comprehends alone all the endearments of us all.", "388": "For which what good man would hesitate to die if he could do her service ?", "389": "The more execrably unnatural, therefore, are they who wound their country by every species of guilt, and who are now, and have been, employed in her utter destruction.", "390": "But were a computation or comparison set up, of those objects to which our chief duty should be paid, the principal are our country and our parents, by whose services we are laid under the strongest obligations;", "391": "the next are our children and entire family, who depend upon us alone, without having any other refuge;", "392": "the next our agreeable kinsmen, who generally share our fortuue in common.", "393": "The necessary supports of life, therefore, are due chiefly to those I have already mentioned ;", "394": "but the mutual intercourses of life, counsels, discourses, ex- hortations, consultations, and even sometimes reproofs, flourish chiefly in friendships, and those friendships are the most agreeable that are cemented by a similarity of manners.", "395": "XVIII.", "396": "But in performing all those duties we are care- fully to consider what is most necessary to each, and what every one of them could or could not attain even without us.", "397": "Thus the relative claims of relationship and of circumstances will not always be identical.", "398": "Some duties are owing to some more than to others.", "399": "For instance, you are sooner to help your neighbour to house his corn, than your brother or your friend;", "400": "but if a cause be on trial, you are to take part with your kinsman, or your friend, rather than with your neigh- bour.", "401": "These considerations, therefore, and the like, ought to be carefully observed in every duty;", "402": "and custom and practice should be attained, that we may be able to be correct assessors of our duties, and, by adding or subtracting, to strike the balance, by which we may see the proportion to which every party is entitled.", "403": "But as neither physicians, nor generals, nor orators, how- ever perfect they may be in the theory of their art, can ever perform anything that is highly praiseworthy, without expe- rience and practice, so rules have indeed been laid down for the observation of duties, as I myself am doing;", "404": "but the import- ance of the matter demands experience and practice.", "405": "I have now, I think, sufficiently treated of the manner in which the honestum, which gives the fitness to our duties, arises from those matters that come within the rights of human society.", "406": "It must be understood, however, at the same time, that when the four springs from which virtue and honesty, arise are laid open, that which is done with a lofty spirit, and one which scorns ordinary interests, appears the most noble.", "407": "Therefore the most natural of all reproaches is somewhat of the following kind:", "408": "- Young men, ye carry but the souls of women;", "409": "That woman of a man.", "410": "Or somewhat of the following kind:", "411": "- Salmacis, give me spoils without toil or danger.", "412": "On the other hand, in our praises, I know not how it is, but actions performed with magnanimity, with fortitude, and virtue, we eulogize in a loftier style.", "413": "From hence Marathon, Salamis, Platæa, Thermopylae, Leuctra, have become the field of rhetoricians;", "414": "and amongst ourselves, Cocles, the Decii, the two Scipios, Cneius and Publius, Marcus Marcellus, and a great many others.", "415": "Indeed, the Roman people in general are distinguished above all by elevation of spirit;", "416": "and their fondness for military glory is shown by the fact that we generally see their statues dressed in warlike habits.", "417": "XIX.", "418": "But that magnanimity which is discovered in toils and dangers, if it be devoid of justice, and contend not for the public good, but for selfish interest, is blameable ;", "419": "for, so far from being a mark of virtue, it is rather that of a barbarity which is repulsive to all humanity.", "420": "By the Stoics, therefore, fortitude is rightly defined, when they call it valour fighting on the side of justice.\"", "421": "No man, there- fore, who has acquired the reputation of fortitude, attained his glory by deceit and malice;", "422": "for nothing that is devoid of justice can be a virtue.", "423": "It is, therefore, finely said by Plato, that not only the knowledge that is apart from justice deserves the appellation of cunning rather than wisdom, but also a mind that is ready to encounter danger, if it is animated by private interest, and not public utility, deserves the character of audaciousness rather than of fortitude.", "424": "We, therefore, require that all men of courage and magnanimity should be at the same time men of virtue and of simplicity, lovers of truth, and by no means deceitful;", "425": "for these qualities are the main glory of justice.", "426": "But there is one painful consideration, that obstinacy, and an undue ambition for power, naturally spring up from this elevation and greatness of spirit;", "427": "for, as Plato tells us, the entire character of the Lacedemonians was inflamed with the desire of conquest.", "428": "Thus the man who is most distin- guished by his magnanimity, is most desirous of being the leading, or rather the only potentate of all.", "429": "Now, it is a difficult matter, when you desire to be superior to all others, to preserve that equability which is the characteristic or justice.", "430": "Hence it is that such men will not suffer themselves to be thwarted in a debate, nor by any public and lawful authority;", "431": "and in public matters they are commonly guilty of corruption and faction, in order to grasp at as great power as possible;", "432": "and they choose to be superior by means of force, rather than equals by justice.", "433": "But the more diffi- cult the matter is, it is the more glorious;", "434": "for there is no conjuncture which ought to be unconnected with justice.", "435": "They, therefore, who oppose, not they who commit, in- justice are to be deemed brave and magnanimous.", "436": "Now, genuine and well-considered magnanimity judges that the honestum, which is nature's chief aim, consists in realities and not in mere glory, and rather chooses to be than to seem pre-eminent:", "437": "for the man who is swayed by the pre- judices of an ignorant rabble is not to be reckoned among the great;", "438": "but the man of a spirit the most elevated, through the desire of glory, is the most easily impelled into acts of injustice.", "439": "This is, indeed, a slippery situation;", "440": "for scarcely can there be found a man who, after enduring trials and encountering dangers, does not pant for popularity as the reward of his exploits.*XX.", "441": "A spirit altogether brave and elevated is chiefly dis- cernible by two characters.", "442": "The first consists in a low estimate of mere outward circumstances, since it is convinced that a man ought to admire, desire, or court nothing but what is virtuous and becoming;", "443": "and that he ought to succumb to no man, nor to any perturbation either of spirit or fortune.*", "444": "The other thing is, that possessed of such a spirit as I have just mentioned, you should perform actions which are great and of the greatest utility, but extremely arduous, full of difficulties and danger both to life and the many things which pertain to life.", "445": "In the latter of those two characters consist all the glory, the majesty, and, I add, the utility;", "446": "but the causes and the efficient means that form great men is in the former, which contains the principles that elevate the soul, and gives it a contempt for temporary considerations.", "447": "Now, this very excel- lence consists in two particulars:", "448": "you are to deem that only to be good that is virtuous;", "449": "and that you be free from all mental irregularity.", "450": "For we are to look upon it as the character of a noble and an elevated soul, to slight all those considerations that the generality of mankind account great and glorious, and to despise them, upon firm and durable principles;", "451": "while strength of mind, and greatness of resolution, are discerned in bearing those calamities which, in the course of man's life, are many and various, so as not to be driven from your na- tural disposition, nor from the dignity of a wise man:", "452": "for it is not consistent that he who is not subdued by fear should be subjugated by passion ;", "453": "nor that he who has shown him- self invincible by toil, should be conquered by pleasure.", "454": "t", "455": "Wherefore, we ought to watch and avoid the love of money:", "456": "for nothing so truly characterizes a narrow, grovelling dispo- sition as to love riches;", "457": "* and nothing is more noble and more exalted than to despise riches if you have them not, and if you have them, to employ them in beneficence and libe- rality.", "458": "†An inordinate passion for glory, as I have already ob- served, is likewise to be guarded against;", "459": "for it deprives us of liberty, the only prize for which men of elevated senti- ments ought to contend.", "460": "Power is so far from being desirable in itself, that it sometimes ought to be refused, and some- times to be resigned.", "461": "We should likewise be free from all disorders of the mind, from all violent passion and fear, as well as languor, voluptuousness, and anger, that we may possess that tranquillity and security which confer alike consistency and dignity.", "462": "Now, many there are, and have been, who, courting that tranquillity which I have mentioned here, have withdrawn themselves from public affairs and taken refuge in retirement.", "463": "Amongst these, some of the noblest and most leading of our philosophers;", "464": "‡ and some persons, of strict and grave dispositions, were unable to bear with the manners either of the people or their rulers;", "465": "and some have lived in the country, amusing themselves with the management of their private affairs.", "466": "Their aim was the same as that of the powerful, that they might enjoy their liberty, without wanting anything or obeying any person;", "467": "for the essence of liberty is to live just as you please.", "468": "XXI.", "469": "Therefore, as the object of those who are ambitious for power, and of those who court retirement, and whom I have just now described, is the same, the former imagine they can attain it if they are possessed of great resources, and the latter, if they can be contented with their own, and with little.", "470": "In this matter, the sentiments of neither are to be absolutely rejected.", "471": "But a life of retirement is more easy, more safe, less tiresome, and less troublesome than any other;", "472": "while the life of those who apply themselves to the affairs of government, and to the management of a state, is more beneficial to mankind, and more conducive to glory and renown.", "473": "Allowances, therefore, are to be made for those who having no management in public matters, with an excellent genius, give themselves up to learning;", "474": "and to those who being hindered by feebleness of health, or for some very weighty reason, retire from affairs of government, and leave to others the power and the honour of the administration:", "475": "but when men, who have no such excuses, say that they despise that power and those offices which most admire, such men are so far from deserving praise that they incur censure.", "476": "It is difficult to condemn their judgment in despising and under- valuing popularity;", "477": "but then they seem to dread the toils and troubles of affronts and repulses as involving ignominy and infamy.", "478": "For some there are who, in opposite matters, are very inconsistent with themselves;", "479": "they spurn most rigidly at pleasure, but they droop in pain;", "480": "they despise glory, but sink under unpopularity;", "481": "and that, too, with no little inconsistency.", "482": "But the men who inherit from nature appliances for government ought, laying aside all excuses, to undertake the discharge of all public offices and the management of state affairs;", "483": "for neither can a state be governed, nor can magna- nimity display itself, by any other means.", "484": "I am not, however, sure whether those who undertake the management of public affairs ought not to be equally distinguished by magnanimity us philosophers, if not more so, and impressed with a con- tempt of common affairs and to possess that tranquillity, that calm of mind, I have so much recommended;", "485": "I mean, if they wish to live without anxiety, with dignity and consistency.", "486": "This may be the more easily practised by philosophers, because in their lives there is less exposed for fortune to strike at;", "487": "because their necessities are more contracted;", "488": "and because, if anything adverse should happen, they cannot fall so heavily.", "489": "It is not, therefore, without reason, that in the mind of those who undertake the management of public affairs, more violent passions are excited, and mightier mat- ters are to be attempted, than by those who are retired;", "490": "they, therefore, ought to possess greater elevation of spirit, and freedom from disquiets.", "491": "But, whoever enters upon public life ought to take care that the question, how far the measure is virtuous, be not his sole consideration, but also how far he may have the means of carrying it into execution.", "492": "In this he is chiefly to take care that through indolence he do not meanly despond, nor through eagerness too much pre- sume.", "493": "Thus, in all affairs, before you undertake them, a diligent preparation should be entered into.", "494": "XXII.", "495": "But, since most persons are of opinion that the achievements of war are more glorious than civil affairs, this judgment needs to be restricted:", "496": "for many, as generally is the case with high minds and enterprising spirits, espe- cially if they are adapted to military life and are fond of warlike achievements, have often sought opportunities of war from their fondness for glory;", "497": "but if we are willing to judge truly, many are the civil employments of greater im- portance, and of more renown, than the military.", "498": "For though Themistocles is justly praised-his name is now more illustrious than that of Solon, and his glorious victory at Salamis is mentioned preferably to the policy of Solon, by which he first confirmed the power of the Areopagus -the one should not be considered more illustrious than the other;", "499": "for the one availed his country only for once-the other is lastingly advantageous;", "500": "because by it the laws of the Athenians, and the institutions of their ancestors, are preserved.", "501": "Now,", "502": "Themistocles could not have stated any respect in which he benefited the Areopagus, but the former might with truth declare that Themistocles had been advan- taged by him;", "503": "for the war was carried on by the counsels of that senate which was constituted by Solon.", "504": "We may make the same observation with regard to Pausanias and Lysander amongst the Lacedemonians ;", "505": "for all the addition of empire which their conquests are supposed to have brought to their country is not to be compared to the laws and economy of Lycurgus ;", "506": "for indeed, owing to these very causes they had armies more subordinate and courageous.", "507": "In my eyes, Marcus Scaurus (who flourished when I was but a boy) was not inferior to Caius Marius;",

"510": "Nor did that good man and great general, Africanus, perform a more important service to his country when he razed Numantia, than did that private citizen, P. Nasica, when at the same period he killed Tiberius Gracchus.", "511": "An action which it is true was not merely of a civil nature ;", "512": "for it approaches to a military character, as being the result of force and courage ;", "513": "but it was an action performed without an army, and from political considerations.", "514": "That state described by the following line is best for a country, for which I understand that I am abused by the wicked and malicious:", "515": "Arms to the gown, and laurels yield to lore.", "516": "*For, not to mention other persons, when I was at the helm of government did not \"arms yield to the gown?\"", "517": "For never did our country know a time of more threatening danger or more profound tranquillity;", "518": "so quickly, through my counsel and my diligence, did the arms of our most pro- fligate fellow citizens drop of themselves out of their hands.", "519": "What so great exploit as this was ever performed in wai, or what triumph can be compared with it ?", "520": "The inheritance of my glory and the imitation of my actions are to descend to you, my son Marcus, therefore it is allowable for me to boast in writing to you.", "521": "It is, how- ever, certain that Pompey, who was possessed of much military glory, paid this tribute to me, in the hearing of many, that in vain would he have returned to his third triumph, had not my public services preserved the place in which he was to celebrate it.", "522": "The examples of civil courage are therefore no less meritorious than those of mili- tary ;", "523": "and they require a greater share of zeal and labour than the latter.", "524": "XXIII.", "525": "Now all that excellence which springs from a lofty and noble nature is altogether produced by the mental and not by the corporeal powers.*", "526": "Meanwhile, the body ought to be kept in such action and order, as that it may be always ready to obey the dictates of reason and wisdom, in carrying them into execution, and in persevering under hardships.", "527": "But with regard to that honestum we are treating of, it consists wholly in the thoughtful application of the mind ;", "528": "by which the civilians who preside over public affairs are equally serviceable to their country as they who wage wars.", "529": "For it often happens that by such counsels wars are either not entered into, or they are brought to a termination ;", "530": "sometimes they are even undertaken, as the third Punic wale was by the advice of Marcus Cato, whose authority was powerful, even after he was dead.", "531": "Wisdom in determining is therefore preferable tc courage in fighting ;", "532": "but in this we are to take care that we are not swayed by an aversion to fighting rather than by a consideration of expediency.*", "533": "Now in engaging in war we ought to make it appear that we have no other view but peace.", "534": "But the character of a brave and resolute man is not to be ruffled with adversity, and not to be in such confusion as to quit his post, as we say, but to preserve a presence of mind, and the exercise of reason, without departing from his purpose.", "535": "And while this is the charac- teristic of a lofty spirit, so this also is that of a powerful intellect, namely, to anticipate futurity in thought, and to conclude beforehand what may happen on either side, and, upon that, what measures to pursue, and never be surprised so as to say, \"I had not thought of that.\"", "536": "Such are the operations of a genius, capacious and elevated ;", "537": "of such a one as relies on its own prudence and counsel ;", "538": "† but to rush precipitately into the field, and to encounter an enemy with mere physical force has somewhat in it that is barbarous and brutal.",

plundering of cities, great consideration is required that nothing be done rashly, nothing cruelly.*", "542": "And this is the part of a great man, after he has maturely weighed all circumstances, to punish the guilty, to spare the many ;", "543": "and in every state of fortune not to depart from an upright, virtuous conduct.", "544": "For, as you find (as I have already observed) men who prefer military to civil duties, so will you find many of that cast wile look upon dangerous and violent resolutions to be more splendid and more dignified than calm and digested measures.", "545": "We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear irresolute and cowardly ;", "546": "but, at the same time, we should avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than which nothing can be more foolish.", "547": "In encountering dangers, therefore, we are to imitate the practice of the physicians who apply to gentle illnesses gentle medicines, but are forced to apply more desperate and more doubtful cures to more dangerous diseases.", "548": "It is the part of a madman to wish for an adverse tempest in a calm, but of a wise man to find relief against the tempest by what- ever means ;", "549": "and the rather if one incurs more advantage by accomplishing the matter than disadvantage by keeping it in suspense.", "550": "Now the conducting of enterprises is dangerous sometimes to the undertakers, and sometimes to the state;", "551": "and hence some are in danger of losing their lives, some their reputation, and some their popularity.", "552": "But we ought to be more forward to expose our own persons than the general interests to danger, and to be more ready to fight for honour and reputation than for other advantages.", "553": "Though many have been known cheerfully to venture not only their money but their lives for the public;", "554": "yet those very men have refused to suffer the smallest loss of glory even at the request of their country.", "555": "For instance, Calli- cratidas, who, after performing many gallant actions at the head of the Lacedemonian armies, during the Peloponesian war, at last threw everything into confusion by refusing to obey the directions of those who were for removing the fleet from Arginusæ, and not for fighting the Athenians ;", "556": "to whom his answer was, that if the Lacedemonians lost that fleet they could fit out another, but that he could not turn his back without dishonour to himself.", "557": "'Tis true, the blow that followed upon this was not very severe to the Lacedemonians ;", "558": "but it was a deadly one, when, from a fear of public odium, Cleombrotus fought with Epamonidas, and the power of the Lacedemonians perished.", "559": "How preferable was the conduct of Quintus Maximus, of whom Ennius says :", "560": "— “ The man* who saved his country by delay, No tales could move him, and no envy sway;", "561": "And thus the laurels on his honoured brow, In age shall flourish, and with time shall grow.\"", "562": "This is a species of fault which ought also to be avoided in civil matters;", "563": "for there are some men who, from a dread of unpopularity, dare not express their opinions however excellent they may be.XXV.", "564": "All who hope to rise in a state ought strictly to observe two rules of Plato.", "565": "The first is, that they so keep in view the advantage of their fellow citizens as to have reference to it in whatever they do, regardless of their indi- vidual interest.*", "566": "The second is, that their cares be applied to the whole of the state, lest while they are cherishing one part they abandon the others.", "567": "For the administration of government, like a guardianship, ought to be directed to the good of those who confer, and not of those who receive the trust.", "568": "†", "569": "Now, they who consult the interests of one part of a community and neglect another, introduce into the state the greatest of all evils, sedition and discord.", "570": "From this partiality some seem to court the people, some each great man, but few the whole.", "571": "Hence the great discords amongst the Athenians, and in our government not only seditions but the most destructive wars, which every worthy and brave citizen who deserves to rise in the state will avoid and de- test :", "572": "he will give himself entirely up to the service of his country, without regard to riches or to power, and he will watch over the whole so as to consult the good of all, He will even be far from bringing any man into hatred or disgrace, by ill-grounded charges, and he will so closely attach himself to the rules of justice and virtue, that how- ever lie may give offence he will preserve them, and incur death itself rather than swerve from the principles I have laid down.", "573": "Of all evils, ambition and the disputes for public posts are the most deplorable.", "574": "Plato, likewise, on this subject, says very admirably, \" that they who dispute for the management of a state resemble mariners wrangling about who should direct the helm.\"", "575": "He then lays down as a rule that we ought to look upon those as our enemies who take arms against the public, and not those who want to have public affairs directed by their judgment.", "576": "For instance, Publius Africanus and Quintus Metellus differed in opinion, but without animosity.", "577": "Nor, indeed, are those to be listened to who consider that we ought to cherish a bitter resentment against our enemies, and that this is characteristic of a high-minded and brave man;", "578": "for nothing is more noble, nothing more worthy of a great and a good man, than placability and moderation.*'", "579": "Nay, amidst free nations and equality of rights, an equability and loftiness of temper is necessary, to prevent our falling into an idle, disagreeable peevishness, when we are irritated by persons approaching us unseasonably, or preferring to us unreasonable requests.", "580": "Yet this politeness and moderation ought to be so tempered, that for the sake of the interests of the state severity should be employed, otherwise public business could not be carried on.", "581": "Meanwhile, all reprimands and punishments ought to be inflicted without abuse, without regard to the party so punishing or reprimanding, but to the good of the state.", "582": "We ought, likewise, to take care that the punishment be proportioned to the offence, * aDd that some be not punished for doing things for which others are not so much as called to account.", "583": "Above all things, in punishing we ought to guard against passion;", "584": "for the man who is to pronounce a sentence of punishment in a passion, never can preserve that mean between what is too much and too little, which is so justly recommended by the Peripatetics, did they not too much commend the passion of anger, by asserting it to be a useful property of our nature.", "585": "For my part, I think that it ought to be checked under all circumstances ;", "586": "† and it were to be wished that they who preside in government were like the laws, which in punishing are not directed by resentments but by equity.", "587": "XXVI.", "588": "Now, during our prosperity, and while things flow agreeably to our desire, we ought with great care to avoid pride and arrogance;", "589": "for, as it discovers weakness not to bear adversity with equanimity, so also with prosperity.", "590": "That equanimity in every condition of life is a noble attri- bute, and that uniform expression of countenance and appear- anc3 which we find recorded of Socrates, and also of Cams Lælius.", "591": "Though Philip of Macedon was excelled by his soil in his achievements and his renown, yet I find him superior to him in politeness and goodness of nature;", "592": "the one, there- fore, always appeared great, while the other often became detestable.", "593": "So that they appear to teach rightly, who admo- nish us that the more advanced we are in our fortune the more affable ought we to be in our behaviour.", "594": "Panætius tells us his scholar and friend, Africanus, used to say, that as horses, grown unruly by being in frequent engagements, are delivered over to be tamed by horse-breakers, thus men, who grow riotous and self-sufficient by prosperity, ought, as it were, to be exercised in the traverse of reason and phi- losophy, that they may learn the inconstancy of human affairs and the uncertainty of fortune.", "595": "In the time of our greatest prosperity we should also have the greatest recourse to the advice of our friends, and greater authority should be conceded to them than before.", "596": "At such a time we are to take care not to lend our ears to flatterers, or to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by adulation, by which it is easy to be misled:", "597": "for we then think ourselves such as may be justly praised, an opinion that gives rise to a thousand errors in conduct;", "598": "because, when men are once blown up with idle conceits, they are exposed to igno- minious ridicule and led into the greatest mistakes.", "599": "So much for this subject.", "600": "One thing you are to understand, that they who regulate public affairs perform the greatest exploits, and such as require the highest style of mind, because their business is most extensive and concerns the greatest number.", "601": "Yet there are, and have been, many men of great capacities, who in private life have planned out or attempted mighty matters, and yet have confined themselves to the limits of their own affairs;", "602": "or, being thrown into a middle state, between phi losophers and those who govern the state, have amused themselves with the management of their private fortune, without swelling it by all manner of means, not debarring their friends from the benefit of it, but rather, when occasion calls upon them, sharing it both with their friends and their country.", "603": "This should be originally acquired with honesty, without any scandalous or oppressive practices;", "604": "it should then be made serviceable to as many as possible, provided they be worthy;", "605": "it should next be augmented by prudence, by industry, and frugality, without serving the purposes of pleasure and luxury rather than of generosity and humanity.", "606": "The man who observes those rules may live with magni- ficence, with dignity, and with spirit, yet with simplicity and honour, and agreeably to (the economy of) human life.", "607": "XXVII.", "608": "The next thing is, to treat of that remaining part of virtue in which consist chastity and those (as we may term them) ornaments of life, temperance, moderation, and all that allays the perturbations of the mind.", "609": "Under this head is comprehended what in Latin we may call decorum (or the graceful), for the Greeks term it the πϱεπον.", "610": "Now, its quality is such that it is indiscernible from the honestum ;", "611": "for what- ever is graceful is virtuous, and whatever is virtuous is graceful.", "612": "But it is more easy to conceive than to express the differ- ence between what is virtuous and what is graceful (or between the honestum and the decorum;", "613": ") for whatever is graceful appears such, when virtue is its antecedent.", "614": "What is graceful, therefore, appears not only in that division of virtue which is here treated of, but in the three foregoing ones ;", "615": "for it is graceful in a man to think and to speak with propriety, to act with deliberation, and in every occurrence of life to find out and persevere in the truth.", "616": "On the other hand, to be imposed upon, to mistake, to faulter, and to be deceived, is as ungraceful as to rave or to be insane.", "617": "Thus, whatever is just is graceful;", "618": "whatever is unjust is as un- graceful as it is criminal.", "619": "The same principle applies to courage;", "620": "for every manly and magnanimous action is worthy of a man and graceful;", "621": "the reverse, as being unworthy, is ungraceful.", "622": "This, therefore, which I call gracefulness, is a universal property of virtue, and a property that is self-evident, and not discerned by any profundity of reasoning;", "623": "for there is a certain gracefulness that is implied in every virtue, and which may exist distinctly from virtue, rather in thought than in fact:", "624": "as grace and beauty of person, for example, cannot be separated from health, so the whole of that grace- fulness which I here speak of is blended with virtue, but may exist separately in the mind and in idea.", "625": "Now, the definition of this is twofold :", "626": "for there is a general gracefulness that is the property of all virtue, and that in- eludes another, which is fitted to the particular divisions of virtue.", "627": "The former is commonly defined to be that grace- fulness that is conformable to that excellence of man, in which he differs from other sentient beings;", "628": "but the special, which is comprised under the general, is defined to be a gracefulness so adapted to nature as to exhibit propriety and sweetness under a certain elegant appearance.", "629": "XXVIII.", "630": "We may perceive that these things are so understood from that gracefulness which is aimed at by the poets, and of which elsewhere more is wont to be said ;", "631": "for we say that the poets observe that gracefulness to be when a person speaks and acts in that manner which is most becoming his character.", "632": "Thus if Æacus or Minos should say:", "633": "-Let them hate me, so they fear me ;", "634": "Or-The father's belly is his children's grave,it would seem unsuitable, because we know them to have been just persons;", "635": "but when said by an Atreus, they are received with applause, because the speech is worthy of the character.", "636": "Now, poets will form their judgment of what is becoming in each individual according to his character;", "637": "but nature herself has stamped on us a character in excellence greatly surpassing the rest of the animal creation.", "638": "Poets, therefore, in their vast variety of characters, con- sider what is proper and what is becoming, even in the vicious:", "639": "but as nature herself has cast to us our parts in constancy moderation, temperance, and modesty;", "640": "as she, at the same time, instructs us not to be unmindful, how we should behave to mankind, the effect is, that the extent both of that gracefulness which is the general property of all virtue, and of that particular gracefulness that is adapted to every species of it, is discovered.", "641": "For as personal beauty, by the sym- metrical disposition of the limbs, attracts our attention and pleases the eye, by the harmony and elegance with which each part corresponds to another, so that gracefulness which manifests itself in life, attracts the approbation of those among whom we live, by the order, consistency, and modesty of all our words and deeds.", "642": "There is, therefore, a degree of respect due from us, suited to every man's character, from the best to the worst:", "643": "for it it is not only arrogant, but it is profligate, for a man to disre- gard the world's opinion of himself;", "644": "but, in our estimate of human life, we are to make a difference between justice and moral susceptibility.*", "645": "The dictate of justice is to do no wrong;", "646": "that of moral susceptibility is to give no offence to mankind, and in this the force of the graceful is most per- ceptible.", "647": "By these explanations I conceive that what we mean by the graceful and becoming may be understood.", "648": "Now the duty resulting from this has a primary tendency to an agreement with and conservation of our nature ;", "649": "and if we follow it as a guide we never shall err, but shall attain to that natural excellence which consists in acuteness and sagacity, to that which is best adapted to human society, and to that which is energetic and manly.*", "650": "But the chief force of the graceful lies in that suitableness of which I am now treating.", "651": "For not only those emotions of a physical kind, but still more those of the mind are to be approved as they are conformable to nature.", "652": "For the nature and powers of the mind are two-fold ;", "653": "one consists in appetite, by the Greeks called (i. e. impulse) which hurries man hither and thither ;", "654": "the other in reason, which teaches and explains what we are to do, and what we are to avoid.", "655": "The result is, that reason should direct and appetite obey.", "656": "XXIX.", "657": "Now every human action ought to be free from precipitancy and negligence, nor indeed ought we to do anything for which we cannot give a justifiable reason.", "658": "This indeed almost amounts to a definition of duty.", "659": "Now we must manage so as to keep the appetites subservient to reason, that they may neither outstrip it, nor fall behind through sloth and cowardice.", "660": "Let them be ever composed and free from all perturbation of spirit;", "661": "and thus entire consistency and moderation will display themselves.", "662": "For those appetites that are too vagrant and rampant as it were, either through desire or aversion, are not sufficiently under the command of reason ;", "663": "such, 1 say, undoubtedly transgress bounds and moderation.", "664": "For they abandon and disclaim that subordination to reason, to which by the law of nature they are subjected, and thereby not only the mind but the body is thrown into disturbance.", "665": "Let any one observe the very looks of men who are in a rage, of those who are.", "666": "agitated by desire or fear, or who exult in an excess of joy ;", "667": "all whose countenances, voices, motions, and attitudes, are changed.", "668": "But to return to my description of duty.", "669": "From these par- ticulars we learn that all our appetites ought to be contracted and mitigated ;", "670": "that all our attention and diligence ought to be awake, so that we do nothing in a rash, random, thought- less, and inconsiderate manner.", "671": "For nature has not formed us to sport and merriment, but rather to seriousness, and studies that are important and sublime.", "672": "Sport and merriment are not always disallowable :", "673": "but we are to use them as we do sleep and other kinds of repose, when we have despatched our weighty and important affairs.", "674": "Nay, our very manner of joking should be neither wanton nor indecent, but genteel and good-humoured.", "675": "For as we indulge boys not in an unlimited licence of sport, but only in that which is not inconsistent with virtuous conduct, so in our very jokes there should appear some gleam of a virtuous nature.", "676": "The manner of joking is reduceable under two denomina- tions ;", "677": "-one that is ill-bred, insolent, profligate, and obscene ;", "678": "another that is elegant, polite, witty, and good-humoured.", "679": "We have abundance of this last, not only in our Plautus, and the authors of the old Greek comedy, but in the writings of the Socratic philosophers.", "680": "Many collections have likewise been made by various writers, of humorous sayings, such as that made by Cato, and called his Apopthegms.", "681": "The dis- tinction, therefore, between a genteel and an ill-mannered joke is a very ready one.", "682": "The former, if seasonably made, and when the attention is relaxed, is worthy of a virtuous man ;", "683": "the other, if it exhibit immorality in its subject, or obscenity in the expression, is unworthy even of a man.", "684": "There is likewise a certain limit to be observed, even in our amusements, that we do not give up everything to amusement, and that, after being elevated by pleasure, we do not sink into some immorality.", "685": "Our Campus Martins, and the sport of hunting, supply creditable examples of amusement.", "686": "XXX.", "687": "But in all our disquisitions concerning the nature of a duty, it is material that we keep in our eye the great excellence of man's nature above that of the brutes and all other creatures.", "688": "They are insensible to everything but pleasure, and are hurried to it by every impulse.", "689": "Whereas the mind of man is nourished by study and reflection, and, being charmed by the pleasure of seeing and hearing, it is ever either inquiring or acting.", "690": "But if there is a man who has a small bias to pleasure, provided he is not of the brute kind (for there are some who are men only in name) ;", "691": "but, I say, if he is more high-minded even in a small degree, though he may be smitten with pleasure, he yet, through a principle of shame, hides and disguises his inclination for it.", "692": "From this we are to conclude that mere corporeal pleasure is unworthy the excellency of man's nature ;", "693": "and that it ought therefore to be despised and rejected ;", "694": "but that if a man shall have any delight in pleasure, he ought to be extremely observant of limits in its indulgence.", "695": "Therefore, the nourish- ment and dress of our bodies should be with a view not to our pleasure, but to our health and our strength ;", "696": "and should we examine the excellency and dignity of our nature, we should then be made sensible how shameful it is to melt away in pleasure, and to live in voluptuousness and effemi- nacy ;", "697": "and how noble it is to live with abstinence, with modesty, with strictness, and sobriety.", "698": "We are likewise to observe, that nature has, as it were, endowed us with two characters.", "699": "The first is in common to all mankind, because all of its partake in that excellency of reason, which places us above the brutes ;", "700": "from which is derived all that is virtuous, all that is graceful, and by which we trace our connections with our several duties.", "701": "The other character is peculiar to individuals.", "702": "For, as there are great dissimilarities in our persons-some for instance are swift in running, others strong in wrestling ;", "703": "and in style of beauty some have a dignity, and others a sweetness of aspect-so are there still greater varieties in our minds.", "704": "Lucius Crassus and Lucius Philippus had a great deal of wit;", "705": "but in Caius Cæsar, the son of Lucius, it was greater in degree, and more elaborate.", "706": "In their contemporaries, Marcus Scaurus, and young Mareus Drusus, there was a remarkable seriousness ;", "707": "in Caius Lælius great hilarity ;", "708": "but in his friend Scipio greater ambition, and a graver style of life.", "709": "As to the Greeks, we are told of Socrates that he was agreeable and witty ;", "710": "his conversation jocose, and in all his discourse a feigner of opinions whom the Greeks called ε’ίϱων.", "711": "On the other hand, Pythagoras and Pericles, without any gaiety, attained the highest authority.", "712": "Amongst the Carthaginian generals, Hannibal, we learn, was crafty, and Quintus Maximus amongst our own generals was apt at con- cealment, secrecy, dissimulation, plotting, and anticipating the designs of enemies.", "713": "In this class the Greeks rank Themis- tocles, and lason of Pheræ, above all others ;", "714": "and place among the very first, that cunning and artful device of Solon, when, to secure his own life, and that he might be of greater service to his country, he counterfeited madness.", "715": "In opposition to those characters, the tempers of many others are plain and open.", "716": "Lovers of truth and haters of deceit, they think that nothing should be done by stealth, nothing by stratagem ;", "717": "while others care not what they suffer themselves, or whom they stoop to, provided they accomplish their ends;", "718": "as we have seen Sylla and Marcus Crassus.", "719": "In which class Lysander the Lacedemonian, we are told, had the greatest art and per- severance, and that Callicratides, who succeeded to Lysander in the command of the fleet, was the reverse.", "720": "We have known some others, who though very powerful in conversation, always make themselves appear undistinguished individuals among many ;", "721": "such were the Catuli, father and son, and Quintus Mucius Mancia.", "722": "I have heard from men older than myself, that Publius Scipio Nasica was of the same cast, but that his father, the same who punished the pernicious designs of Tiberius Gracchus, was void of all politeness in conver- sation :", "723": "and the same of Xenocrates, the most austere of philosophers, and from that very circumstance a distinguished and celebrated man.", "724": "Innumerable, but far from being blame- able, are the other differences in the natures and manners of men.XXXI.", "725": "Every man, however, ought carefully to follow out his peculiar character, provided it is only peculiar, and not vicious, that he may the more easily attain that grace- fulness of which we are inquiring.", "726": "For we ought to manage so as never to counteract the general system of nature;", "727": "but having taken care of that, we are to follow our natural bias;", "728": "insomuch, that though other studies may be of greater weight and excellence, yet we are to regulate our pursuits by the disposition of our nature.", "729": "It is to no purpose to thwart nature, or to aim at what you cannot attain.", "730": "We therefore may have a still clearer conception of the graceful I am recommending, from this consideration, that nothing is grace- ful that goes (as the saying is) against the grain, that is, in contradiction and opposition to nature.", "731": "If anything at all is graceful, nothing surely is more so than a uniformity through the course of all your life, as well as through every particular action of it ;", "732": "and you never can preserve this uniformity, if, aping another man's nature, you forsake your own.", "733": "For as we ought to converse in the language we are best acquainted with, for fear of making ourselves justly ridiculous, as those do who cram in Greek expressions ;", "734": "so there ought to be no incongruity in our actions, and none in all the tenor of our lives.", "735": "*Now so powerful is this difference of natures, that it may be the duty of one man to put himself to death, and yet not of another, though in the same predicament.", "736": "For was the predicament of Marcus Cato different from that of those who surrendered themselves to Cæsar in Africa?", "737": "Yet it had been perhaps blameable in the latter, had they put them- selves to death, because their lives were less severe, and their moral natures more pliable.", "738": "But it became Cato, who had by perpetual perseverance strengthened that inflexibility which nature had given him, and had never departed from the purpose and resolution lie had once formed, to die rather than to look upon the face of a tyrant.†", "739": "How various were those sufferings of Ulysses, in his long continued wanderings, when he became the slave of women (if you consider Circe and Calypso as such):", "740": "and in all he said he sought to be complaisant and agreeable to every body, nay, put up with abuses from slaves and handmaidens at home, that he might at length compass what he desired;", "741": "but with the spirit with which he is represented, Ajax would have preferred a thousand deaths to suffering such indig- nities.", "742": "In the contemplation of which each ought to consider what is peculiar to himself, and to regulate those peculiari- ties, without making any experiments how another man's become them;", "743": "for that manner which is most peculiarly a man's own always becomes him best.", "744": "Every man ought, therefore, to study his own genius, so as to become an impartial judge of his own good and bad qualities, otherwise the players will discover better sense than we;", "745": "for they don't choose for themselves those parts that are the most excellent, but those which are best adapted to them.", "746": "Those who rely on their voices choose the part of Epigonas or Medus ;", "747": "the best actors that of Menalippa or Clytemnestra.", "748": "Rupilius, who I remember, always selected that of Antiopa;", "749": "Esopus seldom chose that of Ajax.", "750": "Shall a player, then, observe this upon the stage, and shall a wise man not observe it in the conduct of life ?", "751": "Let us, there- fore, most earnestly apply to those parts for which we are best fitted;", "752": "but should necessity degrade us into characters unsuitable to our genius, let us employ all our care, attention, and industry, in endeavouring to perform them, if not with propriety, with as little impropriety as possible:", "753": "nor should we strive so much to attain excellencies which have not been conferred on us, as to avoid defects.", "754": "XXXII.", "755": "To the two characters above described is added a third, which either accident or occasion imposes on us;", "756": "and even a fourth, which we accommodate to ourselves by our own judgment and choice.", "757": "Now kingdoms, governments, honours, dignities, riches, interest, and whatever are the qualities contrary to them, happen through accident, and are directed by occasions;", "758": "but what part we ourselves should wish to act, originates from our own will.", "759": "Some, therefore, apply to philosophy, some to the civil law, and some to elo- quence ;", "760": "and of the virtues themselves some endeavour to shine in one, and some in another.", "761": "Men generally are ambitious of distinguishing themselves in that kind of excellence in which their fathers or their an- cestors were most famous:", "762": "for instance, Quintus, the son of Publius Mucius, in the civil law;", "763": "Africanus, the son of Paulus, in the art of war.", "764": "Some, however, increase, by merits of their own, that glory which they have received from their fathers;", "765": "for the same Africanus crowned his military glory with the practice of eloquence.", "766": "In like manner, Timo- theus, the son of Conon, who equalled his father in the duties of the field, but added to them the glory of genius and learning.", "767": "Sometimes, however, it happens that men, laying aside the imitation of their ancestors, follow a purpose of their own;", "768": "and this is most commonly the case with such men who, though descended from obscure ancestors, purpose to them- selves great aims.", "769": "In our search, then, after what is graceful, all those parti- culars ought to be embraced in our contemplation and study.", "770": "In the first place, we are to determine who and what manner of men we are to be, and what mode of life we are to adopt- a consideration which is the most difficult of all;", "771": "for, in our early youth, when there is the greatest weakness of judgment, every one chooses to himself that kind of life which he has most fancied.", "772": "He, therefore, is trepanned into some fixed and settled course of living before lie is capable to judge what is the most proper.", "773": "*For the Hercules of Prodicus, as we learn from Xenophon, in his early puberty (an age appointed by nature for every man's choosing his scheme of life) is said to have gone into a solitude, and there sitting down, to have deliberated within himself much, and for a long time, whether of two paths that he saw before him it was better to enter on, the one of pleasure, the other of virtue.", "774": "This might, indeed, happen to a Jove- begotten Hercules;", "775": "but not so with us, who imitate those whom we have an opinion of, and are thereby drawn into their pursuits and purposes:", "776": "for generally, prepossessed by the principles of our parents, we are drawn away to their customs and habits.", "777": "Others, swayed by the judgment of the multitude, are passionately fond of those things which seem best to the majority.", "778": "A few, however, either through some good fortune, or a certain excellency of nature, or through the training of their parents, pursue the right path of life.", "779": "XXXIII.", "780": "The rarest class is composed of those who, endowed with an exalted genius, or with excellent educa- tion and learning, or possessing both, have had scope enough for deliberating as to what course of life they would be most willing to adopt.", "781": "Every design, in such a delibera- tion, ought to be referred to the natural powers of the indi- vidual;", "782": "for since, as I said before, we discover this propriety in every act which is performed, by reference to the qualities with which a man is born, so, in fixing the plan of our future life, we ought to be still much more careful in that respect, that we may be consistent throughout the duration of life with ourselves, and not deficient in any one duty.", "783": "But because nature in this possesses the chief power, and fortune the next, we ought to pay regard to both in fixing our scheme of life;", "784": "but chiefly to nature, as she is much more firm and constant, insomuch that the struggle, some- times between nature and fortune, seems to be between a mortal and an immortal being.", "785": "The mail, therefore, who adapts his whole system of living to his undepraved nature, let him maintain his constancy;", "786": "for that, above all things, becomes a man, provided he come not to learn that he has been mistaken in his choice of a mode of life.", "787": "Should that occur, as it possibly may, a change must be made in all his habits and purposes which, if circumstances shall be favourable, we shall more easily and readily effect;", "788": "but, should it happen otherwise, it must be done slowly and gradually.", "789": "Thus, men of sense think it more suitable that friendships which are disagreeable or not approved should be gradually detached, rather than suddenly cut off.", "790": "Still, upon altering our scheme of life, we ought to take the utmost care to make it appear that we have done it upon good grounds.", "791": "But if, as I said above, we are to imitate our ancestors, this should be first excepted that their bad qualities must not be imitated.", "792": "In the next place, if nature does not qualify us to imitate them in some things, we are not to attempt it:", "793": "for instance, the son of the elder African us, who adopted the younger son of Paulus, could not, from infirmity of health, resemble his father so much as his father did his grand- father.", "794": "If, therefore, a man is unable to defend causes, to entertain the people by haranguing, or to wage war, yet still he ought to do what is in his power;", "795": "he ought to practise justice, honour, generosity, modesty, and temperance, that what is wanting may be the less required of him.", "796": "Now, the best inheritance a parent can leave a child--more excellent than any patrimony-is the glory of his virtue and his deeds;", "797": "to bring disgrace on which ought to be regarded as wicked and monstrous.", "798": "XXXIV.", "799": "And as the same moral duties are not suited to the different periods of life, some belonging to the young, others to the old, we must likewise say somewhat on this distinc- tion.", "800": "It is the duty of a young man to reverence his elders, and amongst them to select the best and the worthiest, on whose advice and authority to rely.", "801": "For the inexperience of youth ought to be instructed and conducted by the wisdom of the aged.", "802": "Above all things, the young man ought to be restrained from lawless desires, and exercised in endurance and labour both of body and mind, that by persevering in them, he may be efficient in the duties both of war and peace.", "803": "Nay, when they even unbend their minds and give them- selves up to mirth, they ought to avoide intemperance, and never lose sight of morality ;", "804": "and this will be the more easy if even upon such occasions they desire that their elders should be associated with them.", "805": "*As to old men, their bodily labours seem to require diminu- tion, but the exercises of their mind ought even to be increased.", "806": "Their care should be to assist their friends, the youth, and above all their country, to the utmost of their ability by their advice and experience.", "807": "Now there is nothing that old age ought more carefully to guard against, than giving itself up to listlessness and indolence.", "808": "As to luxury, though it is shameful in every stage of life, in old age it is detestable ;", "809": "but if to that is added intemperance in lawless desires, the evil is doubled;", "810": "because old age itself thereby incurs dis- grace ;", "811": "and makes the excesses of the young more shameless.", "812": "†Neither is it foreign to my purpose to touch upon the duties of magistrates, of private citizens, and of strangers.", "813": "It is then the peculiar duty of a magistrate to bear in mind that he represents the state, and that he ought, therefore, to maintain its dignity and glory, to preserve its constitution, to act by its laws, and to remember that these things are committed to his fidelity.*", "814": "As to a private man and citi- zen, his duty is to live upon a just and equal footing with his fellow citizens, neither subordinate and subservient nor domineering.", "815": "In his sentiments of the public to be always for peaceful and virtuous measures;", "816": "for such we are ac- customed to imagine and describe a virtuous citizen.", "817": "Now the duty of a stranger and an alien is, to mind no- thing but his own business, not to intermeddle with another, and least of all to be curious about the affairs of a foreign government.", "818": "Thus we shall generally succeed in the prac- tice of the moral duties, when we inquire after what is most becoming and best fitted to persons, occasions, and ages;", "819": "and nothing is more becoming than in all our actions and in all our deliberations to preserve consistency.", "820": "XXXV.", "821": "But, because the graceful or becoming character we treat of appears in all our words and actions, nay, in every motion and disposition of our person, and consists of three particulars, beauty, regularity, and appointment suited to action (ideas which indeed are difficult to be expressed, but it is sufficient if they are understood);", "822": "and as in these three heads is comprehended our care to be approved by those amongst whom and with whom we live, on them also a few observations must be made.", "823": "In the first place nature seems to have paid a great regard to the form of our bodies, by ex- posing to the sight all that part of our figure that has a beauti- ful appearance, while she has covered and concealed those parts which were given for the necessities of nature, and which would have been offensive and disagreeable to the sight.", "824": "This careful contrivance of nature has been imitated by the modesty of mankind ;", "825": "for all men in their senses conceal from the eye the parts which nature has hid;", "826": "and they take care that they should discharge as privately as possible even the necessities of nature.", "827": "And those parts which serve those necessities, aud the necessities themselves, are not called by their real names;", "828": "because that which is not shameful if privately performed, it is still obscene to describe.", "829": "There- fore neither the public commission of those things, nor the obscene expression of them, is free from immodesty.", "830": "Neither are we to regard the Cynics or the Stoics, who are next to Cynics, who abuse and ridicule us for deeming things that are not shameful in their own nature, to become vicious through names and expressions.", "831": "Now, we give everything that is disgraceful in its own nature its proper term.", "832": "Theft, fraud, adultery, are disgraceful in their own nature, but not obscene in the expression.", "833": "The act of be- getting children is virtuous, but the expression obscene.", "834": "Thus, a great many arguments to the same purpose are maintained by these philosophers in subversion of delicacy.", "835": "Let us, for our parts, follow nature, and avoid whatever is offensive to the eyes or ears ;", "836": "let us aim at the graceful or becoming, whether we stand or walk, whether we sit or lie down, in every motion of our features, our eyes, or our hands.", "837": "In those matters two things are chiefly to be avoided ;", "838": "that there be nothing effeminate and foppish, nor any thing coarse and clownish.", "839": "Neither are we to admit, that those considerations are proper for actors and orators, but not binding upon us.", "840": "The manners at least of the actors, from the morality of our ancestors, are so decent that none of them appear upon the stage without an under-covering ;", "841": "being afraid lest if by any accident certain parts of the body should be exposed, they should make an indecent appearance.", "842": "According to our customs, sons grown up to manhood do not bathe along with their fathers, nor sons-in-law with their fathers-in-law.", "843": "Modesty of this kind, therefore, is to be cherished, especially as nature herself is our instructor and guide.", "844": "XXXVI.", "845": "Now as beauty is of two kinds, one that consists in loveliness, and the other in dignity;", "846": "loveliness we should regard as the characteristic of women, dignity of men :", "847": "therefore, let a man remove from his person every ornament that is unbecoming a man, and let him take the same care of every similar fault with regard to his gesture or motion.", "848": "For very often the movements learned in the Palæstra are offen- sive, and not a few impercinent gestures among the players are productive of disgust, while in both whatever is unaffected and simple is received with applause.", "849": "Now, comeliness in the person is preserved by the freshness of the complexion, and that freshness by the exercises of the body.", "850": "To this we are to add, a neatness that is neither troublesome nor too much studied, but which just avoids all clownish, ill-bred sloven- ness.", "851": "The same rules are to be observed with regard to ornaments of dress, in which, as in all other matters, a mean is preferable.", "852": "We must likewise avoid a drawling solemn pace in walk- ing, so as to seem like bearers in a procession ;", "853": "and likewise in matters that require despatch, quick, hurried motions ;", "854": "which, when they occur, occasion a shortness of breathing, an alteration in the looks, and a convulsion in the features, all which strongly indicate an inconstant character.", "855": "But still greater should be our care that the movements of our mind never depart from nature ;", "856": "in which we shall succeed if we guard against falling into any flurry and disorder or spirit, and keep our faculties intent on the preservation of propriety.", "857": "Now the motions of the mind are of two kinds, the one of reflection and the other of appetite.", "858": "Reflection chiefly applies itself in the search of truth.", "859": "Appetite prompts us to action.", "860": "We are therefore to take care to employ our reflection upon the best subjects, and to render our appetite obedient to our reason.", "861": "XXXVII.", "862": "And since the influence of speech is very great and that of two kinds,—one proper for disputing, the other for discoursing,-the former should be employed in plead- ings at trials, in assemblies of the people, and meetings of the senate;", "863": "the latter in social circles, disquisitions, the meetings of our friends, and should likewise attend upon entertainments.", "864": "Rhetoricians lay down rules for disputing, but none for dis- coursing, though I am not sure but that likewise may be done.", "865": "Masters are to be found in all pursuits in which there are learners, and all places are filled with crowds of rhetori- cians ;", "866": "but there are none who study this, and yet all the rules that are laid down for words and sentiments (in debate) are likewise applicable to conversation.", "867": "But, as we have a voice as the organ of speech, we ought to aim at two properties in it:", "868": "first that it be clear, and secondly that it be agreeable ;", "869": "both are unquestionably to be sought from nature;", "870": "and yet practice may improve the one, and imitating those who speak nervously and distinctly, the other.", "871": "There was, in the Catuli, nothing by which you could conclude them possessed of any exquisite judgment in language, though learned to be sure they were ;", "872": "and so have others been.", "873": "But the Catuli were thought to excel in the Latin tongue ;", "874": "their pronunciation was harmonious, their words were neither mouthed nor minced ;", "875": "so that their ex- pression was distinct, without being unpleasant;", "876": "while their voice, without strain, was neither faint nor shrill.", "877": "The manner of Lucius Crassus was more flowing, and equally elegant;", "878": "though the opinion concerning the Catuli, as good speakers, was not less.", "879": "But Cæsar, brother to the elder Catulus, exceeded all in wit and humour;", "880": "insomuch that even in the forensic style of speaking, he with his conversational manner surpassed the energetic eloquence of others.", "881":

excellence of the followers of Socrates) be smooth and good- humoured, without the least arrogance.", "883": "Let there be plea- santry in it.", "884": "Nor let any one speaker exclude all others as if he were entering on a province of his own, but consider that in conversation, as in other things, alternate participa- tion is but fair.*", "885": "But more especially let him consider Oil what subjects he should speak.", "886": "If serious, let him use gra- vity ;", "887": "if merry, good-humour.", "888": "But a man ought to take the greatest care that his discourse betray no defect in his mo- rals ;", "889": "and this generally is the case when for the sake of de- traction we eagerly speak of the absent in a malicious, ridi- culous, harsh, bitter, and contemptuous manner.", "890": "Now conversation generally turns upon private concerns, or politics, or the pursuits of art and learning.", "891": "We arc, therefore, to study, whenever our conversation begins to ramble to other subjects, to recall it:", "892": "and whatever subjects may present themselves (for we are not all pleased with the same subjects and that similarly and at all times) we should observe how far our conversation maintains its interest;", "893": "and as there was a reason for beginning so there should be a limit at which to conclude.", "894": "XXXVIII.", "895": "But as we are very propely enjoined, in all the course of our life, to avoid all fits of passion, that is, ex- cessive emotions of the mind uncontrolled by reason ;", "896": "in like manner, our conversation ought to be free from all such emo- tions ;", "897": "so that neither resentment manifest itself, nor undue desire, nor slovenness, nor indolence, nor any thing of that kind ;", "898": "and, above all things, we should endeavour to indicate both esteem and love for those we converse with.", "899": "Re- proaches may sometimes be necessary, in which we may per- haps be obliged to employ a higher strain of voice and a harsher turn of language.", "900": "Even in that case, we ought only to seem to do these things in anger ;", "901": "but as, in the cases of cautery and amputations, so with this kind of correction we should have recourse to it seldom and unwillingly;", "902": "and in- deed, never but when no other remedy can be discovered ;", "903": "but still, let all passion be avoided ;", "904": "for with that nothing can be done with rectitude, nothing with discretion.", "905": "In general it is allowable to adopt a mild style of rebuke, combining it with seriousness, so that severity may be indi- cated but abusive language avoided.", "906": "Nay, even what of bitterness there is in the reproach should be shown to have been adopted for the sake of the party reproved.", "907": "Now, it is advisable, even in those disputes which take place with our bitterest enemies, if we hear any that is insulting to ourselves to maintain our equanimity, and repress passion;", "908": "for what- ever is done under such excitement can never be either con- sistently performed, or approved of by those who are present.*", "909": "It is likewise indecent for a man to be loud in his own praise (and the

adapted, but still regard must be paid to magni- ficence and elegance.", "913": "We learn that it was to the honour of Cneius Octavius, the first of that family who was raised to the consulship, that

into the consulship.", "914": "Scaurus demolished this house, and took the ground into his own palace.", "915": "But though the one first brought a consulship into his family, yet the other, though

not to his own concerns alone, so in the house of a man of rank, who is to entertain a great many guests and to admit a multitude of all denominations, attention should be paid to spaciousness;",

mortifying thing when passengers exclaim, \"Ah!", "922": "ancient dwelling!", "923": "by how degenerate a master art thou occupied!”", "924": "which may well be said at the present time of a great many houses.", "925": "But you are to take care, especially if you build for yourself, not to go beyond bounds in grandeur and costliness.", "926": "Even the example of an excess of this kind does much mischief.", "927": "For most people, particularly in this respect, studiously imitate the example of their leaders.", "928": "For instance, who imitates the virtue of the excellent Lucius Lucullus ?", "929": "But how many there are who have imitated the magnificence of his villas.", "930": "To which certainly a bound ought to be set, and it reduced to moderation, and the same spirit of moderation ought to be extended to all the practice and economy of life.", "931": "But of this enough.", "932": "Now in undertaking every action we are to regard three things.", "933": "First, that appetite be subservient to reason, than which there is no condition better fitted for preserving the moral duties.", "934": "We are, secondly, to examine how important the object in which we desire to accomplish, that our atten- tion or labour may be neither more nor less than the occasion requires.", "935": "Thirdly, we are to take care that every thing that comes under the head of magnificence and dignity should be well regulated.", "936": "Now, the best regulation is, to observe that same graceful propriety which I have recommended, and to go no further.", "937": "But of those three heads, the most excellent is, that of making our appetites subservient to our reason.", "938": "XL.", "939": "I am now to speak concerning the order and the timing of things.", "940": "In this science is comprehended what the Greek call εὐταξία, not that which we Romans call mode- ration, an expression that implies keeping within bounds ;", "941": "whereas that is εὐταξία, in which the preservation of order is involved.", "942": "This duty, which we will denominate moderation, is defined by the Stoics as those things which are either said or done in their appropriate places of ranging.", "943": "Therefore, the signification of order and of arrangement seems to be the same.", "944": "For they define order to be the disposing of things into fitting and convenient places.", "945": "Now they

occasion.", "947": "Thus, as I have already observed, that modestia which we have thus explained, is the knowledge of acting according to the fitness of a conjecture.", "948": "But prudence, of which we have treated in the beginning of this book, may admit of the same definition.", "949": "Under this head, however, I speak of moderation and temperance, and the like virtues.", "950": "Therefore, the considerations which belong to prudence have been treated in their proper place.", "951": "But at present I am to treat of those virtues I have been so long speaking of, which relate to morality, and the approbation of those with whom we -live.", "952": "Such then should be the regularity of all our actions, that in the economy of life, as in a connected discourse, all things may agree and correspond.", "953": "For it would be unbecoming and highly blameable, should we, when upon a serious subject, introduce the language of the jovial or the effemi- nate.", "954": "When Pericles had for his colleague in the prætor- ship Sophocles the poet, and as they were discoursing upon their joint official duty, a beautiful boy by chance passed by, Sophocles exclaimed, \"What a charming boy, Pericles !\" but Pericles very properly told him, \" A magistrate ought to keep not only his hands, but his eyes under restraint.\"", "955": "Now Sophocles, had he said the same thing at a trial of athletic performers would not have been liable to this just reprimand, such importance there is in the time and place.", "956": "So too, a man, who is going to plead a cause, if on a journey or in a walk he should muse or appear to himself more thonghtful than ordinary, he is not blamed:", "957": "but should he do this at an entertainment, he would seem ill-bred for not dis- tinguishing times.", "958": "But those actions that are in wide discrepancy with good- breeding, such, for instance, as singing in the forum, or any such absurdity, are so easily discernible, that they re- quire no great degree of reprehension or advice.", "959": "But faults that seem to be inconsiderable, and such as are descernible only by a few, are to be more carefully avoided.", "960": "As in lutes or pipes, however little they be out of tune, it is per- ceived by a practised ear ;", "961": "so in life we are to guard against all discrepancy, and the rather as the harmony of morals is greater and much more valuable than that of sounds.", "962": "XLI.", "963": "Thus, as the ear is sensible of the smallest discord in musical instruments, so we, if we desire to be accurate and attentive observers of faults, may make great discoveries from very trifling circumstances.", "964": "The cast of the eye, the bending or unbending of the brow, an air of dejection or cheerfulness, laughter, the tone of words, silence, the raising or falling of the voice, and the like circumstances, we may easily form a judgment which of them are in their pro- per state, and which of them are in discord with duty and nature.", "965": "Now in this case, it is advisable to judge from others, of the condition and properties of every one of those, so that we ourselves may avoid those things that are unbecoming in others.", "966": "For it happens, I know not how, that we perceive what is defective more readily in others than we do in ourselves.", "967": "Therefore, when masters mimic the faults of boys that they may amend them, those boys are most easily corrected.", "968": "Neither is it improper, in order to fix our choice in matters which involve a doubt, if we apply to men of learning and also of experience, and learn what they think of the several kinds of duty;", "969": "for the greatest part of such men are usually led to that conclusion to which nature herself directs;", "970": "and in these cases, we are to examine not only what a man says, but what he thinks, and upon what grounds he thinks it.", "971": "For as painters, statuaries, and even poets, want to have their works canvassed by the public in order to correct any thing that is generally condemned, and examine both by themselves and with others where the defect lies ;", "972": "thus we ought to make use of the judgment of others to do, and not to do, to alter and correct, a great many things.", "973": "As to actions resulting from the customs or civil institu- tions of a people, no precepts can be laid down ;", "974": "for those very institutions are precepts in themselves.", "975": "Nor ought men to be under the mistake to imagine that if Socrates or Aristippus acted or spoke in opposition to the manners and civil constitutions of their country, they themselves have a similar licence.*", "976": "For this was a right they acquired by their great and superhuman endowments.", "977": "But as to the whole system of the Cynics;", "978": "we are absolutely to reject it, because it is inconsistent with moral susceptibility without which nothing can be honest, nothing can be virtuous.", "979": "Now it is our duty to esteem and to honour, in the same manner as if they were dignified with titles or vested with command, those men whose lives have been conspicuous for great and glorious actions, who feel rightly towards the state and deserve well or have deserved well of their country.", "980": "We are likewise to have a great regard for old age, to pay a deference to magistrates ;", "981": "to distinguish between (what we owe to) a fellow citizen and a foreigner, and to consider whether that foreigner comes in a public or a private capacity.", "982": "In short, not to dwell on particulars, we ought to regard, to cultivate, and to promote the good will and the social welfare of all mankind.", "983": "XLII.", "984": "Now with regard to what arts and means of ac- quiring wealth are to be regarded as worthy and what dis- reputable, we have been taught as follows.", "985": "In the first place, those sources of emolument are condemned that incur the public hatred ;", "986": "such as those of tax-gatherers and usurers.", "987": "We are likewise to account as ungenteel and mean the gains of all hired workmen, whose source of profit is not their art but their labour;", "988": "for their very wages are the consideration of their servitude.", "989": "We are likewise to despise all who retail from merchants goods for prompt sale;", "990": "for they never can suc- ceed unless they lie most abominably.", "991": "Now nothing is more disgraceful than insincerity.", "992": "All mechanical labourers are by their profession mean.", "993": "For a workshop can contain nothing befitting a gentleman.", "994": "Least of all are those trades to be approved that serve the purposes of sensuality, such as (to speak after Terence) fishmongers, butchers, cooks, pastry-cooks, and fishermen ;", "995": "to whom we shall add, if you please, perfumers, dancers, and the whole tribe of games- ters.", "996": "*But those professions that involve a higher degree of in- telligence or a greater amount of utility, such as medicine, architecture, the teaching the liberal arts, are honourable in those to whose rank in life they are suited.", "997": "As to merchandizing, if on a small scale it is mean ;", "998": "but if it is extensive and rich, bring numerous commodities from all parts of the world, and giving bread to numbers without fraud, it is not so despicable.", "999": "But if a merchant, satiated, or rather satisfied with his profits, as he sometimes used to leave the open sea and make the harbour, shall from the harbour step into an estate and lands ;", "1000": "such a man seems most justly deserving of praise.", "1001": "For of all gainful profes- sions, nothing is better, nothing more pleasing, nothing more delightful, nothing better becomes a well-bred man than agriculture.", "1002": "But as I have handled that subject at large in my Cato Major, you can draw from thence all that falls under this head.", "1003": "XLIII.", "1004": "I have I think sufficiently explained in what manner the duties arc derived from the consituent parts of virtue.", "1005": "Now it often may happen that an emulation and a contest may arise amongst things that are in themselves virtuous ;", "1006": "-of two virtuous actions which is preferable.", "1007": "A division that Panætius has overlooked.", "1008": "For as all virtue is the result of four qualities, prudence, justice, magnanimity and moderation;", "1009": "so in the choice of a duty, those qualities must necessarily come in competition with one another.", "1010": "I am therefore of opinion that the duties arising from the social relations are more agreeable to nature than those that are merely notional.", "1011": "This may be confirmed from the fol- lowing argument.", "1012": "Supposing that this kind of life should befall a wise man, that in an affluence of all things he might be able with great leisure to contemplate and attend to every object that is worthy his knowledge;", "1013": "yet if his condition be so solitary as to have no company with mankind, he would prefer death to it.", "1014": "Of all virtues, the most leading is that wisdom which the Greeks call σοϕια, for by that sagacity which they term ϕρονησις we understand quite another thing, as it implies the knowledge of what things are to be de- sired, and what to be avoided.", "1015": "But that wisdom which I have stated to be the chief, is the knowledge of things divine and human, which comprehends the fellowship of gods and men, and their society within themselves.", "1016": "If that be, as it certainly is, the highest of all objects, it follows of course that the duty resulting from this fellowship is the highest of all duties.", "1017": "For the knowledge and contem- plation of nature is in a manner lame and unfinished, if it is followed by no activity ;", "1018": "now activity is most perspi- cuous when it is exerted in protecting the rights of mankind.", "1019": "It therefore has reference to the social interests of the human race, and is for that reason preferable to knowledge;", "1020": "and this every virtuous man maintains and exhibits in prac- tice.", "1021": "For who is so eager in pursuing and examining the nature of things, that if, while lie is handling and con- templating the noblest objects of knowledge, the peril and crisis of his country is made known to him, and that it is in his power to assist and relieve her, would not instantly aban- don and fling from him all those studies, even though he thought he would be enabled to number the stars, or measure the dimensions of the world ?", "1022": "And he would do the same were the safety of a friend or a parent concerned or endan- gered.", "1023": "From this consideration I infer, that the duties of justice are perferable to the studies and duties of knowledge, relating as they do to the interests of the human race, to which no anterior consideration ought to exist in the mind of man.", "1024": "XLIV.", "1025": "But some have employed their whole lives in the pursuits of knowledge, and yet have not declined to contri- bute to the utility and advantage of men.", "1026": "For they have even instructed many how they ought be better citizens and more useful to their country.", "1027": "Thus Lysis the Pythagorean educated Epaminondas of Thebes, as did Plato Dion of Syracuse, and so of many others ;", "1028": "and as to whatever ser- vices I have performed, if I have performed any to the state, I came to it after being furnished and adorned with know- ledge by teachers and learning.", "1029": "Nor do those philosophers only instruct and educate those who are desirous of learning while alive and present amongst us;", "1030": "but they continue to do the same after death, by the monuments of their learning;", "1031": "for they neglect no point that relates to the constitution, the manners and the morals of their country;", "1032": "so that it appears as if they had dedicated all their leisure to our advantage.", "1033": "Thus while they are them- selves devoted to the studies of learning and wisdom, they make their understanding and their skill chiefly available to the service of mankind.", "1034": "It is therefore more serviceable to the public for a man to discourse copiously, provided it is to the purpose, than for a man to think ever so accurately without the power of expression ;", "1035": "the reason is, because thought terminates in itself alone, but discourse affects those with whom we are connected in a community.", "1036": "Now as the swarms of bees do not assemble in order to form the honey-comb, but form the honey-comb because they are by nature gregarious ;", "1037": "so, and in a far greater degree, men being associated by nature, manifest their skill in think- in- and acting.", "1038": "Therefore, unless knowledge is connected with that virtue which consists in doing service to mankind, that is, in improving human society, it would seem to be but solitary and barren.", "1039": "In like manner greatness of soul, when utterly disunited from the company and society of men, becomes a kind of un- couth ferocity.", "1040": "Hence it follows, that the company and the community of men are preferable to mere speculative know- ledge.", "1041": "Neither is that maxim true which is affirmed by some, that human communities and societies were instituted from the necessity of our condition, because we cannot without the help of others supply what our nature requires;", "1042": "and that if we could be furnished, as by a kind of magic wand, with every thing that relates to food and raiment, that then every man of excelling genius, laying aside all other occupations, would apply himself to knowledge and learning.", "1043": "The fact is not so;", "1044": "for he would fly from solitude and look out for a com- panion in his pursuits;", "1045": "and would desire sometimes to teach and sometimes to learn, sometimes to listen and sometimes to speak.", "1046": "Every duty therefore that operates for the good of human community and society, is preferable to that duty which is limited to speculation and knowledge.XLV.", "1047": "Here perhaps it should be inquired, whether the duties of that society which is most suitable to nature are preferable to moderation and decency ?", "1048": "By no means.", "1049": "For some things are partly so disgraceful, and partly so criminal in their nature, that a wise man would not commit them, even to save his country.", "1050": "Posidonius has collected very many such;", "1051": "but they are so obscene and so shocking that it would be scandalous even to name them.", "1052": "A wise man would not undertake such things, even to serve his country, nor would his country undertake them to serve herself.", "1053": "But it fortunately happens, that there never can be a conjunc- ture, when the public interest shall require from a wise man the performance of such actions.", "1054": "Hence it follows, that in the choice of our duties we are to prefer that kind of duty that contributes to the good of society.", "1055": "For well-directed action is always the result of knowledge and prudence.", "1056": "And therefore it is of more con- sequence to act properly, than to deliberate justly.", "1057": "Thus much then may suffice on this subject;", "1058": "for this topic has now been so fully laid open, that it is easy for every man in the study of his duties, to see which is preferable.", "1059": "Now in society there are degrees of duties by which every man may understand what belongs to himself.", "1060": "The first is owing to the immortal gods, the second to our country, the third to our parents, and lastly to others through different grada- tions.", "1061": "From these arguments thus briefly stated we perceive that men are sometimes not only in doubt, whether a thing is virtuous or disgraceful;", "1062": "but likewise when two virtuous things are proposed, which is more so.", "1063": "This head, as I said before, was omitted by Panætius.", "1064": "Let us now proceed to what remains of our subject.", "1065": "I THINK I have in the former Book sufficiently explained in what manner our duties are derived from morality, and every kind of virtue.", "1066": "It now remains that I treat of those kinds of duties that relate to the improvement of life, and to the acquirement of those means which men employ for the attainment of wealth and interest.", "1067": "In this inquiry, as I have already observed, I will treat of what is useful, and what is not so.", "1068": "Of several utilities I shall speak of that which is more useful, or most so.", "1069": "Of all this I shall treat, after premising a few words concerning my own plan of life and choice of pursuits.", "1070": "Although my works have prompted a great many to the exercise not only of reading but of writing, yet I sometimes am apprehensive, that the name of philosophy is offensive to some worthy men, and that they are surprized at my having employed so much of my pains and time in that study.", "1071": "For my part, as long as the state was under the management ofthose into whose hands she had committed herself, I applied to it all my attention and thought.", "1072": "But when the government was engrossed by one person, when there was an end of all public deliberation and authority ;", "1073": "when I in short had lost these excellent patriots who were my assciates in the protection of my country, I neither abandoned myself to that anguish of spirit which, had I given way to it, must have consumed me, nor did I indulge those pleasures that are disgraceful to a man of learning.", "1074": "Would that the constitution had remained in its original state;", "1075": "and that it had not fallen into the hands of men whose aim was not to alter but to destroy it!", "1076": "For then I would first.", "1077": "as I was wont to do when our government existed, have em- ployed my labours in action rather than in writing;", "1078": "and in the next place, in my writings I should have recorded my own pleadings as I had frequently done, and not such subjects as the present.", "1079": "But when the constitution, to which all my care, thoughts, and labour used to be devoted, ceased to exist, then those public and senatorial studies were silenced.", "1080": "But as my mind could not be inactive, and as my early life had been employed in these studies, I thought that they might most honourably be laid aside by betaking myself anew to philosophy, having, when young, spent a great deal of my time in its study, with a view to improvement.", "1081": "When I afterwards began to court public offices and devoted myself entirely to the service of my country, I had so much room for philosophy as the time that remained over from the business of my friends and the public.", "1082": "But I spent it all in reading, having no leisure for writing.", "1083": "II.", "1084": "In the midst of the greatest calamities, therefore, I seem to have realized the advantage that I have reduced into writ- ing, matters in which my countrymen were not sufficiently instructed, and which were most worthy their attention.", "1085": "For in the name of the gods, what is more desirable, what is more excellent, than wisdom ?", "1086": "What is better for man ?", "1087": "what more worthy of him ?", "1088": "They therefore who court her are termed philosophers ;", "1089": "for philosophy, if it is to be interpreted, implies nothing but the love of wisdom.", "1090": "Now the ancient philosophers defined wisdom to be the knowledge of things divine and human, and of the causes by which these things are regulated ;", "1091": "a study that if any man despises, I know not what he can think deserving of esteem.", "1092": "For if we seek the entertainment of the mind, or a respite 'from cares, what is comparable to those pursuits that are always searching out somewhat that relates to and secures the welfare and happiness of life ?", "1093": "Or if we regard the principles of self-consistency and virtue, either this is the art, or there is absolutely no art by which we can attain them.", "1094": "And to say that there is no art for the attainment of the highest objects, when we see that none of the most inconsiderable are without it, is the language of men who speak without consideration, and w1 o mistake in the most important matters.", "1095": "Now if there is any school of virtue, where can it be found, if you abandon this method of study?", "1096": "But it is usual to treat these subjects more particularly when we exhort to philosophy, which I have done in another book.", "1097": "At this time my intention was only to explain the reasons why, being divested of all offices of state, I choose to apply myself to this study preferably to all others.", "1098": "Now an objection is brought against me, and indeed by some men of learning and knowledge, who inquire whether I act con- sistently with myself, when, though I affirm that nothing can be certainly known, I treat upon different subjects, and when, as now, I am investigating the principles of moral duty.", "1099": "I could wish such persons were thoroughly acquainted with my way of thinking.", "1100": "I am not one of those whose reason is always wandering in the midst of uncertainty and never has any- thing to pursue.", "1101": "For if we abolish all the rules, not only of reasoning but of living, what must become of reason, nay of life itself?", "1102": "For my own part, while others maintain some things to be certain, and others uncertain, I say, on the other side, that some things are probable, and others not so.", "1103": "What, therefore, hinders me from following whatever appears to me to be most probable, and from rejecting what is otherwise ;", "1104": "and, while I avoid the arrogance of dogmatizing, from escaping that recklessness which is most inconsistent with wisdom ?", "1105": "Now all subjects are disputed by our sect, because this very probability cannot appear, unless there be a com- parison of the arguments on both sides.", "1106": "But, if I mistake not, I have with sufficient accuracy explained these points in my Academic;", "1107": ". As to you, my dear Cicero, though you are now employed in the study of the oldest and noblest philo- sophy under Cratippus, who greatly resembles those who have propounded these noble principles, yet I was unwilling that these my sentiments, which are so corresponding with your system, should be unknown to you.", "1108": "But to proceed in what I propose.", "1109": "III.", "1110": "Having laid down the five principles upon which we pursue our duty, two of which relate to propriety and virtue, two to the enjoyments of life, such as wealth, interest, and power, the fifth to the forming of a right judgment in any case, if there should appear to be any clashing between the princi- ples I have mentioned, the part assigned to virtue is con- eluded, and with that I desire you should be thoroughly ac- quainted.", "1111": "Now the subject I am now to treat of is neither more nor less than what we call expediency;", "1112": "in which matter custom has so declined and gradually deviated from the right path, that, separating virtue from expediency, it has determined that some things may be virtuous which are not expedient, and some expedient which are not virtuous;", "1113": "than which doctrine nothing more pernicious can be introduced into human life.", "1114": "It is indeed with strictness and honesty that philosophers, and those of the highest reputation, distinguish in idea those three principles which really are blended together.", "1115": "For they give it as their opinion that whatever is just is expedient ;", "1116": "and in like manner whatever is virtuous is just ;", "1117": "from whence it follows that whatever is virtuous is also expedient.", "1118": "Those who do not perceive this distinction often admire crafty and cunning men, and mistake knavery for wisdom.", "1119": "The error of such ought to be eradicated ;", "1120": "and every notion ought to be reduced to this hope, that men may attain the ends they propose, by virtuous designs and just actions, and not by dishonesty and wickedness.", "1121": "The things then that pertain to the preservation of human life are partly inanimate, such as gold, silver, the fruits of the earth, and the like ;", "1122": "and partly animal, which have their peculiar instincts and affections.", "1123": "Now of these some are void of, and some are endowed with, reason.", "1124": "The animals void of reason are horses, oxen, with other brute creatures, and bees, who by their labours contribute somewhat to the service and existence of mankind.", "1125": "As to the animals endowed with reason, they are of two kinds, one the gods, the other men.", "1126": "Piety and sanctity will render the gods propitious ;", "1127": "and next to the gods mankind are most useful to men.", "1128": "(The same division holds as to things that are hurtful and prejudicial.", "1129": "But as we are not to suppose the gods to be injurious to mankind, excluding them, man appears to be most hurtful to man.)",

like manner, neither could stones be hewn for our use, nor iron, nor brass, nor gold, nor silver, be dug from the earth, but by the toil and art of man.", "1135": "IV.", "1136": "As to buildings, by which either the violence of the cold is repelled, or the inconveniences of the heat mitigated, how could they have originally been given to the human race, or afterwards repaired when ruined by

aqueducts, the cuts of rivers, the irrigation of the land, dams opposed to streams, and artificial harbours ?", "1138": "From those and a great many other instances, it is plain that we could by no manner of means have, without the hand and industry of man, reaped the benefits and advantages arising from such things as are inanimate.", "1139": "In short, what advantage and convenience could have been realized from the brute creation, had not men assisted ?", "1140": "Men, undoubtedly, were the first who discovered what useful result we might realize from every animal ;", "1141": "nor could we even at this time either feed, tame, preserve, or derive from them advantages suited to the occasion, without the help of man.", "1142": "And it is by the same that such as are hurtful are destroyed,

habits of brutes.", "1146": "Cities, too, neither could have been built nor peopled but by the associa- tion of men :", "1147": "hence were established laws and customs, the equitable definition of rights, and the regulated order of life.", "1148": "Then followed gentleness of disposition and love of morality ;", "1149": "and the result was that life was more protected, and that by giving and receiving, and by the exchange of resources and articles of wealth, we wanted for nothing.", "1150": "V.", "1151": "We are more prolix than is necessary on this head For to whom is not that

without the zealous co-operation of men ?", "1152": "As instances of this, he mentions Themistocles, Pericles, Cyrus, Alexander, and Agesilaus, who, he says, without the aid of men never could have

cerning the destruction of mankind ;", "1156": "and after collecting together all the different causes, such as those of inundations, pestilence, devastation, and those sudden attacks of swarms of creatures, by which he tells us some tribes of men have been destroyed ;", "1157": "he then calculates how many more men have been destroyed by men, that is by wars and seditions, than by every other species of calamity.", "1158": "As this point therefore admits of no doubt, that man can do the greatest good and the greatest injury to man, I lay it down as the peculiar property of virtue, that it

am now to point out the manner in which we may invite and direct the incli- nations of mankind, so as to serve our interests ;", "1184": "and should what I say on this head appear too long, let it be compared with the importance of the subject, and then, perhaps, it may even seem too short.", "1185": "Whatever, therefore, people perform for any man, either to raise or to dignify him, is done either through kindness, when they have a motive of affection for him ;", "1186": "or to do him honour in admiration of his virtue, and when they think him worthy of the most exalted fortune;", "1187": "or when they place confidence in him, and think that they are doing the best for their own interests ;", "1188": "or when they are afraid of his power ;", "1189": "or when they hope somewhat from him;", "1190": "as when princes, or those who court the people, propose certain largesses;", "1191": "or, lastly, when they are engaged by money and bribery ;", "1192": "a motive that of all other is the vilest and most sordid, both with regard to those who are influenced by it, and those who are com- pelled to resort to it.", "1193": "For it is a bad state of things, when that is attempted by money which ought to be effected by virtue;", "1194": "but as this re- source is sometimes necessary, I will show in what manner it is to be employed, after I have treated of some things that are more connected with virtue.", "1195": "Now, mankind submit to the command and power of another for several reasons.", "1196": "For they are induced by benevolence or by the greatness of his bene- fits ;", "1197": "or by his transcendent worth, or by the hopes that their submission will turn to their own account, or from the fear of their being forced to submit, or from the hopes of reward, or the power of promises, or, lastly (which is often the case in our government), they are hired by a bribe.", "1198": "VII.", "1199": "Now, of all things there is none more adapted for supporting and retaining our influence than to be loved, nor more prejudicial than to be feared.", "1200": "Ennius says very truly, “ People hate the man they fear, and to each the destruction of him whom he hates is expedient.\"", "1201": "It has been lately shown,* if it was not well known before, that no power can resist the hatred of the many.", "1202": "Nor indeed is the destruction of that tyrant, who by arms forced his country to endure him, and whom it obeys still more after his death, the only proof how mighty to destroy is the hatred of mankind, but the similar deaths of other tyrants;", "1203": "few of whom have escaped a. similar fate.", "1204": "For fear is but a bad guardian to permanency, whereas affection is faithful even to perpetuity.", "1205": "But the truth is, cruelty must be employed by those who keep others in subjection by force ;", "1206": "as by a master to his slaves, if they cannot otherwise be managed.", "1207": "But of all mad- men, they are the maddest who in a free state so conduct them- selves as to be feared.", "1208": "However, under the power of a private man the laws may be depressed and the spirit of liberty in- timidated, yet they occasionally emerge, either by the silent determinations of the people, or by their secret suffrages with relation to posts of honour.", "1209": "For the inflictions of liberty, when it has been suspended, are more severe than if it had been retained.", "1210": "We ought therefore to follow this most ob- vious principle, that dread should be removed and affection reconciled, which has the greatest influence not only on our security, but also on our interest and power;", "1211": "and thus we shall most easily attain to the object of our wishes, both in private and political affairs.",

Pherean to have lived ?", "1216": "Who (as we read), though he loved his wife", "1217": "Thebe excessively, yet when- ever he came into her bed-chamber from the banquet, ordered a barbarian, nay, one who we are told was scarred with the Thracian brands, to go before him with a drawn sword ;", "1218": "and sent certain of his attendants to search the chests of the ladies, and discover whether they had daggers concealed among their clothes.", "1219": "Miserable man!", "1220": "to think a barbarous and branded slave could be more faithful to him than his wife !", "1221": "Yet was he not deceived,

another instance, whose cruelty was notorious above all other tyrants;", "1224": "who did not, like the Alexander I have just mentioned, perish by secret treachery, nor by the hands of a few conspirators, like our own late tyrant, but was attacked by the collective body of the Agrigentines.", "1225": "Nay, did not the Macedonians abandon Demetrius, and with one consent betake themselves to Pyrrhus ?", "1226": "And did not the allies of the Lacedæmonians abandon them almost univer- sally when they governed tyrannically, and show themselves unconcerned spectators of the disaster at

persons expect ?", "1251": "Now, as it is plain that the force of kindness is so strong, and that of fear so weak, it remains for me to descant upon the means by which we may most readily attain to that endearment which we desire, consistently with fidelity and honour.", "1252": "But of this we do not all stand in the same need;", "1253": "for it depends on the different purpose of life which each individual pursues, whether it be necessary for him to be beloved by the many, or whether the affections of the few be sufficient.", "1254": "One thing, however, may be considered as certain ;",

these are the strongest causes of affection, though some there may be which are less material.", "1276": "The acquisition of public confidence or trust may be effected by two considerations;", "1277": "by being supposed to be pos- sessed of wisdom and of justice combined.", "1278": "For we have confidence in those who we think understand more than our- selves, and who we believe see further into the future, and, when business is actually in hand and matters come to trial, know how to pursue the wisest measures and act in the most expedient manner, as the exigency may require;", "1279": "all mankind agreeing that this is real and useful wisdom.", "1280": "Such confidence, also, is placed in honest and honourable men, that is, in good men, as to exclude all suspicion of fraud or injury.",

most powerful in winning the confidence of mankind.", "1283": "For honesty without wisdom, has influence sufficient of it- self ;", "1284": "but wisdom without honesty is of no effect in inspiring confidence;", "1285": "because, when we have no opinion of a man's probity, the greater his craft and cunning, the more hated and suspected he becomes;", "1286": "honesty, therefore, joined to un- derstanding, will have unbounded power in acquiring con- fidence ;", "1287": "honesty without understanding can do a great deal;", "1288": "but understanding without honesty can do nothing.", "1289": "X.", "1290": "But lest any one should wonder why, as all philosophers are agreed in one maxim, which I myself have often main- tained, that the man who possesses one of the virtues is in possession of them all, I here make a distinction which im- plies that a man may be just but not at the same time pru- dent, there is one kind of accuracy which in disputation refines even upon truth, and another kind, when our whole discourse is accommodated to the understanding of the public.", "1291": "Therefore I here make use of the common terms of discourse, by calling some men brave, some good, others prudent.", "1292": "For when we treat of popular opinions, we should make use of popular terms, and Panætius did the same.", "1293": "But to return to our subject.", "1294": "Of the three

reverence and extol with the greatest praise, those men in whom they think they can perceive some distinguished or singular vir- tues ;", "1298": "whereas they despise those whom they think to possess no virtue, spirit, or manliness.", "1299": "Now, men do not despise all those of whom they think ill.", "1300": "For they by no means con- temn rogues, slanderers, cheats, and those who are prepared to commit an injury, though they have a bad opinion of them.", "1301": "Therefore, as I have already said, those are despised who can neither serve themselves nor any one else, who have no assiduity, no industry, and no concern about them;", "1302": "but those men are the objects of admiration who are thought to surpass others in virtue, and to be free as well from every disgrace, as especially from those vices which others cannot easily resist.", "1303": "For pleasures, those most charming mistresses, turn aside the greater number of minds from virtue, and most men, when the fires of affliction are applied to them, are un- measurably terrified.", "1304": "Life and death, poverty and riches, make the deepest impressions upon all men.", "1305": "But as to those who, with a great and elevated mind, look down on these in- differently;", "1306": "-men whom a lofty and noble object, when it is presented to them, draws and absorbs to itself;", "1307": "-in such cases, who does not admire the splendour and the beauty of virtue ?", "1308": "XI.", "1309": "This sublimity of soul, therefore, produces the highest admiration ;", "1310": "and above all justice, from which single virtue men are called good, appears to the multitude as something marvellous.", "1311": "And with good reason ;", "1312": "for no man can be just if he is afraid of death, pain, exile, or poverty, or prefers their contraries to justice.", "1313": "Men especially admire him who is incorruptible by money, and they consider every man in whom that quality is seen as ore purified by the fire.", "1314": "Justice, therefore, comprehends all the three means of acquir- in- glory which have been laid down.", "1315": "The love of the pub- lie, on account of its being a general benefit;", "1316": "its confidence, for the same reason ;", "1317": "and its admiration, because it neglects and despises those objects to which most men are hurried on inflamed with avidity.", "1318": "In my opinion, however, every scheme and purpose of life requires the assistance of men, especially that one should have some with whom he can familiarly unbosom himself, which is hard for one to do, unless he maintain the appear- ance of a good man.", "1319": "For this reason, were a man to live ever so lonely or ever so retired in the country, a reputation for justice would be indispensable to him, and so much the more, as those who do not possess it will be esteemed dis- honest, and thus surrounded by no protection will be ex- posed to numerous injuries.", "1320": "And with those likewise who buy or sell, who hire or let out, or who are engaged in the transaction of business, justice is necessary to the carrying of their pursuits, for its influ- ence is so great, that without some grains of it, even they who live by malpractices and villiany could not subsist.", "1321": "For amongst those who thieve in company, if any one of them cheat or rob another he is turned out of the gang;", "1322": "and the captain of the band himself, unless he should distribute the spoils impartially, would either be murdered or deserted by his fellows.", "1323": "Indeed, robbers are even said to have their laws, which they obey and observe.", "1324": "By this impartiality in sharing the booty, Bardyllis, the Illyrian robber, mentioned by Theopompus, obtained great wealth;", "1325": "and Viriathus, the Lusitanian, much greater;", "1326": "to whom our armies and our gene- rals yielded ;", "1327": "but whom the prætor Caius Lælius, surnamed the wise, crushed and subdued, and so repressed his ferocity that he left an easy victory to his successors.", "1328": "If, therefore, the influence of justice is so forcible as to strengthen and enlarge the power of robbers, how great must we suppose it to be amidst the laws and administration of a well-consti- tuted government ?XII.", "1329": "It appears to me, that not only among the Medes, as we are told by Herodotus, but by our own ancestors, men of the best principles were constituted kings, for the benefit of their just government.", "1330": "For when the helpless people were oppressed by those who had greater power, they betook themselves to some one man who was distinguished by his virtue, who not only protected the weakest from oppression, but by setting up an equitable system of government, united highest and lowest in equal rights.", "1331": "The cause of the institu- tion of laws was the same as that of kings;", "1332": "for equality of rights has ever been the object of desire;", "1333": "nor otherwise can there be any rights at all.", "1334": "When mankind could enjoy it under one just and good man, they were satisfied with that;", "1335": "but when that was not the case, laws were invented, which perpetually spoke to all men with one and the same voice.", "1336": "It is therefore undeniable that the men whose reputation among the people was the highest for their justice, were commonly chosen to bear rule.", "1337": "But when the same were likewise regarded as wise men, there was nothing the people did not think themselves capa- ble of attaining under such authority.", "1338": "Justice, therefore, is by all manner of means to be reverenced and practised ;", "1339": "both for its own sake (for otherwise it would not be justice), and for the enlargement of our own dignity and popularity.", "1340": "But as there is a system not only for the acquisition of money but also for its investment, so that it may supply ever- recurring expenses, not only the needful but the liberal;", "1341": "so popularity must be both acquired and maintained by system.", "1342": "It was finely said by Socrates that the shortest and most direct road to popularity, is \"for a man to be the same that he wishes to be taken for.\"", "1343": "People are egregiously mistaken if they think they ever can attain to permanent popularity by hypocrisy, by mere outside appearances, and by disguising not only their language but their looks.", "1344": "True popularity takes deep root and spreads itself wide;", "1345": "but the false falls away like blossoms;", "1346": "for nothing that is false can be lasting.", "1347": "I could bring many instances of both kinds;", "1348": "but for the sake of liberty, I will confine myself to one family.", "1349": "While there is a memorial of Roman history remaining, the memory cf Tiberius Gracchus, the son of Publius, will be held in honour;", "1350": "but his sons even in life were not approved of by the good, and, being dead, they are ranked amongst those who were deservedly put to death.", "1351": "XIII.", "1352": "Let the man therefore who aspires after true popula- rity, perform the duties of justice.", "1353": "What these are has been laid down in the former book.", "1354": "But although we may most easily seem to be just what we are (though in this of itself there is very great importance), yet some precepts require to be given as to how we may be such men as we desire to be considered.", "1355": "For if any one from early youth has the elements of celebrity and reputation, either derived from his father (which I fancy, my dear Cicero, has happened to you), or by some other cause or accident;", "1356": "the eyes of all mankind are turned towards him, and they make it their business to inquire what he does and how he lives;", "1357": "and, as if he were set up in the strongest point of light, no word or deed of his can be private.", "1358": "Now those whose early life, through their mean and ob- scure rank, is passed unnoticed by the public, when they come to be young men, ought to contemplate important pur- poses.", "1359": "and pursue them by the most direct means, which they will do with a firmer resolution, because not only is no envy felt.", "1360": "but favour rather is shown towards that period of life.", "1361": "The chief recommendation then of a young man to fame is derived from military exploits.*", "1362": "Of this we have many ex- amples amongst our ancestors, for they were almost always waging wars.", "1363": "Your youth however has fallen upon the time cf a war, in which one party incurred too much guilt and to- other too little success.", "1364": "But when in that war Pompey gave you the command of a squadron, you gained the praise of that great man and of his army by your horsemanship, your darting the javelin, and your tolerance of all military labour.", "1365": "But this honour of yours ceased with the constitution of our country.", "1366": "My discourse however has not been undertaken with reference to you singly, but to the general subject.", "1367": "Let me therefore proceed to what remains.", "1368": "As in other matters the powers of the mind are far more important than those of the body, so the objects we pursue by intelligence and reason are more important than those we effeet by bodily strength.", "1369": "The most early recommendation, therefore, is modesty, obedience to parents, and affection for relations.", "1370": "Young men are likewise most easily and best known, who attach themselves to wise and illustrious men who benefit their country by their counsels.",

the early life of Publius Rutilius to a reputation for integrity and knowledge of the law.", "1373": "Lueius Crassus indeed, when very young, was indebted to no extrinsic source, but by himself acquired the highest honour from that noble and celebrated prosecution he undertook;", "1374": "and at an age when even those who exercise themselves are highly applauded (as we are told in the case of Demosthenes), Crassus, I say, at that age showed that he could already do that most success- fully in the forum, which at that time he would have gained praise had he attempted at home.", "1375": "XIV.", "1376": "But as there are two methods of speaking;", "1377": "the one proper for conversation, the other for debate;", "1378": "there can be no doubt but the disputative style of speech is of the greatest efficacy with regard to fame ;", "1379": "for that is what we properly term eloquence.", "1380": "Yet it is difficult to describe how great power, affability and politeness in conversation have to win the affections of mankind.", "1381": "There are extant letters from Philip, from Antipater, and from Anti-onus, three of the wisest men we meet with in history, to their sons Alexander, Cas- sander, and Philip, recommending to them to draw the minds of the people to kindly sentiments by a generous style of discourse, and to engage their soldiers by a winning address.",

they hear him, they are convinced he has both greater abilities and more wisdom than the rest of mankind.", "1384": "But should this eloquence have in it dignity combined with mo- desty, nothing can be more admirable, especially should those properties meet in a young man.", "1385": "Various are the causes that require the practice of elo- quence ;", "1386": "and many young men in our state have attained distinction before the judges and in the senate ;", "1387": "but there is the greatest admiration for judicial harangues, the nature of which is two-fold, for it consists of accusation and defence.", "1388": "Of those, though the latter is preferable in point of honour ;", "1389": "yet the other has often been approved.", "1390": "I have spoken a little before of Crassus ;", "1391": "Marcus Antonius when a youth did the same.", "1392": "An accusation also displayed the eloquence of Publius Sulpicius, when he brought to trial Caius Norba- nus, a seditious and worthless citizen.",

character, so to act as to get the name of an accuser, as happened in the case of Marcus Brutus, a man sprung from a most noble family, and son to the eminent adept in civil law.", "1403": "Moreover, this precept of duty also must be carefully ob- served, that you never arraign an innocent man on trial for his life, for this can by no means be done without heinous guilt.", "1404": "For what can be

especially to a wealthy person ;", "1416": "but the former is the more noble and splendid, and more worthy of a brave and illus- trious man ;", "1417": "for although there exists in both a liberal incli- nation to oblige, yet the one is a draft on our purse, the other on our virtue, and bounty which is given out of our income exhausts the very source of the munificence.", "1418": "Thus

beneficence.", "1420": "And in the next place, by the habit of beneficence they will be the better prepared, and, as it were, better exercised to de- serve well of many.", "1421": "Philip, in a certain letter, admirably reproves his son Alexander, because he sought to gain the goodwill of the Macedonians by largesses—\"Pest!\" he says, \"what consideration led you into the hope that you could imagine that they whom you have corrupted with money would be faithful to you ?", "1422": "Are you aiming at this, that the Macedonians should expect you will be, not their king, but their agent and purveyor.\"", "1423": "He says well, \"agent and purveyor,\" because that is undignified in a king;", "1424": "and still better, because he designates a largess a corrupt bribe;", "1425": "for he who receives becomes the worse for it, and more ready always to expect the same.", "1426": "He enjoined this on his son, but we may consider it a precept for all men.", "1427": "Wherefore, this indeed is not doubtful, that such beneficence as consists of labour and industry is both the more honourable, and ex- tends more widely, and can serve a greater number.", "1428": "Some- times, however, we must make presents-nor is this sort of beneficence to be altogether repudiated;", "1429": "and oftentimes we ought to communicate from our fortune to suitable persons, who are in need, but carefully and moderately.", "1430": "For many persons have squandered their patrimonies by unadvised ge- nerosity.", "1431": "Now, what is more absurd than to bring it to pass that you can no longer do that which you would willingly do ?", "1432": "And moreover, rapine follows profuseness.", "1433": "For when, by giving, they begin to be in want, they are forced to lay their hands upon other men's property.", "1434": "Thus, when, for the sako of procuring goodwill, they mean to be beneficent, they ac- quire not so much the affection of those to whom they give as the hatred of those from whom they take.", "1435": "Wherefore, our purse should neither be so closed up that our generosity cannot open it, nor so unfastened that it lies open to all-a bound should be set, and it should bear reference to our means.", "1436": "We ought altogether to remember that saying which, from being very often used by our countrymen, has come into the usage of a proverb, that bounty has no bottom.", "1437": "For what bounds can there be, when both they who have been accustomed to receive, and other persons, are desiring the same thing ?XVI.", "1438": "There are two kinds of men who give largely, of whom one kind are prodigal, the other liberal.", "1439": "The prodigal are those who with entertainments, and distributions of meat to the populace, and gladiatorial exhibitions, and the appa- ratus of the stage and the chase, lavish their money upon those things of which they will leave behind either a tran- sient memory, or none at all.", "1440": "But the liberal are they who, with their fortunes, either redeem those captured by robbers, or take up the debts of their friends, or aid in the establish- ing of their daughters, or assist them either in seeking or increasing their fortunes.", "1441": "Therefore, I am astonished what could come into the mind of Theophrastus, in that book which he wrote about riches, in which he has said many things well, but this most absurdly.", "1442": "For lie is lavish in praise of magnificence, and of the furnishing of popular exhibitions, and he considers the means of supplying such expenses to be the grand advantage of wealth.", "1443": "Now, to me that enjoyment of liberality of which I have given a few examples, seems much greater and surer.", "1444": "With how much more weight and truth does Aristotle censure such of us as feel no astonishment at that profusion of wealth which is wasted in courting the people;", "1445": "\"if,\" says he, \"they who are besieged by an enemy should be compelled to purchase a pint of water at a mina,* this, on first hearing, would seem to us incredible, and all would be astonished, but when we reflect upon it, we excuse it for its necessity;", "1446": "while in these pieces of immense extravagance and unbounded expense, we do not feel greatly astonished.\"", "1447": "And he censures us, especially, \"because we are neither relieving necessity, nor is our dignity increased, and the very delight of the multitude is for a brief and little space, and only felt by the most giddy, even in whom, how- ever, at the same time with the satiety, the memory of the pleasure likewise dies.\"", "1448": "He sums up well, too, that \" these things are agreeable to boys, and silly women, and slaves, and freemen very like slaves;", "1449": "but that by a man of sense, and one who ponders with sound judgment on such exhibi- tions, they can in no way be approved.\"", "1450": "Though I know that in our state it is established by ancient usage, and even now in the good times, that the splendour of ædileships* is expected even from the most excellent men.", "1451": "Therefore, both Publius Crassus, wealthy as well in name as in fortune, dis- charged the office of ædile with the most magnificent enter- tainment;", "1452": "and, a little while after, Lucius Crassus, with Quintus Mucius, the most moderate of all men.", "1453": "served a most magnificent ædileship;", "1454": "and next, Caius Claudius, son of Appius;", "1455": "many subsequently-the Luculli, Hortensius, Sila- nus;", "1456": "but Publius Lentulus, in my consulship, surpasssd all his predecessors.", "1457": "Scaurus imitated him;", "1458": "but the shows of my friend Pompey, in his second consulship, were the most magnificent of all-concerning all of whom, you see what is my opinion.", "1459": "XVII.", "1460": "Nevertheless, the suspicion of avarice should be avoided.", "1461": "The omitting of the ædileship caused the rejection of Mamercus, a very wealthy man, from the consulship.", "1462": "Wherefore it must be done if it be required by the people, and good men, if not desiring, at least approve it, but in proportion to our means, as I myself did it;", "1463": "and again, if some object of greater magnitude and utility is acquired by popular largess, as lately the dinners in the streets, under pretext of a vow of a tenth,† brought great honour to Orestes.", "1464": "Nor was ever any fault found with Marcus Seius, because in the scarcity he gave corn to the people at an as the bushel.", "1465": "For he delivered himself from a great and in- veterate dislike by an expense neither disgraceful, since he was ædile at the time, nor excessive.", "1466": "But it lately brought the greatest honour to our friend Milo, that with gladiators, hired for the sake of the republic, which was held together by my safety, he repressed all the attempts and madness of Publius Clodius.", "1467": "The justification, therefore, of profuse bounty is that it is either necessary or useful.", "1468": "Moreover, in these very cases the rule of mediocrity is the best.", "1469": "Lucius Philippus, indeed, the son of Quintus, a man in the highest degree illustrious for his great genius, used to boast that without any expense lie had attained all the highest honours that could be obtained.", "1470": "Cotta said the same, and Curio.", "1471": "I myself, too, might in some degree boast on this subject;", "1472": "for considering the amplitude of the honours which I attained with all the votes in my own* year, too-a thing that happened to none of those whom I have just named-the expense of my ædileship was certainly trifling.", "1473": "These expenses also are more justifiable on walls, docks, ports, aqueducts, and all things which pertain to the service of the state, though what is given as it were into our hands is more agreeable at present, yet these things are more acceptable to posterity.", "1474": "Theatres, porticos, new temples, I censure with more reserve for Pompey's sake, but the most learned men disapprove of them, as also this very Panætius, whom in these books I have closely followed, though not translated ;", "1475": "and Demetrius Phalereus, who censures Pericles, the greatest man of Greece, because he lavished so much money on that glorious vestibule ;", "1476": "† but all this subject I have carefully discussed in those books which I have written upon Government.", "1477": "The whole plan, then, of such largesses is vicious in its nature, but necessitated by particular occa- sions, and even then ought to be accommodated to our means, and regulated by moderation.", "1478": "XVIII.", "1479": "But in that second kind of munificence which proceeds from liberality, we ought in different cases to be affected in different manners.", "1480": "The case is different of him who is oppressed with misfortune, and of him who seeks to better his fortune without being in any adversity.", "1481": "Our benignity will require to be more prompt toward the dis- tressed, unless perhaps they merit their distress ;", "1482": "yet from those who desire to be assisted, not that they may be relieved from affliction, but that they may ascend to a higher degree, we ought by no means to be altogether restricted, but to apply judgment and discretion in selecting proper persons.", "1483": "For Ennius observes well-\" Benefactions ill bestowed, I deem malefactions.", "1484": "\"But in that which is bestowed upon a worthy and grateful man there is profit, as well from himself as also from others ;", "1485": "for liberality, when free from rashness, is most agreeable, and many applaud it the more earnestly on this account, because the bounty of every very exalted man is the common refuge of all.", "1486": "We should do our endeavour, then, that we may serve as many as possible with those benefits, the recol- lection of which may be handed down to their children and posterity, that it may not be in their power to be ungrateful;", "1487": "for all men detest one forgetful of a benefit, and they consider that an injury is done even to themselves by discouraging liberality, and that he who does so is the common enemy of the poor.", "1488": "And besides, that benignity is useful to the state by which captives are redeemed from slavery, and the poor are enriched.", "1489": "That it was indeed the common custom that this should be done by our order,* we see copiously described in the speech of Crassus.", "1490": "This kind of bounty, therefore, I prefer far before the munificent exhibition of shows.", "1491": "That is the part of dignified and great men—this of flatterers of the populace, tickling, as it were, with pleasures the levity of the multitude.", "1492": "It will, moreover, be expedient that a man, as he should be munificent in giving, so that he should not be harsh in exacting ;", "1493": "and in every contract, in selling, buying, hiring, letting, to be just and good-natured to the vicinage and surrounding occupiers ;", "1494": "conceding to many much that is his own right, but shunning disputes as far as he can conveniently, and I know not but even a little more than he can conveniently.", "1495": "For, to abate at times a little from our rights, is not only generous, but sometimes profitable also.", "1496": "But of our property, which it is truly disgraceful to allow to get dilapidated, care must be taken, but in such a way that the suspicion of shabbiness and avarice be avoided.", "1497": "For to be able to practise liberality, not stripping ourselves of our patrimony, is indeed the greatest enjoyment of wealth.", "1498": "Hospitality also has been justly recommended by Theo- phrastus.", "1499": "For, as it appears to me, indeed, it is very decorous that the houses of illustrious men should be open for illustrious guests.", "1500": "And that also brings credit to the state, that foreigners in our city should not fail of ex- periencing this species of liberality.", "1501": "It is, moreover, exceed- ingly useful to those who wish to be very powerful in an honourable way, to get the command over wealth and interest among foreign nations, through their guests.", "1502": "Theophrastus, indeed, writes that Cymon at Athens practised hospitality even towards his brethren of the Lacian tribe ;", "1503": "for that he so directed and commanded his stewards, that all things should be supplied to any of them that should turn aside into his villa.", "1504": "XIX.", "1505": "Now, those benefits which are bestowed out of our labour, not our money, are conferred as well upon the entire commonwealth, as upon individual citizens.", "1506": "For to give legal opinions, to assist with counsel, and to serve as many as we can with this kind of knowledge, tends very much to increase both our means and our interest.", "1507": "This, therefore, as well as many things about our ancestors, was noble, that the knowledge and interpretation of our most excellently constituted civil law was always in the highest repute ;", "1508": "which, indeed, before this confusion of the present times, the nobles retained in their own possession.", "1509": "Now, like honours -like all the degrees of rank, so the splendour of this science is extinguished ;", "1510": "and this is the more unmeet on this account, because it has happened at the very time when he* was in existence who far surpassed in this science all who went before, to whom also he was equal in dignity.", "1511": "This labour, then, is acceptable to many, and suited to bind men to us by benefits.", "1512": "But the talent of speaking, being very closely connected with this art, is more dignified, more agree- able, and capable of higher ornament.", "1513": "For what is more excellent than eloquence, in the admiration of the hearers, or in the expectation of those in need of its assistance, or in the gratitude of those who have been defended ?", "1514": "To this, then, the first rank of civil dignity was given by our ancestors.", "1515": "Of an eloquent man, then, and one willingly labouring, and, what is according to the customs of our forefathers, defending the causes of many, both ungrudgingly and gratuitously, the benefits and patronage are very extensive.", "1516": "The subject would admonish me that at this opportunity I should likewise deplore the discontinuance, not to call it the extinction, of eloquence, did I not apprehend lest I should appear to be making some complaint upon my own account.", "1517": "However, we see what orators are extinct, in how few there is promise, in how much fewer ability, in how many pre- sumption.", "1518": "But though all, or even many, cannot be skilful in the law, or eloquent, yet it is in a man's power, by his exertions, to be of service to many, by asking benefits for them, commending them to judges and magistrates, watch- ing the interests of others, entreating in their behalf those very advocates who either are consulted or defend causes.", "1519": "They who act thus, gain a great deal of influence, and their industry diffuses itself most extensively.", "1520": "Furthermore, they need not be admonished of this (for it is obvious), that they take care to offend none while they are wishing to serve others.", "1521": "For oftentime they offend either those whom it is their duty or whom it is their interest not to offend.", "1522": "If un- wittingly they do it, it is a fault of negligence;", "1523": "if knowingly, of rashness.", "1524": "It is necessary, too, that you make an apology, in whatever way you can, to those whom you unwillingly of- fend-how that which you did was of necessity, and that you could not do otherwise;", "1525": "and it will be necessary to make compensation to them for what injury you have inflicted by other efforts and good offices.", "1526": "XX.", "1527": "But since, in rendering services to men, it is usual to look either to their character or their fortune, it is easy, indeed, to say, and so people commonly say, that in bestow- ing benefits they only attend to a man's character, not to his- fortune.", "1528": "It is a fine speech ;", "1529": "but pray is there any one who in rendering a service would not prefer the thanks of a rich and powerful man before the cause of a poor, though most worthy man ?", "1530": "For in general our goodwill is more inclined towards him from whom it appears that remuneration would be easier and quicker.", "1531": "But we ought to consider more at- tentively what the nature of things is:", "1532": "for of course that poor man, if he be a good man, though he cannot requite a kindness, can at least have a sense of it.", "1533": "Now it was well said, whoever said it, \" that he who hath the loan of money, hath not repaid;", "1534": "and he who hath repaid, bath not the loan.", "1535": "But both he who hath requited kindness hath a sense of it, and he who hath a sense of it* bath requited.\"", "1536": "But they who consider themselves wealthy, honoured, pros- perous, do not wish even to be bound by a benefit.", "1537": "More- over, they consider that they have conferred a favour when they themselves have received one, however great;", "1538": "and they also suspect that something is either sought or expected from them:", "1539": "but they think it like death to them that they should need patronage, and be called clients.", "1540": "But, on the other hand, that poor man, because in whatever is done for him he thinks it is himself and not his fortune that is regarded, is anxious that he may be seen to be grateful, not only by him who has merited it from him, but also by those from whom he expects the like (for he needs it from many).", "1541": "Nor indeed does he magnify with words any favour of his own doing, if by chance he confers one, but rather undervalues it.", "1542": "And this is to be considered, that if you defend a man of power and fortune, the gratitude is confined to himself alone, or perhaps to his children ;", "1543": "but if you defend a poor but worthy and modest man, all poor men who are not worthless (which is a vast multitude among the people) see a protection offered to themselves:", "1544": "wherefore, I think it better that a favour should be bestowed upon worthy per- sons than upon persons of fortune.", "1545": "We should by all means endeavour to satisfy every description of people.", "1546": "But if the matter shall come to competition, undoubtedly Themistocles is to be received as an authority, who, when he was consulted whether a man should marry his daughter to a worthy poor man, or to a rich man of less approved character, said, \" I certainly would rather she married a man without money, than money without a man.", "1547": "\"But our morals are corrupted and depraved by the admi- ration of other men's wealth.", "1548": "Though what concern is its amount to any of us ?", "1549": "Perhaps it is of use to him who owns it;", "1550": "not always even that:", "1551": "but admit that it is of use to him- self, to be sure he is able to spend more, but how is he an honester man ?", "1552": "But if he shall be a good man besides, let his riches not prevent him from getting our assistance-only let them not help him to get it, and let the entire consideration be, not how wealthy, but how worthy each individual is.", "1553": "But the last precept about benefits and bestowing our labour is, do nothing hostile to equity-nothing in defence of in- justice.", "1554": "For the foundation of lasting commendation and fame is justice-without which nothing can be laudable.", "1555": "XXI.", "1556": "But since I have finished speaking about that kind of benefits which have regard to a single citizen, we have next to discourse about those which relate to all the citizens together, and which relate to the public good.", "1557": "But of those very ones, some are of that kind which relate to all the citizens collectively;", "1558": "some are such that they reach to all individually, which are likewise the more agreeable.", "1559": "The effort is by all means to be made, if possible, to consult for both, and notwithstanding, to consult also for them indivi- dually ;", "1560": "but in such a manner that this may either serve, or at least should not oppose, the public interest.", "1561": "The grant of corn proposed by Caius Gracchus was large, and therefore would have exhausted the treasury;", "1562": "that of Marcus Octavius was moderate, both able to be borne by the state, and neces- sary for the commons;", "1563": "therefore it was salutary both for the citizens and for the nation.", "1564": "But it is in the first place to be considered by him who shall have the administration of the government, that each may retain his own, and that no dimi- nution of the property of individuals be made by public authority.", "1565": "For Philip acted destructively, in his tribuneship,

by every rank and description of men, whom I resisted in such a manner, that this mischief of such magnitude was removed from the state.", "1638": "Never was debt either greater, or better and more easily paid.", "1639": "For the hope of defrauding being frustrated, the necessity of paying followed.", "1640": "But on the other hand, this man, now our victor,* but who was vanquished then, has accomplished the things which he had in view, when it was now a matter of no importance to himself.", "1641": "So great was the desire in him of doing wrong, that the mere wrong- doing delighted him, although there was not a motive for it.", "1642": "From this kind of liberality, then, to give to some, to take from others, they will keep aloof who would preserve the commonwealth, and will take particular care that each may hold his own in equity of right and judgments ;", "1643": "and neither that advantage be taken of the poorer class, on account of their humbleness, nor that envy be prejudicial to the rich, either in keeping or recovering their own.", "1644": "They will besides increase the power of the state in whatever way they can, either abroad or at home, in authority, territories, tributes.", "1645": "These are the duties of great men.", "1646": "These were practised among our ancestors ;", "1647": "they who persevere in those kinds of duties, will, along with the highest advantage to the republic, themselves obtain both great popularity and glory.", "1648": "Now, in these precepts about things profitable, Antipater the Tyrian, a Stoic, who lately died at Athens, considers that two things are passed over by Panætius-the care of health and of property-which matters I fancy were passed over by that very eminent philosopher because they were obvious ;", "1649": "they certainly are useful.", "1650": "Now, health is supported by under- standing one's own constitution, and by observing what things are accustomed to do one good or injuryt ;", "1651": "and by temperance in all food and manner of living, for the sake of preserving the body;", "1652": "and by forbearance in pleasures ;", "1653": "and lastly, by the skill of those to whose profession these things belong.", "1654": "Wealth ought to be acquired by those means in which there is no disgrace, but preserved by diligence and frugality, and increased, too, by the same means.", "1655": "These matters Xenophon, the Socratic philosopher, has discussed very completely in that book which is entitled Œconomics, which I, when I was about that age at which you are now, translated from the Greek into Latin.", "1656": "XXV.", "1657": "But a comparison of profitable things, since this was the fourth head, but passed over by Panætius, is often necessary.", "1658": "For it is usual to compare the good estate of the body with external advantages, and external with those of the body, and those of the body among themselves, and external with external.", "1659": "The good estate of the body is compared with external advantages in this manner, that you had rather be healthy than wealthy.", "1660": "External with those of the body in this manner, to be wealthy rather than of the greatest physical strength.", "1661": "Those of the body among them- ,,-elves, thus, that good health should be preferred to pleasure, and strength to speed.", "1662": "But the comparison of external objects is thus, that glory should be preferred to wealth, a city income to a country one.", "1663": "Of which kind of comparison is that reply of Cato the elder, of whom, when inquiry was made, what was the best policy in the management of one's property, he answered, \" Good grazing.\" \" What was next ?\" ,;", "1664": "Tolerable grazing.\"", "1665": "\"What third?\" \" Bad grazing.\"", "1666": "\"What fourth ?\" \"Tilling.\"", "1667": "And when he who had interrogated him inquired, \" What do you think of lending at usury ?\"", "1668": "Then Cato answered, \" What do you think of killing a man ?\"*", "1669": "From which, and many other things, it ought to be understood that it is usual to make comparisons of profitable things;", "1670": "and that this was rightly added as a fourth head of investigating our duties.", "1671": "But about this entire head, about gaining money, about letting it out, also about spending it, the matter is discussed to more advantage by certain most estimable persons.", "1672": "sitting at the middle Janus, than by any philosophers in any school.", "1673": "Yet these things ought to be understood ;", "1674": "for they relate to utility, about which we have discoursed in this book.", "1675": "We will next pass to what remains.", "1676": "END OF SECOND HOOK.I.", "1677": "PUBLIUS SCIPIO, my son Marcus, he who first was surnamed Africanus, was accustomed, as Cato, who was nearly of the same age as he, has written, to say \" that he was never less at leisure than when at leisure, nor less alone than when be was alone.\"", "1678": "A truly noble saying, and worthy of a great and wise man, which declares that both in his leisure he was accustomed to reflect on business, and in solitude to converse with himself;", "1679": "so that he never was idle, and sometimes was not in need of the conversation of an- other.", "1680": "Thus, leisure and solitude, two things which cause languor to others, sharpened him.", "1681": "I could wish it were in my power to say the same.", "1682": "But if I cannot quite attain to any intimation of so great an excellence of disposition, I come very near it, in will at least.", "1683": "For, being debarred by impious arms and force from public affairs and forensic business, I remain in retirement;", "1684": "and on that account having left the city, wandering about the fields, I am often alone.", "1685": "But neither is this leisure to be compared with the leisure of Africanus, nor this solitude with that.", "1686": "For he, reposing from the most honourable employments of the state, sometimes took leisure to himself, and sometimes betook himself from the concourse and haunts of men into his soli- tude as into a haven:", "1687": "but my retirement is occasioned by the want of business, not by the desire of repose.", "1688": "For, the senate being extinct, and courts of justice abolished, what is there that I could do worthy of myself, either in the senate- house or in the forum ?", "1689": "Thus, I who formerly lived in the greatest celebrity, and before the eyes of the citizens, now shunning the sight of wicked men, with whom all places abound, conceal myself as far as it is possible, and often am alone.", "1690": "But since we have been taught by learned men, that out of evils it is fit not only to choose the least, but also from those very evils to gather whatever good is in them, I therefore am both enjoying rest-not such, indeed, as he ought who formerly procured rest for the state,-and I am not allowing that solitude which necessity, not inclination, brings me, to be spent in idleness.", "1691": "Although, in my judg- ment, Africanus obtained greater praise.", "1692": "For there are ex- tant no monuments of his genius committed to writing- no work of his leisure-no employment of his solitude.", "1693": "From which it ought to be understood, that he was never either idle or solitary, because of the activity of his mind, and the investigation of those things which he pursued in thought.", "1694": "But I who have not so much strength that I can be drawn away from solitude by silent thought, turn all my study and care to this labour of composition.", "1695": "And thus I have written more in a short time, since the overthrow of the republic, than in the many years while it stood.", "1696": "II.", "1697": "But as all philosophy, my Cicero, is fruitful and pro- fitable, and no part of it uncultivated and desert-so no part in it is more fruitful and profitable than that about duties, from which the.", "1698": "rules of living consistently and virtuously are derived.", "1699": "Wherefore, although I trust you constantly hear and learn these matters from my friend Cratippus, the prince of the philosophers within our memory, yet I think it is beneficial that your ears should ring on all sides with such discourse, and that they, if it were possible, should hear nothing else.", "1700": "Which, as it ought to be done by all who design to enter upon a virtuous life, so I know not but it ought by no one more than you ;", "1701": "for you stand under no small expectation of emulating my industry-under a great one of emulating my honours-under no small one, per- haps, of my fame.", "1702": "Besides, you have incurred a heavy responsi- bility both from Athens and Cratippus;", "1703": "and since you have gone to these as to a mart for good qualities, it would be most scandalous to return empty, disgracing the reputation both of the city and of the master.", "1704": "Wherefore, try and ac- complish as much as you can, labour with your mind and with your industry (if it be labour to learn rather than a pleasure), and do not permit that, when all things have been supplied by me, you should seem to have been wanting to yourself.", "1705": "But let this suffice;", "1706": "for we have often written much to you for the purpose of encouraging you.", "1707": "Now let us return to the remaining part of our proposed division.", "1708": "Panætius, then, who without controversy has discoursed most accurately about duties, and whom I, making some cor- rection, have principally followed, having proposed three heads under which men were accustomed to deliberate and consult about duty-one, when they were in doubt whether that about which they were considering was virtuous or base;", "1709": "another, whether useful or unprofitable;", "1710": "a third, when that which had the appearance of virtue was in opposition to that which seemed useful, how this ought to be determined ;", "1711": "he unfolded the two first heads in three books, but on the third head he said that he would afterwards write, but did not perform what he had promised.", "1712": "At which I am the more surprised on this account, that it is recorded by his disciple Posidonius, that Panætius lived thirty years after he had published those books.", "1713": "And I am surprised that this matter should be only briefly touched on by Posidonius in some commentaries, especially when he writes that there is no subject in all philosophy so necessary.", "1714": "But by no means do I agree with those who deny that this subject was casually omitted by Panætius, but that it was designedly abandoned, and that it ought not to have been written at all, because utility could never be in opposition to virtue.", "1715": "On which point is one thing that may admit a doubt;", "1716": "whether this head, which is third in the division of Panætius, ought to have been taken up, or whether it ought to have been altogether omitted.", "1717": "The other thing cannot be doubted, that it was undertaken by Panætius, but left unfinished.", "1718": "For he who has completed two parts out of a three-fold division, must have a third remaining.", "1719": "Besides, in the end of the third book he promises that he will afterwards write about this third part.", "1720": "To this is also added a sufficient witness, Posi- donius, who in a certain letter writes that Publius Rutilius Rufus, who had been a disciple of Panætius, had been ac- customed to say, that as no painter could be found who could finish that part of the Coan Venus which Apelles had left unfinished (for the beauty of the countenance left no hope of making the rest of the body correspond), so no one could go through with those things which Panætius had omitted, on account of the excellence of those parts which he had com- pleted.", "1721": "III.", "1722": "Wherefore, there cannot be a doubt about the opinion of Panætius;", "1723": "but whether it was right in him, or otherwise, to join this third part to the investigation of duty, about this, perhaps, there may be a question.", "1724": "For whether virtue be the only good, as is the opinion of the Stoics, or whether that which is virtuous be, as it appears to your Peripatetics, so much the greatest good, that all things placed on the other side have scarcely the smallest weight;", "1725": "it is not to be doubted but that utility never can compare with virtue.", "1726": "Therefore we have learned that Socrates used to execrate those who had first separated in theory those things cohering in nature.", "1727": "To whom, indeed, the Stoics have so far assented, that they considered that whatever is virtuous is useful, and that no- thing can be useful which is not virtuous.", "1728": "But if Panætius was one who would say that virtue was to be cultivated only on this account, because it was a means of procuring profit, as they do who measure the desirableness of objects either by pleasure or by the absence of pain, it would be allowable for him to say that our interest sometimes is opposed to virtue.", "1729": "But as he was one who judged that alone to be good which is virtuous, but that of such things as oppose this with some appearance of utility, neither the accession can make life better, nor the loss make it worse, it appears that he ought not to have introduced a deliberation of this kind, in which what seems profitable could be compared with that which is virtuous.", "1730": "For what is called the summum bonum by the Stoics, to live agreeably to nature, has, I conceive, this meaning-always to conform to virtue;", "1731": "and as to all other things which may be according to nature, to take them if they should not be repugnant to virtue.", "1732": "And since this is so, some think that this comparison is improperly in- troduced, and that no principle should be laid down upon this head.", "1733": "And, indeed, that perfection of conduct which is properly and truly called so, exists in the wise alone, and can never be separated from virtue.", "1734": "But in those persons in whom there is not perfect wisdom, that perfection can indeed by no means exist;", "1735": "but the likeness of it can.", "1736": "For the Stoics call all those duties about which we are discours- ing in these books, mean duties (media officia).", "1737": "These are common, and extend widely, which many attain by the good- ness of natural disposition, and by progressive improvement.", "1738": "But that duty which the same philosophers call right (rec- turn), is perfect and absolute, and, as the same philosophers say, has all the parts perfect, and cannot fall to the lot of any but the wise man.", "1739": "But when anything is performed in which mean duties appear, it seems to be abundantly perfect, because the vulgar do not at all understand how far it falls short of the perfect;", "1740": "but as far as they understand, they think there is nothing wanting.", "1741": "Which same thing comes to pass in poems, in pictures, and in many other matters, that those things which should not be commended, the un- skilful are delighted with and commend;", "1742": "on this account, I suppose, that there is in these things some merit which catches the unskilful, who indeed are unable to judge what deficiency there may be in each.", "1743": "Therefore, when they are apprised of it by the initiated, they readily abandon their opinion.", "1744": "IV.", "1745": "These duties, then, of which we are discoursing in these books, they* say are virtuous in some secondary degree -not peculiar to the wise alone, but common to every de- scription of men.", "1746": "By these, therefore, all are moved in whom there is a natural disposition towards virtue.", "1747": "Nor, indeed, when the two Decii or the two Scipios are comme- morated as brave men, or when Fabricius and Aristides are called just, is either an example of fortitude looked for from the former, or of justice from the latter, as from wise men.", "1748": "For neither of these was wise in such a sense as we wish the term wise man to be understood.", "1749": "Nor were these who were esteemed and named wise, Marcus Cato and Caius Lælius, wise men;", "1750": "nor were even those famous seven,t but from the frequent performance of mean duties they bore some simili- tude and appearance of wise men.", "1751": "Wherefore, it is neither right to compare that which is truly virtuous with what is repugnant to utility, nor should that which we commonly call virtuous, which is cultivated by those who wish to be esteemed good men, ever be compared with profits.", "1752": "And that virtue which falls within our comprehension is as much to be maintained and preserved by us, as that which is properly called, and which truly is virtue, is by the wise.", "1753": "For otherwise, whatever advancement is made towards vir- tue, it cannot be maintained.", "1754": "But these remarks are made regarding those who are considered good men, on account of their observance of duties ;", "1755": "but those who measure all things by profit and advantage, and who do not consider that those things are outweighed by virtue, are accustomed, in deliberating, to compare virtue with that which they think profitable ;", "1756": "good men are not so accustomed.", "1757": "There- fore, I think that Panætius, when he said that men were accustomed to deliberate on this comparison, meant this very thing which he expressed,-only that it was their cus- tom, not that it was also their duty.", "1758": "For not only to think more of what seems profitable than what is virtuous, but even to compare them one with the other, and to hesitate between them, is most shameful.", "1759": "What is it, then.", "1760": "that is accustomed at times to raise a doubt, and seems necessary to be considered ?", "1761": "I believe, whenever a doubt arises, it is what the character of that action may be about which one is considering.", "1762": "For oftentimes it happens, that what is accustomed to be generally considered disreputable, may be found not to be disreputable.", "1763": "For the sake of ex- ample, let a case be supposed which has a wide applica- tion.", "1764": "What can be greater wickedness than to slay not only a man, but even an intimate friend ?", "1765": "Has he then in- volved himself in guilt, who slays a tyrant, however inti- mate ?", "1766": "He does not appear so to the Roman people at least, who of all great exploits deem that the most honourable.*", "1767": "Has expediency, then, overcome virtue ?", "1768": "Kay, rather, expe- diency has followed virtue.", "1769": "Therefore, that we may be able to decide without any mistake, if ever that which we call expediency (utile) shall appear to be at variance with that which we understand to be virtuous (honestum), a certain rule ought to be established, which if we will fol- low in comparing such cases, we shall never fail in our duty.", "1770": "But this rule will be one conformable to the reason- ing and discipline of the Stoics chiefly, which, indeed, we are following in these books, because, though both by the ancient Academicians and by your Peripatetics, who for- merly were the same sect, things which are virtuous are preferred to those which seem expedient;", "1771": "nevertheless, those subjects are more nobly treated of by those* to whom whatever is virtuous seems also expedient, and nothing ex- pedient which is not virtuous, than by those according to whom that may be virtuous which is not expedient, and that expedient which is not virtuous.", "1772": "But to us, our Academic, sect gives this great licence, that we, whatever may seem most probable, by our privilege are at liberty to maintain.", "1773": "But I return to my rule.", "1774": "V.", "1775": "To take away wrongfully, then, from another, and for one man to advance his own interest by the disadvantage of another man, is more contrary to nature than death, than poverty, than pain, than any other evils which can befall either our bodies or external circumstances.", "1776": "For, in the first place, it destroys human intercourse and society;", "1777": "for if we will be so disposed that each for his own gain shall despoil or offer violence to another, the inevitable conse- quence is, that the society of the human race, which is most consistent with nature, will be broken asunder.", "1778": "As, supposing each member of the body was so disposed as to think it could be well if it should draw to itself the health of the adjacent member, it is inevitable that the whole body would be debilitated and would perish ;", "1779": "so if each of us should seize for himself the interests of another, and wrest whatever he could from each for the sake of his own emolument, the necessary consequence is, that human society and community would be overturned.", "1780": "It is indeed allowed, nature not opposing, that each should rather acquire for himself than for another, whatever pertains to the enjoyment of life;", "1781": "but nature does not allow this, that by the spoliation of others we should increase our own means, resources, and opulence.", "1782": "Nor indeed is this forbid- den by nature alone-that is, by the law of nations-but it is also in the same manner enacted by the municipal laws of countries, by which government is supported in individual states, that it should not be lawful to injure another man for the sake of one's own advantage.*", "1783": "For this the laws look to, this they require, that the union of the citizens should be unimpaired ;", "1784": "those who are for severing it they coerce by death, by banishment, by imprisonment, by fine.", "1785": "But what declares this much more is our natural reason, which is a.", "1786": "Jaw divine and human, which he who is willing to obey, (and all will obey it who are willing to live according to nature) never will suffer himself to covet what is another person's, and to assume to himself that which he shall have wrongfully taken from another.*", "1787": "For loftiness and greatness of mind, and likewise community of feeling, justice, and libe- rality, are much more in accordance with nature, than plea- sure, than life, than riches—which things, even to contemn and count as nothing in comparison with the common good, is the part of a great and lofty soul.", "1788": "Therefore, to take away wrongfully from another for the sake of one's own advan- tage, is more contrary to nature than death, than pain, than other considerations of the same kind.", "1789": "And likewise, to undergo the greatest labours and inquietudes for the sake, if it were possible, of preserving or assisting all nations- imitating that Hercules whom the report of men, mindful of his benefits, has placed in the council of the gods †—is more in accordance with nature than to live in solitude, not only without any inquietudes, but even amidst the greatest plea- sures, abounding in all manner of wealth, though you should also excel in beauty and strength.", "1790": "Wherefore, every man of the best and most noble disposition much prefers that life to this.", "1791": "From whence it is evinced, that man, obeying nature, cannot injure men.", "1792": "In the next place, he who injures another that he may himself attain some advantage, either thinks that he is doing nothing contrary to nature, or thinks that death, poverty, pain, the loss of children, of kindred, and of friends, are more to be avoided than doing injury to another.", "1793": "If lie thinks that nothing is done con- trary to nature by injuring men, what use is there in dis- puting with him who would altogether take away from man what is human ?", "1794": "But if he thinks that indeed is to be shunned, but that those things, death, poverty, pain, are much worse, he errs in this, that he thinks any defect, either of body or fortune, more grievous than the defects of the mind.", "1795": "VI, One thing, therefore, ought to be aimed at by all men ;", "1796": "that the interest of each individually, and of all collectively, should be the same;", "1797": "for if each should grasp at his individual interest, all human society will be dissolved.", "1798": "And also, if nature enjoins this, that a man should desire to consult the in- terest of a man, whoever he is, for the very reason that he is man, it necessarily follows that, as the nature, so the interest, of all mankind, is a common one.", "1799": "If that be so, we are all included under one and the same law of nature ;", "1800": "and if this too be true, we are certainly prohibited by the law of nature from injuring another.", "1801": "But the first is true ;", "1802": "therefore, the last is true.", "1803": "For that which some say, that they would take nothing wrongfully, for the sake of their own advantage, from a parent or brother, but that the case is different with other citizens, is indeed absurd.", "1804": "These establish the prin- ciple that they have nothing in the way of right, no society with their fellow citizens, for the sake of the common interest-an opinion which tears asunder the whole social compact.", "1805": "They, again, who say that a regard ought to be had to fellow citizens, but deny that it ought to foreigners, break up the common society of the human race, which, being withdrawn, beneficence, liberality, goodness, justice, are utterly abolished.", "1806": "But they who tear up these things should be judged impious, even towards the immortal gods ;", "1807": "for they overturn the society established by them among men, the closest bond of which society is, the consideration that it is more contrary to nature that man, for the sake of his own gain, should wrongfully take from man, than that he should en- dure all such disadvantages, either external or in the person, or even in the mind itself, as are not the effects of injustice.", "1808": "For that one virtue, justice, is the mistress and queen of all virtues..", "1809": "Some person will perhaps say-should not the wise man, then, if himself famished with hunger, wrest food from another, some good-for-nothing fellow ?", "1810": "By no means ;", "1811": "for my life is not more useful to me, than such a disposition of mind that I would do violence to no man for the sake of my own advantage.", "1812": "What !", "1813": "If a worthy man could despoil Phalaris, a cruel and outrageous tyrant, of his gar- ments, that he might not himself perish with cold, should he not do it ?", "1814": "These points are very easy to decide.", "1815": "For if you will wrongfully take away anything from a good-for- nothing man for the sake of your own interest, you will act unsociably and contrary to the law of nature.", "1816": "But if you be one who can bring much advantage to the state, and to human society if you remain in life, it may not deserve to be reprehended should you wrongfully take anything upon that account from another.", "1817": "But if that be not the case, it is rather the duty of each to bear his own misfortune, than wrongfully to take from the comforts of another.", "1818": "Disease, then, or poverty, or anything of this sort, is not more con- trary to nature than is the wrongful taking or coveting what is another's.", "1819": "But the desertion of the common interest is contrary to nature, for it is unjust.", "1820": "Therefore, the very law of nature which preserves and governs the interest of men, decrees undoubtedly that things necessary for living should be transferred from an inert and useless fellow to a wise, good, and brave man, who, if he should perish, would largely take away from the common good ;", "1821": "provided he do this* in such a manner, that he do not, through thinking well of himself, and loving himself, make this an excuse for com- mitting injustice.", "1822": "Thus will he always discharge his duty, advancing the interests of mankind, and that human so- ciety of which I so often make mention.t", "1823": "Now, as to what relates to Phalaris, the decision is very easy ;", "1824": "for we have no society with tyrants, but rather the widest separation from .", "1825": "them ;", "1826": "nor is it contrary to nature to despoil, if you can, him whom it is a virtue to slay-and this pestilential and impious class ought to be entirely exterminated from the community of mankind.", "1827": "For as certain limbs are amputated, both if they themselves have begun to be destitute of blood, and, as it were, of life, and if they injure the other parts of the body, so the brutality and ferocity of a beast iu the figure of a man, ought to be cut off from the common body, as it were, of humanity.", "1828": "Of this sort are all those questions in which our duty is sought out of the circumstances of the case.", "1829": "VII.", "1830": "In this manner, then, I think Panæstius would have pursued these subjects, had not some accident or occupation interrupted his design;", "1831": "for which same deliberations there are in his former books rules sufficiently numerous, by which it can be perceived what ought to be avoided on account of its baseness, and what therefore need not be avoided, because it is not at all base.", "1832": "But since I am putting, as it were, the top upon a work incomplete, yet nearly finished, as it is the custom of geometers not to demonstrate everything, but to require that some postulates be granted to them, that they may more readily explain what they intend, so I ask of you, my Cicero, that you grant me, if you can, that nothing except what is virtuous is worthy to be sought for its own sake.", "1833": "But if this be not allowed you by Cratippus,* still you will at least grant that what is virtuous is most worthy to be sought for its own sake.", "1834": "Whichever of the two you please is sufficient for me, and sometimes the one, sometimes the other, seems the more probable;", "1835": "nor does anything else seem probable.", "1836": "tAnd in the first place, Panæstius is to be defended in this, that he did not say that the really expedient could ever be opposed to the virtuous (for it was not permitted to him t to say so), but only those things which seemed expedient.", "1837": "But he often bears testimony that nothing is expedient which is not likewise virtuous-nothing virtuous which is not likewise expedient;", "1838": "and he denies that any greater mischief has ever attacked the race of men than the opinion of those persons who would separate these things.", "1839": "It was not, therefore, in order that we should prefer the expedient to the virtuous, but in order that we should decide between them without error, if ever they should come in collision, that he intro- duced that opposition which seemed to have, not which has, existence.", "1840": "This part, therefore, thus abandoned, I will com- plete with no help, but, as it is said, with my own forces", "1841": "For there has not, since the time of Panætius, been anything delivered upon this subject, of all the

confer a favour than to claim any return.", "2784": "And let this honourable struggle be maintained between them ;", "2785": "so not only will the greatest advantages be derived from friendship, but

made the request, lie would not have obtained it, for they were men of the purest prin- ciple ;", "2836": "besides, it would be equally as wrong to agree to any such request when made, as to make it.", "2837": "And yet Caius Caibo and Caius Cato both took the part of Tiberius Grac- chus, as did his brother Cains, at that time by no means an agitator, but now one of the most violentXII.", "2838": "Let this law therefore be established in friendship, viz., that we should neither ask things that are improper, nor grant them when asked;", "2839": "for it is a disgraceful apology, and by no means to be admitted, as well in the case of other offences, as when any one avows he has acted against the state for the sake of a friend.*", "2840": "For we are placed, 0 Fannius and Scævola, in such a position, that we ought to see from a distance the future calamities of the commonwealth;", "2841": "for the practice of our ancestors has already in some respect swerved from its career and course.", "2842": "Tiberius Gracchus has endeavoured to obtain the sovereignty, or rather he reigned for a few months.", "2843": "Had the Roman people ever heard or witnessed anything similar?", "2844": "Even after his death, his friends and relations maintained his cause;", "2845": "and what malice they exer- cised against Publius Scipio, I cannot relate without tears ;", "2846": "for, owing to the recent punishment of Tiberius Gracchus, we withstood Carbo by whatever means we could.", "2847": "And con- cerning the tribuneship of Caius Gracchus, what we have to expect I have no disposition to anticipate;", "2848": "still the movement is creeping on, and when once it has begun, it rushes with increasing precipitation to destruction:", "2849": "for already you have seen with regard to the ballot, what great mischief has been caused—first, by the Gabinian law,* and two years after by the Caspian:", "2850": "for already I fancy I see the people separated from the senate, and the most important measures carried at the caprice of the mob;", "2851": "for more people will learn how such things may be done, than how they may be resisted.", "2852": "Wherefore do I say this?", "2853": "Because without allies no one attempts anything of the kind ;", "2854": "therefore this should be pressed on all good men, that if inadvertently they should have fallen unawares into friendships of that character, they must not think themselves bound in such a manner that they must not desert their friends when doing wrong in any impor- tant matter :", "2855": "at the same time, punishment should be enacted against the wicked;", "2856": "and not less severe for those who have followed another, than for those who have been themselves the leaders of the wickedness.", "2857": "Who was more illustrious in Greece than Themistocles ?", "2858": "who more powerful ?", "2859": "And when he, as general in the Persian war, had freed Greece from slavery, and through unpopularity had been driven into exile, lie could not endure the injustice of his ungrateful country, which he ought to have borne;", "2860": "he acted the same part as Coriolanus had done among us twenty years before.", "2861": "No one was found to support these men against their coun- try;", "2862": "accordingly, they both committed suicide.", "2863": "Wherefore such a combination with wicked men not only must not be sheltered under the excuse of friendship, but should rather be visited with every kind of punishments:", "2864": "so that no one may think it permitted to him to follow a friend, even when waging war against his country.", "2865": "And as matters have begun to proceed, I know not whether that will not some day occur.", "2866": "To me, however, it is no less a cause of anxiety in what state the republic shall be after my death, than in what state it is at this day.", "2867": "XIII.", "2868": "Let this, therefore, be established as a primary law concerning friendship, that we expect from our friends only what is honourable, and for our friends' sake do what is honourable;", "2869": "that we should not wait till we are asked;", "2870": "that zeal be ever ready, and reluctance far from us;", "2871": "but that we take pleasure in freely giving our advice;", "2872": "that in our friendship, the influence of our friends, when they give good advice, should have great weight;", "2873": "and that this be em- ployed to admonish not only candidly, but even severely, if the case shall require, and that we give heed to it when so employed;", "2874": "for, as to certain persons, whom I understand to have been esteemed wise men in Greece, I am of opinion that some strange notions were entertained by them;", "2875": "but there is nothing which they do not follow up with too great subtlety:", "2876": "among the rest, that excessive friendships should be avoided, lest it should be necessary for one to feel anxiety for many:", "2877": "that every one has enough, and more than enough, of his own affairs ;", "2878": "that to be needlessly impli- cated in those of other people is vexatious ;", "2879": "that it was most convenient to hold the reins of friendship as loose as pos- sible, so as either to tighten or slacken them when you please;", "2880": "for they argue, that the main point towards a happy life, is freedom from care, which the mind cannot enjoy if one man be, as it were, in travail for others.", "2881": "Nay, they tell us that some are accustomed to declare, still more unfeelingly (a topic which I have briefly touched upon just above), that friendships should be cultivated for the purpose of protection and assistance, and not for kind feeling or affection;", "2882": "and therefore the less a man possesses of inde- pendence, and of strength, in the same degree he most earnestly desires friendships;", "2883": "that thence it arises that women seek the support of friendship more than men, and the poor more than the rich, and persons in distress,* rather than those who are considered prosperous.", "2884": "Admirable phi- losophy !", "2885": "for they seem to take away the sun from the world who withdraw friendship from life;", "2886": "for we receive nothing better from the immortal gods, nothing more delightful:", "2887": "for what is this freedom from care ?-in appearances, indeed, flattering;", "2888": "but, in many cases, in reality to be disdained.", "2889": "Nor is it reasonable to refuse to undertake any honourable matter or action lest you should be anxious, or to lay it aside when undertaken;", "2890": "for if we fly from care, we must fly from virtue also ;", "2891": "for it is impossible that she can, without some degree of distress, feel contempt and detestation for qualities opposed to herself;", "2892": "just as kindheartedness for malice, temperance for profligacy, and bravery for cowardice.", "2893": "Accordingly, you see that upright men are most distressed by unjust actions;", "2894": "the brave with the cowardly;", "2895": "the virtu- ous with the profligate :", "2896": "and, therefore, this is the character- istic of a well-regulated mind, both to be well pleased with what is excellent, and to be distressed with what is contrary.", "2897": "Wherefore, if trouble of mind befall a wise man (and as- suredly it will, unless we suppose that all humanity is extirpated from his mind), what reason is there why we should altogether remove friendship from life, lest because of it we should take upon ourselves some troubles ?", "2898": "for what difference is there (setting the emotions of the mind aside), I do not say between a man and a beast, but between a man and a stone, or log, or anything of that kind ?", "2899": "For they do do not deserve to be listened to, who would have virtue to be callous, and made of iron, as it were;", "2900": "which indeed is, as in other matters, so in friendship also, tender and susceptible;", "2901": "so that friends are loosened, as it were, by happy events, and drawn together by distresses.", "2902": "XIV.", "2903": "Wherefore the anxiety which has often to be felt for a friend, is not of such force that it should remove friendship from the world, any more than that the virtues, because they bring with them certain cares and troubles, should therefore be discarded.", "2904": "For when it produces friendship (as I said above), should any indication of virtue shine forth, to which a congenial mind may attach and unite itself-when this happens, affection must necessarily arise.", "2905": "For what is so unmeaning as to take delight in many vain things, such as preferments, glory, magnificent buildings, clothing and adornment of the body ;", "2906": "and not to take an extreme delight in a soul endued with virtue, in such a soul as can either love, or (so to speak) love in return ?", "2907": "for there is nothing more delightful than the repayment of kindness, and the interchange of devotedness and good offices.", "2908": "Now if we add this, which may with propriety be added, that there is nothing which so allures and draws any object to itself a.;", "2909": "congeniality does friendship;", "2910": "it will of course be admitted as true, that the good must love the good.", "2911": "and unite them to themselves, just as if connected by relationship and nature;", "2912": "for nothing is more apt to seek and seize on its like than nature.", "2913": "Wherefore this certainly is clear, Tannins and Scævola (in my opinion), that among the good a liking for the good is, as it were, inevitable;", "2914": "and this indeed is ap- pointed by nature herself as the very fountain of friendship.*", "2915": "But the same kind disposition belongs also to the multitude;", "2916": "for virtue is not inhuman, or cruel, or haughty, since she is accustomed to protect even whole nations, and to adopt the best measures for their welfare, which assuredly she would not do did she shrink from the affection of the vulgar.", "2917": "And to myself, indeed, those who form friendships with a view to advantage, seem to do away with its most endearing bond ;", "2918": "for it is not so much the advantage obtained through a friend, as the mere love of that friend, which delights ;", "2919": "and then only what has proceeded from a friend becomes de- lightful, if it has proceeded from zealous affection :", "2920": "and that friendship should be cultivated from a sense of necessity, is so far from being the case, that those who, being endowed with power and wealth, and especially with virtue (in which is the strongest support of friendship), have least need of another, are most liberal and generous.", "2921": "Yet I am not sure whether it is requisite that friends should never stand in any need;", "2922": "for wherein would any devotedness of mine to him have been exerted, if Scipio had never stood in need of my advice or assistance at home or abroad ?", "2923": "Wherefore friendship has not followed upon advantage, but advantage on friendship.", "2924": "XV.", "2925": "Persons, therefore, who are wallowing in indulgence, will not need to be listened to if ever they shall descant upon friendship, which they have known neither by ex- perience nor by theory.", "2926": "For who is there, by the faith of gods and men, who would desire, on the condition of his loving no one, and himself being loved by none, to roll in affluence, and live in a superfluity of all things?", "2927": "For this is the life of tyrants, in which undoubtedly there can be no confidence, no affection, no steady dependence on attach- ment ;", "2928": "all is perpetually mistrust and disquietude-there is no room for friendship.", "2929": "For who can love either him whom he fears, or him by whom he thinks he himself is feared ?", "2930": "Yet are they courted, solely in hypocrisy, for a time ;", "2931": "because, if perchance (as it frequently happens) they have been brought low, then is it perceived how desti- tute they were of friends.", "2932": "And this, they say, Tarquin* expressed ;", "2933": "that when going into exile, he found out whom he had as faithful friends, and whom unfaithful ones, since then he could no longer show gratitude to either party;", "2934": "although I wonder that, with such haughtiness and im- patience of temper, he could find one at all.", "2935": "And as the character of the individual whom I have mentioned could not obtain true friends, so the riches of many men of rank exclude all faithful friendship;", "2936": "for not only is fortune blind herself, but she commonly renders blind those whom she embraces.", "2937": "Accordingly such persons are commonly puffed up with pride and insolence, nor can any thing be found more intolerable than a fortunate fool.", "2938": "And thus, indeed, one may observe, that those who before were of agreeable character, by military command, by preferment, by pros- perity, are changed, and old friendships are despised by them, and new ones cherished.", "2939": "For what can be more foolish than, when men are possessed of great influence by their wealth, power, and resources, to procure other things which are procured by money-horses, slaves, rich apparel, costly vases-and not to procure friends, the most valuable and fairest furniture of life, if I may so speak;", "2940": "for while they are procuring those things, they know not for whom they are procuring them, nor for whose sake they are labouring.*", "2941": "For every one of these things belongs to him who is most powerful, whereas the possession of his friend- ships is preserved to every one steadfast and secure;", "2942": "so that if those things are preserved which are, as it were, the gifts of fortune, yet a life unadorned and abandoned by friends cannot possibly be happy.", "2943": "But on this head enough.", "2944": "XVI.", "2945": "But it is required to lay down what limits there are in friendship, and, as it were, what bounds of loving, con- cerning which I see three opinions held, of none of which I approve :", "2946": "-the first, that we should be affected towards a friend in the same manner as towards ourselves;", "2947": "the second, that our goodwill towards our friends should exactly and equally answer to their goodwill towards us;", "2948": "the third, that at whatever value a man sets himself, at the same he should be estimated by his friends.", "2949": "To none of these three opinions do I entirely assent.", "2950": "For the first one is not true, that as a man feels towards himself so he should be disposed towards his friend.", "2951": "For how many things, which for our own sake we should never do, do we perform for the sake of our friends ?", "2952": "To ask favours of unworthy persons, to supplicate them, to inveigh bitterly against any one, and to accuse him with great vehemence, which in our own cases cannot be done creditably, in the case of our friends are most honourably done;", "2953": "and there are many cases in which good men subtract many things from their own interests, or allow them to be subtracted, that their friends, rather than themselves, may enjoy them.", "2954": "The second opinion is that which limits friend- ship to an equality of kind actions and kind wishes:", "2955": "this is indeed to reduce friendship to figures too minutely and penu- riously, so that there may be a balance of received and paid.", "2956": "True friendship seems to be far too rich and affluent for that, and not to observe, narrowly, lest it should pay more than it receives:", "2957": "nor need it be feared lest anything should be lost or fall to the ground, or lest more than what is fair should be accumulated on the side of friendship.", "2958": "But the third limitation is most detestable, that at whatever value a man sets on himself, at that value he should be estimated by his friends;", "2959": "for often, in certain persons, either their spirit is too humble, or their hope of improving their condition too desponding;", "2960": "it is not, therefore, the part of a friend to be towards him what he is to himself;", "2961": "but rather to use every effort, and to contrive to cheer the prostrate spirit of his friend.", "2962": "and to encourage better hopes and thoughts.", "2963": "There- fore I must lay down some other limit of true friendship, as soon as I shall have stated what Scipio was accustomed above all things to reprehend.", "2964": "He used to declare that no speech could be found more hostile to friendship, than his who had said that a man ought so to love as if one day he would come to hate.*", "2965": "Nor, indeed, could he be induced to believe that this, as was supposed, was said by Bias, † who was considered one of the seven wise men ;", "2966": "but that it was the opinion of some wicked or ambitious man, or one who sought to bring everything under his own power.", "2967": "For in what manner can any one be a friend to him to whom he thinks he may possibly become an enemy ?", "2968": "Moreover, it will follow that he desires and wishes his friend to do wrong as often as possible, that he may afford him, as it were, so many handles for reproach.", "2969": "And, again, at the right conduct and advantage of his friends he will necessarily be tormented, grieved, and jealous.", "2970": "Wherefore this precept, to whomso- ever it belongs, is powerful only for the destruction of friend- ship.", "2971": "This, rather, should have been the precept, that we should employ such carefulness in forming our friendships, that we should not any time begin to love the man whom we could ever possibly hate.", "2972": "Moreover, if we have been but unfortunate in our selection, Scipio was of opinion that this should be submitted to, rather than that a time of alienation should ever be contemplated.", "2973": "XVII.", "2974": "I think, therefore, we must adopt these limitations, that when the character of friends is correct, then there should be a community between them of all things, of pur- pose and of will, without any exception;", "2975": "so that, even if by any chance it has happened that the less honourable wishes of our friends have to be forwarded, in which either their life is concerned, or their reputation, then you may decline a little from the straight path,* provided only extreme infamy do not follow;", "2976": "for there is a point to which indulgence may be granted to friendship:", "2977": "yet reputation must not be disre- garded;", "2978": "nor ought we to esteem the good will of our fellow countrymen as an engine of small value in the administration of the state, although to seek it by fawning and flattering is mean indeed ;", "2979": "yet virtue, on which affection is consequent, should by no means be rejected.", "2980": "But frequently (for I return to Scipio, the whole of whose discourse was concern- ing friendship) he used to complain, that in all other things men were comparatively careful;", "2981": "so that every man could tell how m'any goats or how many sheep he possessed, yet how many friends he had he could not tell;", "2982": "and in procuring the former, men employed carefulness, while in selecting their friends they were negligent, nor had they, as it were, any signs or marks by which they determined who were suited for friendship.", "2983": "The steadfast, then, and the steady, and the consistent are to be selected, of which class of persons there is a great scarcity;", "2984": "and, in truth, it is difficult for any one to judge, unless after he is experienced.", "2985": "Now the trial must be made in actual friendship;", "2986": "thus friendship outstrips judgment, and removes the power of making ex- periments.", "2987": "It is the part, therefore, of a prudent man, to check the impetus of his kindly feeling as he would his chariot, that we may have our friendships, like our horses, fully proved, when the character of our friends has been in some measure tested.", "2988": "Of some, it is often discovered in small sums of money how void of worth they are.", "2989": "Some, whom a small sum could not influence, are discovered in the case of a large one.", "2990": "But, even if some shall be found who think it sordid to prefer money to friendship, where should we find those who do not place above friendship high digni- ties, magistracies, military command, civil authorities, and influence?", "2991": "so that, when on the one side these objects have been proposed, and the claim of friendship on the other, they would not far prefer the former.", "2992": "For nature is too weak to despise the possession of power;", "2993": "for, even if they have attained it by the slighting of friendship, they think the act will be thrown into the shade, because friendship was not overlooked without strong grounds.", "2994": "Therefore real friend- ships are found with most difficulty among those who are in- vested with high offices, or in business of the state.", "2995": "For where can you find the man who would prefer his friend's advancement to his own?", "2996": "And why?", "2997": "For to pass over these matters, how grievous, how impracticable to most men does participation in afflictions appear!", "2998": "to which it is not easy to find the man who will descend.", "2999": "Although Ennius * truly says, \"A sure friend is discerned in an unsure matter.\"", "3000": "Yet these two charges of inconstancy and of weakness con- demn most men:", "3001": "either in their prosperity they despise a friend, or in his troubles they desert him.", "3002": "XVIII.", "3003": "He who, therefore, shall have shown himself in both cases as regards friendship, worthy, consistent, and steadfast;", "3004": "such a one we ought to esteem of a class of persons ex- tremely rare, nay, almost godlike.", "3005": "Now, the foundation of that steadfastness and constancy, which we seek in friendship, is sincerity.", "3006": "For nothing is steadfast which is insincere.", "3007": "Besides, it is right that one should be chosen who is frank and good-natured, and congenial in his sentiments;", "3008": "one, in fact, who is influenced by the same motives ;", "3009": "all which qualities have a tendency to create sincerity.", "3010": "For it is impossible for a wily and tortuous disposition to be sincere.", "3011": "Nor in truth can the man who has no sympathy from nature, and who is not moved by the same considerations, be either attached or steady.", "3012": "To the same requisites must be added, that he shall neither take delight in bringing forward charges, nor believe them when they arise;", "3013": "all which causes belong to that consistent principle, of which now for some time I have been treating.", "3014": "Thus the remark is true, which I made at first, that friendship can only exist among the good :", "3015": "for it is the part of a good man (whom at the same time we may call a wise man) to observe these two rules in friendship:", "3016": "first, that there shall be nothing pre- tended or simulated (for even to hate openly better becomes the ingenuous man, than by his looks to conceal his sen timents);", "3017": "in the next place, that not only does he repel charges when brought (against his friends) by any one, but is not himself suspicious, ever fancying that some infidelity has been committed by his friend.", "3018": "To all this there should be added a certain suavity of conversation and manners, affording as it does no inconsiderable zest to friendship.", "3019": "Now solemnity and gravity on all occasions, certainly, carry with them dignity;", "3020": "but friendship ought to be easier and more free and more pleasant, and tending more to every kind of politeness and good nature.", "3021": "XIX.", "3022": "But there arises on this subject a somewhat difficult question ;", "3023": "whether ever new friends, if deserving friendship, are to be preferred to old ones, just as we are wont to prefer young colts to old horses ?", "3024": "a perplexity unworthy of a man;", "3025": "for there ought to be no satiety of friendship as of other things :", "3026": "every thing which is oldest (as those wines which bear age well) ought to be sweetest;", "3027": "and that is true which is sometimes said, \"many bushels of salt must be eaten together,\" before the duty of friendship can be fulfilled.", "3028": "But new friendships, if they afford a hope that, as in the case of plants which never disappoint, fruits shall appear, such are not to be rejected;", "3029": "yet the old one must be preserved in its proper place, for the power of age and custom is exceedingly great;", "3030": "besides, in the very case of the horse, which I just mentioned, if there is no impediment, there is no one who does not more pleasurably use that to which he is accustomed than one unbroken and strange to him;", "3031": "and habit asserts its power, and habit prevails, not only in the case of this, which is animate, but also in the cases of those things which are inanimate, since we take delight in the very mountainous or woody scenery among which we have long dwelt.", "3032": "But it is of the greatest importance in friendship that the superior should be on an equality with the inferior.", "3033": "For there often are instances of superiority, as was the case with Scipio, one, so to speak, of our own herd.", "3034": "He never ranked himself above Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or other friends of an inferior grade.", "3035": "But his brother, Quintus Maximus, a distinguished man, though by no means equal to himself, simply because he was the elder, he treated as his superior, and he wished all his friends should receive additional dignity through him.", "3036": "And this conduct should be adopted and imitated by all, so that if they have attained to any excellence in worth, genius, or fortune, they should communicate them with their friends, and share them with their connexions;", "3037": "so that if men have been born of humble parentage, or if they have kinsmen less powerful than themselves, either in mind or in fortune, they should increase the consequence of such persons, and be to them a source of credit and of dignity;", "3038": "as in works of fiction, they who for some time, through igno- rance of their origin and descent, have been in a state of servitude, when they have been discovered and found out to be the sons of gods or kings, yet retain their affection for the shepherds, whom for many years they looked upon as their parents.", "3039": "And this assuredly is much rather to be observed in the case of parents that are real and undoubted.", "3040": "For the fruit of talent, and worth, and every excellence, is gathered most fully when it is bestowed on every one most nearly connected with us.", "3041": "XX.", "3042": "As therefore those who are superior

in genius, or fortune, or rank :", "3044": "whereas most of them are always either complaining of something, or even breaking out into reproaches;", "3045": "and so much the more if they think they have anything which they can say was done by them in an obliging and friendly manner with some exertion on their part.", "3046": "A disgusting set of people assuredly they are who are ever reproaching you with their services ;", "3047": "which the man on whom they are conferred ought indeed to remember, but he who conferred them ought not to call them to mind.", "3048": "Where fore, as those who are superior ought in the exercise of friendship to condescend;", "3049": "so, in a measure, they ought to raise up their inferiors.", "3050": "For there are some persons who render friendships with them annoying, while they fancy they are slighted:", "3051": "this does not commonly happen except to.", "3052": "those who think themselves liable to be slighted ;", "3053": "and from this belief they require to be relieved, not only by your pro- fessions but by your actions.", "3054": "Now, first of all, so much advantage is to be bestowed on each as you yourself can pro- duce;", "3055": "and

state of delight, he would be able to consider nothing in his mind, to attain nothing by reason, nothing by reflection :", "3607": "wherefore that there was nothing so detestable and so destructive as pleasure, inasmuch as that when it was excessive and very prolonged, it extinguished all the light of the soul.", "3608": "Nearchus of Tarentum, our host,* who had re- mained throughout in friendship with the Roman people, said lie had heard from older men, that Archytas held' this con- versation with Caius Pontius the Samnite, the father of him by whom, in the Caudian battle, * Spurius Postumius

often heard from my elders, who said that, in like manner, they, when boys, had heard from old men, that Caius Fabricius was wont to wonder that when he was ambassador to king Pyrrhus, he had heard from Cineas the Thessalian, that there was a certain person at Athens, who professed himself a wise man, and that he was accustomed to say that all things which we did were to be referred to plea- sure :", "3619": "and that hearing him say so, Manius Curius and Titus Coruncanius were accustomed to wish that that might be the persuasion of the Samnites and Pyrrhus himself, that they might the more easily be conquered when they had given themselves up to pleasure.", "3620": "Manius Curius had lived with Publius Decius, who, five years before the consulship of the former, had devoted himself

is even the highest praise to old age, that it has no great desire for any pleasures.", "3625": "It lacks banquets, and piled- up boards, and fast-coming goblets ;", "3626": "it is therefore also free from drunkenness and indigestion and sleeplessness.", "3627": "But if something must be conceded to pleasure (since we do not easily withstand its allurements, for Plato beautifully calls pleasure the bait of evils, inasmuch as, by it, in fact, men are caught as fishes with a hook), although old age has nothing to do with extravagant banquets, yet in reasonable entertainments it can experience pleasure.", "3628": "I, when a boy, often saw Caius Duilius,* son of Marcus, the first man who had conquered the Carthaginians by sea, returning from dinner, when an old man :", "3629": "he took

that advances, all things will become every day more subdued.", "3637": "For I did not calculate the gratification of those banquets by the pleasures of the body, so much as by the meetings of friends and con- versations.", "3638": "For well did our ancestors style the reclining of friends at an entertainment, because it carried with it a union of life, by the name \" convivium”* better than the

even in these pleasures themselves old age is without enjoyment.", "3644": "For my part, the presidencies † esta- blished by our ancestors delight me ;", "3645": "and that conversation, which after the manner of our ancestors, is kept up over our cups from the top of the table;", "3646": "and the cups, as in the Sym- posium of Xenophon, small and dewy, and the cooling of the wine in summer, and in turn either the sun, or the fire in winter:", "3647": "practices which I am accustomed to follow among the Sabines also, and I daily join a party of neighbours, which we prolong with various

disagreeable and irksome to be without them;", "3655": "but to the contented and satisfied it is more delightful to want them than to enjoy them:", "3656": "and yet he does not want who feels no desire;", "3657": "therefore I say that this freedom from desire is more delightful than enjoyment.", "3658": "But if the prime of life has more cheerful enjoyment of those very pleasures, in the first place they are but petty objects which it en- joys, as I have said before;", "3659": "then they are those of which.", "3660": "old age, if it does not abundantly possess them, is not altogether destitute.", "3661": "As he is more delighted with Turpio Ambivius, who is spectator on the foremost bench,* yet he also is delighted who is in the hindmost;", "3662": "so youth having a close view of

less, generally with very great interest.", "3685": "And yet for my part it is not only the product, but the virtue and nature of the earth itself delight me ;", "3686": "which, when in its softened and subdued bosom it has received the scattered seed, first of all confines what is hidden within it, from which harrowing, which produces that effect, derives its name (occatio) ;", "3687": "then,

stalk, is now enclosed in a sheath, as if it were of tender age, out of which, when it hath shot up, it then pours forth the fruit of the ear, piled in due order, and is guarded by a rampart of beards

may be most properly committed to them and to men of their character.", "4569": "But if there is a man, from whom you have already received offence, or of whom you have known any- thing ill, never entrust anything to him, nor commit to him any portion of your reputation.", "4570": "But if within your province you have got any person who has been thoroughly admitted to your intimacy, and who is unknown to me, consider how far you ought to trust him.", "4571": "Not but that there may be many worthy men amongst the provincials ;", "4572": "but this it is lawful to hope, but dangerous to determine.", "4573": "For every man's nature is concealed with many folds of disguise, and covered as it were with various veils.", "4574": "His nature, his brows, his eyes, and very often his countenance are deceitful, and -his speech is most commonly a lie.", "4575": "Wherefore, out of that class of men who, being devoted to the love of money, are destitute of all those qualities from which we cannot be separated, where can you find one who will sincerely love you, a mere stranger to them.", "4576": "and not pretend to do so for the sake of advantage ?", "4577": "It would seem to me very extraordinary, especially as those very men pay seldom any regard to any private man, while they are all invariably attached themselves to the prætors.", "4578": "However, if amongst such kind of men you should find one (for the thing is not impossible), who loves you more than he does his own interest, eagerly enrol such a man in the number of your friends ;", "4579": "but if you do not perceive this, there will be no class in your acquaintance more to be avoided :", "4580": "because they know all the arts of getting money, they Jo nothing but for money, and they are indifferent about the opinion of any man with whom they are not to continue to live.", "4581": "Certain connections too with the Greeks themselves are to be most carefully guarded against, except with a very few men, who, if any, are worthy of ancient Greece.", "4582": "For truly, in general they are deceitful and treacherous, and trained up by perpetual subjection, in the art of sycophancy.*", "4583": "All of these I would say should be liberally treated, and the best of them received into hospitality and friendship ;", "4584": "but too close intimacies with them are not very safe, for though they dare not oppose our wishes, yet they are jealous not only of our countrymen but even of their own.", "4585": "Though they dare not fly in the face of a Roman magistrate, yet at the bottom they hate not only us but their own countrymen.", "4586": "Now, as in matters of this kind, as I wish to be cautious and diligent (though I fear I may seem too rigid), what do you think is my feeling with respect to slaves, whom we ought to keep under the strictest commmand in all places, but especially in the provinces ?", "4587": "Concerning this class many directions might be given ;", "4588": "but the shortest and plainest method I can recommend is, that in all your Asiatic journeys, they should behave as if you were travelling over the Appian way, and that they think there is not the least difference whether they were entering Tralles † or Formiæ.‡", "4589": "But if any of your slaves should distinguish himself by his fidelity, let him be employed in your domestic and private affairs, but not let him have the smallest thing to do with any public concern, or anything relating to the business of your government.", "4590": "For though many things may properly be entrusted to our faithful slaves, yet for the sake of avoid- ing observation and animadversion, they ought not to be committed to them.", "4591": "But I know not how my discourse has deviated into a style of dictation, though that was not my intention at the com- mencement.", "4592": "For why should I dictate to a man not inferior to me in knowledge, especially in all matters of this kind, and even superior in experience ?", "4593": "but I thought it would be very agreeable, if my sanction were added to what you are doing.", "4594": "Wherefore let these be the foundations of your dignity.", "4595": "In the first place, your own integrity and modera- tion ;", "4596": "in the next place, the modest behaviour of all who are about you, joined to a very cautious and circumspect choice of your acquaintance, whether they be provincials or Greeks;", "4597": "and the orderly and consistent regulation of your household.", "4598": "All which particulars are commendable in our private and daily concerns, but they must appear divine amidst such great power, such depraved manners, and so corrupting a province.", "4599": "Such a plan, and such regulations, will be sufficient to support that severity in all your resolutions, and all your decrees, which you exercised in those matters, and by which, to my great pleasure, we have incurred some enmities, unless, indeed, you imagine that I was influenced by the complaints of an individual—I know not whom-of the name of Paconius, who is not even a Greek, but is some Mysian, or rather Phrygian;", "4600": "or that I was moved by the vociferations of Tuscenius, that frantic, mean-spirited wretch, from whose polluted maw you, with the utmost equity, rescued a dis- honest prey.", "4601": "Wherefore we could not easily maintain those and the other instances of severity which you have practised in that province, without the most perfect integrity.", "4602": "There should therefore be the utmost rigour in your ad- ministration of justice, so that it should not be affected by favour, but maintained without variation.*", "4603": "It is, however, of no great consequence that justice should be impartially and diligently administered by yourself, unless the same is done 'by those to whom you have delegated some part of your functions.", "4604": "Now it appears to me that in the government of Asia there is no great variety of business, but that it is chiefly employed in judicial administration, the method of which especially in provinces is simple.", "4605": "Constancy and gravity must indeed be exercised, which may be not only above partiality, but even above the suspicion of it.", "4606": "To this must be added affability in hearing, calmness in determining, and carefulness in discussing the case and making restitu- tion.", "4607": "By reason of these qualities, Octavius* lately became most popular, before whom, for the first time, the lictor had nothing to do, and the crier had nothing to say;", "4608": "for every one spoke when he pleased and as long as he pleased.", "4609": "In this matter he might, perhaps, seem too compliant, were it not that this gentleness was the warrant of his inflexibility.", "4610": "The men of Sylla's party were compelled to restore what they had seized by force and terror.", "4611": "Such of the magistrates as had made unjust decisions were obliged themselves to submit, as private men, to similar inflictions.", "4612": "Now this severity on his part would have seemed cruel, had it not been tempered with many ingredients of humanity.", "4613": "If this gentleness is agreeable at Rome, where there is so much arrogance, such unbounded liberty, such unrestrained licentiousness, where there are such numerous magistracies, so many auxiliaries, so great force, and so much authority in the senate, how agreeable must the affability of a prætor be in Asia, where so great a number of our countrymen and allies, where so many cities and so many states, are observant ofone man's nod ?", "4614": "where they have no resource, no tribunal, no senate, and no assembly of the people ?", "4615": "It belongs there- fore to the character of a great man, and of a man as well humane by nature, as improved by learning and the study of the noblest arts, so to conduct himself in the use of such great power as that no other authority should be desired by those over whom he rules.", "4616": "The great Cyrus is represented by Xenophon (not accord- ing to the truth of history, but as the ideal model of right government*), whose extreme gravity is combined by that philosopher with singular sweetness of manners;", "4617": "which books our countryman, Scipio Africanus, was accustomed, and not without reason, always to have in his hands, for in them no duty of active, well-tempered government has been passed over;", "4618": "and if Cyrus, who could never be reduced to a private station, so diligently cultivated those duties, what ought they to be held by those to whom power has been given on con- dition of their surrendering it, and given by those laws to which they must be amenable ?", "4619": "Now it seems to me that all the considerations of those who rule over others should be referred to this object, that those who are under their government should be as happy as possible;", "4620": "and by constant report, and the acknowledgment of all, it has become no honour that this both is, and ever has been your most settled principle ever since you first landed in Asia;", "4621": "nay, that it is the duty, not only of those who govern the allies and the subjects of Rome, but of those who have the care of slaves and dumb cattle, to con- tribute to the interests and welfare of all committed to their charge.", "4622": "In this respect I perceive it is universally allowed that the utmost diligence has been used by you;", "4623": "that no new debts have been contracted by the states;", "4624": "that you have dis- charged many old ones with which many of the cities were burdened and oppressed;", "4625": "that you have repaired many ruin- ous and almost abandoned towns;", "4626": "amongst others Samus the capital of Ionia, and Halicarnassus the capital of Caria;", "4627": "that there are no seditions, no discords in your towns;", "4628": "that it has been seen to by you that the states are governed by the counsels of the best men;", "4629": "that you have suppressed rapine in Mysia, and bloodshed in many places;", "4630": "that peace has been established all over your province;", "4631": "that you have chased thieves and robbers, not only from the highways and country places, but from towns and temples, where they were more numerous and more dangerous;", "4632": "that calumny, that most cruel minister to the avarice of prætors, has been removed from the reputation, the fortunes, and the retire- ment of the rich;", "4633": "that the funds and taxes of the states are equally borne by all who inhabit the borders of those states;", "4634": "that access to you is most easy;", "4635": "that your ears are open to the complaints of all men;", "4636": "that the poor and the helpless always find admittance, not only to your public audiences and tribunals, but even to your house and your bed-chamber;", "4637": "and that in short, in the whole of your government there is nothing that is spiteful, nothing that is merciless, but that it is filled with clemency, gentleness, and humanity.", "4638": "How important was that public service you performed when you freed Asia from the unjust and burdensome tax imposed upon them by the ædiles, with great odium to us;", "4639": "for if one man of quality publicly complains that you have deprived him of almost £100,000, by ordering that money should not be levied for public exhibitions, what vast sums must have been raised, had the custom continued for raising money in the name of all who exhibited public shows at Rome.", "4640": "I stifled these complaints of our people, by a method which, however it may be regarded in Asia, is highly ap- plauded at Rome ;", "4641": "for when the states of ray province had voted a sum of money for erecting a temple and a monument to me, and when on account of my great deserts and your extraordinary services, they did it voluntarily and cheer- fully, and though the law has expressly provided, \" That governors may receive money for erecting a temple or a monument,\" nay, though the money which was granted was not to perish, but to be laid out upon the ornaments of a temple, that was to appear to future times, not more a pre- sent to me than to the people of Rome, and to the immortal gods;", "4642": "and yet I thought that the offer should be rejected though warranted by dignity, by law, and by the good will of those who made it;", "4643": "and this I did for this reason, amongst others, that those magistrates to whom such sums are not due, nor permitted by law, might bear (the refusal of them) with a more resigned temper.", "4644": "Apply yourself, therefore, with all your spirit and all your zeal, to that plan which you have already practised, that of loving the people which your country has committed and en- trusted to your faithful care ;", "4645": "protecting them in every way, and desiring that they should be as happy as possible.", "4646": "*But if fortune had set you over the Africans, the Spaniards, or the Gauls, those fierce and barbarous nations, yet still it would have been the dictate of your humanity to study their interests, and to have promoted their advantage and welfare.", "4647": "But when we govern a set of men, among whom civilization not only exists, but from whom it may be supposed even to have extended to others, surely we are most especially bound to repay them what we have received from them ;", "4648": "for I am not ashamed to acknowledge, especially in my position in life, and with the deeds which I have per- formed, which can involve no suspicion of indolence or un- steadiness ;", "4649": "that I have arrived at all those accomplishments to which I have attained, by means of those studies and arts which have been handed down to us in the remains and sys- tems of Greece.", "4650": "Therefore, besides the common faith which we owe to all mankind, we seem to be especially in- debted to this race of men,* so that we should be desirous of offering to those, by whose precepts we have been instructed, that which we learned from them.", "4651": "Plato, that philosopher, so distinguished by his genius and learning, thought that states would then at length be happy, when either wise and learned men should begin to be their rulers, or when their governors should apply themselves wholly to the study of learning and wisdom ;", "4652": "that is, he thought that this union of power and wisdom would constitute the safety of states.", "4653": "This may possibly, at some time, be the case of our whole empire, but at present it is the case of one province, that an individual possesses the supreme power in it, who has de- voted, from his childhood, the largest amount of time and study to the pursuit of learning, of virtue, and humanity.", "4654": "Take care, therefore, my Quintus, that this year which is added to your government, prove to be a year that is added to the welfare of Asia ;", "4655": "and because Asia has been more successful in detaining you than I was in procuring your recall, do you behave so as that my regret may receive some mitigation from the joy of the province.", "4656": "For if you have so indefatigably applied yourself to deserve greater honours than perhaps ever man did, you ought to exert much greater diligence in maintaining them.", "4657": "I have already given you my sentiments concerning that kind of honours.", "4658": "I have always been of opinion, that if they are commonly accessible they are worthless ;", "4659": "if bestowed to serve a purpose, they are con- temptible;", "4660": "but if they are offered (as has been done) as a t ibute to your merits, I think you cannot bestow too much pains upon their preservation.", "4661": "As, therefore, you are invested with the highest command and power in those cities where you see your virtues are consecrated and deified, think, in all that you arrange, and decree, and perform, what you owe to such opinions on the part of mankind, to such flattering decisions, and such ex- alted honours.", "4662": "The result of this will be, that you will pro- vide for all, that you will remedy the ills of your subjects, provide for their welfare, and desire to be designated and regarded as the parent of Asia.", "4663": "To this zeal and assiduity the farmers of the revenue offer a great obstruction.", "4664": "If we oppose them, we shall separate from ourselves and from the state an order of men who have the highest claims upon us, and who by me were attached to the service of our government.", "4665": "If, on the other hand, we should indulge them in every respect, we must suffer those to be utterly ruined, whose welfare, nay, whose convenience, we are bound to consult.", "4666": "This, if we will view the case aright, is the sole difficulty in all your administration.", "4667": "For to practise self-control, to subdue all inordinate desires, to regulate your family, to practise the impartial administra- tion of justice, to show yourself ready to acquaint yourself with cases, and to admit and grant a hearing to individuals, are things more glorious than difficult, for they consist not in any laborious application, but in the bent of the mind and of the affections.", "4668": "We learned how much bitterness of feeling this matter of the farmers of the revenue occasioned to our allies from our own fellow countrymen ;", "4669": "who, when the tolls of Italy were lately abolished, complained not so much of the heaviness of the tolls as of the insolence of the toll-gatherers, from which I am sensible of what must befall our allies in remote coun- tries, when I have heard such complaints from our fellow citizens in Italy.", "4670": "It seems to require a superhuman virtue, that is, one like your own, in this situation of things, to give satisfaction to the farmers of the public revenue, especially when the taxes have been disadvantageously contracted for, and at the same time not to suffer our allies to be ruined.", "4671": "But, in the first place, as to the Greeks, the hardship which they most bitterly complain of, that of their being taxed, is, in my opinion, no great hardship, because by their own constitutions, apart from the government of the Roman people, they were in the same condition with their own cou- sent.", "4672": "As to the name of a farmer of the revenue, the Greeks- ought not to hold it in such contempt, because, without their assistance, they could not have paid the tax indiscriminately imposed upon them by Sylla.", "4673": "Now that the Greeks are fully as severe as our farmers are, in the collection of the public revenue, may be concluded from this, that the Caunians* some time ago, who inhabit the islands that were annexed by Sylla to the division of Rhodes, petitioned the senate that they might pay their taxes to us, rather than to the Rho- dians.", "4674": "They therefore who always have been taxed, ought not to hold the name of a tax-gatherer with horror, nor ought they to despise him, without whom they cannot pay their taxes ;", "4675": "nor ought they who have petitioned for him to reject him.", "4676": "The Asiatics ought at the same time to reflect, that were they not under our government, no calamity of foreign war and domestic dissension would ever have been absent from them.", "4677": "And since this government cannot be supported without taxes, they ought cheerfully to purchase for themselves, with some part of their incomes, an uninter- rupted peace and tranquillity.", "4678": "When once they come to en- dure with patience the profession and name of a farmer of the revenue, your prudent measures and conduct will be able to make other annoyances seem lighter to them.", "4679": "They will come, not to reflect so much in making their compositions upon the Censorian Law, but rather upon the advantage of settling the business, and upon their freedom from molesta- tion.", "4680": "You can likewise continue what you have always so admirably done, to put them in mind how much dignity there is in the office of a farmer of the revenue, andhow much we owe to that order.", "4681": "So that, apart from force and the influence of authority, and of the fasces, you will bring the publicans into favour and credit with the Greeks.", "4682": "You may even entreat those whom you have so highly obliged, and who owe their all to you, that by their compliance they will suffer us to cherish and continue those intimate con- nexions that subsist between us and the farmers of the revenue.", "4683": "But why do I exhort you to those measures which you are not only able to do of your own accord without the iu-- structions of any one, but which in a great degree you already have happily executed.", "4684": "For the most honourable and considerable bodies of our empire never cease to pay me their daily thanks, which are the more agreeable, because the Greeks do the same.", "4685": "Now it is a matter of great difficulty to bring together in good will those whose in- terests, whose advantages, and whose natures, I had almost said, are repugnant.", "4686": "But what I have here written, I have written not for your instruction (for wisdom such as yours stands in need of no man's instructions), but the recording of yeur merits delights me as I write.", "4687": "In this letter, how- ever, I have been longer than I intended or supposed that I should be.", "4688": "There is one thing which I shall not cease to recommend to you, for so far as in me lies I will not suffer an exception to your praises.", "4689": "All who come from that region, while they praise your virtue, your integrity, and your humanity, even in their highest commendations make one exception, your anger;", "4690": "a vice, which in private and every day life seems to be the defect of an inconstant and weak mind ;", "4691": "but when a passionate behaviour is joined to sovereign power, nothing can be more monstrous.*", "4692": "I shall not, however, endeavour to give you the sentiments of the best instructed men, concern- ing the passion of anger, both because I am unwilling thia.", "4693": "this letter should be too long, and because you can easily learn them from the writings of many men.", "4694": "Still I do not think that one thing which is proper to a letter should be neglected, namely, that he to whom we write should be made acquainted with those things of which he is ignorant.", "4695": "Now I am told almost by every body, that when you are free from anger, nothing can be more agreeable than you are ;", "4696": "ut when the impudence or perverseness of another has excited you, you are under such violent agitations that your kindly disposition is sought for in vain.", "4697": "As, therefore, a certain desire of glory as well as interest, and fortune, have concurred to lead us into that walk of life, by which we become the perpetual subject of conversation amongst mankind, we ought to do and to strive all we can that no conspicuous vice may be said to attach to us.*", "4698": "I do not now insist on this consideration, that in human nature at large, and especially at our time of life, it is very difficult for a man to alter his disposition, or suddenly to pluck out a fail- in-, that has settled into a habit.", "4699": "But my advice to you is this, if you cannot altogether avoid this, but passion takes possession of your mind before reason can take precautions that it should not invade it, you should undergo a course of preparation, and be every day meditating that resistance must be offered to anger, and the more violently it affects the mind, the more diligently must you restrain your tongue ;", "4700": "which merit sometimes appears to me not less than that of never being angry at all;", "4701": "because the latter virtue is not solely the proof of self-respect, but sometimes of a lethargic temperament.", "4702": "But when you are touched with anger, to control both your temper and your language, even to hold your peace, and to keep under command all excitement and irritation of mind ;", "4703": "these are the properties, if not of con- summate wisdom, yet of extraordinary understanding.", "4704": "They say that in this respect you are become much more pliable and gentle.", "4705": "None of your violent emotions of passion are stated to me ;", "4706": "none of your imprecating expressions, and opprobious behaviour, all which are as repugnant to authority and dignity, as they are reproachful to learning and good breeding.", "4707": "For if angry passions are implacable, the utmost cruelty is involved, and if placable,* an excess of weakness;", "4708": "which, however, as a comparison of evils, is pre- ferable to the cruelty.", "4709": "That the first year of your government gave rise to a great deal of talk upon this subject might be owing to your un- expectedly encountering that injustice, avarice, and insolence of individuals, which seemed intolerable.", "4710": "The second year, however, was more gentle ;", "4711": "because both habit and reason, and, if I mistake not, my letters rendered you more mild and patient.", "4712": "Now your third year ought to admit of such amendment, as that no person may be able to utter the slightest reproach.", "4713": "And on this subject I address you in the terms neither of exhortation nor precept, but of brotherly entreaty, that you employ your whole abilities, care, and concern, in accumu- latin- praise from all quarters.*", "4714": "If our situation were one of mediocrity as to public conversation and discourse, nothing pre-eminent would be required of you, nothing beyond the ordinary conduct of others.", "4715": "But by reason of the splendour and magnitude of the concerns in which we are engaged, unless we derive the highest glory from these functions, we seem scarcely capable of avoiding the deepest condemnation.", "4716": "We are so situated, that while all good men arc our friends, they also require and expect from us, all application and virtue;", "4717": "in the meanwhile, all the repro- bate part of mankind, because with them we have declared eternal war, seem to be satisfied with the slightest ground for condemning us.", "4718": "Wherefore, since such a theatre as Asia has been assigned you for the display of your virtues, a theatre most celebrated by fame, most ample in extent, most distinguished by dis- cernment, but.", "4719": "naturally so noisy that its expressions and intimations reach even to Rome, I pray you to strive and labour to appear, not only adequate to these conditions, but by your merits to have surpassed them all ;", "4720": "and as fortune has fixed my share of the public administration in Rome, and yours in Asia, while I yield to none in my conduct, do you excel all in yours.", "4721": "At the same time reflect, that we are not now labouring for a glory that is in expectation and reversion ;", "4722": "but we are struggling for what has been attained, a glory that we are not so much to covet as to preserve.", "4723": "Indeed, had I any interest that is distinct from yours, I could desire nothing more than that situation of life which has actually been assigned to me ;", "4724": "but as the case is, that unless all your words and actions are answerable to my conduct here, I shall think that I have gained nothing by all those mighty toils and dangers in all which you have been a sharer.", "4725": "Now if you were my chief fellow labourer in working my way to this splendid reputation, you ought to labour beyond others that I may maintain it.", "4726": "You are not to regard the opinion and the judgment of those who are now living, but also of those who shall here- after exist, whose verdict will be the more just as it will be free from detraction and malevolence.", "4727": "In the next place, you are to reflect, that you are not seeking glory for yourself alone ;", "4728": "and, if you were, you would not be indifferent about it, especially as you have thought proper to consecrate the memory of your name by the noblest memorials, but you are to share it with me, and it is to descend to our posterity", "4729": "You are therefore to beware, lest if you should be careless you should seem not only to have neglected your own interests, but to have acted grudgingly even to your de- scendants.", "4730": "And these things are said, not that my words may seem to have aroused you when slumbering, but that they may en- courage you in your career ;", "4731": "for you will continually act as you have acted, so that all may praise your equity, your moderation, your inflexibility, and your integrity.", "4732": "But through my excessive affection for you, I am possessed with an insatiable passion for your glory.", "4733": "In the meanwhile I am of opinion, that as you must be now as well acquainted with Asia as any man is with his own house ;", "4734": "* and as so great experience has been added to your great wisdom, there is nothing that pertains to glory of which you are not fully sensible, and which does not daily occur to your mind, without the exhortation of any.", "4735": "But I who, when I read your letters, think I hear you, and when I write to you think I converse with you, am more delighted with your letters the longer they are, and for the same reason I myself also am more prolix in writing.", "4736": "In conclusion I exhort and entreat you, that just as good poets and skilful actors are wont to do, so you will redouble your attention at this the latter part and conclusion of your business and office ;", "4737": "that this last year of your government, like the last act of a play, may appear the most elaborate and perfect.", "4738": "This you will most easily do, if you think that I, whom individually you have endeavoured to please more than all the world besides, am ever present with you, and take an interest in all that you do or say.", "4739": "Lastly, I entreat you, as you value my welfare, and that of all your friends, that you will most carefully attend to your health.", "4740": "ACADEMICS little differing from the Peripatetics, 2, 6, 8;", "4741": "have a right to treat about duties, 2 ;", "4742": "how dif- fering from the Sceptics, and why they dispute
