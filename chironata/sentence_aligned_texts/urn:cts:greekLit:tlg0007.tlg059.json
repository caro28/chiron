enabled him to take part in politics, and caused him to be trusted by the people;", "13": "yet a young and ambitious man must be excused if he feels pride in the glory and reputation which he gains by brilliant exploits.", "14": "For, as Theophrastus says, the virtue which buds and sprouts in youthful minds is confirmed by praise, and the high spirit thus formed leads it to attempt greater things.", "15": "On the other hand, an excessive love of praise is dangerous in all cases, but, in statesmen, utterly ruinous;", "16": "for when it takes hold of men in the possession of great power

the head and desired sometimes to take the lead, and not always follow the head, but which when allowed to lead the way took the wrong path and caused the head to be miserably crushed, because it allowed itself to be guided by that which could neither see nor hear.", "19": "This has been the fate of many of those politicians who court the favour of the people;", "20": "for, after they have once shared their blind impulses, they lose the power of check­ ing their folly, and of restoring good discipline and order.", "21": "These reflections upon the favour of the people occurred to me when I thought of its power, as shown in the case of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, men who were well born, well educated, and began their political career with great promise, and yet were ruined, not so much by an excessive craving for popular applause as by a very pardonable fear of disgrace.", "22": "They both received at the outset great proofs of their countrymen's good-will, but felt ashamed to remain as it were in their debt, and they ever strove to wipe out their obligations to the people by legislation on their behalf, and by their beneficent measures continually increased their popularity, until, in the heat of the rivalry thus created, they found themselves pledged to a line of policy in which they could not even pause with honour, and which they could not desist from without disgrace.", "23": "The reader, however, will be able to form his own opinion about them from their history, and I shall now write, as a parallel to them, the lives of that pair of Laconian re­ formers, Agis and Kleomenes, kings of Sparta, who, like the Gracchi, increased the power of the people, and endeavoured to restore an admirable and just constitution which had fallen into desuetude;",

meanness, while the use and enjoyment of riches was followed by luxury, effeminacy, and extravagance.", "28": "Thus it fell out that Sparta lost her high and honoured position in Greece, and remained in obscurity and disgrace until the reign of Agis and Leonida.", "29": "Agis was of the Eurypontid line, the son of Eudamidas, and the sixth in descent from king Agesilaus, who invaded Asia, and

son, Leonidas the son of Kleonymus was appointed his guardian, and, as the child died before reaching manhood, he succeeded to the throne although he was far from being an acceptable personage to his countrymen;", "45": "for, though the Spartans at this period had all abandoned their original severe simplicity of living, yet they found the manners of Leonidas in offensive contrast to their own.", "46": "Indeed, Leonidas, who had spent much of his life at the courts of Asiatic potentates, and had been especially attached to that of Seleukus, seemed inclined to outrage the political feeling of the Greeks by introducing the arrogant tone of an Oriental despot into the constitutional monarchy of Sparta.", "47": "IV.", "48": "On the other hand, the goodness of heart and in­ tcllectual power of Agis proved so greatly superior not only to that of Leonidas, but of every king since Agesilaus the Great, that before he arrived at his twentieth year, in spite of his having been brought up in the greatest luxury by his mother Agesistrata and his grandmother Archidamia, the two richest women in Sparta, he abjured all frivolous indulgence, laid aside all personal ornament, avoided extravagance of every kind, prided himself on practising the old Laconian habits of dress, food, and bathing, and was wont to say that he would not care to be king unless he could use his position to restore the ancient customs and discipline of his country.", "49": "V.", "50": "The corruption of the Lacedæmonians began at the time when, after having overthrown the Athenian empire, they were able to satiate themselves with the possession of gold and silver.", "51": "Nevertheless, as the number of houses instituted by Lykurgus was still maintained, and each father still transmitted his estate to his son, the original equal division of property continued to exist and preserved the state from disorder.", "52": "But a certain powerful and self-willed man, named Epitadeus, who was one of the Ephors, having quarrelled with his son, pro­ posed a rhetra permitting a man to give his house and land to whomsoever he pleased, either during his life, or by his will after his death.", "53": "This man proposed the law in order to gratify his own private grudge;", "54": "but the other Spartans through covetousness eagerly confirmed it, and ruined the admirable constitution of Lykurgus.", "55": "They now began to acquire land without limit, as the powerful men kept their relatives out of their rightful inheritance;", "56": "and as the wealth of the country soon got into the hands of a few, the city became impoverished, and the rich began to be viewed with dislike and hatred.", "57": "There were left at that time no more than seven hundred Spartans, and of these about one hundred pos­ sessed an inheritance in land, while the rest, without money, and excluded from all the privileges of citizenship, fought in a languid and spiritless fashion in the wars, and were ever on the watch for some oppotunity to subvert the existing condition of affairs at home.", "58": "VI. Agis, therefore, thinking that it would be an honourable enterprise, as indeed it was, to restore these citi­ zens to the state and to re-establish equality for all, began to sound the people themselves as to their opinion about such a measure.", "59": "The younger men quickly rallied round him, and, with an enthusiasm which he had hardly counted upon, began to make ready for the contest;", "60": "but most of the elder men, who had become more thoroughly tainted by the prevailing corruption, feared to be brought back to the discipline of Lykurgus as much as a runaway slave fears to be brought back to his master, and they bitterly reviled Agis when he lamented over the con­ dition of affairs and sighed for the ancient glories of Sparta.", "61": "His enthusiastic aspirations, however, were sympathised with by Lysander the son of Libys, Man­ drokleidas the son of Ekphanes, and Agesilaus.", "62": "Lysander was the most influential of all the Spartans, while Mandrokleidas was thought to be the ablest politician in Greece, as he could both plot with subtlety and execute with boldness.", "63": "Agesilaus was the uncle of King Agis and a fluent speaker, but of a weak and covetous disposition.", "64": "It was commonly supposed that he was stirred to action by the influence of his son Hippomedon, who had gained great glory in the wars and was exceedingly popular among the younger citizens;", "65": "but what really determined him to join the reformers was the amount of his debts, which he hoped would be wiped out by a revolution.", "66": "As soon as Agis had won over this important adherent, he began to try to bring over his mother to his views, who was Agesilaus's sister, and who, from the number of her friends, debtors, and dependants, was very powerful in the state, and took a large share in the management of public affairs.", "67": "VII.", "68": "When she first heard of Agis's designs she was much startled, and dissuaded the youth from an enterprise which she thought neither practicable nor desirable.", "69": "However, when Agesilaus pointed out to her what a notable design it was, and how greatly to the advantage of all, while the young king himself besought his mother to part with her wealth in order to gain him glory, arguing that he could not vie with other kings in riches, as the servants of Persian satraps, and the very slaves of the intendants of Ptolemy and Seleukus possessed more money than all the kings that ever reigned in Sparta;", "70": "but that, if he could prove himself superior to those vanities by his temperance, simplicity of life, and true greatness of mind, and could succeed in restoring equality among his follow-countrymen, he would be honoured and renowned as a truly great king.", "71": "By this means the youth entirely changed his mother's mind, and so fired her with his own ambition, as if by an inspiration from heaven, that she began to encourage Agis and urge him on, and invited her friends to join them, while she also communicated their design to the other women, because she knew that the Lacedæmonians were in all things ruled by their women, and that they had more power in the state than the men possessed in their private house- holds.", "72": "Most of the wealth of Lacedæmon had fallen into female hands at this time, and this fact proved a great hind­ rance to the accomplishment of Agis's schemes of reform;", "73": "for the women offered a vehement opposition to him, net merely through a vulgar love for their idolised luxury, but also because they saw that they would lose all the influence and power which they derived from their wealth.", "74": "They betook themselves to Leonidas, and besought him, as being the elder man, to restrain Agis, and check the development of his designs.", "75": "Leonidas was willing enough to assist the richer class, but he feared the people, who were eager for reform, and would not openly oppose Agis, although he endeavoured secretly to ruin his scheme, and to prejudice the Ephors against him, by imputing to him the design of hiring the poor to make him despot with the plunder of the rich, and insinuating that by his redistribution of lands and remission of debts he meant to obtain more adherents for himself instead of more citizens for Sparta.", "76": "VIII.", "77": "In spite of all this, Agis contrived to get Lysan­ der appointed one of the Ephors, and immediately brought him to propose a rhetra before the Gerusia, or Senate, the main points of which were that all debts should be cancelled;", "78": "that the land- should be divided, that between the valley of Pellene and Mount Taygetus, Matea, and Sellasia into four thousand five hundred lots, and the outlying districts into fifteen thousand:", "79": "that the latter district should be distributed among the Periœki of military age, and the former among the pure Spartans:", "80": "that the number of these should be made up by an extension of the franchise to Periœki or even foreigners of free birth, liberal education, and fitting personal qualifications :", "81": "and that these citizens should be divided into fifteen companies some of four hundred, and some of two hundred, for the public meals, and should conform in every respect to the discipline of their forefathers.", "82": "IX.", "83": "When this rhetra was proposed, as the Senate could not agree whether it should become law, Lysander convoked a popular assembly and himself addressed the people.", "84": "Mandrokleidas and Agesilaus also besought them not to allow a few selfish voluptuaries to destroy the glorious name of Sparta, but to remember the ancient oracles, warning them against the sin of covetousness, which would prove the ruin of Sparta, and also of the responses which they had recently received from the oracle of Pasiphae.", "85": "The temple and oracle of Pasiphæ at Thalamae was of peculiar sanctity.", "86": "Pasiphae is said by some writers to have been one of the daughters of Atlas, and to have become the mother of Ammon by Zeus, while others say that Kassandra the daughter of Priam died there, and was called Pasiphae because her prophecies were plain to all men.", "87": "Phylarchus again tells us that Daphne the daughter of Amyklas, while endeavouring to escape from the violence of Apollo, was transformed into the laurel, • which bears her name, and was honoured by the god and endowed by him with the gift of prophecy.", "88": "Be this as it may, the oracular responses which were brought from this shrine bade the Spartans all become equal according as Lykurgus had originally ordained.", "89": "After these speeches had been delivered, King Agis himself came forward, and, after a few introductory words, said that he was giving the strongest possible pledges of his loyalty to the new constitution;", "90": "for he declared his intention of surrendering to the state, before any one else, his own property, consisting of a vast extent of land, both arable and pasture, besides six thousand talents of money;", "91": "and he assured the people that his mother and her friends, the richest people in Sparta, would do the same.", "92": "X.", "93": "The people were astounded at the magnanimity of the youth, and were filled with joy, thinking that at last, after an interval of three hundred years, there had appeared a king worthy of Sparta.", "94": "Lesnidas, on the other hand, opposed him as vigorously as he could, reflecting that he would be forced to follow his example, and divest himself of all his property, and that Agis, not he, would get the credit of the act.", "95": "He therefore inquired of Agis whether he thought Lykurgus to have been a just and well-meaning man.", "96": "Receiving an affirmative reply, he again demanded, \" Where, then, do we find that Lykurgus approved of the cancelling of debts, or of the admission of foreigners to the franchise, seeing that he did not think that the state could prosper without a periodical expulsion of foreigners ?\"", "97": "To this Agis answered, that it was not to be wondered at if Leonidas, who had lived in a foreign country, and had a family by the daughter of a Persian satrap, should be ignorant that Lykurgus, together with coined money, had banished borrowing and lending from Sparta, and that he had no hatred for foreigners, but only for those whose profession and mode of life made them unfit to associate with his countrymen.", "98": "These men Lykurgus expelled, not from any hatred of their persons, but because he feared that their manners and habits would infect the citizens with a love of luxury, effeminacy, and avarice.", "99": "Terpander, Thales, and Pherekydes were all foreigners, but, since they sang and taught what Lykurgus approved, they lived in Sparta, and were treated with especial honour. \"", "100": "Do you,\" asked he, \" praise Ekprepus, who when Ephor cut off with a hatchet the two additional strings which Phrynis the musician had added to the original seven strings of the lyre, and those who cut the same strings off the harp of Timo­ theus, and yet do you blame us when we are endeavouring to get rid of luxury, extravagance, and frivolity, just as if those great men did not merely mean thereby to guard against vain refinements of music, which would lead to the introduction of extravagant and licentious manners, and cause the city to be at discord and variance with itself?\"XI.", "101": "After this the people espoused the cause of Agis, while the rich begged Leonidas not to desert them, and by their entreaties prevailed upon the senators, who had the power of originating all laws, to throw out the rhetra by a majority of only one vote.", "102": "Lysander, who was still one of the Ephors, now proceeded to attack Leonidas, by means of a certain ancient law, which forbade any de­ scendant of Herakles to beget children by a foreign wife, and which bade the Spartans put to death any citizen who left his country to dwell in a foreign land.", "103": "Ho instructed his adherents to revive the memory of this law, and threaten Leonidas with its penalties, while he himself with the other Ephors watched fur the sign from heaven.", "104": "This ceremony is conducted as follows:", "105": "—Every ninth year the Ephors choose a clear moonless night, and sit in silence watching the heavens.", "106": "If a star shoots across the sky, they conclude that the kings must have committed some act of impiety, and they suspend them from their office, until they were absolved by a favourable oracle from Delphi or Olympia.", "107": "Lysander now declared that he had beheld this sign, and impeached Leonidas, bringing for­ ward witnesses to prove that he had two children born to him by an Asiatic wife, the daughter of one of the lieu­ tenants of Seleukus, and that having quarrelled with his wife and become hated by her he had unexpectedly returned home, and in default of a direct heir, had succeeded to the throne.", "108": "At the same time Lysander urged Kleombrotus, the son-in-law of Leonidas, who was also of the royal family, to claim the throne for himself.", "109": "Leonidas, terrified at this, took sanctuary in the temple of Athena of the Brazen House, and was joined there by his daughter, who left her husband Kleombrotus.", "110": "When the trial came on, Leonidas did not appear in court, he was re­ moved from the throne, and Kleombrotus was appointed in his stead.", "111": "XII.", "112": "At this crisis Lysander was forced to lay down his office, as the year for which he had been elected had expired.", "113": "The Ephors at once took Leonidas under their protection, restored him to the throne, and impeached Lysander and Mandrokleidas as the authors of illegal measures in the cancelling of debts and the redistribution of the land.", "114": "As these men were now in danger of their lives, they prevailed upon the two kings to act together and overrule the decision of the Ephors;", "115": "for this, they declared, was the ancient rule of the constitution, that if the kings were at variance, the Ephois were entitled to support the one whom they judged to be in the right against the other, but their function was merely to act as arbitrators and judges between the kings when they dis­ agreed, and not to interfere with them when they were of one mind.", "116": "Both the kings agreed to act upon this advice, and came with theis friends into the assembly, turned the Ephors out of their chairs of office, and elected others in their room, one of whom was Agesilaus.", "117": "They now armed many of the younger citizens, released the prisoners, and terrified their opponents by threatening a general massacre.", "118": "No one, however, was killed by them;", "119": "for although Agesilaus desired to kill Leonidas, and when he withdrew from Sparta to Tegea, sent men to waylay and murder him on the road, Agis, hearing of his intention, sent others on whom he could rely, who escorted Leonidas safely as far as Tegea.", "120": "XIII.", "121": "Thus far all had gone well, and no one remained to hinder the accomplishment of the reforms;", "122": "but now Agesilaus alone upset and ruined the whole of this noble and truly Spartan scheme by his detestable vice of covet­ ousness.", "123": "He possessed a large quantity of the best land in the country, and also owed a great sum of money, and as he desired neither to pay his debts nor to part with his land, he persuaded Agis that it would be too revolutionary a proci eding to carry both measures at once, and that, if the moneyed class were first propitiated by the cancelling of debts, they would afterwards be inclined to submit quietly to the redistribution of lands.", "124": "Lysander and the rest were deceived by Agesilaus into consenting to this, and they brought all the written securities for money which had been given by debtors, which are called by them klaria, into the market-place, collected them into one heap, and burned them.", "125": "As the flames rose up, the rich and those who had lent money went away in great distress, but Agesilaus, as if exulting at their misfortune, declared that he had never seen a brighter blaze or a purer fire.", "126": "As the people at once demanded the division of the land, and called upon the kings to distribute it among them, Agesilaus put them off with various excuses, and managed to spin out the time till Agis was sent out of the country on military service, as the Achæans, who were allies, had demanded a reinforcement from Sparta, because the Æto­ lians threatened to invade Peloponnesus through the terri­ tory of Megara, and Aratus, the general of the Achæans, who was collecting an army to resist them, sent to Sparts.", "127": "demanding assistance.XIV.", "128": "The Spartans at once despatched Agis at the head of an army, whose high spirits and devotion to his person filled him with delight.", "129": "The men were nearly all young and poor;", "130": "and as they were now relieved from the pressure of their debts, and expected that on their return the land would be distributed amongst them, they behaved with the most admirable discipline.", "131": "They marched through Peloponnesus without doing the least damage, without offending any one, almost without noise;", "132": "so that all the cities were astonished at the spectacle thus afforded them, and men began to wonder what a Lacedæmonian army must have been like when led by Agesilaus or Lysander the Great, or by the ancient hero Leonidas, if such awe and reverence was paid by the soldiers to one who was nearly the youngest of them all.", "133": "Their youthful leader himself was worthy of admiration, and was looked up to by the men because of his simple hard-working habits, and the pride which he took in wearing the same dress and using the same arms as the common soldiers.", "134": "The revolution which he had effected, however, was very dis­ tasteful to the rich, who feared lest it might be taken as an example by the people in other states and lead to further disturbances.", "135": "XV.", "136": "Agis joined Aratus at Corinth, while the question of how to repel the invasion was still being debated.", "137": "His advice was spirited, without being rash or foolhardy.", "138": "He gave it as his opinion that it was their duty to fight, and not abandon the gate of Peloponnesus and let the enemy into the country, but that he would defer to the decision of Aratus, who was an older man than himself, and was the general of the Achæans, and that he had not come to give them advice or to take the command of them, but to reinforce them and serve as their ally.", "139": "The historian Baton of Sinope declares that Agis declined to fight although Aratus wished him to do so;", "140": "but he is mistaken, and clearly has not read the justification which Aratus has written of his conduct, namely, that as the farmers had nearly all finished gathering in their harvest, he thought it better to allow the enemy to enter the country than to hazard everything upon the issue of a single battle.", "141": "As Aratus decided not to fight, and dismissed his allies with thanks,", "142": "Agis returned heme, greatly honoured by those under his orders, and found the internal affairs of Sparta in great turmoil and confusion.", "143": "XVI.", "144": "Agesilaus, who was now Ephor, and who was no longer restrained by the presence of those of whom he had formerly stood in awe, was using the most disgraceful expedients to extort money from the people, and had even intercalated a thirteenth month in the year, although the state of the calendar did not require it, and caused taxes to be paid for it.", "145": "As he feared those whom he had wronged, and was an object of universal hatred, he had taken a body-guard of swordsmen into his pay, and walked through the city accompanied by them.", "146": "As for the kings, he re­ garded Kleombrotus with contempt, and though he still paid some respect to Agis, he wished it to be thought that he did so because he was nearly related to himself, not because he was king.", "147": "He also gave out that he intended to remain in office as Ephor for the next year as well.", "148": "In consequence of this his enemies determined to bring matters to a crisis.", "149": "They assembled in force, brought back Leonidas publicly from Tegea, and reinstated him as king, to the great joy of most of the citizens, who were angry with the other party because they had been deceived by them about the redistribution of the land.", "150": "Agesilaus was able to leave the country in safety, owing to the intercession of his son Hippomedon, who was very popular with all classes on account of his bravery.", "151": "Of the two kings, Agis fled to the temple of Athena of the Brazen House, while Kleombrotus took sanctuary in the temple of Poseidon.*", "152": "It appeared that Leonidas hated Kleombrotus most of the two;", "153": "for he passed by Agis, but marched in pursuit of Kleombrotus with an armed force, and angrily reproached him that being his own son-in-law he had conspired against him, dethroned him, and driven him into exile.", "154": "XVII.", "155": "Kleombrotus could find nothing to say in his defence, and sat silent and helpless;", "156": "but Chilonis, the daughter of Leonidas, who formerly had taken offence at her father's injurious treatment, and when Kleombrotus usurped the throne had left him, and showed her sym­ pathy with Leonidas in his misfortune by accompanying him in the temple where he took sanctuary, and after he left the country by mourning for him and remaining at variance with her husband Kleombrotus, now changed aides with his changing fortunes, and appeared sitting by her husband's side as a suppliant to the god with him, with her arms cast round him, and her two children on each side of her.", "157": "All stood amazed and were moved to tears by her noble and affectionate conduct, and she, pointing to her mean dress and dishevelled hair, said, \" Father, I have not adopted this posture and this dress out of pity for Kleombrotus, but I have so long been in mourning for your misfortunes and your banishment that it has become customary with me.", "158": "Am I now to remain in mourning while you are victorious and reign in Sparta, or am I to dress myself in fine clothes as becomes a prin­ cess, while I see my husband murdered by your hand?", "159": "Unless he can move you to compassion, and obtain your pity by the tears of his wife and children, he will suffer a more terrible penalty for his misconduct than you wish to impose, by seeing me his dearest wife die before him ;", "160": "for how can I endure to live among other women, if I prove unable to move either my husband or my father to com­ passion ?", "161": "Both as a wife and as a daughter I have been

part which I have taken in pro­ testing against his conduct to you;", "163": "but you yourself sug­ gest a sufficient apology for his crime, by showing that you think royalty so great and precious a thing, that to obtain it you are willing to murder your son-in-law and neglect your own child.\"", "164": "XVIII.", "165": "Chilonis, after speaking thus, nestled her face against that of her husband, and glanced round at the spectators with red and tearful eyes.", "166": "Leonidas, after a short consultation with his friends, bade Kleombrotus rise and leave the country, but besought his daughter to remain with him, and not to leave him who loved her so dearly, and had just spared her husband's life in consequence of her entreaties.", "167": "He could not, however, prevail upon her to stay, but she rose up with her husband, took one child in her arms, and led the other, and so, after kneeling before the altar, followed her husband, who, if his mind was not entirely corrupted by vain ambition, must have thought exile with such a wife preferable to royalty.", "168": "After driving Kleombrotus from the throne, ejecting the Ephors from office and substituting others chosen by himself, Leonidas addressed himself to Agis.", "169": "At first he tried to persuade him to come out of sanctuary and reign as his colleague, saying that the citizens had forgiven him, because they knew that he was young and impe­ tuous, and had been deceived by Agesilaus.", "170": "However, as Agis saw through these devices and remained where he was, Leonidas left off making these hypocritical offers.", "171": "Amphares, Damochares, and Arkesilaus were in the habit of going to the temple and conversing with him;", "172": "and once he came out of the temple in their company to take a bath, and after bathing was conducted back again by them in safety.", "173": "All three were on intimate terms with him, but Amphares, who had lately borrowed some rich clothing and valuable plate from Agesistrata, was inclined to plot against the king and the royal ladies, that he might not be obliged to restore them.", "174": "He, therefore, we are told, lent a ready ear to Leonidas's plans, and excited the zeal of the Ephors, one of whom he was.", "175": "XIX.", "176": "Since", "177": "Agis lived entirely in the temple, and only left it in order to bathe, they determined to seize him when he came out for this purpose.", "178": "Having one day watched him bathing they came up and greeted him in a friendly way, and walked along with him talking and jesting as young men who are on intimate terms are wont to do.", "179": "When they reached the place where a road branches off to the public prison, Amphares, in virtue of his Ephorship, laid hold of Agis and said :", "180": "\" Agis, I must lead you before the Ephors to give an account of your conduct.\"", "181": "At the same time Damochares, a tall and strong man, threw his cloak round Agis's neck and dragged him along by it.", "182": "Others now appeared by previous arrange­ went, and pushed him from behind, and as no one came to nelp him, he was forced into the prison.", "183": "Hereupon, Leonidas appeared with a band of mercenaries, and sur­ rounded the prison.", "184": "The Ephors now went in to Agis, and sent for all the senators of their way of thinking to come to the prison in order to go through the form of a trial.", "185": "Agis laughed at their hypocrisy, but Amphares told him that it was no laughing matter, and that he would soon pay a bitter penalty for his rashness.", "186": "Another of the Ephors, wishing to offer a means of escape to Agis, inquired of him whether he had acted on his own responsibility, or had been compelled to do so by Agesilaus and Lysander.", "187": "Agis answered that no man had compelled him, but that he admired and imitated Lykurgus, and had aimed at reviving his institutions.", "188": "Upon this the same Ephor asked him whether he repented of what he had done.", "189": "When the brave youth answered that he never would repent of his glorious designs, whatever tortures he might have to suffer for them, the assembly at once con­ demned him to death, and bade the prison officials at once remove him to the place called Dec has, which is a part of the prison in which criminals are strangled.", "190": "Seeing that the servants would not lay hands upon Agis, and that even those mercenaries who were present shrunk from such work, because it was held to be unlawful and impious to lay hands upon the person of the king, Damo­ chares, after threatening and abusing them, dragged Agis with his own hands to the place of execution.", "191": "Many of the citizens had by this time heard of his arrest, and many men had assembled with torches in their hands and were clamouring at the gate of the prison.", "192": "The mother and grandmother of Agis were also present, and loudly demanded that the king of Sparta should have a fair trial in the presence of his countrymen.", "193": "For this reason they within hurried on the execution, as they feared that if a larger crowd collected Agis would be rescued during the night.", "194": "XX.", "195": "While Agis was being led to execution, he saw one of the servants of the prison weeping and in great distress.", "196": "\" My man,\" said he, \" do not weep for me, for I am a better man than those who are murdering me in this cruel and illegal fashion.\"", "197": "With these words he, of his own accord, put the noose round his neck.", "198": "Meanwhile Amphares proceeded to the prison gate.", "199": "Here Agesis­ trata fell at his feet, believing him still to be her friend.", "200": "Amphares raised her, saying that Agis would suffer no violent treatment, and bade her, if she wished, go in and see her SOIL.", "201": "As she asked to be accompanied by her mother, Amphares said that there was no objection to that, and after receiving them both within the walls, ordered the prison gates to be closed.", "202": "He first sent Archidamia, who was now very old, and greatly respected by her country women, to the place of execution, and when she was dead, bade Agesi strata enter.", "203": "When she saw the corpse of her son lying on the ground, and her mother banging by a halter, she herself assisted the servants to take her down, laid her body beside that of Agis, and arranged and covered up the two corpses.", "204": "She then knelt and kissed the face of her son, saying, \" My child, thy great piety, goodness, and clemency has brought thee and us to this death.\"", "205": "Upon this Amphares, who was watching and listening at the door, came into the room, and said angrily to Agesistrata, \" If you approve of your son's deeds, you shall suffer with him.\"", "206": "At these words Agesistrata rose and offered her neck to the halter, saving, \"I only pray that this may be for the good of Sparta.\"XXI.", "207": "When the sad news was known throughout the city, and the three corpses brought out of the prison, the terror which was inspired did not prevent the citizens from manifesting their sorrow at the deed, and their hatred of Leonidas and Amphares.", "208": "No such wicked or cruel deed, they declared, had been committed in Sparta since the Dorians settled in Peloponnesus.", "209": "The very enemies of the Lacedæmonians generally seemed unwilling to lay violent hands on their kings when they met them in battle, and turned aside through reverence of their exalted position.", "210": "For this reason, in all the battles which the Lacedæmonians had fought against the Greeks before the era of Philip of Macedon, only one king, Kleombrotus, had fallen on the field of Leuktra;", "211": "for though the Messenians aver that Theopompus, a king of Lacedæmon, was slain by Aristomenes, the Lacedæmonians deny it, and say that he was only wounded.", "212": "This matter is doubtful, but Agis was the first king who was put to death by the Ephors in Lacedæmon, because he had con­ ceived a noble design and one which was worthy of Sparta.", "213": "He was of an age when men's shortcomings deserve to be pardoned;", "214": "and deserves to be blamed by his friends more than by his enemies, because with an ill- judged clemency he spared the life of Leonidas, and trusted in the professions of the rest of his political enemiesI.", "215": "AFTER the death of Agis, as has been related, Leonida.", "216": "was not able to seize the person of his brother Archidamus, who at once fled out of the country, but he brought the wife of Agis with her newly-born child out of her house, and forcibly married her to his own son Kleomenes, who was scarcely come to an age for marriage, because he was unwilling for her to marry any one else.", "217": "Indeed Agiatis was the daughter of Gylippus, and heiress to a great estate.", "218": "She was thought to be the most beautiful woman of her time in all Greece, and was of a noble disposition.", "219": "It is said that she made many entreaties not to be forced into a second marriage, but that after her union with Kleomenes, although she continued to hate his father Leonidas, she made a good and affectionate wife to the young man, who became passionately fond of her, and sympathised with her loving remembrance of Agis, so that he would often ask her to tell him about her late husband, and used to listen with rapt attention while she explained the designs and projects of Agis.", "220": "For Kleomenes was as eager for honour, and had as noble a mind as Agis himself, and was equally moderate and simple in his way of life;", "221": "but he lacked the other'is discreet and gentle temper, and was of a stirring and vehement nature, eager to embark on any honourable enterprise.", "222": "He thought it the most glorious position of all to rule over an obedient people;", "223": "but he took pride also in bending disobedient subjects to his will, and forcibly compelling them to move in the path of honour.", "224": "II.", "225": "He was far from satisfied with the state of things at Sparta, where the citizens had given themselves up to luxuric us repose, while the king Leonidas cared nothing for public affairs, so long as he was able to gratify his own love of extravagance and self-indulgence.", "226": "Public virtue was entirely gone, and no man cared to profit his country, but only himself.", "227": "As for discipline, orderly training of the young, hardiness of body, and equality, all these things had perished with Agis, and it was not safe even to speak of them.", "228": "We are told that while yet a lad Kleomenes was instructed in the principles of the Stoic philosophy by Sphærus of Borysthenes,* who visited Lacedæmon and gave excellent instruction there to the young.", "229": "This Sphærus was one of the aptest pupils of Zono of Kitium,t and he seems to have admired the manly spirit of Kleomenes and to have encouraged him in the pursuit of honour.", "230": "The ancient hero Leonidas, when asked what he thought of Tyrtaeus, is said to have answered, \"He is good at exciting the minds of the youth.\"", "231": "Indeed they became filled with enthusiasm by the poems of Tyrtæus, and fought with reckless daring in battle:", "232": "and so also the Stoic philosophy often renders brave and fiery natures over-daring and venturesome, and yields the best fruit when applied to a grave and gentle nature.", "233": "III.", "234": "When after the death of Leonidas, Kleomenes succeeded to the throne, he found the state utterly dis­ organised, for the rich took no part in politics, and cared for nothing but their own pleasure and profit, while the miserable condition of the poor caused them to fight without spirit in the wars, and to neglect the proper training of their children.", "235": "He himself was a king only in name, as the Ephors had engrossed all real power.", "236": "Under these circumstances he at once began to revolve schemes of reform in his mind, and began to sound the opinion of his intimate friend Xenares, by enquiring of him what sort of a king Agis had been, and in what manner, and with what associates he had made his attempts at reform.", "237": "Xenares at first very willingly gave him a complete narrative of the whole transaction;", "238": "but as he saw that Kleomenes listened with intense interest, and was deeply excited by the recital of Agis's designs, to which he was never weary of listening, Xenares at last angrily reproached him with not being in his right mind, and at last broke off all intercourse with him.", "239": "He did not, however, tell any one the reason of their being at variance, but declared that Kleomenes knew well what it was.", "240": "Kleomenes, after meeting with this rebuff from Xenares, imagining that every one else would be of the same mind, determined to concert his own measures alone.", "241": "As he thought that there was more chance of effecting reforms during war than in time of peace, he involved Sparta in a war with the Achæans, for which they themselves furnished the pretext.", "242": "Aratus, the chief of the Achæans, had always desired to unite the whole of the Peloponnesus in one confederacy, and in all his long political career had steadily kept this object in view, as he thought that thus, and thus alone, the people of Peloponnesus would be able to defend themselves against external foes.", "243": "Nearly all the tribes of Peloponnesus joined his confederacy except the Lacedæmonians, the people of Elis, and such of the Arcadians as were under J acedæmonian influence.", "244": "On the death of Leonidas, Aratus began to make plundering expeditions into the territory of the Arcadians, especially those near the Achæan frontier, in order to see what steps the Lacedæ­ monians would take;", "245": "for he despised Kleomenes as a young and inexperienced man.", "246": "IV.", "247": "Upon this the Ephors first sent Kleomenes to occupy the temple of Athena, near Belbina.", "248": "This place was situated in a mountain pass leading into Laconia, and it was claimed by the citizens of Megalopolis as be­ longing to their territory.", "249": "Kleomenes seized the pass and fortified it, to which Aratus offered no objection, but endeavoured by a night march to surprise the cities of Tegea and Orchomenes.", "250": "However, the hearts of the traitors within the walls failed them, and so Aratus led his army back, hoping that his object had not been dis­ covered.", "251": "Kleomenes, by way of jest, now wrote him a letter affecting to enquire of him in the most friendly terms where he had been to in the night.", "252": "He answered that he had heard that Kleomenes was about to erect fortifications at Belbina, and had marched to prevent his doing so.", "253": "To this Kleomenes answered that he was satis­ fled that this had been Aratus's intention.", "254": "\" But,\" he continued, \" if you do not mind, please tell me why you brought scaling ladders and torches with you.\"", "255": "Aratus laughed at this home-thrust, and enquired what sort of a youth Kleomenes might be.", "256": "Damochares, the Lacedæmo­ nian exile, answered, \" If you mean to do anything against the Lacedæmonians, you must make haste and do it before this young gamecock's spurs are grown.\"", "257": "After this the Ephors ordered Kleomenes, who was encamped in Arcadia with a few horsemen and three hundred foot, to retire, as they feared to go to war.", "258": "But since, as soon as he had withdrawn, Aratus captured the city of Kaphyæ, they sent him back again.", "259": "He captured Methydrium, and overran Argolis, upon which the Achaeans sent an army of twenty thousand foot and a thousand horse, under the command of Aristomachus, to attack him.", "260": "Kleomenes met them near Pallantium, and was eager to fight, but Aratus, alarmed at his daring, would not permit the Achæan general to fight, and drew off his forces, incurring thereby the anger of the Achæans, and the ridicule and contempt of the Lacedæmonians, who only amounted to one-fifth of the enemy's numbers.", "261": "This affair gave Kleomenes great self-confidence, and parodying a saying of one of the ancient kings, he said to his countrymen that it was useless nowadays for the Lacedæmonians to ask either how many their enemies were, or where they were.*V. Shortly after, as the Achæans were making war against the Eleans, Kleomenes was sent to aid the latter, and met with the army of the Achæans returning home, near the mountain called Lykæum.", "262": "He attacked their forces, and utterly routed them, killing many and capturing numbers of prisoners, so that a report spread throughout Greece that Aratus himself had perished.", "263": "But Aratus, turning the disaster to good account, immediately after the defeat marched to Mantinoa, and as no one expected him, captured the city and placed a strong garrison in it.", "264": "This completely disheartened the Lacedæmonians, who desired to recall Kleomenes and put an end to the war.", "265": "Kleomenes now sent to Messene and invited back Archi­ damus, the brother of Agis, who ought to have been on the throne as the representative of the other royal family, imagining that if there were two kings reigning at Sparta at the same time, the power of the Ephors would be weakened.", "266": "However, the party who had previously murdered Agis perceived this, and as they feared that if Archidamus returned to Sparta he would make them pay the penalty of their crimes, they welcomed him back and assisted him to make a secret entry into the city, but immediately afterwards assassinated him, either against the will of Kleomenes, as we are told by Phylarchus, or else with his connivance, in consequence of the represen­ tations of his friends.", "267": "They indeed bore the chief blame in the matter, as they were thought to have forced Kleomenes into consenting to the murder.", "268": "VI. Kleomenes, determined to carry out his designs of reform, now proceeded to bribe the Ephors into sending him out on a new military expedition.", "269": "He also won over a considerable number of suppliers among the citizens by means of the lavish expenditure and influence of his mother Kratesiklea, who, though averse to a second mar­ riage, is said to have married one of the leading men in Sparta in order to further her son's interests.", "270": "Kleomenes now took the field at the head of his army, and captured a small town within the territory of Megalo­ polis, named Leuktra.*", "271": "The Achæans under Aratus promptly came up, and a battle was fought under the walls of the town, in which part of the army of Kleomenes was defeated.", "272": "Aratus however refused to follow up his advantage, and kept the main body of the Achæans motionless behind the bed of a torrent.", "273": "Enraged at his inaction, Lydiades of Megalopolis charged at the head of the cavalry under his own command, but got entangled in the pursuit of the enemy in ground which was cut up by walls and watercourses.", "274": "Seeing him thrown into dis­ order, Kleomenes sent his Tarentine and Cretan troops to attack him.", "275": "by whom Lydiades, fighting bravely, was overpowered and slain.", "276": "The Lacedæmonians now re­ covered their spirits, and with loud shouts attacked the Achæans and completely defeated them.", "277": "Many were slain, and their corpses were given up to the enemy for burial, with the exception of that of Lydiades, which Kleomenes ordered to be brought to himself.", "278": "He then attired it in a purple robe, placed a garland upon its head, and sent it to the city of Megalopolis.", "279": "This was that Lydiades who had been despot of Megalopolis, but who abdicated his throne, restored liberty to his countrymen, and brought the city to join the Achæan league.", "280": "VII.", "281": "After this victory Kleomenes became inspired with fresh confidence, and was convinced that if he only were allowed undisputed management he would easily conquer the Achæans.", "282": "He explained to his step-father Megistonous that the time had at length come for the abolition of the Ephors, the redistribution of property, and the establishment of equality among the citizens, after which Sparta might again aspire to recover her ancient ascendancy in Greece.", "283": "Megistonous agreed, and communicated his intentions to two or three of his friends.", "284": "It chanced that at this time one of the Ephors who was sleeping in the temple of Pasiphæ dreamed an extraordi­ nary dream, that in the place where the Ephors sat for the dispatch of business he saw four chairs removed, and one alone remaining, while as he wondered he heard a voice from the shrine say \"", "285": "This is best for Sparta.\"", "286": "When the Ephor related this dream to Kleomenes, he was at first much alarmed, and feared that the man had conceived some suspicion of his designs, but finding that he was really in earnest recovered his confidence.", "287": "Taking with him all those citizens whom he suspected to be opposed to his enterprise, he captured Heræa and Alsæa, cities belonging to the Achaean league, revictualled Orchomenus, and threatened Mantinea.", "288": "By long marches and counter- marches he so wearied the Lacedæmonians that at last at their own request he left the greater part of them in Arcadia, while he with the mercenaries returned to Sparta.", "289": "During his homeward march he revealed his intentions to those whom he considered to be most devoted to his person, and regulated his march so as to be able to fall upon the Ephors while they were at their evening meal.", "290": "VIII.", "291": "When he drew near to the city, he sent Eury­ kleidas into the dining-room of the Ephors, on the pretence of bringing a message from the army.", "292": "After Eurykleidas followed Phœbis and Therukion, two of the foster-brothers of Kleomenes, called mothakes * by the Lacedæmonians, with a few soldiers.", "293": "While Eurykleidas was parleying with the Ephors, these men rushed in with drawn swords and out them down.", "294": "The president, Agylæus, fell at the first blow and appeared to be dead, but contrived to crawl out of the building unobserved into a small temple, sacred to Fear, the door of which was usually closed, but which then chanced to be open.", "295": "In this he took refuge and shut the door.", "296": "The other four were slain, and some few per­ sons, not more than ten, who came to assist them.", "297": "No one who remained quiet was put to death, nor was any one prevented from leaving the city.", "298": "Even Agylæus, when he came out of his sanctuary on the following day, was not molested.", "299": "IX.", "300": "The Lacedæmonians have temples dedicated not only to Fear, but to Death, and Laughter, and the like.", "301": "They honour Fear, not as a malevolent divinity to be shunned, but because they think that the constitutions of states are mainly upheld by Fear.", "302": "For this reason, Aristotle tells us that the Ephors, when they enter upon their office, issue a proclamation ordering the citizens to shave the moustache and obey the laws, that the laws might not be hard upon them.", "303": "The injunction about shaving the moustache is inserted, I imagine, in order to accustom the young to obedience even in the most trivial matters.", "304": "It seems to me that the ancient Spartans did not regard bravery as consisting in the absence of fear, but in the fear of shame and dread of dishonour;", "305": "for those who fear the laws most are the bravest in battle;", "306": "and those who most fear disgrace care least for their own personal safety.", "307": "The poet was right who said \"Where there is fear, is reverence too :", "308": "\" and Homer makes Helen call Priam \"My father-in-law dear, Whom most of all I reverence and fear, while he speaks of the Greek army as obeying \"", "309": "Its chief's commanda in silence and with fear.\"", "310": "Human nature, indeed, leads most men to reverence those whom they fear;", "311": "and this is why the Lacedæmo­ nians placed the temple of Fear close to the dining-hall of the Ephors, because they invested that office with almost royal authority.", "312": "X.", "313": "On the following morning Kleomenes published a list containing the names of eighty citizens, whom he required to leave the country, and removed the chairs of the Ephors, except one, which he intended to occupy him­ self.", "314": "He now convoked an assembly, and made a speech justifying his recent acts.", "315": "In the time of Lykurgus, he said, the kings and the senate shared between them the supreme authority in the State;", "316": "and for a long time the government was carried on in this manner without any alteration being required, until, during the long wars with Messene, as the kings had no leisure to attend to public affairs, they chose some of their friends to sit as judges in their stead, and these persons acted at first merely as the servants of the kings, but gradually got all power into their own hands, and thus insensibly established a new power in the State.", "317": "A proof of the truth of this is to be found in the custom which still prevails, that when the Ephors send for the king, he refuses to attend at the first and second summons, but rises and goes to them at the third.", "318": "Asteropus, who first consolidated the power of the Ephors, and raised it to the highest point, flourished in comparatively recent times, many generations after the original establishment of the office.", "319": "If, he went on to say, the Ephors would have behaved with moderation, it would have been better to allow them to remain in existence;", "320": "but when they began to use their ill-gotten power to destroy the constitution of Sparta, when they banished one king, put another to death without trial, and kept down by terror all those who wished for the introduction of the noblest and most admirable reforms, they could no longer be borne.", "321": "Had he been able without shedding a drop of blood to drive out of Lacedæmon all those foreign pests of luxury, extravagance, debt, money-lending, and those two more ancient evils, poverty and riches, he should have accounted himself the most fortunate of kings, be­ cause, like a skilful physician, he had painlessly performed so important an operation upon his country:", "322": "as it was, the use of force was sanctioned by the example of Lykurgus, who, though only a private man, appeared in arms in the market-place, and so terrified King Charilaus, that he fled for refuge to the altar of Athena.", "323": "He, however, being an honest and patriotic man, soon joined Lykurgus, and acquiesced in the reforms which he introduced, while the acts of Lykurgus prove that it is hard to effect a revolu­ tion without armed force, of which he declared that he had made a most sparing use, and had only put out of the way those who were opposed to the best interests of Lace­ daemon.", "324": "He announced to the rest of the citizens that the land should be divided among them, that they should be relieved from all their debts, and that all resident aliens should be submitted to an examination, in order that the best of them might be selected to become full citizens of Sparta, and help to defend the city from falling a prey to Ætolians and Illyrians for want of men to defend her.", "325": "XI.", "326": "After this he himself first threw his inheritance into the common stock, and his example was followed by his father-in-law Megistonous, his friends, and the rest of the citizens.", "327": "The land was now divided, and one lot was assigned to each of those whom he had Vanished, all of whom he said it was his intention to bring back as soon as order was restored.", "328": "He recruited the numbers of the citizens by the admission of the most eligible of the Periœki to the franchise, and organised them into a body of four thousand heavy armed infantry, whom he taught to use the sarissa, or Macedonian pike which was grasped with both hands, instead of the spear, and to sling their shields by a strap instead of using a handle.", "329": "He next turned his attention to the education and discipline of the youth, in which task he was assisted by Sphærus.", "330": "The gymnasia and the common meals were soon re-established, and the citizens, for the most part willingly, resumed their simple Laconian habits of living.", "331": "Kleomenes, fearing to be called a despot, appointed his own brother, Eukleidas, as his colleague.", "332": "Then for the first time were two kings of the same family seen at once in Sparta.", "333": "XII.", "334": "As Kleomenes perceived that Aratus and the Achæans thought that while Sparta was passing through so perilous a crisis her troops were not likely to leave the country, he thought that it would be both a spirited and a useful act to displ ay the enthusiasm of his army to the enemy.", "335": "He invaded the territory of Megalopolis, carried off a large booty, and laid waste a large extent of country.", "336": "Finding a company of players on their road from Messene, he took them prisoners, caused a theatre to be erected in the enemy's country, and offered them forty minæ for a performance for one day, at which he himself attended as a spectator, not that he cared for the per­ formance, but because he wished to mock at his enemies, and to show by this studied insult the enormous supe­ riority of which he was conscious.", "337": "At this period his was the only army, Greek or foreign, which was not attended by actors, jugglers, dancing-girls, and singers;", "338": "but he kept it free from all licentiousness and buffoon­ ery, as the younger men were nearly always being practised in martial exercises, while the elders acted as their instructors;", "339": "and when they were at leisure they amused themselves with witty retorts and senten­ tious Laconian pleasantries.", "340": "The great value of this kind of discipline is described at greater length in the life of Lykurgus.", "341": "XIII.", "342": "In everything Kleomenes himself acttd as their teacher, and example, offering his own simple, frugal life, so entirely free from vulgar superfluities, as a model of sobriety for them all to copy;", "343": "and this added greatly to his influence in Greece.", "344": "For when men attended the courts of the other kings of that period they were not so much impressed by their wealth and lavish expenditure as they were disgusted by their arrogant, overbearing manners ;", "345": "but when they met Kleomenes, who was every inch a king, and saw that he wore no purple robes, did not lounge on couches and litters, and was not surrounded by a crowd of messengers, door-keepers, and secretaries, so as to be difficult of access, but that he himself, dressed in plain clothes, came and shook them by the hand, and conversed with them in a kindly and encouraging tone, they were completely fascinated and charmed by him, and declared that he alone was a true descendant of Herakles.", "346": "His dinner was usually served upon a very small Laconian table with three couches,.", "347": "but if he were entertaining ambassadors or foreigners two additional couches were added, and his servants somewhat improved his dinner, not by adding to it made-dishes and pastry, but by serving a greater abundance of food and a more liberal allowance of wine.", "348": "Indeed he blamed one of his friends, when he heard that when entertaining foreigners at dinner he had placed before them black broth and barley cakes :", "349": "for he said that in such matters, and when entertaining strangers, it was not well to be too rigidly Spartan.", "350": "After the table was removed a tripod was brought in which supported a bronze bowl full of wine, two silver pateræ, that held each about a pint, and a number of very small silver cups, from which any one drank who wished, for Kleomenes never forced men to drink against their will.", "351": "No recitations were performed for the amusement of the guests;", "352": "for he himself would lead the conversation and entertain them over their wine, partly by asking questions of them and partly by relating anecdotes to them:", "353": "for he well knew both how to make serious subjects interesting, and to be pleasant and witty without giving offence.", "354": "He was of opinion that the habit of other princes, of tempting men into their service by presents and bribes, was both clumsy and wicked ;", "355": "but he thought it peculiarly befitting a king to influence and captivate men's minds by the charm of his conversa­ tion, and was wont to say that a friend differed only from a mercenary soldier in that a man wins the one by the influence of his character and his conversation, and the other by his money.", "356": "XIV.", "357": "First of all the people of Mantinea made overtures to him.", "358": "They admitted him to their city by night, aided him to drive out the Achæan garrison, and placed them­ selves unreservedly in his hands.", "359": "He, however, restored them to the enjoyment of their own laws and original constitution, and marched away the same day to Tegea.", "360": "Shortly afterwards by a circuitous march through Arcadia he arrived before the Achæan city of Pheræ, desiring either to fight a battle with the Achæans, or to make Aratus incur the disgrace of retreating and leaving him in possession of the country:", "361": "for although Hyperbates was nominally in command, all real power over the Achæans was in the hands of Aratus.", "362": "The Achæans took the field with their entire force, and encamped at Dymæ, near the temple called Hekatombæon.", "363": "When Kleomenes arrived here he was unwilling to establish himself between the hostile city of Dymæ and the army of the Achæans, and challenged them, forced them to fight, and completely routed their phalanx.", "364": "He killed many, took a large number of prisoners, and then, marching to Langon, drove out the Achaean garrison, and restored the city to the Eleans.", "365": "XV.", "366": "As the Achæan power was now quite broken, Aratus, who was usually elected general every other year, refused to take office, and excused himself when they besought him to do so:", "367": "a dishonourable act, when the times became more stormy, to desert the helm, and give up his power to another.", "368": "Kleomenes at first used very moderate language to the Achæan ambassadors, but sent others ordering them to acknowledge him for their sovereign, and promising that if they did so he would do them no further hurt, and would at once restore the prisoners and fortresses which he had taken.", "369": "As the Achaeans were willing to accept these terms they invited Kleomenes to a conference at Lema.", "370": "It happened, however, that Kleomenes, after a long march, drank a quantity of cold water, which caused him to bring up much blood, and to lose his voice.", "371": "In consequence of this, although he sent back the most distinguished of his prisoners, he was obliged to postpone the conference, and went home to Lacedæmon.", "372": "XVI.", "373": "This mischance ruined Greece, which even now might have recovered herself, and avoided falling into the hands of the insolent and rapacious Macedonians.", "374": "For Aratus, either because he distrusted and feared Kleomenes, or else because he grudged him his success, and thought that after he had for thirty-three years been chief of the Achæans, it was not to be endured that a young man should overthrow him, and enter into the fruit of his labours, at first tried to oppose the Achæans when they offered to come to terms with the Lacedæmonians;", "375": "but as they would not listen to him, because they were cowed by the boldness of Kleomenes, and also admitted the justice of the Lacedæmonian claim to be the leading state in Peloponnesus, as their ancestral right, he adopted a course which was a disgraceful one for any Greek, but especially so for him, and one which was most unworthy of his former political life.", "376": "He determined to invite Anti­ gonus into Greece, and to fill the Pelopennesus with those very Macedonians whom he himself when a lad had chased out of the country by his capture of the Acro-Corinthus, although he was regarded with suspicion by all the kings, and was at variance with them all, and though he had already accused this very Antigonus himself of every con­ ceivable crime in his “Memoirs,” which are still extant.", "377": "Yet he himself has stated that he suffered much, and risked much to free Athens from a Macedonian garrison;", "378": "though now he led these very men with arms in their hands into his own native country, and up to his own paternal hearth.", "379": "He thought that Kleomenes, a descendant of Herakles, a king of Sparta, who had restored the simple ancient Dorian constitution of Lykurgus, as one tightens the relaxed strings of a lyre, to bring it into tune, was unworthy to be accounted the ruler of Sikyon and Tritaea;", "380": "and in his eagerness to avoid the rough Spartan cloak, and the Spartan barley bread, and that with which he especially charged Kleomenes, the destruction of wealth and the encouragement of poverty, threw himself and all Achæa with him, into the arms of the Macedonians, with all their diadems and their purple robes and their habits of oriental despotism.", "381": "That he might avoid acting under the orders of Kleomenes, he was content to offer sacrifice at festivals in honour of Antigonus, and himself to place a garland upon his head, and to lead the paean in praise of a man wasted and emaciated by consump­ tion.", "382": "And this I write, not from any desire to depreciate Aratus, for in many respects he proved himself a truly great and patriotic man, but rather out of pity for the weakness of human nature, which will not allow even the most eminent persons to present us with the spectacle of an entirely unblemished virtue.", "383": "XVII.", "384": "When the Achæans again assembled at Argos to hold a conference there, and Kleomenes started to go thither from Tegea, men's minds were full of hope that peace would be finally established.", "385": "But Aratus, who had already settled the main points of his treaty with Anti­ gonus, and feared that Kleomenes would either by per­ suasion or force bring the assembly over to his views, sent to him demanding either that he should take three hundred hostages for his safety and come to the conference alone, or else meet them with his army outside the walls at the gymnasium called the Kyllarabium.", "386": "Kleomenes on hearing this said that he had not been properly treated ;", "387": "for Aratus ought to have warned him of this at once, not have waited till he was almost at the gates of Argos and then expressed suspicions of his honesty of purpose and driven him away.", "388": "He sent a letter to the assembled Achæans, containing bitter invectives against Aratus, and as Aratus replied by maligning him in a public oration, he broke up his camp and sent a herald with a declaration of war, not to Argos, according to Aratus, but to Ægium, in order to take the Achæans by surprise.", "389": "The Achæan cities were all ripe for revolt, as the populace hoped for a redistribution of the land and cancelling of debts if they joined the Spartans, while the leading men were all jealous of the power and influence of Aratus, and some of them hated him as the traitor who was bringing the Macedonians into Peloponnesus.", "390": "Rely­ ing upon the prevalence of this feeling Kleomenes invaded Achaia, took Pellene by surprise, and drove out the garrison and the Achæan inhabitants.", "391": "Soon afterwards he captured the cities of Pheneus and Penteleum.", "392": "The Achaeans of Corinth and Sikyon now began to fear that his partisans were plotting to deliver up those cities to him, and in consequence sent their cavalry and foreign mercenaries away from Argos to guard those towns, while they themselves proceeded to Argos to hold the Nemean festival there.", "393": "Kleomenes, rightly judging that his ap­ pearance at a time when the city was full of a disorderly crowd of people who were come to attend the feasts and games would produce great confusion, marched up to the walls by night, seized the place called the ‘Shield,’ which is just above the theatre, and is very difficult of access, and so terrified the citizens that no one attempted to offer any resistance.", "394": "They willingly agreed to admit a Spartan garrison, to give twenty of their chief men as hostages for their loyalty, and to become the allies of the Lacedæ­ monians, acknowledging their supremacy.", "395": "XVIII.", "396": "This exploit added not a little to the reputation and power of Kleomenes.", "397": "None of the ancient kings of Sparta could ever make themselves masters of Argos, although they often attempted to do so;", "398": "and even that most brilliant general King Pyrrhus, though he forced his way into the city, could not take it, but perished, and with him a great part of his army.", "399": "For these reasons, the skill and audacity of Kleomenes were the more admired:", "400": "and those who had before ridiculed his attempts to bring back the days of Solon and Lykurgus by the cancelling of debts and redistribution of land, now became entirely convinced that these measures had been the cause of the revival of Sparta.", "401": "The Spartans before this had been so feeble and helpless, that the Ætolians invaded Laconia and carried off a booty of fifty thousand slaves, on which occasion it is said that an old Spartan observed that the enemy had greatly benefited Laconia by relieving it from its burdens.", "402": "Yet a short time after this, by the restoration of their former constitution, and by re-esta­ blishing the ancient system of training, they made as magnificent a display of discipline and valour as if Lykurgus himself were alive and at the head of affairs, for they gained for Sparta the first place in Greece, and won the whole of Peloponnesus by the sword.", "403": "XIX.", "404": "The submission of Argos to Kleomenes was soon followed by that of Phlius and Kleonæ.", "405": "During these events Aratus was at Corinth, busily engaged in search­ ing for the partisans of the Lacedæmonians.", "406": "When the news of the fall of these cities reached Corinth, as he observed that the city of Corinth was eager to join Kleomenes and leave the Achæan league, he summoned the citizens to meet in the public assembly, and himself made his way unperceived to the gate.", "407": "He had already sent his horse thither, and mounting, fled to Sikyon.", "408": "The Corinthians now hurried to Argos to surrender their city to Kleomenes;", "409": "in such haste, writes Aratus in his ‘Me­ moirs,' that they foundered all their horses.", "410": "Kleomenes reproached them for allowing Aratus to escape, but shortly afterwards sent Megistonous to him, asking him to hand over the citadel of Corinth, which was in possession of an Achaean garrison, and offering him a large sum of money.", "411": "He answered that the course of affairs was not in his power, but that he was rather in theirs.", "412": "These parti­ culars we have extracted from Aratus's own writings.", "413": "Kleomenes now marched from Argos to Corinth, receiving on the way the submission of Trœzene, Epidaurus, and Hermione.", "414": "As the garrison refused to surrender the citadel, he built a rampart round it, and sending for the friends and representatives of Aratus, bade them take charge of his house and property during his absence.", "415": "He now sent the Messenian Tritymallus to Aratus, with instructions to propose to him that the garrison of Acro- Corinthus should be composed partly of Spartan and partly of Achæan troops, while he himself privately offered him double the amount of the pension which he received from King Ptolemy of Egypt.", "416": "However, as Aratus refused to listen to his overtures, but sent his own son with the other hostages to Antigonus, and persuaded the Achæans to pass a decree to hand over the Acro- Corinthus to Antigonus, Kleomenes invaded the territory of Sikyon and laid it waste, and also took the property of Aratus when it was publicly presented to him by the people of Corinth.", "417": "XX.", "418": "When Antigonus crossed the Geranean mountains with a large force, Kleomenes did not think it necessary to guard the isthmus, but determined to fortify the mountains called Onea, and by holding that strong position, to protract the war and wear out the Macedonian force, rather than fight a pitched battle with their phalanx.", "419": "By this line of policy he reduced Antigonus to great straits;", "420": "for he had made no preparations for feeding his troops for more than a short time, and yet to force his way in over the isthmus was a difficult operation while Kleomenes barred the way.", "421": "An attempt which he made to steal through by Lechæum * at night was repulsed with considerable loss;", "422": "so that Kleomenes and his friends, elated by their victory, supped merrily together, while Antigonus was at his wit's end to know what to do.", "423": "He even began to meditate matching to the promontory of Heræum, and conveying his forces over the Corinthian gulf to Sikyon, an operation which would have required much time and many ships.", "424": "However, late in the evening there arrived certain friends of Aratus by sea from Argos, inviting him to come thither, as the Argives intended to revolt from Kleomenes.", "425": "The prime mover in this revolt was one Aristoteles, who easily prevailed upon the people to rise, because they were disappointed with Kleomenes, who had not cancelled all their debts as they hoped he would.", "426": "Aratus now took fifteen hundred of Antigonus's soldiers and proceeded by sea to Epidaurus.", "427": "Aristoteles however did not wait for his arrival, but led the citizens to attack the garrison in the citadel, assisted by Timoxenus with a body of Achæans from Sikyon.", "428": "XXI.", "429": "Intelligence of this movement reached Kleomenes about the second watch of the night.", "430": "He at once sent for Megistonous, and angrily ordered him at once to go to the assistance of the garrison of Argos;", "431": "for it was he who had so confidently assured Kleomenes of the loyalty of the Argives, and had dissuaded him from banishing those whom he suspected from the city.", "432": "Having detached Megistonous with two thousand men on this service, he himself turned his attention to Antigonus, and pacified the people of Corinth by assuring them that nothing had happened at Argos except a slight disturbance which would be easily suppressed.", "433": "However, as Megistonous was killed while forcing his way into the city, and the garrison were hard pressed, and kept sending messengers to Kleomenes begging for assistance, he, fearing that if the enemy gained Argos they might cut him off from Laconia, and sack the defenceless city of Sparta, withdrew his army from Corinth.", "434": "He lost this city at once, for Antigonus instantly entered it and placed a garrison in it.", "435": "He now proceeded to assault the city wall of Argos, and concen­ trated his troops for this purpose.", "436": "He broke through the vaults supporting the part of the city called the ‘Shield,' forced his way in, and joined his garrison, who were still holding out against the Achæans.", "437": "He now, by the use of scaling ladders, captured some of the strong places in the city, and cleared the streets of the enemy by means of his Cretan archers.", "438": "When however he saw Antigonus march­ ing down from the mountains to the plain with his phalanx in battle array, and saw the Macedonian cavalry pouring along towards the city, he despaired of success, and collecting all his troops into one mass, led them safely out of the city.", "439": "He had in a wonderfully short time effected great things, and had all but made himself master of the whole of Peloponnesus:", "440": "but now he lost it all as quickly as he had won it, for some of his allies at once deserted him, and many shortly afterwards surrendered their cities to Antigonus.", "441": "XXII.", "442": "As Kleomenes was marching into the city of Tegea at night-fall, on his return from this disastrous campaign, he was met by messengers bearing the news of a still greater calamity, the death of his wife Agiatis, of whom he was so fond that even when in the full tide of success he never would remain continuously with his army, but used constantly to return to Sparta to see her.", "443": "He was terribly grieved and cast down, as one would expect a young man to be on losing so beautiful and excellent a wife, yet he did not allow his noble spirit to be crushed by his sorrow, but without showing any outward signs of grief in his voice or countenance, continued to give his orders to his officers, and to take measures for placing Tegea in a posture of defence.", "444": "At daybreak next morn­ ing he returned to Lacedæmon, and after lamenting his misfortune with his mother and his children, began to consider by what policy he might save his country.", "445": "Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, now offered him assistance on the condition of receiving his mother and children as hostages.", "446": "For a long time he shrank from mentioning this proposal to his mother, and often conversed with her without having the courage to allude to it, until she sus­ pected that he had something on his mind, and inquired of his friends whether there was not some subject about which he hesitated to speak to her.", "447": "At last Kleomenes brought himself to mention Ptolemy's proposal to her.", "448": "On hearing it, she laughed loudly, and said, “This, then, is that which you have so long been fearing to tell me.", "449": "Pray place me and the children on board ship as soon as possible, and send us to any place where this body of mine may be useful to Sparta, before it be uselessly con­ sumed by old age at home.", "450": "\"When all was prepared for hei voyage, Kratesiklea pro­ ceeded to Tænarus escorted by Kleomenes with all his troops under arms.", "451": "Before embarking she retired alone with him into the temple of Poseidon, where, after em­ bracing him as he sorrowed at her departure, she said, “Now, king of the Lacedæmonians, take care when we come out that no one sees us weeping or doing anything unworthy of Sparta.", "452": "This lies in our own power;", "453": "but good or evil fortune befalls us according to the will of Heaven.", "454": "\"Saying thus, she fixed her eyes upon the ship, walked swiftly to it carrying the child, and bade the pilot start at once.", "455": "When she reached Egypt, as she heard that Ptolemy had received an embassy from Antigonus, and was told that although the Achæans wished to come to terms with him, he had feared on her account to make peace with them without consulting Ptolemy, she wrote to him bidding him act worthily of Sparta, and consult her interests, and not fear to displease Ptolemy because of what he might do to an old woman and an infant.", "456": "So great a spirit is she said to have shown in her misfortunes.", "457": "XXIII.", "458": "Antigonus now advanced, took Tegea, and allowed his troops to plunder Orchomenus and Mantinea.", "459": "Kleomenes, who was confined to the territory of Lace­ daemon, proceeded to emancipate all helots who could pay a sum of five Attic minæ for their freedom, by which means he raised a sum of five hundred talents.", "460": "He also organised a special corps of two thousand men, armed after the Macedonian fashion, with which he hoped to be able to meet the Leukaspids,* or white-shielded troops of Antigonus, and proceeded to attempt a wonderful and surprising feat of arms.", "461": "The city of Megalopolis at that time was itself quite as large and as powerful as Sparta, and had close at hand the army of the Achæans, and that of Antigonus himself, whom the people of Megalopolis had been especially eager to invite into Peloponnesus.", "462": "This city Kleomenes determined to pounce upon :", "463": "(no other word expresses the speed with which he surprised it).", "464": "He ordered his troops to provision themselves for five days, and led them to Sellasia, as though he intended to invade Argolis.", "465": "From Sellasia he marched into the territory of Megalopolis, halted at Rhœteum for supper, and thence proceeded along the road by Helikus straight towards Megalopolis.", "466": "When he was close to it he detached Panteus with two regiments to attack a part of the wall lying between two towers, which he had heard was often left unguarded, while he moved slowly forward with the main body.", "467": "Panteus not only found that spot, but a great extent of the city wall unguarded.", "468": "While he was engaged in throwing down the wall and killing those who attempted to defend it, Kleomenes came up, and was within the city with his army before the people of Megalopolis knew of his arrival.", "469": "XXIV.", "470": "When at last the inhabitants discovered the extent of their misfortune, some snatched up what they could and fled at once, while others got under arms and endeavoured to drive out the enemy.", "471": "In this they could not succeed, but they enabled the fugitives to escape unmolested, so that no more than a thousand souls remained in the city, as all the rest got safe with their wives and children to Messene.", "472": "Of those who offered resistance but a few were slain, and a very small number were taken prisoners, amongst whom were Lysandridas and Thearidas, the two most important persons in Megalopolis.", "473": "On this account the soldiers who took them brought them at once to Kleomenes.", "474": "Lysandridas, as soon as he saw Kleomenes at a distance, called out loudly to him, “King of the Lacedæmonians, now you have an opportunity to add to your glory by a deed even more noble and more worthy of a king than that which you have achieved!", "475": "”", "476": "Kleomenes, suspecting what he meant, asked, \" What do you mean, Lysandridas ?", "477": "do you bid me give you back your city ? \"", "478": "“That is what I bid you to do,\" answered Lysandridas;", "479": "“and I advise you not to ruin so great a city, but to fill it with friends and trusty allies, by restoring it to the people of Megalopolis, and becoming their saviour.\"", "480": "To this Kleomenes, after a short silence, replied, \"It is hard to believe this;", "481": "but let us ever prefer honour to profit.\"", "482": "Saying this he sent his prisoners to Messene, and a herald with them, who offered to restore the city to the people of Megalopolis, on the condition that they should desert the Achæans and become the friends and allies of the Spartans.", "483": "However, Philopœmen would not allow his countrymen to break their faith with the Achæans and accept this wise and generous offer.", "484": "He declared that Kleomenes did not intend to give them back their city, but wanted to get possession of them as well as of their city, and with violent abuse drove Thearidas and Lysandridas out of the Messenian country.", "485": "This was that Philopoemen who afterwards became the general of the Achaeans and won great distinction, as will be found in the life of him which I have written.", "486": "XXV.", "487": "When this answer was brought back to Kleo­ menes, who had hitherto carefully kept the city un­ harmed, and had not allowed any one to appropriate the most trifling article, be became furious with disappoint­ ment.", "488": "He plundered the city, sent all the statues and pictures to Sparta, utterly destroyed all the best part of the city, and returned home, for he feared Antigonus and the Achæans.", "489": "They, however, did not offer to attack him:", "490": "for they were engaged in holding a conference at Ægium.", "491": "Here Aratus ascended the tribune, and for a long time wept with his face hidden in his gown.", "492": "At last, as the others in wonder bade him tell them the cause of his grief, he said that Megalopolis had been ruined by Kleomenes.", "493": "On hearing this the assembly at once broke up.", "494": "The Achæans were terror-stricken at the sudden­ ness and importance of the blow, and Antigonus deter­ mined to proceed to the assistance of the people of Megalopolis, but as it took a long time to assemble his troops from their winter-quarters, he ordered them to stay where they were, and himself with a small force marched to Argos.", "495": "Kleomenes now engaged in a second enterprise, which appeared completely insane, but which is said by the historian Polybius to show consummate generalship.", "496": "As he knew that all the Macedonian troops were scattered over the country in winter-quarters, and that Antigonus with a few mercenary troops was spending the winter at Argos with his friends, he invaded the Argive territory, thinking that either he should shame Antigonus into a battle, and beat him, or else that if he did not dare to fight, the Argives would be disgusted with him.", "497": "And so it fell out.", "498": "The Argives, seeing their country spoiled by Kleomenes, were greatly enraged, and gathering to­ gether before the house in which Antigonus was lodging, excitedly called upon him either to fight or to resign his post as commander in-chief in favour of a better man.", "499": "But Antigonus, like a prudent general as he was, thought it more disgraceful to run foolish risks and incur unneces­ sary danger than to hear himself called hard names by the mob, and refused to leave the city, but stood constant in his original policy.", "500": "Kleomenes, after marching up to the gates of Argos, ostentatiously ravaged the country, and returned home unmolested.", "501": "XXVI.", "502": "Shortly afterwards, hearing that Antigonus had again advanced to Tegea, intending to invade Laconia by that route, Kleomenes quickly assembled his army, marched by a different road, avoiding Antigonus, and at day-break appeared near the city of Argus, where he ravaged the plain country, not reaping the corn, an invaders usually do, with sickles and swords, but beating down with great clubs, so that his soldiers in sheer sport as they marched along were able to destroy the whole crop without trouble.", "503": "When they reached the gymna­ sium of Kyllarabis some of the officers proposed to set it on fire;", "504": "but Kleomenes forbade it, saying that even in destroying Megalopolis he had been guided by anger rather than by honour.", "505": "Antigonus at first retired directly towards Argos, but afterwards occupied all the passes by which the Lacedæmonians could retreat.", "506": "Kleomenes affected to set him at defiance, and sent a herald to Argos to demand the keys of the temple of Hera (between Argos and Mycenæ), in order that he might offer sacrifice there before retiring.", "507": "After insulting the Argives by this ironical request, he offered sacrifice outside the temple, for the doors remained locked, and led away his army to Phlius.", "508": "From thence he marched to Mount Oligyrtus.", "509": "where he defeated the Macedonian troops who guarded the pass, and returned home by way of Orcho­ menus, having inspired his countrymen with hope and confidence, and having proved to his enemies that he was a consummate general, capable of conducting the most im­ portant operations.", "510": "It was indeed no small feat for him, with only the resources of one small state at his disposal, to make war against the power of Macedonia and all the cities of the Peloponnesus, with Antigonus for their paymaster, and not only to prevent the enemy's setting foot in Laconia, but to lay waste their country, and take such large and important cities from them.", "511": "XXVII.", "512": "However, he who first called money the sinews of war must have had this war in his mind.", "513": "So also Demades, when the Athenians wished to man a fleet at a time when they had no money, observed that they must make bread before they could make a voyage.", "514": "Archidamus, too, who was king of Sparta at the opening of the Peloponnesian war, when his allies asked him to fix the limit of their several contributions, answered that the consumption of war is unlimited.", "515": "For just as trained athletes in time overpower their antagonist in spite of his strength and skill, so Antigonus, having vast resource to draw upon, wearied out and overpowered Kleomenes, who had the greatest difficulty in paying his mercenary troops and feeding his countrymen.", "516": "In other respects the long duration of the contest was in Kleomenes's favour, as Antigonus had troubles at home which made the contest a more equal one.", "517": "The barbarians, in his absence, always overran and plundered the outskirts of the king­ dom of Macedonia, and at this period an army of Illyrians had invaded the country from the north, against whose depredations the Macedonians besought Antigonus to return and protect them.", "518": "The letter calling upon him to return was very nearly delivered to him before the decisive battle of the war;", "519": "and had he received it, he would no doubt have returned home at once and taken a long farewell of the Achaeans.", "520": "However, fortune, who delights to show that the most important events are decided by the merest trifles, caused the embassy with the letters for the recall of Antigonus to reach him just after the battle of Sellasia, in which Kleomenes lost his army and his country.", "521": "This makes the misfortune of Kleomenes yet more pitiable;", "522": "for if he had avoided a battle for two days longer, he never need have fought at all, as the Macedonians would have retreated, and left him to make what terms he pleased with the Achæans:", "523": "whereas, as has been explained, his want of money forced him to fight, and that too when, according to Polybius, he had only twenty thousand men to oppose to thirty thousand.", "524": "XXVIII.", "525": "In the battle he acted like a great general, and the Spartans fought with desperate courage, while the mercenary troops also behaved well;", "526": "but he was overpowered by the Macedonian armament and by the irresistible weight of their phalanx.", "527": "The historian Phylarchus says that Kleomenes was ruined by treachery, for Antigonus sent his Illyrians and Akarnanians to make a flank march and attack one of the enemy's wings, which was commanded by Eukleidas, the brother of Kleomenes, and there placed the rest of his army in battle array.", "528": "Kleomenes, who was watching the enemy from an emi.", "529": "nence, could not see the Illyrian and Akarnanian troops, and suspected some manoeuvre of the kind.", "530": "He sent for .", "531": "Damoteles, the chief of the Spartan secret-service,.", "532": "and ordered him to explore the ground on both flanks, and see that no attack was meditated in that direction.", "533": "As Damoteles, who is said to have been bribed by Antigonus, answered that all was well on the flanks, and that he bad better give his entire attention to the enemy in front, Kleomenes believed him, and at once charged the army of Antigonus.", "534": "The furious attack of the Spartans drove back the Macedonian phalanx, and Kleomenes forced it to retreat before him for a distance of about five stadia.", "535": "Then, as he found that his brother Eukleidas on the other wing was surrounded by the enemy, he halted, and looking towards him, said, “You are gone, my dearest brother;", "536": "you have fought bravely, and are a noble model to the Spartan youth, a noble theme for Spartan maidens' songs.\"", "537": "Then, as the entire division under Eukleidas was cut to pieces, and the victors attacked his own men, who were thrown into confusion and could no longer stand their ground, he escaped from the field as best he could.", "538": "It is said that many of the mercenaries were slain, and that of the Lacedæmonians, who were six thousand in all, only two hundred remained alive.", "539": "XXIX.", "540": "Kleomenes, when he reached Sparta, advised the citizens whom he met to submit to Antigonus, and declared that he himself, whether he lived or died, would do what was best for Sparta.", "541": "As he saw the women running up to those who had accompanied him in his flight, taking their arms from them and offering them drink, he retired into his own house, where his mistress, a girl of a good family of Megalopolis, whom he had taken to live with him after his wife’s death, came up to him as usual, and wished to attend upon him on his return from the wars.", "542": "But he would neither drink, although exces­ sively thirsty, nor sit down, weary though he was, but in his armour as he was took hold of one of the columns with his hand, leaned his face upon his elbow, and after resting a short time in this posture while he revolved in his mind every kind of plan, proceeded with his friends to Gythium.", "543": "Here they embarked on a ship which had been prepared in case of such a disaster, and sailed away.", "544": "XXX.", "545": "After the battle Antigonus advanced upon Sparta, and made himself master of the city.", "546": "He treated the Lace­ dæmonians with kindness, and offered no kind of insult to their glorious city, but permitted them to retain their laws and constitution, sacrificed to the gods, and on the third day withdrew, as he had learned that a terrible war was raging in Macedonia, and that his kingdom was being ravaged by the barbarians.", "547": "His health was already affected by a disease, which ended in consumption.", "548": "How­ ever, he bore up against it, and was able to die gloriously after having recovered his kingdom, won a great victory over the barbarians, and killed a great number of them.", "549": "Phylarchus tells us that he ruptured his lungs by shouting in the battle itself, and this seems the most probable account, but the common report at the time was that while shouting aloud after the victory, “0 happy day ! \" he brought up a vast quantity of blood and fell sick of a fever, of which he died.", "550": "Such was the fate of Antigonus.", "551": "XXXI.", "552": "Kleomenes sailed from Kythera to another island, named Ægialea.", "553": "As he was about to cross over from this place to Oyrene, one of his friends named Therykion, a brilliant warrior and a man of lofty, un­ bending spirit, said to him in private, “My king, we have lost the opportunity of falling by the noblest of deaths in the battle, although we publicly declared that Antigonus should never enter Sparta unless he first passed over the dead body of the king.", "554": "However, the course which is next to this in honour is still open to us.", "555": "Why should we recklessly embark on this voyage merely in order to exchange out- misfortunes at home for others in a distant country ?", "556": "If it be not disgraceful for the sons of Herakles to submit to the successors of Philip and Alexander, we shall save ourselves a long voyage by delivering ourselves up to Antigonus, who is probably as much better than Ptolemy as the Macedonians are better than the Egyptians.", "557": "If, on the other hand, we scorn to become the subjects of our conqueror, why should we become subject to one who has not conquered us, and so prove ourselves inferior to two men instead of one, by becoming the courtiers of Ptolemy as well as fleeing before Antigonus ?", "558": "Is it on account of your mother that we are going to Egypt ?", "559": "If so, you will indeed make a glorious appearance before her, and you will be much to be envied when she shows her son to the ladies of Ptolemy's court, an exile instead of a king.", "560": "While we are still masters of our own swords, and are still in sight of Laconia, let us put ourselves beyond the reach of further misfortunes, and make amends to those who died for Sparta at Sellasia, rather than settle our­ selves in Egypt, and inquire whom Antigonus has been pleased to appoint satrap of Lacedaemon ?", "561": "\"*To these remarks of Therykion Kleomenes answered, “Wretch, do you think that by suicide, the easiest way out of all difficulties, and one which is within every man's reach, you will gain a reputation for bravery, and will not rather be flying before the enemy more disgracefully than at Sellasia?", "562": "More powerful men than ourselves have ere now been defeated, either by their own evil for­ tune or by the excessive numbers of their enemy:", "563": "but the man who refuses to bear fatigue and misery, and the scorn of men, is conquered by his own cowardice.", "564": "A self­ inflicted death ought to be an honourable action, not a dishonourable means of escape from the necessity for action.", "565": "It is disgraceful either to live or to die for one­ self alone:", "566": "yet this is the course which you recommend, namely, that I should fly from my present misery without ever again performing any useful or honourable action.", "567": "I think that it is both your duty and mine, not to despair of our country :", "568": "for when all hope fails us, we can easily find means to die.\"", "569": "To this Therykion made no answer, but as soon as he had an opportunity left Kleomenes, sought a retired spot upon the beach, and killed himself.", "570": "XXXII.", "571": "Kleomenes sailed from Ægialea to Libya, where he was received with royal honours and conducted to Alexandria.", "572": "At his first interview Ptolemyt treated him with mere ordinary politeness, but when by conver­ sation with him he discovered his great abilities, and is the familiar intercourse of daily life observed the noble Spartan simplicity of his habits, and saw with how proud and unbroken a spirit he bore his misfortunes, he thought him a much more trustworthy friend than any of the venal throng of courtiers by whom he was surrounded.", "573": "Ptolemy felt real regret at having neglected so great a man, and allowed Antigonus to gain so much glory and power at his expense.", "574": "He showed Kleomenes great kindness and honour, and encouraged him by promising that he would place a fleet and a sum of money at his disposal, which would enable him to return to Greece and recover his throne.", "575": "He settled upon him a yearly allow­ ance of twenty-four talents, the most part of which he and his friends, who still retained their simple Spartan habits, distributed in charity among the Greek refugees who had found an asylum in Egypt.", "576": "XXXIII.", "577": "The elder Ptolemy died before he could accom­ plish his promise of attempting to restore Kleomenes to his throne;", "578": "and amidst the drunken licence of the court of his successor, the affairs of Kleomenes were entirely neglected.", "579": "The young king * was so given up to wine and women, that his soberest moments were spent in organising religious ceremonies in the palace, and in carrying a kettledrum in honour of the mother of the gods.", "580": "The whole of the public business of the kingdom was managed by Agathoklea, the king's mistress, her mother, and the brothel-keeper Œnanthes.", "581": "Yet even here it seems that the assistance of Kleomenes was needed, for the king, fearing his brother Magas, who through his mother had great influence with the army, attached him­ self in a special manner to Kleomenes, and made him a member of his own secret council, desiring to make use of him to kill his brother.", "582": "Kleomenes, although every one in the court bade him do this, refused, saying that it would rather be his duty, if it were possible, to raise up more brothers for the king, to strengthen and confirm his throne.", "583": "When Sosibius, the most powerful of the king's favourites, said that the mercenary troops were not to be depended upon while Magas was alive, Kleomenes an swered that he might be quite easy on that score, for more than three thousand of the mercenaries were Pelo­ ponnesians, and at the slightest sign from him would seize their arms and rally round him.", "584": "This speech was thought at the time to be a great proof of the loyalty of Kleomenes, and gave the courtiers a great idea of his power;", "585": "but afterwards, as Ptolemy's weakness of character produced cowardice, and after the manner of empty-headed men he began to think it safest to suspect every one, these words made the courtiers fear Kleomenes, as having a dangerous power over the mercenaries;", "586": "and many of them were wont to say, \"This man moves among us like a lion among a flock of sheep.\"", "587": "Indeed the demeanour of Kleomenes in the Egyptian palace, as he calmly and quietly watched the course of events, naturally suggested this simile.", "588": "XXXIV.", "589": "Kleomenes gave up asking for a fleet and an army;", "590": "but hearing that Antigonus was dead, and that the Achæans were involved in a war with the Ætolians, while his presence was imperatively demanded at home, as all Peloponnesus seemed to be going to ruin, he desired to be sent home alone with his friends.", "591": "However, he could persuade no one to accede to this request, as the king thought of nothing but his concubines and his revels, and Sosibius, upon whom devolved the whole conduct of affairs, although he knew that Kleomenes would be dan­ gerous and hard to manage if kept in Egypt against his will, yet feared to set at large so daring and enterprising a man, who had gained a thorough insight into the utter rottenness of the Ptolemaic dynasty.", "592": "For Kleomenes could not be bribed into remaining quiet, but as the bull * sacred to Apis, although he is abundantly fed and supplied with every luxury, yet longs to frisk and range about as nature intended, so he cared for none of their effeminate pleasures, \"but wore his soul away\" like Achilles, “Idling at home, though eager for the fray.", "593": "\"XXXV.", "594": "While his affairs were in this posture, there arrived at Alexandria one Nikagoras, a Messenian, who pretended to be a friend to Kleomenes, but really hated him bitterly, because he had once sold him a fair estate, but had never received the money, either because Klec­ menes intended to cheat him, or because he was unable to pay him on account of the wars.", "595": "As this man was dis­ embarking from his ship, Kleomenes, who happened to be walking upon the quay, saw him, and at once warmly greeted him, and inquired what business had brought him to Egypt.", "596": "Nikagoras returned his salutation with equal friendliness, and said that he had brought over some fine horses for the king's use in the wars.", "597": "At this Kleomenes laughed, and said, “I had rather you had brought singing- girls or beautiful boys, for they are what please the king best.\"", "598": "Nikagoras listened to this remark with a smile, but a few days afterwards he reminded Kleomenes of the estate which he had bought, and asked him to pay the price, saying that he would not have pressed for it if he had not sustained losses on his cargo.", "599": "As Kleomenes replied that all his pension from the king was spent, Nikagoras in a rage repeated to Sosibius the sarcasm which he had used.", "600": "Sosibius was much pleased to hear of it, but as he wished to have some graver matter of which to accuse him to the king, he persuaded Nikagoras to write a letter before he left Egypt, accusing Kleomenes of a design to make himself master of Cyrene, if the king put him in possession of a fleet and army.", "601": "Nikagoras wrote the letter, and sailed away to Greece;", "602": "and after forty days Sosibius took the letter and showed it to Ptolemy, as though he had just received it.", "603": "By this means he so wrought upon the young king's mind, that he confined Kleomenes in a large house, and placed a guard before all the doors, although he continued to allow him his pension as before.", "604": "XXXVI.", "605": "This treatment was in itself sufficiently grievous to Kleomenes, and made him fear that something worse was in store.", "606": "Now Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermes, who was a friend of the king's, had always been on good terms with Kleomenes, and they had been in the habit of conversing familiarly together.", "607": "This man now, at Kleo­ ment s's own request, came to see him, and talked amicably with him, explaining away all which had appeared sus­ picious about the king's conduct.", "608": "As he was leaving the house, without noticing that Kleomenes had followed him to the door, he harshly reproved the guard for keeping such careless watch over so great and savage a monster.", "609": "Kleomenes himself heard him say this, and before Ptolemy observed him, retired and told his friends what he had heard.", "610": "They at once abandoned all hope, and fiercely determined to avenge themselves on Ptolemy for his wickedness and arrogance, and die as became Spartans, not wait to be butchered like fat cattle.", "611": "They thought that it was intolerable that Kleomenes should have dis­ dained to make terms with Antigonus, who was a soldier and a man of action, and should sit waiting for the pleasure of a timbrel-playing king, who as soon as he was at leisure from his kettle-drummings and revellings, intended to murder him.", "612": "XXXVII.", "613": "As soon as they had formed this resolution, as it happened that Ptolemy had gone to Canopus, they spread a report that the king had given orders for the guard to be removed.", "614": "Next, observing the custom of the kings of Egypt, which was to send a dinner and various presents to those who are about to be released from confinement, the friends of Kleomenes prepared many presents of this kind and sent them to him, deceiving the guard, who believed that they had been sent by the king.", "615": "Kleomenes offered sacrifice, and gave the soldiers on guard an ample share of the meat, while he himself put on a garland and feasted with his friends.", "616": "It is said that they proceeded to action sooner than had been originally intended, because Kleomenes perceived that one of the servants who was in the plot had left the house, though he had only gone to visit his mistress.", "617": "Fearing that he meant to denounce them, as soon as it was noon, and the guard were sleeping off their wine, Kleomenes put on his tunic, slit up the seam over the right shoulder, seized his naked sword, and sallied forth with his friends similarly arrayed, thirteen in all.", "618": "One of them named Hippitas, who was lame, came boldly out with the rest, but finding that they proceeded slowly to enable him to keep up with them, begged them to kill him, and not spoil their plot by waiting for a useless man.", "619": "It happened that one of the Alexandrians was leading a horse past the door;", "620": "they at once took it, placed Hippitas on its back, and ran quickly through the streets, calling upon the populace to rise and set itself free.", "621": "The people, it appears, had spirit enough to admire Kleomenes, but no one dared to follow or help him.", "622": "Three of the conspirators met Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermes, coming out of the palace, and killed him:", "623": "and when another Ptolemy, the governor of the city, drove towards them in a chariot, they rushed to meet him, scattered his body-guard, dragged him out of the chariot and killed him.", "624": "They now made their way to the citadel, intending to break open the prison and make use of the prisoners to swell their numbers;", "625": "but the guardians of the prison had closed the gates effectually before they arrived, and Kleomenes, failing in this attempt, roamed through the city without finding any one to join him, as all fled in terror at his approach.", "626": "At last he stopped, and said to his friends, \" No wonder women bear rule in a city where men fear to be free.\"", "627": "He now bade them all end their lives worthily of him and of themselves.", "628": "First of all Hippitas, at his own request, was struck dead by one of the younger men;", "629": "after which, each man deliberately and fearlessly inflicted upon himself a mortal stab, with the exception of Panteus, who had been the first to break into the city of Megalopolis.", "630": "This man, the handsomest and best warrior of all the Spartan youth, was especially loved by the king, and was ordered by him to wait till all the rest were dead, and then to put an end to his life.", "631": "When they had all fallen, Panteus pricked each man with his dagger, to make certain that none of them were alive.", "632": "When he pricked Kleomenes in the ankle he saw his face contract.", "633": "He kissed him and sat down beside him until he was quite dead, and then, embracing the corpse, killed himself upon it.", "634": "XXXVIII.", "635": "Thus perished Kleomenes, after having reigned over Sparta for thirteen years, as described above.", "636": "The news of his death was soon bruited abroad, and Kratesiklea, although a woman of high spirit, was so overcome by her misfortune that she embraced the children and wept for Kleomenes.", "637": "Upon this the eldest boy leaped up, and before any one knew what he was going to do, threw himself headlong from the roof of the house.", "638": "He was much hurt, but not killed, and was taken up, crying out and reproaching his friends because they would not allow him to die.", "639": "When Ptolemy heard the news, he ordered the corpse of Kleomenes to be flayed and exposed on a gibbet, and his children, his mother, and her atten­ dants to be put to death.", "640": "Among these was the wife of Panteus, the fairest and noblest-looking of them all.", "641": "She and her husband had only recently been married when their misfortunes began.", "642": "When Panteus left Sparta she wished to accompany him, but her parents would not allow her to do so, and locked her up in their house.", "643": "But she shortly afterwards procured a horse and a little money, and made her escape by night.", "644": "She rode all the way to Taenarum, where she found a ship about to sail to Egypt, on board of which she crossed the sea, joined her husband, and cheerfully shared his exile.", "645": "She now, when the soldiers came to lead away Kratesiklea, took her by the hand, held up the train of her dress, and bade her be of good courage;", "646": "although Kratesiklea herself was not afraid to die, but only asked one favour, that she might die before her children.", "647": "When they arrived at the place of execution, the children were first killed before the eyes of Kratesiklea, and then she herself.", "648": "All she said was :", "649": "“My children, whither have you come ? \"", "650": "The wife of Panteus, being a tall and robust woman, girded up her robe, and arranged each of the corpses as decently as her means permitted.", "651": "After she had paid the last offices to each of them she prepared herself for death, bared her neck, allowed no one to approach her but the executioner, and died like a heroine, without requiring any one to arrange her corpse.", "652": "Thus the modesty which she had observed throughout her life, did not desert her even when the was dead.", "653": "XXXIX.", "654": "Thus gloriously, even during its last days, did Lacedæmon, whose women are taught to vie with men in courage, prove that virtue is superior to Fortune.", "655": "A few days afterwards, those who were watching the body of Kleomenes as it hung upon the gibbet, observed a large snake which wound its body round his head and covered his face, so that no ravenous bird could alight upon it.", "656": "On hearing this, the king was struck with superstitious terror, fearing that he had offended the gods by the murder of one who was evidently a favourite of Heaven, and something more than mortal.", "657": "All the ladies of his court began to offer sacrifices of atonement for his sin, and the people of Alexandria went to the place and worshipped Kleomenes as a hero and child of the gods, until they were restrained by the learned, who explained that as from the corrupted bodies of oxen are bred bees, from horses wasps, and from asses beetles, so human bodies, by the melting and gathering together of the juices of the marrow, produce serpents.", "658": "This was observed by the ancients, who therefore considered that of all animals the serpent was peculiarly appropriated to heroes.", "659": "I. HAVING finished the first History,.", "660": "it remains to con­ template equal calamities in the pair of Roman Lives, in a comparison of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus with Agis and Kleomenes.t Tiberius and Caius were the sons of Tiberius Gracchus,* who was censor and twice consul, and celebrated two triumphs, but was still more distin­ guished for his personal character, to which he owed the honour cf having for his wife Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio,* the conqueror of Hannibal, whom he married after Scipio's death, though Tiberius had not been a friend of Scipio, but rather a political opponent.", "661": "A story is told that Tiberius once caught a couple of snakes t in his bed, and the diviners, after consulting on the matter, told him that he must not kill both nor yet let both go;", "662": "as to the male, they said, if it were killed, the death of Tiberius would follow, and if the female were killed, Cornelia would die.", "663": "Now Tiberius, who loved his wife and thought it would be more suitable for him to die first, as he was an elderly man and his wife was still young, killed the male snake and let the female go;", "664": "and he died no long time after, leaving twelve children by Cornelia, Cornelia undertook the care of her family and her hus­ band's property, and showed herself so prudent, so fond of her children, and of so exalted a character, that Tiberius was judged to have done well in dying in place of such a wife.", "665": "And though Ptolemæus,* the king of Egypt, in­ vited Cornelia to share his crown, and wooed her for his wife, she refused the offer and continued a widow.", "666": "All her children died before her, except one daughter, who married the younger Scipio,† and two sons, of whom I am going to speak, Tiberius and Caius, who were brought up by their mother so carefully that they became, beyond dispute, the most accomplished of all the Roman youth, which they owed, perhaps, more to their excellent educa­ tion than even to their natural good qualities.", "667": "II.", "668": "Now as the figures of the Dioscuri,* whether sculp­ tured or painted, though resembling one another, still present such an amount of difference as appears when we contrast a boxer with a runner, so in these two youths, with all their resemblance in courage, temperance, generous temper, eloquence, and magnanimity, yet great contrasts also in their actions and polity blossomed forth, so to speak, and displayed themselves, which I think it well to set forth.", "669": "First in the character and expression of his countenance, and in his movements, Tiberius was mild and sedate;", "670": "Caius was animated and impetuous.", "671": "When Tiberius harangued the people, he would stand composedly on one spot;", "672": "but Caius was the first Roman who moved about on the rostra t and pulled his toga from his shoulder while he was speaking, as Kleon ‡ the Athenian is said to have been the first popular orator at Athens who threw his cloak from him and struck his thigh.", "673": "The manner of Caius was awe-striking and vehemently impassioned;", "674": "the manner of Tiberius was more pleading and calculated to stir the sympathies:", "675": "the language of Tiberius was pure and elaborated to great nicety ;", "676": "that of Caius was persuasive and exuberant.", "677": "In like manner, in his mode of life and his table, Tiberius was frugal and simple;", "678": "compared with others, Caius was moderate and austere, but, contrasted with his brother, luxurious and curious, as we see by Drusus charging him with buying silver dolphins* at the price of twelve hundred and fifty drachmæ for every pound that they weighed.", "679": "The differences in their character corresponded to their respective styles of speaking :", "680": "Tiberius was moderate and mild;", "681": "Caius was rough and impetuous, and it often hap­ pened that in his harangues he was carried away by passion, contrary to his judgment, and his voice became shrill, and he fell to abuse, and grew confused in his dis­ course.", "682": "To remedy this fault, he employed Licinius, a well-educated slave, who used to stand behind him when he was speaking, with a musical instrument,t such as is used as an accompaniment to singing, and whenever he observed that the voice of Caius was becoming harsh and broken through passion, he would produce a soft note, upon which Caius would immediately moderate his vehemence and his voice, and become calm.", "683": "III.", "684": "Such were the contrasts between the two brothers, but in courage against the enemy, in justice to the subject nations, in vigilance in the discharge of public duties, and in self-control over indulgence, they were both alike.", "685": "Tiberius was the elder by nine years, a circumstance which caused their political career to be separated by an interval, and greatly contributed to the failure of their measures, for they did not rise to eminence at the same time nor unite their strength in one effort, which from their union, would have been powerful and irresistible.", "686": "I must accordingly speak of each separately, and of the elder first.", "687": "IV.", "688": "Immediately on attaining man's estate, Tiberius had so great a reputation that he was elected a member of the college of augurs,.", "689": "rather for his excellent qualities than his noble birth.", "690": "Appius Claudius,t a man of consular and censorian rank, who in consideration of but with rather too much heat, his dignity was appointed Princeps Senatus,* and in loftiness of character surpassed all his contemporaries, showed his opinion of Tiberius;", "691": "for when the augurs were feasting together, Appius addressed Tiberius with many expressions of friendship, and solicited him to take his daughter to wife.", "692": "Tiberius gladly accepted the proposal, and the agreement was forthwith made.", "693": "As Appius was entering the door on his return home, he called out to his wife in a loud voice, \" Antistia, I have given our daughter Claudia to wife.\"", "694": "Antistia in surprise replied, “What is the need or the hurry, unless you have got Tiberius Grac­ chus for her husband ? ” I am aware that some writers tell this story of Tiberius the father of the Gracchi and of Scipio Africanus;", "695": "but the majority have the story as I give it, and Polybius † says that after the death of Scipio Africanus, his kinsmen selected Tiberius to be the hus­ band of Cornelia, and that she had neither been given in marriage nor betrothed by her father in his lifetime.", "696": "Now the younger Tiberius served in the army in Africa ‡ with the second Scipio,* who had married his sister, and by living in the general'is tent he soon learned his character, which exhibited many and great qualities for virtuous emulation and practical imitation.", "697": "Tiberius, also, soon surpassed all the young soldiers in attention to discipline and in courage;", "698": "and he was the first to mount the enemy's wall, as Fannius † says, who also asserts that he mounted the wall with Tiberius and shared the honour with him.", "699": "While he was in the army Tiberius won the affection of all the soldiers, and was regretted when he went away.", "700": "V.", "701": "After that expedition he was elected quæstor, ‡ and it fell to his lot to serve in that capacity under the consul Caius Mancinus,§ no bad man, but the most unlucky of Roman generals.", "702": "Accordingly in adverse fortune and critical affairs the prudence and courage of Tiberius became the more conspicuous, and not only his prudence and courage, but what was truly admirable, his considera­ tion and respect for his general, whose reverses almost made him forget who he was.", "703": "Having been defeated in several great battles, Mancinus attempted to leave his camp by night and make a retreat.", "704": "The Numantines, however, perceived his movements, and immediately seizing the camp, fell on the Romans in their flight and killed those in the rear;", "705": "and at last, when they were surrounding the whole army and driving them to un­ favourable ground, from which escape was impossible, Mancinus, despairing of all chance of saving himself by resistance, sent to treat for a truce and terms of peace.", "706": "But the Numantines declared that they would trust nobody except Tiberius, and they bade Mancinus send him.", "707": "The Numantines had come to this resolution as well from a knowledge of the young man's character, for there was much talk about him in this campaign, as from the remembrance of his father Tiberius, who, after carrying on war against the Iberians and subduing many of them, made peace with the Numantines, and always kept the Roman people to a fair and just observance of it.", "708": "Accord­ ingly Tiberius was sent, and had a conference with the Numantines, in which he got some favourable conditions, and, by making some concessions, obtained a truce, and thus saved twenty thousand Roman citizens, besides the slaves and camp-followers.", "709": "VI.", "710": "All the property that was taken in the camp be­ came the booty of the Numantines;", "711": "and among it were the tablets of Tiberius, which contained the entries and accounts of his administration as quæstor.", "712": "Being very anxious to recover them, though the army had already advanced some distance, he returned to the city with three or four companions, and calling forth the magistrates of Numantia, he begged to have back his tablets, in order that his enemies might not have an opportunity of ca­ lumniating him if he should not be able to give an account of his administration of the public money.", "713": "The Numan­ tines were pleased at the opportunity of doing him a service, and invited him to enter the city;", "714": "and when he stood hesitating, they came near and clung to his hands, and were urgent in entreating him not to consider them as enemies any longer, but as friends, and to trust them.", "715": "Tiberius determined to do so, as he was very anxious to get the tablets, and feared to irritate the Numantines if he should seem to distrust them.", "716": "When he had entered the city, the first thing they did was to prepare an enter­ tainment, and to urge him most importunately to sit down and eat with them.", "717": "They afterwards gave him back the tablets, and bade him take anything else he liked.", "718": "Tiberius, however, would have nothing except the frankincense which he wanted for the public sacrifices, and after a friendly embrace he took his leave of them.", "719": "VII.", "720": "On his return to Rome, the whole transaction was greatly blamed as dishonourable and disgraceful to Rome.", "721": "The kinsfolk and friends of the soldiers, who were a large part of the people, crowded about Tiberius, charging the general with the disgraceful part of what had hap­ pened, and declaring that Tiberius had been the saviour of so many citizens.", "722": "Those who were the most vexed at the events in Iberia,* recommended that they should follow the example of their ancestors ;", "723": "for in former times the Romans stripped of their clothes and delivered up to the Samnites* those who had purchased their safety on dishonourable terms, both the generals and all who had any share or participation in the treaty, quæstors and tribunes all alike, and on their heads they turned the violation of the oaths and the infraction of the agreement.", "724": "It was on this occasion particularly, that the people showed their affection and zeal towards Tiberius:", "725": "for they decided to deliver up the consul, stripped and in chains, to the Numantines, but they spared all the rest on account of Tiberius.", "726": "It appears that Scipio also, who was then the most powerful man in Rome, gave his assistance in this matter, but never­ theless he was blamed for not saving Mancinus, and not making any exertion to ratify the treaty with the Numan­ tines, which had been concluded by his relation and friend Tiberius.", "727": "But whatever difference there was between Scipio and Tiberius on this occasion, perhaps originated mainly in jealousy and was owing to the friends of Tiberius and the sophists, who endeavoured to prejudice him against Scipio.", "728": "There was, however, no irreconcilable breach made between them, and no bad result from this affair;", "729": "indeed, it seems to me that Tiberius would never have been in­ volved in those political measures which cost him his life, if Scipio Africanus had been at Rome while they were going on.", "730": "But it was while Scipio was carrying on the war at Numantia* that Tiberius commenced his legisla­ tion, to which he was led from the following motives.", "731": "VIII.", "732": "Whatever territory the Romans acquired from their neighbours in war, they sold part, and retaining the other part as public property,!", "733": "they gave it to the poorer citizens to cultivate, on the payment of a small sum to the treasury.", "734": "But as the rich began to outbid the poor, and so to drive them out, a law was passed which forbade any one to have more than five hundred jugera of land.", "735": "This law restrained the greediness of the rich for a short time, and was a relief to the poor, who remained oil the land which they had hired, and cultivated the several portions which they originally had.", "736": "But in course of time their rich neighbours contrived to transfer the holdings to themselves in the names of other persons, and at last openly got possession of the greater part of the public lands in their own names, and the poor, being expelled, were not willing to take military service and were careless about bringing up families, in consequence of which there was speedily a diminution in the number of freemen all through Italy, and the country was filled with ergastula* of barbarian slaves, with whom the rich cultivated the lands from which they had expelled the citizens.", "737": "Now Caius Lælius,† the friend of Scipio, attempt­ ed to remedy this mischief, but he desisted through fear of the disturbances that were threatened by the opposition of the rich, whence he got the name of wise or prudent, for such is the signification of the Roman word “sapiens.\"", "738": "Tiberius, on being elected tribune, ‡ immediately undertook the same measures, as most say, at the instigation of the orator Diophanes and the philosopher Blossius.§", "739": "Diophanes was an exile from Mitylene:", "740": "Blossius was an Italian from Cumæ, and had been an intimate at Rome with Antipater of Tarsus, who had done him the honour of dedicating to him some of his philosophical writings.", "741": "Some give part of the blame to Cornelia also, the mother of Tiberius, who frequently reproached her sons that the Romans still called her the mother-in-law of Scipio, but not yet the mother of the Gracchi.", "742": "Others say that jealousy of one Spurius Postumius,* a contemporary of Tiberius, and a rival of his reputation as an orator, was the immediate motive:", "743": "for it is said that when Tiberius returned to Rome from his military service, he found that Postumius had far out-stripped him in reputation and influence, and seeing the distinction that Postumius had attained, he determined to get the advantage over him by engaging in measures which were attended with hazard, but promised great results.", "744": "But his brother Caius in a certain book has recorded, that as Tiberius was passing through Tyrrhenia (Tuscany), on his road to Numantia, he observed the de­ serted state of the country, and that the cultivators and shepherds were foreign slaves and barbarians;", "745": "and that he then for the first time conceived those political measures which to them were the beginning of infinite calamities.", "746": "But the energy and ambition of Tiberius were mainly ex­ cited by the people, who urged him by writing on the porticoes, the walls, and on the tombs, to recover the public land for the poor.", "747": "IX.", "748": "He did not, however, draw up the law without assistance, but took the advice of the citizens most eminent for character and reputation, among whom were Crassus* the pontifex maximus, Mucius Scævola,† the jurist, who was then consul, and Claudius Appius, his father-in-law.", "749": "Never was a measure directed against such wrong and aggression conceived in more moderate and gentle terms;", "750": "for though the rich well deserved to be punished for their violation of law and to be compelled to surrender under penalties the land which they had been illegally enjoying, the law merely declared that they should give up their unjust acquisitions upon being paid the value of them, and should allow the lands to be occupied by the citizens who were in want of this relief.", "751": "Though the reform of this abuse was so moderate and reasonable, the people were satisfied to take no notice of the past and to secure themselves against wrong for the future.", "752": "But the rich and those who had possessions detested the proposed law because of their greediness, and the proposer of it was the object of th eir indignation and jealousy ;", "753": "and accord­ ingly they attempted to divert the people from the measure, by insinuating that Tiberius was proposing a division of land merely to disturb the state and to bring about a revolution.", "754": "But they failed altogether;", "755": "for Tiberius, supporting a measure in itself honourable and just, with an eloquence- calculated to set off even a meaner subject, showed his power and his superiority over his opponents, whenever the people were crowded round the rostra and he addressed them about the poor.", "756": "“The wild beasts of Italy,\" he would say, “had their dens and holes and hiding-places, while the men who fought and died in defence of Italy enjoyed, indeed, the air and the light, but nothing else:", "757": "houseless and without a spot of ground to rest upon, they wander about with their wives and children, while their commanders, with a lie in their mouth, exhort the soldiers in battle to defend their tombs and temples against the enemy, for out of so many Romans not one has a family altar or ancestral tomb, but they fight to maintain the luxury and wealth of others, and they die with the title of lords of the earth,t without possessing a single clod to call their own.\"X. Such language as this, proceeding from a lofty spirit and genuine feeling, and delivered to the people, who were vehemently excited and roused, none of the enemies of Tiberius attempted to refute.", "758": "Abandoning, therefore, all idea of opposing him by words, they addressed themselves to Marcus Octavius,* one of the tribunes, a young man of sober and orderly disposition, and a companion and friend of Tiberius.", "759": "At first Octavius, from regard to Tiberius, evaded the proposals, but being urged and importuned by many of the powerful nobles,† and as it were, driven to it, he set himself in opposition to Tiberius, and prevented the passing of the law.", "760": "Now all the power is virtually in the hands of the dissentient tribune, for the rest can do nothing if a single tribune oppose them.", "761": "Irritated at this, Tiberius withdrew his moderate measure and introduced another, more agreeable to the people and more severe against the illegal possessors of land;", "762": "this new measure ejected persons out of the lands which they had got possession of contrary to exist­ ing laws.", "763": "There was a daily contest between him and Octavius at the rostra, but though they opposed one another with great earnestness and rivalry, it is said they never uttered a disparaging word against one another, and that no unbecoming expression ever escaped either of them against the other.", "764": "It is not, then, in bacchanalian revelries* only, as it seems, but also in ambitious rivalry and passion, that to be of noble nature and to have been well brought up, restrains and governs the mind.", "765": "Tiberius, observing that Octavius himself was obnoxious to the law and possessed a considerable tract of the public land, begged him to desist from his opposition, offering to pay him the value of the land out of his own purse, though he was by no means in affluent circumstances.", "766": "Upon Octavius rejecting the proposal, Tiberius by an edict forbade all the other magistrates to transact any public business until the people had voted upon his law;", "767": "and he placed his private seals on the temple of Saturn,t that the quæstors might not be able to take anything out of it or pay anything in, and he.", "768": "gave public notice that a penalty would be imposed on the prætors if they dis­ obeyed;", "769": "in consequence of which all the magistrates were afraid and ceased from discharging their several functions.", "770": "Upon this the possessors changed their dress and went about the Forum in a piteous and humble guise, but in secret they plotted against Tiberius and endeavoured to procure assassins to take him off;", "771": "in consequence of which, Tiberius, as everybody knew, wore under his dress a short sword, such as robbers use, which the Romans call dolo.*XI.", "772": "When the day came and Tiberius was calling the people to the vote, the voting-urns† were seized by the rich and the proceedings were put into great confusion.", "773": "However, as the partisans of Tiberius, who had the su­ periority in numbers, were collecting in order to make resistance, Manlius.", "774": "and Fulvius, both consular men, falling down at the knees of Tiberius, and clinging to his hands with tears, begged him to desist.", "775": "Tiberius, seeing that matters were near coming to extremities, and from regard to the men also, asked them what they would have him do;", "776": "to which they replied, that they were not com­ petent to advise on so important a matter, and they urged him to refer it to the senate, and at last he consented.", "777": "The senate met, but did nothing, owing to the opposition of the rich, who had great influence in the body;", "778": "upon which Tiberius had recourse to the uncon­ stitutional and violent measure of depriving Octavius of his office, finding it impossible to put his proposed law to the vote in any other way.", "779": "In the first place, he publicly entreated Octavius, addressing him affection ately and clinging to his hands, to yield to and gratify the people, who asked for nothing but their rights, and would only get a small matter in return for great dangers and sufferings.", "780": "Octavius rejected this proposition;", "781": "upon which Tiberius reminded him that both of them were magistrates and were contending with equal power on a weighty matter, and that it was.", "782": "not possible for this struggle to continue without coming to open hostility;", "783": "that he saw no remedy except for one of them to give up his office;", "784": "and he bade Octavius put it to the people to vote on his case first, and said that he would imme­ diately descend to the station of a private man, if the citizens should desire it.", "785": "As Octavius refused this pro­ posal also, Tiberius said that he would put the question about Octavius retiring from the tribunate to the people, if Octavius did not change his resolution.", "786": "XII.", "787": "Thus ended the assembly of that day.", "788": "On the following day Tiberius mounted the rostra and again endeavoured to persuade Octavius;", "789": "but as he would not yield, Tiberius proposed a law by which Octavius should be deprived of his tribunate, and he forth w ith sum­ moned the citizens to vote upon it.", "790": "Now, there were five and thirty tribes,.", "791": "and when seventeen of them had already given their vote, and the addition of one more tribe would reduce Octavius to a private condition, Tiberius stopped the voting, and again entreated Octavius, embracing him in the presence of the people and urgently praying him not to be careless about being deprived of his office, and not to bring on him the blame of so severe and odious a measure.", "792": "It is said that Octavius was not entirely untouched or unmoved by these en­ treaties, and his eyes were filled with tears and he was silent for some time.", "793": "But when he looked to the rich and the possessors, who were standing together in one body, through fear of losing their good opinion, as it seems, he boldly determined to run every risk, and he told Tiberius to do what he pleased.", "794": "Accordingly the law was passed, and Tiberius ordered one of his freedmen to drag Octavius from the rostra, for Tiberius employed his own freedmen as officers ;", "795": "a circumstance which made the spectacle of Octavius dragged from the rostra with contumely still more deplorable.", "796": "At the same time the people made an assault on Octavius, and though the rich all ran to his assistance and disengaged him from their hands, it was not without difficulty that he was rescued and made his escape from the mob.", "797": "But one of his faith­ ful slaves, who had placed himself in front of his master to defend him, had his eyes torn out.", "798": "This violence was quite contrary to the wishes of Tiberius, who, on seeing what was going on, speedily made his way to the dis­ turbance.", "799": "XIII.", "800": "The law about the land was now immediately carried, and triumviri* were appointed for ascertaining its bounds and distributing it;", "801": "the triumviri were Tiberius, and his father-in-law Claudius Appius, and Caius Gracchus, his brother, who, however, was not at Rome, but serving under Scipio against Numantia.", "802": "All this Tiberius accomplished quietly without any opposition, and he also procured to be elected tribune in the room of Octavius, not a person of rank, but one Mucius t a client ‡ of his own.", "803": "The nobles, who were vexed at all these measures and feared the growing power of Tiberius, treated him in the senate with contumely;", "804": "and upon his asking, according to custom, for a tent from the treasury for his use while he was distributing the land, they refused it to him, though others had often had one allowed them on less important occasions;", "805": "and they only gave him for his expenses nine oboli§ a day, which was done on the motion of Publius Nasica,|| who entered violently into the opposition against Tiberius, for he was in possession of a very large amount of public land, and was greatly annoyed at being forcibly ejected from it.", "806": "But the people now became still more violent.", "807": "A. friend of Tiberius happened to die suddenly, and sus­ picious marks immediately showed themselves on the body.", "808": "The people cried out that he was poisoned, and collecting in great numbers at the funeral, they carried the bier and stood by while the body was burnt.", "809": "And the suspicion of poison appeared to have some reason, for the body burst on the pile and sent forth such a quantity of corrupt humours as to quench the flame;", "810": "and though a light was again applied, the body would not burn till it was removed to another place, where, after much trouble, the fire at last laid hold of it.", "811": "Upon this Tiberius, with the view of exciting the people still more, changed his dress, and showing his children to the people, begged that they would protect them and their mother, for he now despaired of his own safety.", "812": "XIV.", "813": "On the death of Attalus * Philometor, Eudemus of Pergamum brought his will to Home, in which the Roman people were made the king's heir.", "814": "In order to please the people, Tiberius promulgated a law to the effect that as soon as the king's treasures were received, they should be distributed among those who had assignments of land, in order to enable them to stock the farms and to assist them in their cultivation.", "815": "With respect to the cities included within the kingdom of Attains, he said that the senate had no right to decide about them, but he would bring the subject before the popular assembly.", "816": "This measure gave violent offenoo to the senate, and Pompeius t getting up, said that he lived near Tiberius, and so knew that Eudemus of Pergamum had given a diadem out of the royal treasures and a purple robe to Tiberius, who designed to make himself king in Rome.", "817": "Quintus Metellus ‡ reproached Tiberius by reminding him, that whenever his father, during his censorship, was returning home from supper, the citizens used to put out the lights for fear it might be supposed that they were indulging too much in entertainments and drinking, but that the most insolent and needy of the citizens accompanied Tiberius with lights at night.", "818": "Titus Annius,* who was not a man of good repute or sober behaviour, but in any contest of words by way of question and answer was con­ sidered to be unequalled, challenged Tiberius to answer definitely whether he had or had not branded with infamy his brother tribune, though by the law he was sacred and inviolable.", "819": "As the question was received with signs of approbation, Tiberius, hastily quitting the senate-house, convoked the people and ordered Annius to be brought before them, with the intention of accusing him.", "820": "But Annius, who was much inferior to Tiberius both in eloquence and reputation, had recourse to his tricks, and called on Tiberius to answer a few questions before he began his speech.", "821": "Tiberius assented, and as soon as there was silence, Annius said, \" If you intend to deprive me of my rank, and disgrace me, and I appeal to one of your brother tribunes, and he shall come to my aid, and you shall then fall into a passion, will you deprive him of his office ?”", "822": "On this question being put, it is said that Tiberius, though no man was readier in words or bolder in action, was so confused that he made no reply.", "823": "XV.", "824": "For the present Tiberius t dissolved the assembly, seeing that his proceedings with respect to Octavius were not liked either by the nobles or the people, for they considered that the high and honourable dignity of the tribunate, which had been kept unimpaired up to that time, had been destroyed and trampled upon.", "825": "He made an harangue to the people, a few of the arguments of which it will not be out of place to mention, for the purpose of showing the persuasive eloquence and the subtlety of the man.", "826": "He said that a tribune was sacred and inviolate, only because he was dedicated to the people and was the guardian of the people.", "827": "If then a tribune should deviate from his duty and wrong the people, abridge their power and deprive them of the opportunity of voting, he had by his own act deprived himself of his rank, by not fulfilling the conditions on which he received it.", "828": "Now we must consider a tribune to be still a tribune, though he should dig down the Capitol and burn the naval arsenal.", "829": "If he should commit such excesses as these, he is a bad tribune;", "830": "but if he should attempt to deprive the people of their power, he is not a tribune at all.", "831": "And is it not a monstrous thing if a tribune shall have power to order a consul to be put in prison, and the people shall not be able to deprive a tribune of his power when he is using it against the people who gave it to him?", "832": "for both tribune and consul are equally chosen by the people.", "833": "Now the kingly office, besides compre­ hending within it all civil power, is consecrated to the divinity by the discharge of the chief ceremonials of reli­ gion ;", "834": "and yet the state ejected Tarquinius for his wrong- doing, and for the violence of one man the ancient power which established Rome was overthrown.", "835": "And what is there at Rome so sacred, so venerated as the virgins who guard the ever-burning fire ?", "836": "but if any of them offends, she is buried alive;", "837": "for when they sin against the gods, they no longer retain that inviolable sanctity which they have by being devoted to the gods.", "838": "In like manner, neither has a tribune when he is wronging the people any right to retain the inviolable character which he receives from the people, for he is destroying the very power which is the origin of his own power.", "839": "And indeed, if he has legally received the tribunitian power by the votes of a majority of the tribes, how is it that he cannot even still more legally be deposed by the vote of all the tribes ?", "840": "Now, nothing is so sacred and inviolable as things dedicated to the gods;", "841": "but yet no one has ever hindered the people from using such things, moving them, and changing their places as they please.", "842": "It is therefore legal for the people to transfer the tribunate, as a consecrated thing, from one man to another.", "843": "And that the tribunate is not an inviolable thing, nor an office of which a man cannot be divested, is clear from this that many magis­ trates have abdicated their office and prayed to be excused from it of their own free will.", "844": "XVI.", "845": "Such were the heads of the justification of Tiberius.", "846": "His friends, seeing the threats of his enemies and their combination, thought that he ought to be a candidate for the tribunate for the next year;", "847": "and Tiberius attempted to strengthen his popularity by promising to carry new measures,.", "848": "such as a diminution of the period of military service, an appeal to the people from the judices, an intermixture of an equal number of the Equites with the Senators, from whom alone the judices were then taken;", "849": "and in every way he attempted to abridge the power of the Senate, influenced rather by passion and ambition, than justice and the interests of the state.", "850": "While the voting was going on, the friends of Tiberius, seeing that their enemies were gaining the advantage, for all the people were not present,t at first attempted to prolong the time by abusing the other tri­ bunes, and next they dissolved the meeting and appointed it for the following day.", "851": "Tiberius, going down to the Forum, supplicated the citizens in humble manner and with tears in his eyes;", "852": "he then said that he feared his enemies would break into his house by night and kill him, and thus he induced a great number of the citizens to take their station about his house and watch there all night.", "853": "XVII.", "854": "At daybreak the man came to bring the birds which the Romans use in their auspices, and he threw them food.", "855": "But the birds would not come out of the basket­ with the exception of one, though the man shook it hard;", "856": "and even this one would not touch the food, but after raising its left wing and stretching out a leg it ran back to the basket.", "857": "This reminded Tiberius of another omen that had happened.", "858": "He had a helmet which he wore in battle, elaborately worked and splendid.", "859": "Some snakes had got into the helmet unobserved, and laid their eggs and hatched them there.", "860": "This made Tiberius still more uneasy about the signs from the fowls.", "861": "Nevertheless he advanced up the city on hearing that the people was assembled about the Capitol;", "862": "but before he got out of the house he stumbled over the threshold, and the blow was so violent that the nail of his great too was broken, and the blood ran out through his shoe.", "863": "He had not got far before some crows were seen fighting on the roof of a house on the left hand, and though a great crowd was passing by, as was natural on such an occasion, a stone which was pushed off by one of the crows fell by the feet of Tiberius.", "864": "This made even the boldest of his adherents hesitate;", "865": "but Blossius of Cumæ, who was present, said it would be a shame and a great disgrace if Tiberius, a son of Gracchus and a grandson of Scipio Africanus, and a defender of the Roman people should not obey the summons of the people for fear of a crow, and that his enemies would not treat this cowardly act as a matter of ridicule, but would make it the ground of calumniating him to the people as playing the tyrant and treating them with contempt.", "866": "At the same time many persons ran up to Tiberius with a message from his friends in the Capitol, to hasten there, as all was going on favourably.", "867": "And indeed everything promised well at first, for as soon as he appeared he was greeted with friendly cheers, and as he ascended the Capitol he was joyfully received, and the people crowded about him to prevent any stranger from approaching.", "868": "XVIII.", "869": "Now, Mucius began to summon the tribes again, but nothing could be conducted with the usual forms on account of the confusion that prevailed among those who were on the outskirts of the assembly, where they were struggling with their opponents, who were attempting to force their way in and mingle with the rest.", "870": "At this juncture Flavius Flaccus,* a senator, posted himself in a conspicuous place, and as it was not possible to make his voice heard so far, he made a signal with his hand that he wished to say something in private to Tiberius.", "871": "Tiberius bade the crowd let Flaccus pass, who, with great difficulty making his way up to Tiberius, told him that the Senate was sitting, that as they could not pre­ vail on the consul, the rich were resolving to kill Tiberius themselves, and that they had armed many of their slaves and friends for this purpose.", "872": "XIX.", "873": "Upon Tiberius reporting this to those who were standing about him, they forthwith tucked up their dress, and breaking the staves which the officers use to keep the crowd back, distributed the fragments among them and made ready to defend themselves against their assailants.", "874": "While those at a distance were wondering at what was going on, and asking what it meant, Tiberius touched his head with his hand, since his voice could not be heard, intending thereby to signify to the people that his life was in danger.", "875": "His enemies on seeing this ran to the Senate and told them that Tiberius was asking for a crown, and that his touching his head was a proof of it.", "876": "On this the whole body was greatly disturbed ;", "877": "Nasica entreated the consul- to protect the state and put down the tyrant.", "878": "The consul however answered mildly that he would not be the first to use violence, and that he would not take any citizen's life without a regular trial;", "879": "if how­ ever, he said, the people should come to an illegal vote at the instigation of Tiberius, or from compulsion, he would not respect any such decision.", "880": "Upon this Nasica springing up exclaimed, “ Well then, as the consul betrays the state, do you who wish to maintain the laws follow me.\"", "881": "As he uttered these words he drew the skirt of his dress over his head, and hastened to the Capitol;", "882": "and the senators who followed him, wrapping their dress about them with one hand, pushed all the people they met out of the way, no one opposing them, from respect to their rank, but taking to flight and trampling down one another.", "883": "The followers of the senators had clubs and sticks which they had brought from home;", "884": "but the senators seizing the fragments and legs of the benches which were broken by the people in their hurry to escape, made right to Tiberius, and struck all those who were in their road.", "885": "The people were all put to flight or killed.", "886": "As Tiberius was attemp­ ting to make his escape, some one laid hold of his dress, on which he dropped his toga and fled in his tunic;", "887": "but he stumbled over some persons who were lying on the ground and was thrown down.", "888": "While he was endeavour­ ing to rise, he received the first blow, as it is universally admitted, from Publius Satyreius, one of his colleagues, who struck him on the head with the leg of a bench.", "889": "Lucius Rufus claimed the credit of giving him the second blow, as if that were a thing to be proud of.", "890": "Above three hundred persons lost their lives by sticks and stones, but none by the sword.", "891": "XX.", "892": "This is said to have been the first disturbance at Rome since the abolition of the kingly power, which ended in bloodshed and the death of citizens.", "893": "All previous disputes, though they were neither trifling nor about trifling matters, were settled by mutual concession:", "894": "the nobles yielded through fear of the people, and the people yielded from respect to the Senate.", "895": "Even on this occasion it is probable that Tiberius would have given way to persuasion without any difficulty, and still more readily if his assailants had not come to bloodshed and blows, for those about him were not above three thousand in number.", "896": "But the combination against him seems to have proceeded rather from the passion and hatred of the rich citizens, than from the reasons which they alleged;", "897": "and the brutal and indecent treatment of his dead body is a proof of this.", "898": "For they would not listen to his brother's request * to take up the body and bury it at night, but it was thrown into the Tiber with the other bodies.", "899": "And this was not all;", "900": "they banished some of his friends with­ out trial, and others they seized and put to death, among whom was Diophanes the orator.", "901": "One Caius Villius t they shut up in a vessel with snakes and vipers, and thus he died.", "902": "Blossius of Cumæ, being brought before the consuls and questioned about what had passed, admitted that he had done everything at the bidding of Tiberius.", "903": "On Nasica asking ‡ him, \" What if Tiberius had told you to burn the Capitol ? ”", "904": "Blossius said, that Tiberius would never have given him any such order.", "905": "The same question being often put to him, and by several persons, he said, \" If he had commanded me to burn the Capitol, it would have been a good deed for me to do;", "906": "for Tiberius would not have given such an order unless it were for the interest of the people.\"", "907": "Blossius, however, was set at liberty, and afterwards went to Aristonikus § in Asia, on the ruin of whose affairs he killed himself.", "908": "XXI.", "909": "The Senate, under present circumstances, en­ deavoured to soothe the people;", "910": "they made no opposition to the distribution of the public land, and they allowed the people to elect another commissioner in place of Tiberius.", "911": "Having come to a vote, they elected Publius Crassus * a relation of Gracchus, for his daughter Licinia was the wife of Caius Gracchus.", "912": "Cornelius Nepos,t indeed, says that Caius did not marry the daughter of Crassus, but the daughter of Brutus t who triumphed over the Lusitanians:", "913": "however, the majority of writers state the matter as I have done.", "914": "Now, as the.", "915": "people were sore about the death of Tiberius, and were manifestly waiting for an opportunity to be revenged, and N asica § was threatened with prosecu­ tions, the Senate, fearing for his safety, made a decree for sending him to Asia, though they had nothing for him to do there.", "916": "For when men met Nasica they did not conceal their hostility, but broke out into violence, and abused him wherever they fell in with him, calling him accursed, and tyrant, who had stained with the blood of an inviolable and sacred functionary the most sacred and revered of all the holy places in the city.", "917": "Accordingly, Nasica left Italy, though bound by the most sacred functions, for he was Pontifex Maximus;", "918": "and, rambling about despised from place to place, he died no long time after in the neighbour­ hood of Pergamum.", "919": "It is no wonder if Nasica was so much hated by the people, when even Scipio Africanus, whom the Romans considered inferior to no man in integrity, and loved as well as any, narrowly escaped losing the popular favour, because, on receiving the news of the death of Tiberius, at Numantia, he exclaimed in the verse of Homer, So perish * all who do the like again.", "920": "Subsequently, when Caius and Fulvius asked him, before an assembly of the people, what he thought of the death of Tiberius, he showed by his answer that he was not pleased with the measures of Tiberius.", "921": "This made the people interrupt him with their shouts when he was speaking, as they had never done before;", "922": "and Scipio was so far transported with passion as to break out into invectives against them.", "923": "But of this I have spoken more particularly in the Life of Scipio.", "924": "†I. CAIUS GRACCHUS at first, either through fear of hit enemies or with the view of making them odious, with­ drew from the Forum * and kept quiet at home, like a man humbled for the present, and intending for the future to keep aloof from public affairs;", "925": "which gave occasion for some people to say that he disliked the measures of Tiberius, and had abandoned them.", "926": "He was also still quite a youth, for he was nine years younger than his brother, and Tiberius was not thirty t when he was killed.", "927": "But in the course of time, as his character gradually displayed itself in his aversion to indolence, luxury, wine, and all matters of private profit, and it was clear, from his application to the study of eloquence, that he was preparing, as it were, his pinions for public life, and that he would not remain quiet;", "928": "and further, when he showed by his defence of Vettius, one of his friends, who was under prosecution, the people all around him being wild and frantic with delight, that the rest of the orators were mere children, the nobles were again alarmed, and there was much talk among them that they would not allow Caius to obtain the tribunate.", "929": "It happened without any set design that the lot fell on him to go as quæstor to Sardinia,.", "930": "under Orestes t the consul, which pleased his enemies, and was not disagreeable to Caius.", "931": "For he was fond of war, and equally disciplined for military service and speaking in the courts of justice;", "932": "but he still shrunk from public affairs and the Rostra, and as he could not resist the invitations of the people and his friends, he was well pleased with this opportunity of leaving Rome.", "933": "It is true it is a common opinion that Caius was a pure demagogue, and much more greedy of popular favour than Tiberius.", "934": "But it was not so in fact, and Caius seems to have been involved in public affairs rather through a kind of necessity than choice.", "935": "Cicero the orator also says that Caius declined all offices, and had determined to live in retirement, but that his brother appeared to him in a dream,‡ and said, “ Caius, why do you linger ?", "936": "There is no escape:", "937": "one life for both of us, and one death in defence of the people is our fate.\"", "938": "II.", "939": "Now,", "940": "Caius during his stay in Sardinia exhibited his excellent qualities in every way ;", "941": "he far surpassed all the young men in military courage, in upright conduct to the subject people, in loyalty and respect to the commander;", "942": "and in temperance, frugality, and attention to his duties he excelled even his elders.", "943": "The winter having been severe and unhealthy in Sardinia, the general demanded clothing for his soldiers from the cities, upon which they sent to Rome to pray to be relieved from this imposition.", "944": "The Senate granted their petition, and ordered the general to get supplies for the troops by other means;", "945": "but as the general was unable to do this, and the soldiers were suffer­ ing, Caius went round to the cities and induced them voluntarily to send clothing and to assist the Romans.", "946": "This, being reported to Rome, made the Senate uneasy, for they viewed it as a preliminary to popular agitation.", "947": "Ambassadors also arrived at Rome from Libya, with a message from King Micipsa,* that the king had sent corn to the commander in Sardinia, out of respect for Caius Gracchus.", "948": "The Senate, taking offence at the message, would not receive the ambassadors, and they passed a decree that fresh troops should be sent out to replace those in Sardinia, but that Orestes should stay;", "949": "intending by this measure to keep Caius there also, in respect of his office.", "950": "On this being done, Caius immediately set sail in a passion, and appearing at Rome contrary to all expecta­ tion, was not only blamed by his enemies, but even the people considered it a strange thing for the quæstor to leave his general behind.", "951": "However, when the matter was brought before the Censors,† he asked for permission to make his defence, and he produced such a change in the opinions of his audience, that he was acquitted, and con­ sidered to have been exceedingly ill used:", "952": "he said that he had served in the army for twelve years, while others were only required to serve ten years, and that he had exercised the functions of quæstor to the commander for three years, though the law allowed him to return after one year's service;", "953": "he added that he was the only soldier who took out a full purse with him and brought it back empty, while the rest took out with them only jars of wine, which they had emptied in Sardinia, and brought them back full of gold and silver.", "954": "III.", "955": "After this, his enemies brought fresh charges against him, and harassed him with prosecutions on the ground of causing the defection of the allies and having participated in the conspiracy which had been detected at Fregellæ.*", "956": "But he cleared himself of all suspicion, and having established his innocence, immediately set about canvassing for the tribunate.", "957": "All the men of distinction, without exception, opposed him ;", "958": "and so great a multitude flocked to Rome from all parts of Italy, to the Comitia, that many of them could not find lodgings, and the Campus Martiust being unable to contain the numbers, they shouted from the house-tops and tilings.", "959": "However, the nobility so far prevailed against the people as to disappoint the hopes of Caius, inasmuch as he was not returned first, as he expected, but only fourth.", "960": "But upon entering on his office he soon made himself first, for he surpassed every Roman in eloquence,t and his misfortunes gave him a licence for speaking freely when lamenting the fate of his brother.", "961": "He took every opportunity of directing the thoughts of the people to this subject, reminding them of former times, and contrasting the conduct of their ancestors, who went to war with the Falisci on behalf of Genucius, a tribune, who had been insulted by them, and condemned Caius Veturius to death because he was the only man that did not make way for a tribune as he was passing through the Forum. “", "962": "But before your eyes,\" he exclaimed, “ these men beat Tiberius to death with staves, and his body was dragged through the midst of the city to be thrown into the Tiber;", "963": "and all his friends who were caught were put to death without trial.", "964": "And yet it is an old usage among us, if a man is accused of a capital charge and does not appear, for a trumpeter to come to the door of his house in the morning and summon him by the sound of the trumpet, and the judices cannot vote upon the charge till this has been done.", "965": "So circumspect and careful were the Romans of old in the trials of persons accused.\"", "966": "IV.", "967": "Having first stirred up the people by such harangues as these (and he had a very loud voice, and was most vigorous in speech), he promulgated two laws:", "968": "* one, to the effect that if the people had deprived any magistrate of his office, he should be incapacitated from holding office a second time;", "969": "and the other, which rendered a magistrate liable to a public prosecution if he had banished any citizen without trial.", "970": "One of these rogations had the direct effect of branding with infamy Marcus Octavius, who had been deprived of the tribunate by Tiberius;", "971": "and Popillius * came within the penalties of the other, for during his prætorship he had banished the friends of Tiberius.", "972": "Popillius did not stand his trial, and he fled from Italy;", "973": "but the other law Caius himself withdrew, saying that he refrained from touching Octavius at the request of his mother Cornelia.", "974": "The people admired his conduct on this occasion, and gave their consent, for they respected Cornelia no less for the sake of her sons than her father;", "975": "and afterwards they set up a bronze statue t of her, with the inscription—Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi.", "976": "There are recorded several things that Caius said in defence of his mother in a rhetorical and coarse way, in reply to one of his enemies.", "977": "“ What,\" said he, “ do you abuse Cornelia, the mother of Tiberius?\"", "978": "And as the man laboured under the imputation of being a dissolute fellow, he added, “ How can you have the impudence to compare yourself with Cornelia?", "979": "Have you been a mother, as she has?” —and more to the like effect, but still coarser.", "980": "Such was the bitterness of his language, and many like things occur in his writings.", "981": "V.", "982": "Of the laws ‡ which he promulgated with the view of gaining the popular favour and weakening the Senate, one was for the establishment of colonies and the diRtribu­ tion of Public Land among the poor;", "983": "another provided for supplying the soldiers with clothing at the public expense, without any deduction on this account being made from their pay, and exempted youths under seventeen years of age from being drafted for the army;", "984": "a third was in favour of the allies, and put the Italians on the same foot­ ing as the citizens with respect to the suffrage;", "985": "another related to grain, and had for its object the lowering of the price for the poor ;", "986": "the last related to the judices, a measure which most of all encroached on the privileges of the senate-for the senate alone supplied judices for the trials, and this privilege rendered that body formidable both to the people and the equites.", "987": "The law of Gracchus added three hundred equites to the senate, who were also three hundred in number, and it made the judices eligible out of the whole six hundred.", "988": "In his endeavours to carry this law he is said to have made every exertion;", "989": "and in particular it is recorded that all the popular leaders who preceded him turned their faces to the senate and the comitium while they were speaking, but he was the first who turned his face the other way to the Forum while haranguing the people, and he continued to do so;", "990": "and by a small deviation and alteration in attitude he stirred a great question, and in a manner transformed the govern­ ment from an aristocratical to a democratical form, by this new attitude intimating that the orators should direc­ their speeches to the many and not to the senate.", "991": "VI.", "992": "The people not only passed this law, but empowered Gracchus to select from the equites those who were to act as judices, which conferred on him a kind of monarchical authority, and even the senate now assented to the measures which he proposed in their body.", "993": "But all the measures which he proposed were honourable to the senate;", "994": "such, for instance, was the very equitable and just decree about the grain which Fabius the proprætor sent from Iberia.", "995": "Gracchus induced the senate to sell the grain and to return the money which it produced to the Iberian cities, and further to censure Fabius for making the Roman dominion heavy and intolerable to the subject nations;", "996": "this measure brought him great reputation and popularity in the provinces.", "997": "He also introduced measures for sending out colonies, the construction of roads, and the building of public granaries;", "998": "and he made himself director and super­ intendent for the carrying all these measures into effect.", "999": "Though engaged in so many great undertakings, he waft never wearied, but with wonderful activity and labour he effected every single object as if he had for the time no other occupation, so that even those who thoroughly hated and feared him were struck with amazement at the rapidity and perfect execution of all that he undertook.", "1000": "But the people looked with admiration on the man himself, seeing him attended by crowds of building-contractors, artificers, ambassadors, magistrates, soldiers, and learned men, to all of whom he was easy of access;", "1001": "and while he maintained his dignity, he was affable to all, and adapted his behaviour to the condition of every individual, and so proved the falsehood of those who called him tyrannical or arrogant or violent.", "1002": "He thus showed himself more skilful as a popular leader in his dealings with men, and in his conduct, than in his harangues from the Rostra.", "1003": "VII.", "1004": "But Caius busied himself most about the construe­ tion of roads,.", "1005": "having in view utility, convenience, and ornament.", "1006": "The roads were made in a straight line, right through the country, partly of quarried stone and partly with tight-rammed masses of earth.", "1007": "By filling up the depressions, and throwing bridges across those parts which were traversed by winter torrents or deep ravines, and raising the road on both sides to the same uniform height, the whole line was made level and presented an agreeable appearance.", "1008": "He also measured all the roads by miles (the Roman mile is not quite eight Greek stadia), and fixed stone blocks to mark the distances.", "1009": "He placed other stones at less distances from one another on each side of the road, that persons might thus easily mount their horses without assistance.", "1010": "VIII.", "1011": "As the people extolled him for all these services, and were ready to show their good will towards him in any way, he said on one occasion when he was addressing them, that he would ask a favour, which he would value above everything if it was granted, but if it were refused, he should not complain.", "1012": "It was accordingly expected that he would ask for the consulship, and everybody supposed that he would be a candidate for the consulship and the tri­ bunate at the same time.", "1013": "When the consular comitia were near, and all were at the highest point of expectation, Caius appeared conducting Caius Fannius into the Campus Martius, and canvassing with his friends for Fannius.*", "1014": "This gave Fannius a great advantage.", "1015": "Fannius was elected consul, and Caius tribune for the second time, though he was neither a candidate nor canvassed, but his election was entirely due to the zeal of the people.", "1016": "Per­ ceiving, however, that the senate was clearly opposed to him, and that the kind feeling of Fannius towards him cooled, he forthwith endeavoured to attach the people by other measures, by proposing to send colonies to Tarentum and Capua, and by inviting the Latins to a participation in the Roman franchise.", "1017": "The senate, fearing that Gracchus would become irresistible, attempted a new and unusual method of diverting the people from him, by opposing popular measures to his, and by gratifying the people, contrary to sound policy.", "1018": "Livius Drusus was one of the colleagues of Caius, a man by birth and education inferior to none in Rome, and in character, eloquence, and wealth equal to any who enjoyed either honour or power by the aid of these advantages.", "1019": "To him accordingly the chief nobles applied, and they urged him to attack Caius, and to unite with them against him, not by adopting violent measures, nor coming into collision with the many, but by a course of administration adapted to please, and by making such concessions as it would have been honourable to refuse, even at the risk of unpopularity.", "1020": "IX.", "1021": "Livius, having agreed to employ his tribunitian authority on the side of the senate, framed measures which had neither any honourable nor any useful object:", "1022": "he only had in view to outbid Caius in the popular favour, just as it is in a comedy, by making himself busy and vying with his rival.", "1023": "This showed most clearly that the senate were not displeased with the measures of Cams, but only wished to destroy him or completely humble him.", "1024": "When Caius proposed to send out ten colonies consisting of citizens of the best character, the senate accused him of truckling to the people;", "1025": "but they co-operated with Livius, who pro­ posed twelve colonies, each of which was to consist of three thousand needy citizens.", "1026": "They set themselves in opposition to Caius when he proposed to distribute land among the poor, subject to a yearly payment to the treasury from each, on the ground that he was trying to gain the popular favour;", "1027": "but they were satisfied when Livius proposed to relieve the colonists even from this payment.", "1028": "Further, Caius gave them offence by proposing to confer on the Latins the Roman suffrage;", "1029": "but when Livius brought forward a measure which forbade any Latin to be beaten with rods even while serving in the army, they supported it.", "1030": "And indeed Livius himself, in his harangues to the people, always said that he only proposed what was agreeable to the senate, who had a regard for the many;", "1031": "which indeed was the only good that resulted from his measures.", "1032": "For the people became more pacific­ ally disposed towards the senate;", "1033": "and though the most distinguished of them were formerly suspected and hated by the people, Livius did away with and softened their recollection of past grievances and their ill feeling, by giving out that it was in accordance with the wish of the senate that he had entered upon his popular career and framed measures to please the many.X.", "1034": "But the best proof to the people of the good intentions and honesty of Livius was, that he proposed nothing for himself or in behalf of his own interests;", "1035": "for he appointed other persons to superintend the establishment of the colonies, and he did not meddle with the administration of the money, while Caius had assigned to himself most of such functions, and the most important of them.", "1036": "It hap­ pened that Rubrius, one of the tribunes, had proposed a measure for the colonisation of Carthage, which had been destroyed by Scipio ;", "1037": "and as the lot fell on Caius, he set sail to Libya to found the colony.", "1038": "In his absence, Drusus, making still further advances, insinuated himself into the favour of the people, and gained them over mainly by calumniating Fulvius.*", "1039": "This Fulvius was a friend of Caius and a joint commissioner for the distribution of lands;", "1040": "but he was a noisy fellow, and specially disliked by the senate;", "1041": "he was also suspected by others of stirring up the allies, and secretly encouraging the Italians to revolt;", "1042": "and though this was said without proof or inquiry, Fulvius himself gave it credit by his unwise and revolu­ tionary policy.", "1043": "This more than anything else destroyed the popularity of Caius, who came in for his share of the odium against Fulvius.", "1044": "And when Scipiot Africanus died without any obvious cause, and certain signs of blows and violence were supposed to be visible on the body, as I told in the Life of Scipio, the suspicion fell chiefly on Fulvius, who was his enemy, and on that day had abused Scipio from the Rostra.", "1045": "Suspicion attached to Caius also.", "1046": "So abominable a crime committed against the first and greatest of the Romans went unpunished, and there was not even an inquiry;", "1047": "for the many opposed it and stopped the investigation through fear for Caius, lest he should be discovered to be implicated in the murder.", "1048": "These events, indeed, belong to an earlier period.", "1049": "XI.", "1050": "In Libya, as to the foundation of Carthage,t which Caius named Junonia, which is the same as Heraea, it is said there were many supernatural hindrances.", "1051": "Foi the first standard was seized and broken by a violent gust of wind, though the standard-bearer stuck to it vigorously;", "1052": "and the victims which were lying on the altars were dis­ persed by a tempest, and scattered beyond the stakes which marked the limits of the city, and the stakes were torn up by tho wolves and carried a long way off.", "1053": "How­ ever Caius, after settling and arranging everything in seventy days, returned to Rome upon hearing that Fulvius was hard pressed by Drusus, and that affairs required his presence.", "1054": "Lucius Opimius, a man who belonged to the faction of the oligarchs,* and had great influence in the senate, failed on a former occasion when he was a candi­ date for the consulship, at the time when Caius brought forward Fannius and canvassed against Opimius;", "1055": "but now, being supported by a powerful party, it was expected that Opimius would be elected consul and would put down Caius, whose influence was already in some degree on the wane, and the people also were tired of such measures as his, for there were many who sought their favour, and the senate easily gave way.", "1056": "XII.", "1057": "On his return from Libya, Caius removed from the Palatium to the neighbourhood of the Forum, as being a more popular place of residence, for it happened that most of the lowest classes of the poor lived there ;", "1058": "he next pro­ mulgated the rest of his measures, intending to take the vote of the people upon them.", "1059": "As crowds were collecting from all parts to support Caius, the senate prevailed on the consul Fannius to drive out of the city all who were not Romans.", "1060": "Accordingly a strange and unusual pro­ clamation was made, to the effect that none of the allies or friends of the Roman state should appear in Rome during those days;", "1061": "on which Caius published a counter edict, in which he criminated the consul and promised his support to the allies if they remained in Rome.", "1062": "But he did not keep his promise;", "1063": "for though he saw one of them, who was his own friend and intimate, dragged off by the officers of Fannius, he passed by without helping him, whether it was that he feared to put to the test his power which was now on the decline, or that he did not choose, as he said, to give his enemies the opportunity which they were seeking of coming to a collision and a struggle.", "1064": "It also chanced that he had incurred the ill-will of his fellow- colleagues, in the following manner :", "1065": "-l'he people were going to see an exhibition of gladiators in the Forum, and most of the magistrates had constructed seats round the place, with the intention of letting them for hire.", "1066": "But Caius urged them to remove the seats, that the poor might be able to see the show without paying.", "1067": "As no one took any notice of what he said, he waited till the night before the show, when he went with the workmen whom he had under him, and removed the seats, and at daybreak he pointed out to the people that the place was clear;", "1068": "for which the many considered him a man, but he offended his colleagues, who viewed him as an audacious and violent person.", "1069": "Owing to this circumstance, it is supposed, he lost his third tribunate, though he had most votes, for it is said that his colleagues acted illegally and fraudulently in the proclamation and return.", "1070": "This, however, was dis­ puted.", "1071": "Caius did not bear his failure well:", "1072": "and to his enemies, who were exulting over him, he is said to have observed, with more arrogance than was befitting, that their laugh was a sardonic laugh,.", "1073": "for they knew not what a darkness his political measures had spread all around them.", "1074": "XIII.", "1075": "After effecting the election of Opimius to the consulship, the enemies of Caius began to repeal many of his laws and to disturb the settlement of Carthage, for the purpose of irritating Caius, in order that he might give them some cause of quarrel, and so be got rid of.", "1076": "He endured this for some time, but his friends, and especially Fulvius, beginning to urge him on, he again attempted to combine his partisans against the consul.", "1077": "On this occasion it is said that his mother also helped him, by hiring men from remote parts and sending them to Rome in the disguise of reapers, for it is supposed that these matters are obscurely alluded to in her letters­ to her son.", "1078": "Others, on the contrary, say that this was done quite contrary to the wishes of Cornelia.", "1079": "On the day on which the party of Opimius intended to repeal the laws of Caius, the Capitol had been occupied by the opposite faction early in the morning.", "1080": "The consul had offered the sacrifices, and one of his officers, named Quintus Antyllius,† was carrying the viscera to another part, when he said to the partisans of Fulvius, “ Make way for honest men, you rascals.\"", "1081": "Some say that as he uttered these words he also held out his bare arm with insulting gestures.", "1082": "However this may be, Antyllius was killed on the spot, being pierced with large styles t said to have been made expressly for the purpose.", "1083": "The people were greatly disturbed at the murder, but it produced exactly opposite effects on the leaders of the two parties.", "1084": "Caius was deeply grieved at what had hap­ pened, and abused his party for having given a handle to their enemies, who had long been looking for it;", "1085": "but Opimius, as if he had got the opportunity which he wanted, was highly elated, and urged the people to avenge the murder.", "1086": "XIV.", "1087": "A torrent of rain happened to fall just then, and the meeting was dissolved.", "1088": "Early on the following day Opimius summoned the senate to transact business.", "1089": "In the mean time the naked body of Antyllius was placed on a bier, and, according to arrangement, carried through the Forum past the senate-house with loud cries and lamentations.", "1090": "Opimius, though he knew what was going on, pretended to be surprised at the noise, and the senators went out to see what was the matter.", "1091": "When the bier had been set down in the midst of the crowd, the senators began to express their indignation at so horrible and monstrous a crime;", "1092": "but this only moved the people to hate and execrate the oligarchs, who, after murdering Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol, a tribune, had treated his body with insult;", "1093": "while Antyllius, a mere servant, who perhaps had not deserved his fate, yet was mainly to blame for what happened, was laid out in the Forum, and surrounded by the Roman senate lamenting and assisting at the funeral of a hireling;", "1094": "and all this merely to accomplish the ruin of the only remaining guardian of the people's liberties.", "1095": "On returning to the senate- house, the senators passed a decree- by which the consul Opimius was directed to save the state in such way as he could, and to put down the tyrants.", "1096": "Opimius gave notice to the senators to arm, and each eques was com­ manded to bring in the morning two armed slaves.", "1097": "On the other side, Fulvius also made preparation and got together a rabble;", "1098": "but Caius as he left the Forum stood opposite his father's statue, and looking at it for some time without speaking, at last burst into tears, and fetching a deep sigh, walked away.", "1099": "The sight of this moved many of the spectators to compassion, and blaming themselves for deserting the man and betraying him, they came to the house of Caius and passed the night at his door;", "1100": "but not in the same manner as those who watched about the house of Fulvius, for they spent the night in tumult and shouting, drinking, and bragging what they would do.", "1101": "Fulvius himself, who was the first to get drunk, spoke and acted in a way quite unseemly for a man of his age.", "1102": "The followers of Caius, viewing the state of affairs as a public calamity, kept quiet, thinking of the future, and they passed the night watching and sleeping in turns.", "1103": "XV.", "1104": "At daybreak Fulvius was with difficulty roused from his drunken sleep, and his partisans, arming them­ selves with the warlike spoils in his house, which he had taken in his victory over the Gauls during his consulship, with loud threats and shouts went to seize the Aventine Hill.-", "1105": "Caius would not arm, but went out in his toga just as if he was proceeding to the Forum, with only a short dagger at his side.", "1106": "As he was going out at the door, his wife met him, and throwing one arm round him, while she held in the other their little child, said, \" Caius, not as in time past do I take my leave of you going to the Rostra as tribune and as legislator, nor yet going to a glorious war, where, if you died in the service of your country, you would still leave me an honoured grief;", "1107": "but you are going to expose yourself to the murderers of Tibe­ rius :", "1108": "'tis right indeed to go unarmed, and to suffer rather than do wrong, but you will perish without benefiting the state.", "1109": "The worst has now prevailed;", "1110": "force and the sword determine all controversies.", "1111": "If your brother had died at Numantia, his body would have been restored to us on the usual terms of war;", "1112": "but now perchance I too shall have to supplicate some river or the sea to render up to me your corpse from its keeping.", "1113": "What faith can we put in the laws or in the deities since the murder of Tiberius?\"", "1114": "While Licinia was thus giving vent to sorrow, Grac­ chus gently freed himself from his wife's embrace, and went off in silence with his friends.", "1115": "Licinia, as she attempted to lay hold of his dress, fell down on the floor, and lay there some time speechless, until her slaves took her up fainting, and carried her to her brother Crassus.", "1116": "XVI.", "1117": "When they were all assembled, Fulvius, at the request of Caius, sent his younger son with a caduceus * to the Forum.", "1118": "He was a most beautiful youth, and with great decorum and modesty, and with tears in his eyes he addressed to the consul and the senate the message of conciliation.", "1119": "The majority who were present were not disinclined to come to terms;", "1120": "but Opimius replied, that Fulvius and Gracchus must not attempt to bring the senate to an accommodation through the medium of a messenger;", "1121": "they must consider themselves as citizens who had to account for their conduct, and come down and surrender, and then beg for mercy;", "1122": "he further told the youth that these were the terms on which he must come a second time, or not at all.", "1123": "Now Caius, it is said, wished to go and clear himself before the senate, but as no one else assented, Fulvius again sent his son to address the senate on their behalf in the same terms as before.", "1124": "But Opimius, who was eager to come to blows, forthwith ordered the youth to be seized and put in prison, and advanced against the party of Fulvius with many legionary soldiers and Cretan bowmen t who mainly contributed to put them into confusion by discharging their arrows and wounding them.", "1125": "The partisans of Fulvius being put to flight, he made his escape into a bath that was not used where he was soon discovered and put to death with his elder son.", "1126": "Caius was not observed to take any part in the contest, but greatly troubled at what was taking place, he retired to the temple of Diana, and was going to kill himself theie, but was prevented by his faithful friends Pomponius and Licinius, who took the sword away and induced him to fly.", "1127": "It is said that he went down on his knees in the temple, and stretching out his hands to the statue of the goddess, prayed that the Roman people, for their ingratitude and treachery to him, might always be slaves;", "1128": "for the greater part of them had openly gone over to the other side upon an amnesty * being proclaimed.", "1129": "XVII.", "1130": "In his flight Caius was followed by his enemies, who were near overtaking him at the wooden bridge, t but his two friends, bidding him make his escape, opposed the pursuers and allowed no man to pass the head of the bridge till they were killed.", "1131": "Caius was accompanied by a single slave, named Philocrates, t and though all the spec­ tators urged him to fly, just as if they were shouting at a race, yet no one, though he prayed for it, would come to his aid or lend him a horse:", "1132": "for the pursuers were close upon him.", "1133": "He just escaped into a sacred grove of the Furies, § and there he fell by the hand of Philocrates, who killed himself on the body of his master.", "1134": "Some say both of them were taken alive by their enemies, and thai the slave embraced his master so closely, that Caius could not be struck until the slave had been dispatched first, and with many blows.", "1135": "It is said that a man cut off the head of Caius and was carrying it away, but it was taken from him by a friend of Opimius named Septimuleius;", "1136": "for proclamation had been made at the beginning of the contest, that those who brought the heads of Caius and Fulvius should have their weight in gold.", "1137": "The head of Caius was brought to Opimius by Septimuleius stuck on a spear, and it weighed seventeen pounds and two-thirds in the scales.", "1138": "Septimuleius was a scoundrel and a knave * here also, for he had taken out the brain and dropped melted lead in its place.", "1139": "Those who brought the head of Fulvius got nothing, for they belonged to the lower class.", "1140": "The bodies of Caius and Fulvius and their par­ tisans were thrown into the river, the number of dead being three thousand:", "1141": "their property was sold and the produce paid into the treasury.", "1142": "They also forbade the women to lament for their relatives, and Licinia was deprived of her marriage portion.", "1143": "But their conduct was most cruel to the younger son of Fulvius, who had neither raised up his hand against them nor been among the combatants;", "1144": "for he was seized before the battle, when he came to treat of terms, and was put to death after the battle.", "1145": "But what most of all vexed the people was the circumstance of Opimius erecting a temple to Concord, which was viewed as an evidence of his insolence and arrogance, and as a kind of triumph for the slaughter of so many citizens.", "1146": "Accordingly by night some person wrote under the in­ scription on the temple the following line :", "1147": "—", "1148": "The work of Discard t makes the temple of Concord.", "1149": "XVIII.", "1150": "This Opimius,* the first man that ever exer­ cised the dictatorial power in the office of consul, and who had condemned without trial three thousand citizens, and among them Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus t- Flaccus, a consular, who had enjoyed a triumph;", "1151": "Gracchus, the first man of his age in character and re­ putation—this Opimius did not keep himself free from corruption.", "1152": "Being sent as a commissioner to Jugurtha, the Numidian, he was bribed by him, and being convicted of most shameful corruption, he spent the last years of his life in infamy, hated and insulted by the people, who, though humbled and depressed for the time, soon showed how much they desired and regretted the Gracchi.", "1153": "Foi they had statues of the two brothers made and set up in public places, and the spots on which they fell were de­ clared sacred ground, to which people brought all the first fruits of the seasons, and many persons daily offered sacri­ fices there and worshipped, just as at the temples of the gods.", "1154": "XIX.", "1155": "Cornelia is said to have borne her misfortunes with a noble and elevated spirit, and to have said of the sacred ground on which her sons were murdered, that they had a tomb worthy of them.", "1156": "She resided in the neighbourhood of Misenum, without making any change in her usual mode of life.", "1157": "She had many friends, and her hospitable table was always crowded with guests;", "1158": "Greeks and learned men were constantly about her, and kings sent and received presents from her.", "1159": "To all her visitors and friends she was a most agreeable companion:", "1160": "she would tell them of the life and habits of her father Africanus, and, what is most surprising, would speak of her sons without showing sorrow or shedding a tear, relating their sufferings and their deeds to her inquiring friends as if she was speaking of the men of olden time.", "1161": "This made some think that her understanding had been impaired by old age or the greatness of her sorrows, and that she was dull to all sense of her misfortunes, while in fact such people themselves were too dull to see what a support it is against grief to have a noble nature, and to be of honourable lineage and honourably bred;", "1162": "and that though fortune has often the advantage over virtue in its attempts to guard against evils, yet she cannot take away from virtue the power of enduring them with fortitude.*I. Now that we have completed the narrative of these men's lives, it remains for us to compare them with one another.", "1163": "As for the Gracchi, not even their bitterest enemies could deny that they were the most virtuous of all the Romans, or that they were excellently well nurtured and educated;", "1164": "while Agis and Kleomenes appear to have excelled them in strength of mind, because they both, after having been brought up in the same fashion by which their elders had been corrupted, became the restorers of temperance and simplicity of life.", "1165": "Further­ more, the Gracchi, who lived at a period when Rome was at the height of its greatness and renown, felt ashamed to fall short of the glorious achievements of their forefathers ;", "1166": "while the virtuous impulses of the others were not checked by their fathers having pursued the opposite course of policy, or by the miserable and distracted condition of their country.", "1167": "The greatest proof of the unselfishness and indifference to money of the Gracchi is that they filled various offices in the state, and yet kept their hands clean from dishonest gains ;", "1168": "while it would be an insult to Agis to praise him for not having taken other men's money, as he gave up to his countrymen his own private property, which alone was worth six hundred talents.", "1169": "If then he thought it discreditable for him to be richer than any of his countrymen, even though his riches were lawfully acquired, what must have been his abhorrence of those who obtain money wrongfully.", "1170": "II.", "1171": "There was also a great difference in the boldness and extent of their schemes of reform.", "1172": "The Gracchi were chiefly engaged in the construction of roads and the found- ing of cities, and Tiberius's most important measure of reform was the division of the public lanes among the people, while the best act of his brother Caius was the establishment of a mixed tribunal by adding to the three hundred Senators three hundred Roman Knights.", "1173": "The revolution effected by Agis and Kleomenes was of quite a different kind.", "1174": "They thought, in Plato's words, that to proceed by slow degrees was merely cutting off the heads of the hydra,.", "1175": "and therefore they by one comprehensive measure swept away all abuses at once:", "1176": "although it would be nearer the truth to say that they swept all abuses out of the state by restoring to it its original constitution.", "1177": "It may also be observed that the reforms of the Gracchi were opposed by some of the most powerful men in Rome, whereas the legislation which was begun by Agis, and completed by Kleomenes, followed a famous and ancient precedent, the rhetras on sobriety and equality which had been communicated to their ancestors by Lykurgus with the sanction of the Pythian Apollo.", "1178": "It is also most important to notice that the reforms of the Gracchi made Rome no greater than she was before, while the acts of Kleomenes enabled him in a short time to make Sparta mistress of the whole of Peloponnesus, and to engage in a contest with the most powerful man of his time, with the object of ridding Greece from Illyrian and Gaulish mercenary troops, and of renewing its ancient glories under the rule of the Herakleidæ.", "1179": "III.", "1180": "I think too that the deaths of these men show a certain difference in their courage.", "1181": "The Gracchi fought with their countrymen, and were slain by them while flying, while of the other two, Agis may almost be said to have died voluntarily, because he would not put a citizen to death, while Kleomenes, when insulted and ill-treated, fiercely attempted to avenge himself, and as circumstances prevented his succeeding, bravely killed himself.", "1182": "It may be said on the other side that Agis never distinguished himself in the field, and we may set against the many brilliant victories of Kleomenes the scaling of the wall of Carthage by Tiberius Gracchus, no slight achievement, and the peace which he made with the Numantines, by which he saved the lives of twenty thousand Roman soldiers, who could not otherwise have hoped to survive;", "1183": "while Caius, in several campaigns both in Italy and Sardinia, showed great military skill;", "1184": "so that they both might have rivalled the fame of the greatest generals of Rome, had they not been cut off so soon,IV.", "1185": "In political matters Agis appears to have shown weakness, as he allowed Agesilaus to cheat the citizens out of their promised redistribution of lands, and in a feeble and vacillating manner announced his intention and then abandoned it.", "1186": "The cause of his irresolution was his extreme youth;", "1187": "while Kleomenes on the other hand effected his revolution with too great promptitude and daring, putting the Ephors to death without a trial, when it would have been easy for him to have won them over to his side, and banishing many of the citizens.", "1188": "It is not the part either of a wise physician or of a good politician to use the knife except in the last extremity, but it shows a want of skill in both, and in the latter case it is unjust as well as cruel.", "1189": "Of the Gracchi, neither would begin a civil war, and Caius is said not even to have defended himself when struck, but though forward enough in battle ho was loth to fight in a party quarrel;", "1190": "for he appeared in public unarmed, and retired when fighting began, and evidently took more pains not to do any harm than not to suffer any.", "1191": "For this reason we must regard the flight of both the Gracchi as a proof, not of cowardice, but of caution;", "1192": "for they must either have retreated when attacked or have retaliated upon their opponents.", "1193": "V.", "1194": "The heaviest charge that can be brought against Tiberius is that he deposed his colleague from the tribune­ ship, and afterwards sought a second tribuneship for himself.", "1195": "As for the murder of Antyllius, Caius Gracchus was most falsely and unjustly accused of it, for he did not wish him to die, and was grieved at his death.", "1196": "Again Kleomenes, not to speak of his massacre of the Ephors, set all the slaves at liberty, and practically made himself despot of the kingdom, although for form's sake he associated his brother with him, who was of the same family.", "1197": "And when Archidamus, who was the next heir to the throne of the other royal house, was persuaded by him to return from Messene to Sparta, as Kleomenes did not avenge his death, he caused men to suspect that he himself had some share in it.", "1198": "Yet Lykurgus, whom he affected to imitate, abdicated the throne of his own free will in favour of his nephew Charilaus, and fearing that if the child died by any mischance he might be thought guilty of having caused its death, he travelled abroad for a long time and did not return until Charilaus had begotten a son to succeed him.", "1199": "However, no Greek can bear comparison with Lykurgus;", "1200": "yet we have proved that Kleomenes effected greater reforms, and showed less respect to the laws than any of the others.", "1201": "Both the Greeks have been blamed for having from the very outset aimed at being nothing more than warlike depots;", "1202": "while the worst enemies of the Romans only charge them with an immoderate ambition, and admit that they became so excited by the contest with their political opponents that the natural heat of their temper drove them in spite of themselves like a baleful gust of wind to advocate extreme measures.", "1203": "What indeed can be more just or honourable than the objects with which they started;", "1204": "for their troubles were brought upon them by the opposition which the rich offered to their laws, so that the one was forced to fight to save his own life, while the other endeavoured to avenge his brother, who was slain without law or justice ?", "1205": "From what has been said the reader can himself form an opinion about their respective merits, but if I must say what I think of each, I should give the highest place in respect of virtue to Tiberius Gracchus;", "1206": "I think that the young Agis committed the fewest crimes;", "1207": "while in daring and action Caius fell far short of Kleomenes.", "1208": "I.", "1209": "The writer of the Ode to Alkibiades on the occasion of his winning the chariot-race at Olympia, whether he was Euripides, as is commonly supposed, or some other poet, my friend Sossius, tells us that the first thing necessary for a perfectly happy man is that he should be born a citizen of some famous city.", "1210": "But for my own part I believe that for the enjoyment of true happiness, which depends chiefly upon a man's character and disposition, it makes no difference whether he be born in an obscure state or of an ill-favoured mother, or not.", "1211": "It would indeed be absurd if one were to suppose that the town of lulls, which is only a small part of the little island of Keos or Ægina, which some Athenian bade his country­ men clear away because it was an eyesore to Peiræus, should be able to produce good actors and poets, and yet be unable to bring forth a just, virtuous, sensible and high- minded man.", "1212": "We may reasonably expect that those arts by which men gain glory or profit should be neglected and fall into decay in small and obscure towns;", "1213": "but virtue, like a hardy plant, can take root in any country where it meets with noble natures and industrious dis­ position.", "1214": "I myself therefore must lay the blame of my intellectual and moral shortcomings, not upon the insig­ nificance of my native city, but upon myself.", "1215": "II.", "1216": "However, when a man is engaged in compiling a history from materials which are not ready to his hand, but for the most part are to be found scattered through other foreign towns, it becomes really of the first impor­ tance that he should live in some famous, cultivated, and populous city, where he can have unlimited access to books of all kinds, and where he can also personally collect and inquire into the truth of those stories which, though not reduced to writing, are all the more likely to be true because they rest upon universal popular tradition.", "1217": "The work of a historian who is deprived of these advan­ tages must necessarily be defective in many essential particulars.", "1218": "Now I, who belong to a small city, and who love to live in it lest it should become even smaller, when I was at Rome, and during my travels in Italy, found my time so taken up with political business and with the care of my pupils in philosophy, that I had no leisure to learn the Roman language, and have only applied myself to Latin literature at a very advanced period of life.", "1219": "In this reading of Latin books, singular as it may appear, I did not find that the words assisted me to discover the meaning, but rather that my knowledge of the history enabled me to find out the meaning of the words.", "1220": "I think that to speak the Latin language with elegance, to understand it readily, and to use its various idioms and phrases correctly, is for a literary man both useful and interesting;", "1221": "but the amount of study and practice which it requires is consi­ derable and should only be undertaken by those who are younger than myself, and who have more leisure time to devote to the acquisition of such accomplishments.", "1222": "III.", "1223": "In consequence of these considerations, in this my fifth book of Parallel Lives, which deals with the lives of Demosthenes and Cicero, I intend to describe their several characters, and to compare them with one another by means of their political acts, but I do not mean to examine minutely into their respective speeches, or to decide which of the two was the more pleasing or the more able orator.", "1224": "Were I to attempt such a task, I should be forgetting Ion's proverb about a \"fish out of water,\" like the all-accomplished Cæcilius, who has boldly taken upon himself to write a comparison of Demosthenes with Cicero.", "1225": "Perhaps, however, we might begin to doubt the divine origin of the commandment “ know thyself,\" if we found men always ready to apply it.", "1226": "Indeed Heaven appears to have originally intended to form the characters of Demosthenes and Cicero on the same model, and in some instances to have implanted in them precisely the same qualities, such as great personal ambition, love of freedom, and want of courage in the wars, yet to have left much to chance.", "1227": "I think it would be difficult to find an instance of any two other orators who both rose from a humble station to great power and influence, who both opposed absolute monarchy both lost favourite daughters, were both exiled and brought back with honour, who both when flying from their country a second time fell into the hands of their enemies, and with whose deaths the liberties of their countrymen were finally extinguished;", "1228": "so that it is hard to say whether their resemblance is clue more to nature, which originally moulded their characters alike, or to fortune, which placed then in exactly similar circum­ stances.", "1229": "First, then, I will relate the life of the elder of the two.", "1230": "IV.", "1231": "The father of Demosthenes was also named Demos­ thenes, and belonged, according to Theopompus, to the best class of Athenian citizens.", "1232": "He was commonly called “ the sword cutler,\" because he possessed a large work­ shop and many slaves skilled in cutlery.", "1233": "As for the accusa­ tion which the orator Æschines brings against his mother, that she was the daughter of one Gylon, who was banished for treason, by a foreign woman, we cannot tell whether it is true or only a calumnious imputation.", "1234": "Demosthenes was left an orphan at the age of seven years, and was the heir to considerable property, amounting in all to no less than fifteen talents.", "1235": "He was scandalously ill-used by his guardians, who appropriated much of his income, and neglected the rest so much that he was unable to pay his teachers.", "1236": "He grew up ignorant of much that a buy of good birth is expected to learn, partly for this reason, and partly on account of his weak health, which caused his mother to keep him away from school.", "1237": "He was a sickly child, and it is said that the opprobrious nickname of Batalus was bestowed upon him by his school-fellows because of his bodily weakness.", "1238": "Batalua, according to some writers, was an effeminate flute-player, whose habits were satirized in a comic drama written by Antiphanes.", "1239": "Others assert that Batalus was a poet who wrote in a drunken licentious style;", "1240": "and there seems also some foundation for the belief that this word was used for a certain part of the human body by the Athenians of that time.", "1241": "The other nickname of Demosthenes, Argas, either alludes to his savage and harsh temper, for some poets use the word to mean a snake;", "1242": "or else it refers to his speeches, as wearying those who heard them;", "1243": "for Argas was the name of a poet whose verses were bad and tiresome.", "1244": "And, as Plato says, so much for this.", "1245": "V.", "1246": "We are told that he was first led to turn his attention to oratory by the following incident.", "1247": "When Kallistratus was going to make a speech in court about the affair of Oropus * great interest was taken in the trial because of the ability of the orator, who at that time was at the height of his reputation, and also because of the important character of the law suit.", "1248": "Demosthenes, hearing his teachers and attendants making arrangement to be present at the trial, persuaded his own servant by great entreaties to take him to hear the speeches.", "1249": "The man, who was intimate with the doorkeepers of the court, managed to obtain a place for Demosthenes, in which the boy could sit unseen by the public and hear all that was said.", "1250": "Kallis­ thenes spoke very brilliantly and was much admired.", "1251": "He excited the envy of Demosthenes by the honours which he received, as he was escorted home by a long train of friends who congratulated him upon his success;", "1252": "but the boy was even more impressed by the power of his eloquence, which enabled him to deal with everything just as he pleased.", "1253": "In consequence of this Demosthenes neglected all other branches of learning, neglected all the sports of childhood, and laboriously practised and exercised himself in the art of oratory, meaning some day to become an orator himself.", "1254": "He studied rhetoric under Isaeus, although Isokrates was giving lessons at the same time, either, according to some writers, because, being an orphan, he was unable to raise the sum of ten minæ which Isokrates demanded as a fee, or because he thought that the vigorous invective of Isaeus was more what he required to learn.", "1255": "Hermippus informs us that he read in some anonymous work that Demosthenes was a scholar of Plato, and learned much of the art of speaking from him, while he mentions having heard from Ktesibius that Demosthenes had been lent the works of Isolates and Alkidamas by one Kallias, a Syra­ cusan, and some others, and that he used to read and practise himself in them in secret.", "1256": "VI.", "1257": "When he came of age he at once brought a series of actions against his guardians for malversation of his property, while they resorted to every species of legal subtlety and chicanery to avoid making restitu­ tion.", "1258": "By publicly pleading his cause, as Thucydides says, \" he learned his trade by dangers,\" and succeeded in recovering some of his paternal estate, though but a small part of that to which he was entitled.", "1259": "He gained, however, confidence and practice as a public speaker, and the fascinating excitement and sense of power which he experienced in these contests emboldened him to become a professional orator and to deal with political matters.", "1260": "We are told that Laomedon of Orchomenus, by the advice of his physicians, used to run long distances as a remedy for a disease of the spleen from which he suffered, until he not only overcame his disorder, but was able to enter for races at the games, and became one of the best long-distance runners of his time.", "1261": "Even so Demosthenes, who was forced by his private misfortunes to make his first appearance as a speaker, gained such skill and power by his success in the law-courts that he soon took the lead among the speakers in the public assembly.", "1262": "Yet when he first addressed the people he was violently coughed down, inter­ rupted and ridiculed, because his speech was found dull and tiresome, being confused in style and strained and arti­ ficial in argument.", "1263": "It is said that his voice was weak, and his pronunciation indistinct, and that, as he was frequently obliged to pause for want of breath, it was difficult to follow the meaning of his sentences.", "1264": "At last he left the public assembly and wandered about Peiræus in despair.", "1265": "Here he was met by an old man named Eunomus of Thriasia,* who reproved him and told him that he did himself great wrong, because, having a manner of speech extremely like that of Perikles, he permitted himself to be disheartened by failure, and did not face the clamour of the rabble boldly, and did not train his body to be strong enough to support the strain of such contests, but allowed himself to fall into a weakly and effeminate condition.", "1266": "VII.", "1267": "After a second failure, as he was going home overwhelmed with shame hiding his face in his cloak, Satyrus the actor is.", "1268": "said to have followed him and joined him.", "1269": "Demosthenes told him with tears in his eves that although he had taken more pains than any other speaker, and had devoted all his energes to the study of eloquence, yet he could not gain the ear of the people, but that ignorant drunken sailors were listened to when they mounted the tribune, while he was treated with scorn.", "1270": "On hearing this Satyrus answered, \"Demosthenes, what you say is very true, but I will soon apply a remedy, if you will recite to me one of the long speeches from the plays of Sophokles or Euripides.\"", "1271": "After Demosthenes had recited a speech, Satyrus recited the same speech in turn, and so altered it and gave it so much more grace, by throwing into it the expression which the verses required, that it appeared to Demosthenes to be quite different.", "1272": "Having thus learned how much a speech gains by a really artistic delivery, Demosthenes perceived that it was of but little use for him to study the matter of a speech, unless he also paid attention to the form in which it was to be presented to his audience.", "1273": "He now built for himself an underground study, which remained entire down to the present day, where he daily practised himself in gesture and declamation, and exercised his voice, and where he sometimes spent two or three months at a time with half of his head shaved, so that even if he wished he could not go out of doors.", "1274": "VIII.", "1275": "He took, however, his themes and subjects for declamation from the various topics of the day, which he learned from those who came to visit him.", "1276": "As soon as they left him he used to return to his study, and repeated aloud in the form of a speech all the news which he had heard, and made comments upon it.", "1277": "He also used to work up any conversations which he heard, into sentences and periods for his orations, and would alter, correct and paraphrase both his own remarks and those of his friends.", "1278": "This gave rise to the opinion that he was not really a man of ability, but that his power and skill as an orator was obtained by laborious study.", "1279": "A great proof of this was thought to be that Demosthenes seldom spoke on the spur of the moment, but often when he was present in the assembly and was called upon by the people to speak, he would remain silent unless he had prepared and meditated over his speech.", "1280": "Many of the other orators ridiculed him for this, and Pytheas in derision said that his arguments smelt of the lamp.", "1281": "To this Demosthenes made the bitter retort, \" My lamp, Pytheas, sees very different work from yours.\"", "1282": "In conversation with others, however, he did not altogether deny the practice, but said that although he never spoke without having made notes, yet that he often spoke without having written down everything that he was going to say.", "1283": "He used to say that this careful preparation of his speeches showed that he was a true lover of the people, and felt a due reverence for them;", "1284": "while, on the contrary, to speak without caring how the people take one's words proves a man to be of an overbearing oligarchioal disposition, who would use force rather than persuasion.", "1285": "Many writers allege, as a proof that Demosthenes dared not speak on the spur of the moment, that when he attacked Demades he was always immediately answered by him, but that he never so answered Demades.", "1286": "IX.", "1287": "How then, one might ask, was it that Æschines in his orations speaks of Demosthenes as a man of un­ bounded impudence ?", "1288": "or how was it that when Python of Byzantium was pouring forth a flood of invective against Athens, Demosthenes alone rose and answered him?", "1289": "Moreover, when Lamachus of Mytilene, who had written an encomium upon the Kings of Macedon, Philip and Alexander, which was full of abuse of the Thebans and Olynthians, read his composition in public at the Olympic festival, Demosthenes came up to him and in a fine speech proved from history how great things the Thebans and inhabitants of Chalkidike had done for Greece, and what evils had arisen from the baseness of those who flattered the Macedonians, till the audience were so much wrought upon by his eloquence that Lamachus was forced to flee for his life.", "1290": "The answer to this appears to be that Demosthenes, although he did not copy Perikles in all respects, imitated his reserve and dignity of manner, and his reluctance to speak upon every trivial occasion;", "1291": "and that he was not so much attracted by the credit which he might gain by engaging in these encounters, as he was unwilling rashly to place his power and reputation at the mercy of fortune.", "1292": "Indeed, his spoken orations had more fire and daring than the written ones, if we may trust Eratosthenes, Demetrius of Phalerum, and the comic poets.", "1293": "Eratosthenes tells us that in his speeches he used to rave like a Bacchanal, while Demetrius says that once, as if inspired, he recited the metrical oath :", "1294": "\" By earth, by fountains, and by waterfloods.'", "1295": "One of the comic poets also calls him \" the random talker,\" while another mocks at his fondness for antithesis in the following verses:", "1296": "\"Ist Citizen.", "1297": "He got it as he got it back.", "1298": "2nd Citizen.", "1299": "Demosthenes would willingly have spoken words like theee.\"", "1300": "Unless indeed Antiphanes meant by this to allude to the oration on Halonesus, in which Demosthenes advised the Athenians not to take that island, but to take it back from Philip.X.", "1301": "Yet all admitted that Demades, by his own natural wit, without art, was invincible;", "1302": "and that he often, speaking on the spur of the moment, would demolish the carefully studied orations of Demosthenes.", "1303": "Ariston of Chios has preserved the opinion of Theophrastus about these two orators.", "1304": "Theophrastus, when asked what kind of orator he thought Demosthenes to be, replied, \"an orator worthy of Athens.\"", "1305": "When again asked his opinion of Demades, he replied that he thought him \" Too great for Athens.\"", "1306": "The same philosopher relates that Poly­ euktus of Sphettus, one of the chief Athenian statesmen of the time, used to declare that Demosthenes was the best orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful speaker, because his speeches contained the greatest possible amount of meaning in the fewest words.", "1307": "Demos­ thenes himself, whenever Phokion rose to answer him, was wont to whisper to his friends, \"Here comes the cleaver of my harangues.\"", "1308": "It is not clear whether by this Demosthenes alluded to Phokion's oratorical skill, or to his blameless life and high reputation, meaning that the slightest sign given by a man in whom the people felt such confidence carried more weight than the longest oration by anyone else.", "1309": "XI.", "1310": "Demetrius of Phalerum has recorded the devices by which Demosthenes overcame his bodily defects, which he says he heard from Demosthenes's own lips when he was an old man.", "1311": "He corrected the indistinctness of his articulation and his tendency to lisp by declaiming long speeches with pebbles in his mouth, while he strengthened his voice by running or walking up hill, talking the while, and repeating orations or verses.", "1312": "He also had a large mirror in his house, and used to stand before it and study oratorical gestures.", "1313": "We are told that once a man called upon him and asked him to act as his counsel in a lawsuit against a man by whom he had been beaten.", "1314": "\" But,\" said Demosthenes, \" you have not suffered any of this ill-treatment which you complain of.\"", "1315": "At this the man raised his voice and excitedly exclaimed, \"Do you say, Demosthenes, that I have not been ill-treated?\" \"", "1316": "Yes,\" answered he, \" now I hear the voice of one who has really been ill-used.\"", "1317": "So important did he think the action and the tone of voice of a speaker to be in carrying conviction to the minds of his hearers.", "1318": "His manner in speaking marvellously pleased the common people, though men of taste, such as Demetrius of Phalerum, thought it vulgar and affected.", "1319": "Hermippus informs us that Æsion,* when asked to give his opinion about the orators of former times and those of his own day, said that the ancient orators used to address the people in a surprisingly decorous and dignified manner, but that the speeches of Demosthenes when read aloud, appeared to him to be much more carefully constructed and more forcible.", "1320": "It is indeed unnecessary to say that the written speeches of Demosthenes are bitter and angry compositions;", "1321": "but in his impromptu repartees, he often was genuinely witty and pleasant.", "1322": "As for example, when Demades exclaimed, \"Demosthenes teach me Will a sow teach Athena?\"", "1323": "Demosthenes answered, \"This Athena was caught in adultery in Kollytus* the other day.\"", "1324": "And when the thief who was surnamed Chalkus, that is, Brazen-face, attempted to sneer at him for sitting up late at night writing, Demosthenes answered, \" I know that my habit of burning a lamp at night must disconcert you.", "1325": "But, men of Athens, need we wonder at the thefts which take place, when we see that our thieves are brazen, and our walls are only made of clay.\"", "1326": "However, although I could relate several more anecdotes of this kind, I must now stop, as we ought to discover what remains of the disposition and character of Demosthenes from a survey of his political acts.", "1327": "XII.", "1328": "He first began to take an active part in public affairs during the Phokian war, as we learn from his own words, and as we may also gather from his Philippic ora­ tions, some of which were pronounced after that war was ended, while the earlier ones touch on those matters most nearly connected with it.", "1329": "It is evident that when he prepared the oration against Meidias he was thirty-two years of age, and had not as yet acquired any fame or reputation.", "1330": "This appears to me to be the chief reason for his having made up his quarrel with Meidias for a sum of money, for he was far from being a \" mild-man­ nered \" man, but keen and savage in avenging the injuries which he received.", "1331": "It must have been because he saw, that to ruin a man who was so rich, so able a speaker, and so well-befriended as Meidias, was too difficult a task for a man of his political power, and so yielded to the entreaties of those who begged him to let the action drop;", "1332": "for I do not believe that the bribe of three thousand drachmae which he received would by itself have caused Demos­ thenes to lay aside the rancorous hatred which he bore to Meidias, if he had entertained any hopes of obtaining a verdict against him.", "1333": "In the defence of the liberties of Greece against the encroachments of Philip, Demosthenes found a noble theme for political oratory, which he treated in a manner worthy of the subject, and soon acquired such renown by his able and fearless speeches, that he was courted by the king of Persia himself, and was more talked about in the court of Philip than any of the other statesmen of the time, while even his bitterest antagonists admitted that they had to deal with no mean adversary;", "1334": "for both AEschines and Hypereides own as much in their invectives against him.", "1335": "XIII.", "1336": "I cannot, therefore, understand what Theo­ pompus meant by saying that he was of an inconstant disposition, and not able to remain long associated with any party or any line of policy.", "1337": "It appears rather that he remained throughout the consistent advocate of the same principles, and a member of the same political party to which he originally belonged, and that he not only never changed his politics in his life, but even lost his life because he would not change them.", "1338": "He was not like Demades, who to excuse himself for changing sides pleaded that he had oftentimes gone against his own words, but never against the interests of the state.", "1339": "Still less can he be compared with Melanopus, the political opponent of Kallistratus, who was often bribed by him to allow some measure to pass, and on these occasions would say to the people, \" The man is my personal enemy, but I postpone my personal feelings to the good of my country.\"", "1340": "Niko­ demus of Messene, who first took up with Kassander, and afterwards became the advocate of Demetrius, used to declare that he never was inconsistent, because it was always best to obey the strongest party.", "1341": "But in the case of Demosthenes, unlike these men, we can say that he never deviated either in word or deed from the one direct line of policy which he unswervingly pursued to the end.", "1342": "The philosopher Panætius declares that in most of his orations, as in that about the Crown, that against Aristo­ krates, that on behalf of the persons exempted from taxa­ tion (against Leptines), and in the Philippics, we can trace the principle that honour ought to be pursued for its own sake;", "1343": "for in all these he urges his countrymen not to adopt the most pleasant, the most easy, or the most pro­ fitable line of policy, but often thinks that caution and even safety should be regarded as of less importance than honourable conduct;", "1344": "so that if to his noble principles and high-minded eloquence he had joined warlike courage and clean hands from bribery, he would have been worthy to rank, not with Mœrokles, Polyeuktus, and Hypereides, but with Kimon, Thucydides, Perikles, and other great men of old.", "1345": "XIV.", "1346": "Indeed, of his contemporaries, Phokion, although we cannot approve of the strong Macedonian bias of his policy, was nowise inferior to Ephialtes, Aristeides, or Kimon, either in courage or in just dealing;", "1347": "while Demosthenes, who could not be trusted, as we are told by Demetrius, to stand his ground in battle, and who was not altogether proof against the seductions of money -for though he never would receive a bribe from Philip or from Macedonia, yet he was overwhelmed by the torrent of gold which poured from Susa and Ekbatana-was better able than any one else to praise the great deeds of his ancestors, but was not equally capable of imitating them.", "1348": "Yet in spite of these shortcomings, his life was more vir­ tuous than that of any statesman of his time, with the exception of Phokion.", "1349": "He used plainer language to the people than any one else, opposed their wishes, and sharply reproved them for their mistakes, as we learn from his orations.", "1350": "Theopompus has recorded that once when the Athenians called upon him to impeach some person, and became riotous when he refused, he rose and said, \" Men of Athens, I will always give you my advice, whether you bid me or not;", "1351": "but I will not accuse men falsely because you bid me.\"", "1352": "His mode of dealing with Antiphon also was by no means like that of a man who courts the favour of the people, for when the public assembly acquitted Antiphon, Demosthenes dragged him before the court of the Areopagus, and in defiance of the expressed opinion of the people, proved him guilty of having promised Philip that he would set fire to the dock-yard.", "1353": "The wretched man was condemned by the court and executed.", "1354": "He also impeached the priestess Theoris for various evil practices, and especially for teaching slaves to cheat their masters.", "1355": "He obtained a verdict against her, and caused her also to be put to death.", "1356": "XV.", "1357": "It is stated that the speech by which Apollodorus obtained sentence against the general Timotheus, and had him condemned to pay a large fine, was written for him by Demosthenes :", "1358": "and he also wrote the speeches against Phormio and Stephanus, which, as may be supposed, brought great disgrace upon him.", "1359": "For Phormio actually used a speech written by Demosthenes to combat Apollodo­ rus, which was just as if out of one armourer's shop he had sold them each daggers to kill one another with.", "1360": "Of his public speeches, those against Androtion, Timokrates and Aristokrates were written for other persons, as he had not at the time of their composition began to speak in public, being only twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age.", "1361": "The oration against Aristogeiton, he himself pronounced, as he did also that against Leptines, out of regard for Ktesippus the son of Chabrias, according to his own ac­ count of the matter, though some say that he was paying his addresses to the young man's mother at the time.", "1362": "He did not, however, marry her, but married a Samian woman, as we learn from the treatise of Demetrius of Magnesia on Synonyms.", "1363": "It is not clear whether the oration against Æschines for the dishonest embassage was ever spoken;", "1364": "although we are told by Idomeneus that AEschines was only acquitted by thirty votes.", "1365": "This, however, cannot be true, judging from the speeches of Demothenes and Æschines \" on the Crown:", "1366": "\" for neither of them distinctly alludes to that affair as having ever come into court.", "1367": "This point, therefore, I shall leave for others to determine.", "1368": "XVI.", "1369": "Before the war broke out no one could doubt which side Demothenes would take, as he never allowed any act of the King of Macedonia to pass unnoticed, but seized every opportunity of rousing and exciting his countrymen to oppose him.", "1370": "In consequence of this his name became well known at the court of Philip, and when he was sent with nine others to Macedonia on an embassy, Philip listened to the speeches of them all, but replied to his speech with the greatest care.", "1371": "He did not, however, pay so much attention to Demosthenes in the entertainment which he provided for the ambassadors, but took especial pains to win the favour of Æschines and Philokrates.", "1372": "Hence, when these men praised Philip as being more eloquent, more handsome, and to crown all, able to drink more than any one else, Demosthenes sneer­ ingly replied that the first of these qualities was excellent in a sophist, the second in a woman, and the third in a sponge, but that they were none of them such as became a king.", "1373": "XVII.", "1374": "When war finally broke out, as Philip was unable to remain quiet, while the Athenians were urged on by Demosthenes, his first measure was to prevail upon the Athenians to recover Eubcea, which had been handed over to Philip by its local rulers.", "1375": "In pursuance of a decree which bore the name of Demosthenes, the Athe­ nians crossed into the island and drove out the Mace­ donians.", "1376": "Next, as Philip was besieging Byzantium and Perinthus, Demosthenes prevailed upon his countrymen to lay aside their anger and forget the wrongs which they had received from the people of those cities in the social war, and to send them a reinforcement by which they were saved.", "1377": "After this he travelled through Greece, exciting a spirit of resistance to Philip by his speeches, until he succeeded in forming nearly all the Greek cities into a confederacy against Philip, organised an army of fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, besides the local forces of each city, and induced them to subscribe cheerfully for the maintenance of the mercen­ aries and the expenses of the war.", "1378": "At this time, we are told by Theophrastus that, when the allies demanded that their contributions should be limited to some fixed sum, Krobylus the Athenian orator answered that war feeds not by a fixed allowance.*", "1379": "Greece was now in a flutter of expectation, and the people of Eubœa, Achaia, Corinth, Megara, Leukas and Korkyra were all in arms.", "1380": "Yet the hardest task of all still remained for Demosthenes to ac­ complish, namely, to induce the Thebans to join the alliance, because their territory bordered upon that of Athens, and their army was very important, for at that time Thebes was the most warlike state in Greece.", "1381": "It was no easy matter to win over the Thebans, who had just received signal assistance from Philip in their war against the Phokians, and so were inclined to take his side, besides which, their being such near neighbours to the Athenians caused perpetual jealousies and quarrels between the two countries, which were renewed upon the most trifling occasions.", "1382": "XVIII.", "1383": "Yet when Philip, excited by his success at Amphissa, suddenly marched to Elatea and made himself master of Phokis, when all the Athenians were panic- stricken, and no one dared to ascend the bema, or knew what to say, Demosthenes alone came forward and advised them to stand by the Thebans;", "1384": "and after having, after his wont, encouraged and comforted the people, he was sent with some others as ambassador to Thebes.", "1385": "We learn from the historian Marsyas that Philip, too, sent the Macedonians Amyntas and Klearchus, the Thessalian Daochus, and Thrasydaeus to Thebes to argue on his behalf.", "1386": "The Thebans on this occasion saw clearly enough on which side their interests lay, for the sufferings they had just endured in the Phokian war were still fresh in their memories;", "1387": "but we read in the history of Theopompus that the eloquence of Demosthenes so roused and inflamed their courage that all cold-blooded calculation of the chances, fear of the enemy, and considerations of expe­ diency were entirely lost sight of in the honourable enthusiasm created by his speech.", "1388": "So powerful did his oratory prove, that Philip at once sent an embassy to ask for terms of peace, while Greece stood erect and watchful.", "1389": "Not only the Athenian generals, but even the Boeotarchs took their orders from Demosthenes, and he was as power­ ful in the public assembly of the Thebans as in that of Athens, being beloved by both nations and possessed of a power which was not beyond his deserts, as Theopompus says, but which he well deserved.", "1390": "XIX.", "1391": "But some fatal destiny seemed now to have brought round the hour for the extinction of the liberties of Greece, and both counteracted his efforts, and also gave many ominous indications of what was to come.", "1392": "The Pythia at Delphi uttered terrible predictions, and an old oracle of the Sibyls was in every one's mouth, which ran as follows :", "1393": "-", "1394": "Far from the battle, on that fatal day Beside Thermodon may I flee away, Or view it as an eagle from the sky;", "1395": "There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.\"", "1396": "It is said that the Thermodon in a little rivulet near my own town of Chæronea which runs into the Kephisus.", "1397": "We Chæroneans nowadays do not know of any rivulet which is so called, but we suppose that the stream which we call Hæmon was at that period called the Thermodon;", "1398": "for it runs past the temple of Herakles, where the Greek army encamped:", "1399": "and we imagine that when the battle took place this stream was filled with blood and corpses, and became known by its present name.", "1400": "Yet the historian Douris writes that the Thermodon was not a river at all, but that some men while digging a trench round their tent found a small stone image, with an inscription saying that it represented a man named Thermodon carrying a wounded Amazon in his arms.", "1401": "Concerning this there was another oracle current, as follows -.­ \" Watch for Thermodon's field, thou sable crow, There shalt thou feed on human flesh enow.\"XX.", "1402": "It is hard in these matters to determine the exact truth:", "1403": "but, be this as it may, Demosthenes was greatly encouraged to see such a force of armed Greeks at his disposal, and, elated by their confidence and eagerness for battle would not allow them to pay any attention to oracles and predictions, but hinted that the Pythia was in Philip's pay, and reminded the Thebans of Epameinondas, and the Athenians of Perikles, both of whom regarded such considerations as mere pretexts for cowardice.", "1404": "Up to this point he behaved as a brave man should ;", "1405": "but in the battle - itself he performed no honourable exploit worthy of his speeches, but left his place in the ranks and ran away in a most shameful manner, throwing away his arms that he might run faster, and not hesitating to disgrace the motto of \" Good Luok,\" which Pytheas tells us was written in golden letters upon his shield.", "1406": "Immediately after the victory Philip, in insolent delight at his success, danced in a drunken revel among the corpses and sang the opening words of a decree of Demosthenes, which happened to form an iambio verse, as follows:", "1407": "­ \" Demosthenes Pæanian, son of Demosthenes,\" &c.", "1408": "When, however, he came to himself, and comprehended how great his danger had been, he trembled at the ability and power of an orator who had been able to force him in a few hours of one day to risk both his empire and his life.", "1409": "The fame of Demosthenes reached even to the King of Persia, and he sent letters to the Satraps who governed the provinces near the sea, bidding them offer money to Demosthenes, and pay him more attention than any other Greek, because he was able to effect a diversion in favour of Persia by keeping the King of Macedonia's hands full.", "1410": "This was afterwards discovered by Alexander, who found at Sardis letters from Demosthenes and papers belonging to the King's lieutenant, containing an account of the various sums of money which they had transmitted to him.", "1411": "XXI.", "1412": "When this great misfortune befel Greece, the political opponents of Demosthenes at once impeached him for his conduct;", "1413": "but the people not only acquitted him of the charges which they brought against him, but continued to treat him with great honour, and to ask for his advice.", "1414": "When the remains of those who had fallen at Cheeronea were brought home and buried, they chose him to make the funeral oration over them, and generally they bore their misfortunes with a noble spirit, not being excessively humbled and cast down, as Theopompus relates in his history, with a view to dramatic effect, but by showing especial honour and esteem for their principal adviser they proved that they did not repent of the policy which they had followed.", "1415": "Demosthenes pronounced the funeral oration over the fallen, but he never again pro­ posed a decree in the popular assembly in his own name, but always in that of some one of his friends, in order to avoid the evil omen of his own unlucky name, until he again took courage at the death of Philip, which took place shortly after his victory at Chæronea.", "1416": "This, it seems, was the meaning of the last verse of the oracle, \" There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.", "1417": "\"XXII.", "1418": "Demosthenes had secret intelligence of Philip's death, before it was publicly known.", "1419": "In order to inspirit the Athenians, he went with a cheerful countenance into the senate, and declared that he had dreamed that some great good fortune was in store for them.", "1420": "Not long after­ wards messengers arrived with the news of Philip's death.", "1421": "Upon this the Athenians made sacrifices of thanksgiving to the gods, and decreed a crown to Pausanias who slew Philip.", "1422": "Demosthenes also came abroad in a gay dress, and wearing a garland of flowers on his head, although his daughter had only been dead seven days.", "1423": "This cir­ cumstance is reported by iEschines, who reviles him for his conduct, and calls him an unnatural father, though he only proves the weakness and vulgarity of his own nature by supposing that noisy demonstrations of grief show ten­ derness of heart, and blaming those who bear their sorrows with dignity and composure.", "1424": "Yet I will not say that the Athenians did right to wear garlands and make merry at the death of a king who, after his victory, had dealt so gently with them when they were at his mercy;", "1425": "for it deserved the anger of the gods, and was a thoroughly low­ minded act to honour a man while he lived and elect him a citizen of Athens, and then when he fell by the hand of a stranger not to be able to contain themselves for joy, but to dance over his corpse and to sing paeans of victory, as if they themselves had done some great feat of arms.", "1426": "On the other hand, I praise Demosthenes for leaving his own home troubles to be wept for by the women of his household, and himself coming forward and doing what he imagined was best for his country.", "1427": "This shows a manly and patriotic spirit, which ever looks to the good of the community at large;", "1428": "and I think that in forcing his pri­ vate grief to give way to the public joy he acted well, and even outdid those actors who represent kings and autocrats on the

sorrow, but to admi­ nister consolation to him and to turn his thoughts tc pleasanter subjects, as physicians bid weak-eyed patients turn their eyes away from a distressing glare of light and direct them to green and soothing colours;", "1430": "and what better means of consolation could one possibly find when one's country is fortunate, than to bid one's friend merge his private grief in the public joy ?", "1431": "I have been led to make these reflections by observing that this speech of Æschines has had undue influence with many persons, because it makes a mistaken appeal to their tenderer feelings.", "1432": "XXIII.", "1433": "Now Demosthenes a second time began to rouse the states of Greece and reorganise the confederacy.", "1434": "The Thebans attacked their Macedonian garrison, and killed many of them, with arms furnished by Demosthenes, and the Athenians began to prepare to fight as their allies.", "1435": "Demosthenes reigned supreme in the popular assembly, and wrote to the Persian generals in Asia endeavouring to induce them to attack Alexander, whom he scoffed at as a child, and nicknamed Margites.*", "1436": "But when Alexander, after settling the affairs of his kingdom, marched with his army into Bœotia, the courage of the Athenians deserted them.", "1437": "Demosthenes himself quailed in terror, and the Thebans, forsaken by their allies, fought against Alex­ ander alone, and were utterly ruined.", "1438": "Upon this the Athenians, in an agony of terror, sent Demosthenes and several other orators on an embassy to Alexander;", "1439": "but he, fearing Alexander's fury, went no further than Mount Kithæron, and then returned home.", "1440": "Alexander now at once sent to Athens to demand that ten of her chief orators should be given up to him, according to the historians Idomeneus and Douris, though most of the more trust­ worthy writers say that he only asked for the eight fol­ lowing :", "1441": "—Demosthenes, Polyeuktus, Ephialtes, Lykurgus, Mœrokles, Demon, Kallisthenes and Charidemus.", "1442": "On this occasion Demosthenes told the people the fable of the sheep who gave up their watch-dogs to the wolves, explaining that he and the other orators were the watch-dogs who guarded the people, and calling Alexander the great wolf of Macedon.\"", "1443": "\"Moreover,\" said he, \"by delivering us up you really deliver up yourselves also, just as you see merchants selling whole cargoes of corn by small samples of a few grains which they carry about in a cup.\"", "1444": "This we learn from Aristobulus of Kassandrea.†", "1445": "As the Athe­ nians were quite at their wit's end, and knew not what to do, Demades at last agreed with the orators whose extra­ dition was demanded, that in consideration of a sum of five talents he would himself go to the king of Macedonia and intercede for them, either because he trusted in the friendship which existed between him and Alexander, or because he thought that he should find him like a lion that has been satiated with slaughter.", "1446": "Demades succeeded in saving their lives, and arranged terms of peace between the Athenians and Alexander.XXIV.", "1447": "After Alexander's departure Demades and his party were all powerful at Athens, and Demosthenes was completely humbled.", "1448": "He made an effort to assist the abortive attempts of Agis * King of Sparta, but as the Athe­ nians would not take part in the proposed rising, and the Lacedæmonians were crushed, he again retired into ob­ scurity.", "1449": "At this time also the action bought by Æschines against Ktesiphon about the Crown came on for trial.", "1450": "This action had been formally begun during the archon­ ship of Chærondas, a short time before the battle of Chaeronea, but it was not decided until ten years later, in the archonship of Aristophon.", "1451": "This, although a private action, attracted greater interest than any public one, both on account of the eloquence of the speakers on both sides and the spirited behaviour of the judges, who refused to truckle to the party in power, which had banished Demosthenes and which was slavishly subservient to Macedonia, but acquitted Demosthenes by such a splendid majority that Æschines did not obtain the fifth part of the votes.", "1452": "He in consequence at once left the city, and spent the remainder of his life at Rhodes and the other cities of the Ionian coast as a sophist and teacher of rhetoric.", "1453": "XXV.", "1454": "Shortly after this, Harpalus arrived in Athens from Asia, fleeing from Alexander, whom he feared to meet, both because he had grossly misconducted himself while in command of a province, and because Alexander had now become a capricious tyrant, terrible even to his friends.", "1455": "When he sought refuge with the Athenians, and placed himself, his ships, and his treasure in their hands, the other orators, casting longing glances at his wealth, at once pleaded for him, and advised the Athe­ nians to receive and protect the suppliant.", "1456": "Demosthenes at first advised them to send Harpalus away, and take care not to involve the city in war by such unjust and uncalled­ for proceedings:", "1457": "but a few days afterwards when an inventory was being taken of Harpalus's property, he, seeing that Demosthenes was admiring a golden Persian drinking cup and examining the sculptures with which it was enriched, bade him take it in his hands and observe the weight of the gold.", "1458": "Demosthenes was surprised at the weight, and asked how much it would fetch.", "1459": "Harpalus answered with a smile, \" It will fetch you twenty talents :", "1460": "\" and as soon as it was dark he sent the cup and the twenty talents to the house of Demosthenes.", "1461": "Harpalus had very cleverly fathomed the character of Demosthenes by observing the loving and eager glances with which he eyed this cup;", "1462": "for he received the bribe and went over to the side of Harpalus, just as if he were a city which had received a foreign garrison.", "1463": "Next morning he carefully bandaged his throat with woollen wrappers, and proceeded to the assembly, where, when called upon to rise and speak, he made signs that he had lost his voice.", "1464": "Witty men said that the orator had not caught a sore throat, but a silver quinsy during the night.", "1465": "Soon the whole people learned that he had been bribed, and as they would not listen to him when he rose to explain his conduct, but hooted and groaned, some one rose and said, \" Men of Athens, will you not listen to a man who has such a golden tongue?\"", "1466": "The people thereupon sent Harpalus away, and fearing that inquiry might be made after the treasure which the orators had received, they instituted a vigorous search through every man's house, except that of Kallikles the son of Arrhenides, which they would not allow to be searched because his newly-married wife was there.", "1467": "These particulars we learn from the history of Theo­ pompus.", "1468": "XXVI.", "1469": "Demosthenes, wishing to put a good face on the matter, passed a decree in the assembly, that the senate of the Areopagus should enquire into the matter, and punish those who were found guilty.", "1470": "However he was one of the first whom the senate found guilty:", "1471": "and, although he came into court and pleaded his cause, he was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, and was imprisoned in default.", "1472": "Overwhelmed with shame at this disgrace, and being also in weak health, he could not bear to remain in prison, and made his escape with the secret assistance of his keepers.", "1473": "We read that after he had got a short distance from Athens he saw that he was being pursued by several of his political opponents, and tried to hide from them.", "1474": "When, however, they came up to him, addressed him by his name, and begged him to receive money for his journey from them, assuring him that they had brought it to give to him and had pursued him for no other reason, Demos­ thenes burst into tears and exclaimed:", "1475": "\" I may well be sorry to leave a home where my very enemies treat me with more kindness than any friends I am likely to find abroad will do.\"", "1476": "Demosthenes was much depressed by his banishment, and spent most of his time in Trœzene or Ægina, looking towards Attica with tears in his eyes.", "1477": "He is said during his exile to have uttered many unmanly sentiments, very unworthy of his bold speeches when in power.", "1478": "On leaving the city he stretched out his hands towards the Acropolis and exclaimed :", "1479": "\" Athena, patroness of Athens, why dost thou delight in those three savage creatures, the owl, the snake, and the people ? \"", "1480": "He used to dissuade the young men whom he met and conversed with during his travels from taking part in political life, and would say that such were the miseries, the fears, the jealousies, backbitings, and ceaseless struggles by which a public man is beset, that if at the outset of his life he had known them, and had been offered his choice between two courses, one leading to the bema and the public assembly, and the other to utter annihilation, he would unhesitatingly have chosen the latter.", "1481": "XXVII.", "1482": "While he was in exile Alexander died, and the Hellenic confederacy was again revived under Leosthenes, a brave general, who shut up Antipater in Lauria and besieged him there.", "1483": "Now, Pytheas the orator and Kalli.", "1484": "medon, surnamed the \" crab,\" who were exiled from Athens, joined Antipater, and travelled about Greece in company with his friends and ambassadors, urging the cities not to join the Athenians and revolt from Mace­ donia.", "1485": "Demosthenes, on the other hand, joined the embassy sent out by Athens and co-operated with them, striving to induce the Greeks to rise against the Mace­ donianis and drive them out of Greece.", "1486": "In Arcadia, Phylarchus tells us that a wordy battle took place between Pytheas and Demosthenes at a public meeting in which Pytheas was advocating the cause of Macedonia, and Demosthenes that of Greece.", "1487": "Pytheas said that we may always know that there is sickness in a house if we see asses' milk carried into it, and that a city must be in a bad way if it received an embassy from Athens", "1488": "To this Demosthenes answered by turning his own illus­ tration against him, for, he said, asses' milk is brought into houses to cure the sick, and Athenians come into other cities to save them from ruin.", "1489": "The people of Athens were so delighted with the conduct of Demosthenes in this matter that they decreed his restoration.", "1490": "The decree was proposed by Demon, one of the township of Pæania, and a cousin of Demosthenes;", "1491": "and a trireme was sent to Ægina to fetch him home.", "1492": "When he landed at Peiraeus he was met by the whole people, and by all the priests and archons, all of whom greeted him warmly.", "1493": "On this occasion, Demetrius of Magnesia relates that he raised his hands to heaven and congratulated himself on having returned home more gloriously than Alkibiades, because he had persuaded, not forced, his countrymen to receive him back.", "1494": "As the fine imposed upon him still remained in force, for the people could not alter a verdict at their pleasure, they made use of a legal fiction.", "1495": "It was the custom at the festival of Zeus the Preserver to pay a sum of money to those who ornamented the altar for the sacrifice:", "1496": "they charged Demosthenes with this office, and ordered him to execute it for the sum of fifty talents, which was the amount of his fine.", "1497": "XXVIII.", "1498": "He did not, however, long enjoy his restora­ tion, for the Greeks were soon utterly ruined.", "1499": "In the month of Metageitnion *

that Antipater and Kraterus were marching upon Athens, Demosthenes and his party escaped out of the city, and the people, at the instance of Demades, condemned them to death.", "1501": "As they had dispersed to all quarters of Greece, Antipater sent men in pursuit of them, the chief of whom was Archias, who was surnamed the Exile-hunter.", "1502": "This man, who was a citizen of Thurii, is said once to have been a tragic actor, and to have studied his art under the celebrated Polus of Ægina.", "1503": "Hermippus reckons Archias among the pupils of the orator Lakritus, while Demetrius tells us that he was a student of philosophy of the school of Anaximenes.", "1504": "This Archias tore away from the shrine of Æakus at Ægina the orator Hypereides, Aristonikus of Marathon, and Himeræus, the brother of Demetrius of Phalerum, who had taken sanctuary there, and sent them to Antipater at Kleonæ, where they were put to death.", "1505": "It is even said that Hypereides had his tongue cut out.", "1506": "XXIX.", "1507": "Hearing that Demosthenes was sitting as a suppliant in the temple of Poseidon at Kalauria,† Archias crossed over thither in some small boats with a guard of Thracian mercenaries, and tried to persuade Demosthenes to leave the temple and accompany him to Antipater, promising that he should not be ill-treated.", "1508": "Demosthenes had a strange dream the night before that he was con­ tending with Archias in acting a play, and that although he acted well and delighted his audience, yet he was beaten by Archias, who was better furnished with stage properties and appliances.", "1509": "Wherefore, when Archias tried to cajole him, Demosthenes looked him full in the face, and, without rising, said, \"Archias, your acting never affected me on the stage, nor will your promises now.\"", "1510": "Upon this Archias became angry, and savagely threatened him.", "1511": "\"Now,\" said Demosthenes, \"you speak like the true Macedonian that you are;", "1512": "but just now you were acting a part.", "1513": "So now wait for a little while until I have sent a letter home.\"", "1514": "Saying this, he retired into the inner part of the temple, took his tablets as though about to write, placed his pen in his mouth and bit it, as he was wont to do when meditating what he should write, and after remaining so for some time, covered his head with his robe and leaned it on his arms.", "1515": "The soldiers standing at the door of the temple jeered at him for a coward, and Archias walked up to him and bade him rise, repeating his assurance that he would make Antipater his friend.", "1516": "Demosthenes, as soon as he perceived that the poison was beginning to work upon him, uncovered his head, and, looking steadfastly at Archias, said, \" Now,

it was contained in his pen,* as has been related.", "1521": "But one Pappas, from whom Hermippus has borrowed his account of the scene, says that when Demosthenes fell before the altar, in his tablets were found written the opening words of a letter, \"Demosthenes to Antipater,\" and nothing more.", "1522": "All were surprised at the suddenness of his death, but the Thracian mercenaries at the door declared that they saw him take the poison out of a little cloth and put it into his mouth.", "1523": "They imagined that what he swallowed was gold but a maidservant that waited on him told Archias, in answer to his inquiries, that Demosthenes had for a long time carried about a packet containing poison, to be used in case of need.", "1524": "Eratosthenes himself writes that Demosthenes carried the poison in a hollow bracelet which he wore on his arm.", "1525": "It would be tedious to notice all the discrepancies to be found in the nume­ rous accounts which have been written of the death of Demosthenes;", "1526": "but I will mention that Demochares, a relative of Demosthenes, states his belief that he did not die by poison, but by the provident care of the gods, who rescued him from the cruelty of the Macedonians by a swift and painless death.", "1527": "He perished on the sixteenth day of the month Pyanepsion, which is observed as a day of the strictest fasting and humiliation by the women who celebrate the festival of the Thesmophoria.*", "1528": "The people of Athens soon afterwards bestowed on Demos­ thenes the honours which he deserved, by erecting a brazen statue in memory of him, and decreeing that the eldest of his family should be maintained in the Prytaneum for ever.", "1529": "On the base of the statue was inscribed the celebrated couplet:",

Demosthenes himself composed this couplet in Kalauria just before he took the poison.", "1533": "XXXI.", "1534": "A short time before my own first visit to Athens, the following incident is said to have taken place.", "1535": "A soldier, being summoned by his commanding officer to be tried for some offence, placed all his money in the hands of the statue of Demosthenes, which are represented as clasped together.", "1536": "Beside the statue grew a small plane-tree, and several leaves of this tree, either blown there by chance, or placed there on purpose by the soldier, concealed and covered up the money, so that it remained there a long while.", "1537": "At last the soldier returned and found it, and as the circumstance became widely known, many literary men seized the opportunity of first of the family who got the cognomen of Cicero * must have been a man of note, and this was the reason why his descendants did not reject the name, but were well pleased with it, though it was a matter of jeering to many :", "1538": "for the Latins call a vetch Cicer, and the first Cicero had at the end of his nose a cleft or split, slightly marked as we may suppose, like the cleft in a vetch, whence he got the cognomen.", "1539": "Indeed Cicero himself, the subject of this Life, on his friends advising him when he was first a candidate for office and began to engage in public life, to get rid of the name and take another, is reported to have boldly replied that he would strive to make the name of Cicero more glorious than that of Scaurus and Catulus.", "1540": "While he was quæstor in Sicily, and causing a silver offering to the gods to be made, he had inscribed on it his first two names, Marcus and Tullius, but in place of the third he jocosely ordered the artist to cut the figure of a vetch by the side of the characters.", "1541": "This then is what is recorded about the name.", "1542": "II.", "1543": "They say that Cicero's mother gave birth t to him, after a painless and easy labour, on the third day of the new calends, on which the magistrates now offer up prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the Emperor.", "1544": "It is said that a vision appeared to his nurse and foretold her that she was nurturing a great blessing for all Romans.", "1545": "Such things as these are generally considered to be mere dreams and idle talk, but in his case Cicero soon showed that it was a real prophecy when he was of age to be taught, for he was conspicuous for his natural talent and got a name and reputation among the boys, so that their fathers used to visit the schools out of desire to see Cicero, and to inquire of his famed quickness and capacity for learning;", "1546": "but the ill-educated part were angry with their sons when they saw them giving Cicero a place in the midst of them in the public roads by way of honour.", "1547": "Cicero, who had a talent, such as Plato* requires in a nature that loves learning and loves wisdom, for embrac­ ing all knowledge and undervaluing no kind of learning and discipline, happened to show a strong inclination to poetry:", "1548": "and indeed a small poem of his is still preserved, which was written when he was a boy:", "1549": "it is entitled Pontius Glaucus,t and is in tetrameter verse.", "1550": "In the course of time he applied himself to the Muse of such arts with still more versatility, and got the reputation of being not only the first orator, but also the best poet ‡ among the Romans.", "1551": "Now his oratorical reputation con­ tinues to the present day, though there has been no small innovation in matters that concern eloquence;", "1552": "but as to his poetical reputation, owing to many poets of genius who have come after him, its fate has been to die III.", "1553": "away altogether unknown to fame and unhonoured.", "1554": "After being released from his youthful studies, he heard Philo * of the Academy, whom of all the scholars of Kleitomachus, the Romans admired most for his eloquence and loved most for his manners.", "1555": "At the same time by his intimacy with the Mucii,† who were statesmen and leaders in the Senate, he was aided in getting some knowledge of the law;", "1556": "and for a time, also, he served in the army under Sulla in the Marsic war.t", "1557": "But seeing that matters were coming to a civil war, feand from a civil war to apure monarchy, betaking ofquiet contemplation, he kept company with learned Gree ks andapplliedhimself to the sciences until Sulla hadgot the mastery, and the state seemed to have received a settlement.", "1558": "During this time Chrysogonus,§ a freedman of Sulla, having laid an information about a man's property as being one of those who were put to death during the proscriptions, bought it for two thousand drachmam.", "1559": "Roscius, the son and heir of the dead man, complained of this, and showed that the property was of the value of two hundred and fifty talents, on which Sulla, being convicted, was angry, and with the assistance of Chrysogonus instituted a prosecution against Roscius for parricide.", "1560": "No one gave Roscius help, but all were deterred through fear of the severity of Sulla, on which the young man in his desolate condition had recourse to Cicero, who was also importuned by his friends, who urged that he would never again have a more splendid opportunity of gaining a reputation nor a more honourable.", "1561": "Accordingly Cicero undertook the defence, and gained credit -by his success;", "1562": "but, being afraid of Sulla, he went into Greece,.", "1563": "giving out that his bodily health required care.", "1564": "And indeed he was lean and had little flesh, and owing to weakness of stomach, he took little food, and that of a light kind late in the day;", "1565": "his voice was full and good, but hard and unmanageable, and owing to the vehemence and passion of his language being continually carried through the higher notes it gave him alarm about his health.", "1566": "IV.", "1567": "On his arrival at Athens t he became a hearer of Antiochus of Askalon, being pleased with the easy flow of his speech and his graceful manner, but he did not like his doctrinal innovations.", "1568": "For Antiochus was now seceding from what is called the New Academy, and deserting the sect of Karneades;", "1569": "whether it was that he was influenced by the evidence and by the senses, or as some say, through rivalry and differences with the followers of Kleitomachus and the partisans of Philo, he was changing to be a cultivator of the Stoic principle in most things.", "1570": "But Cicero liked the other doctrines better, and attached himself to them in preference, intending, if he should altogether be excluded from public affairs, to remove himself to Athens from the Forum and public life and live there in tranquillity with philosophy.", "1571": "But when news came that Sulla was dead and his body being strengthened by discipline was attaining a vigorous habit, and his voice being now brought under manage­ ment had become pleasant to the ear and powerful, and was suitably adapted to his habit of body, and his friends from Rome were sending him many letters and exhortations, and Antiochus strongly urged him to engage in public affairs, he began anew to fashion his oratorical power, as If it were an instrument, and to, rouse afresh his political capacity, by exercising himself in the proper discipline and attending the rhetoricians of repute.", "1572": "Accordingly he sailed to Asia and Rhodes;", "1573": "* and among the Asiatic orators he attended the instruction of Xenokles of Adramyttium, and Dionysius of Magnesia, and Menip­ pus of Caria ;", "1574": "and in Rhodes, the rhetorician Apollonius, the son of Molo, and the philosopher Poseidonius.", "1575": "It is said that Apollonius, who did not understand the Latin language, requested Cicero to perform his exercises in Greek;", "1576": "and that Cicero readily complied, thinking.", "1577": "that his faults would thus be better corrected.", "1578": "When he had finished his exercise, all the rest were amazed, and vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius, while he was listening to Cicero, showed no approbation, and when Cicero had finished he sat for a long time wrapped in thought;", "1579": "and as Cicero showed his dissatis­ faction, he said, \" You indeed, Cicero, I commend and admire, but I pity the fortune of Greece seeing that the only excellent things which were left to us have been transferred to the Romans by you, learning and eloquence.", "1580": "\"V. Now Cicero, full of hope in his course to a political career, had his ardour dulled by an oracular answer.", "1581": "For on consulting the god at Delphi * how he might get most fame, the Pythia bade him make his own nature, and not the opinion of the many, his guide in life.", "1582": "At first he lived with reserve at Rome, and was slow in offering himself for magistracies, and was undervalued, being called Greek and pedant, names current among and familiar to the lowest citizens.", "1583": "But as he was naturally ambitious and was urged on by his father and friends, he devoted himself to assisting persons in their causes, and he did not approach the highest distinction by gradual steps, but at once blazed forth in reputation, and was far superior to those who exerted themselves in the Forum.", "1584": "It is said that he was as defective as Demosthenes in action, and that accordingly he carefully devoted himself first to Roscius t the comedian, and then to Æsopus the tragedian.", "1585": "Of this AEsopus it is told, that when he was representing on the stage Atreus deliberating how he should revenge himself on Thyestes, and one of the servants suddenly ran past him, being transported out of his reason by his feelings he struck the man with his sceptre and killed him.", "1586": "Cicero derived no small power of persuasion from his action. ‡", "1587": "He used scoffingl y to say of the orators who bawled loud,§ that because of their weak­ ness they had recourse to shouting, like lame men leaping on horses.", "1588": "His readiness at sarcasm and other sharp sayings was considered well adapted to courts of justice and clever, but by over use of it he gave offence to many and got the character of an ill-disposed person.", "1589": "VI.", "1590": "Being elected quaestor * at a time of scarcity of corn, and having got Sicily as his province, he gave offence to the people at first by compelling them to send corn to Home.", "1591": "But afterwards, when they had proof of his care and justice and mildness, they respected him as they never had any governor before.", "1592": "And when many young Romans of good repute and noble birth, who were under a charge of neglect of discipline and bad behaviour in the war, were sent up to the prætor of Sicily, Cicero pleaded for them in a remarkable manner, and gained their acquittal.", "1593": "Being accordingly greatly elated at all this, on his journey to Rome, as he tells us, a ludicrous incident happened to him.", "1594": "In Campania t falling in with a man of rank, whom he considered to be a friend of his, he asked him what the Romans said about his conduct in Sicily, and what they thought of it, supposing that the city was full of his name and of his measures, and upon the man replying, \" But where have you been all this time Cicero ? \" he was completely dispirited that his fame was lost in the city as in a boundless sea and had produced no glorious result to his reputation;", "1595": "but on reflection he abated much of his ambition, considering that he was striving for fame as for a thing indefinite and one which had no attainable limit.", "1596": "However all along there abided in him an exceeding love of praise and a strong passion for fame, which often disturbed much of his sound judgment.", "1597": "VII.", "1598": "But when he began to engage more actively in public concerns, he thought it a shame that artisans, who make use of inanimate instruments and tools, should be acquainted with the name of each and its place and use, and that the political man, whose public acts are effected by the agency of men, should be indolent and indifferent about the knowledge of his fellow-citizens.", "1599": "Accordingly he not only accustomed himself to remember persons' names, but he also knew the place in which every man of note dwelt, and the spot where he had his property, and the friends with whom he was familiar and his neighbours ;", "1600": "and whatever road in Italy he was traversing, Cicero could easily tell and point out the lands and houses of his friends.", "1601": "As he had only a small property, though sufficient and adequate to his expenses, he obtained credit by accepting neither pay nor presents for his services as an advocate, and most particularly by his undertaking the prosecution against Verres,* who had been prætor of Sicily.", "1602": "Verres, who had been guilty of great malversa­ tion, was prosecuted by the Sicilians, and Cicero caused his conviction, not by speeches, but in a manner, as one may say, by not speaking at all.", "1603": "For as the prætors favoured Verres, and were putting off the trial to the last day by adjournments and tricks, and it was clear that the space of one day would not be sufficient for the speeches and the trial would not be brought to a conclusion, Cicero got up and said that the case required no speeches, and bringing forward the witnesses and taking their evidence he told the judices to give their vote.", "1604": "Yet many lively sayings of his at that trial are recorded.", "1605": "The Romans call a castrated hog \" verres.\"", "1606": "Now when a man of the class of libertini named Cæcilius, who was under the imputation of Judaism, wished to put aside the Siceliots and be the prosecutor of Verres, Cicero said \"", "1607": "What has a Jew to do with a verres ? \"", "1608": "Verres also had a son grown up, who was reputed not to have regard to his youthful beauty as a person of free birth ought to have.", "1609": "Accordingly when Cicero was reviled for his effeminacy by Verres, he replied, \" A man should find fault with his sons at home.\" *", "1610": "The orator Hortensius did not venture directly to defend the cause of Verres, yet he was induced to give him his assistance when the damages were assessed, for which he had received an ivory sphinx as his reward.", "1611": "Upon Cicero saying something to him in an oblique way, and Hortensius replying that he had no skill in solving ænigmas, Cicero answered, \" And yet you have the sphinx t at home.\"", "1612": "VIII.", "1613": "Verres being convicted, Cicero laid the damages at seventy-five ten thousands, and yet he fell under suspicion of having lowered the damages ‡ for a bribe.", "1614": "However the Siceliots were grateful, and during his ædileship * they came and brought many things from the island, from none of which did Cicero make any gain, but he availed himself of the men's desire to honour him so far as to cheapen the market.", "1615": "He possessed a fine place at Arpi,t and he had an estate near Naples, and another near Pompeii,‡ neither of them large:", "1616": "he had also the marriage portion of his wife Terentia § to the amount of ten ten thousands, and a bequest which amounted to nine ten thousands of denarii.", "1617": "With these means he lived honourably and moderately, enjoying the company of the Greeks who were familiar with him, and of the Romans of learning :", "1618": "he rarely, if ever, lay down to table before sunset, and not so much because of his occupa­ tions, as because of his health, which suffered much from the stomach.", "1619": "He was also exact and careful in other matters that concerned the care of his body, and he employed both friction and walking a fixed number of times.", "1620": "By thus regulating his habit of body he main­ tained it free from disease, and equal to undergo many and great trials and labours.", "1621": "He gave up his father's house to his brother, and he fixed his own residence on the Palatine, in order that those who paid their respects to him might not be troubled by coming a great distance ;", "1622": "and people used to come daily to his doors to pay their respects, no fewer than those who waited on Crassus because of his wealth, and on Pompeius because of his influence with the soldiers, which two were at that time highest in repute and chief of the Romans.", "1623": "Pompeius also courted Cicero, and Cicero'a policy contributed greatly to the power and credit of Pompeius.", "1624": "IX.", "1625": "Though there were many candidates with him for the prætorship,* and men of note, he was proclaimed first of all;", "1626": "and he was considered to have discharged his judicial functions with integrity and skill.", "1627": "It is said that Licinius Macer, a man who of himself had great weight in the city, and who was also supported by Crassus, being tried before Cicero for peculation, was so confident in his power and the exertions made on his behalf, that while the judices were giving their votes he went home, and after cutting his hair with all speed, and putting on a clean dress, as if he had been acquitted, he was about to return to the Forum;", "1628": "but on Crassus meeting him near the hall door and telling him that he was condemned by all the votes, he turned back, took to his bed and died.", "1629": "And the circumstance brought Cicero credit for his careful administration of justice.", "1630": "Vatinius t was a man whose manner was somewhat rough and contemptuous towards the magistrates when he was pleading before them, and his neck was full of swellings:", "1631": "on one occasion when he was before Cicero, he made a certain demand, and as Cicero did not grant it forthwith, but deliberated some time, Vatinius said that he should not hesitate about it if he were prator, on which Cicero quickly answered, \" But I have not such a neck as you.\"", "1632": "While Cicero had still two or three days in his office, some person brought Manilius* before him on a charge of peculation;", "1633": "but Manilius had the goodwill of the people and their zeal in his favour, as it was considered that he was attacked on account of Pompeius, whose friend he was.", "1634": "On Manilius asking for time Cicero gave him only one day, which was the next;", "1635": "and the people were angry, inasmuch as the prætors were accustomed to allow ten days at least to those who were accused.", "1636": "The tribunes also brought Cicero to the Rostra and found fault with him, but he prayed to be heard, and he said that as he had always behaved to accused persons with forbearance and kindness, so far as the laws allowed, he thought it would be harsh not to do so in the case of Manilius, and accordingly he had purposely limited him to the only day which was at his disposal as prætor, for that to throw the trial into the period of another prætor's jurisdiction was not the part of one who was willing to help another.", "1637": "These words wrought a wonderful change in the people, and with many expressions of good­ will they prayed him to undertake the defence of Manilius.", "1638": "Cicero readily undertook it, and chiefly for the sake of Pompeius who was absent, and coming before the people he again harangued them, in bold terms censuring the oligarchal faction and the enviers of Pompeius.", "1639": "X. Cicero was invited to the consulship!", "1640": "no less by the aristocratical party than by the many who for the interest of the state gave him their aid, and for the following reason.", "1641": "The changes which Sulla had intro­ duced into the constitution at first appeared unseasonable, but now they seemed to the many by length of time and usage to have received a kind of settlement, and not a bad one ;", "1642": "but there were those who sought to shake and change the present condition of affairs for the sake of their own gain and not for the public good, while Pom­ peius was still fighting with the kings in Pontus and Armenia, and there was no power in Rome able to resist those who were for change.", "1643": "These men had for their head a bold man and an ambitious and one of versatile temper, Lucius Catilina, who in addition to other great crimes had once laboured under the imputation of unlaw­ ful commerce with his virgin daughter, and of murdering his own brother,.", "1644": "and being afraid of being punished for this he persuaded Sulla to proscribe his brother among those who were doomed to die, as if he were still alive.", "1645": "Him the evil-minded took for their leader, and they gave various pledges to one another, and among these they sacrificed a man and ate of his flesh.", "1646": "† Catilina had corrupted a large part of the youth in the city by supplying every one of them with pleasure and banquets, and amours with women, and furnishing unsparingly the expense for all this.", "1647": "All Etruria was roused to revolt, and the greater part of Gaul within the Alps:", "1648": "and Rome was exposed to the greatest hazard of change, on account of the inequality in properties, for those who had most reputation and lofty bearing had impoverished themselves by theatrical expenses and entertainments, and love of magistracies and building, and the wealth had all come into the bands of men of mean birth and low persons, 30 that things needed only a slight inclination, and it was in the power of every man who had courage for the thing to unsettle the state, which of itself was in a diseased condition.", "1649": "XI.", "1650": "However Catilina, wishing to secure a stronghold, was a candidate for the consulship, and he was high in hope that he should be the colleague of Caius Antonius, a man who of himself was not calculated to be a leader either for good or bad, but one who would add force to another who was a leader.", "1651": "It was from seeing this that the majority of the honourable and the good en­ couraged Cicero to the consulship, and as the people readily seconded them, Catilina was rejected, and Cicero and Caius Antonius were elected.", "1652": "And yet Cicero alone of the candidates was the son of an eques, not of a senator.", "1653": "XII.", "1654": "Now the designs of Catilina still remained un­ known to the many, but great struggles awaited the consulship of Cicero.", "1655": "For in the first place, those who by the laws of Bulla were excluded from magistracies, being neither weak nor few, became candidates and attempted to gain popular favour, and they made many charges against the tyranny of Bulla which were indeed true and just, but yet they were disturbing the state of affairs at an unfit time and out of season;", "1656": "and in the next place the tribunes brought forward measures to the same purpose, in which they proposed an administration com­ posed of ten men * with full powers, whose instructions were to have authority to sell the public property in all Italy and in all Syria, and all that had lately been ac­ quired by Pompeius, to try whom they pleased, to send them into exile, to colonise cities, to take money from the treasury, and to maintain and raise as many soldiers as they might require.", "1657": "Accordingly others of the nobles were in favour of the law, and especially Antonius, the colleague of Cicero, who expected to be one of the ten.", "1658": "It was supposed also that he was acquainted with the designs of Catilina, and was not averse to them on account of the magnitude of his debts, which chiefly gave alarm to the nobles.", "1659": "And this was the first object that Cicero directed his attention to, and he caused the province of Macedonia t to be given to Antonius, and Gaul, which was offered to himself, he declined;", "1660": "and by these favours he gained over Antunius like a hired actor to play a second part to himself on behalf of his country.", "1661": "Now when Antonius was gained and had become tractable, Cicero, being emboldened, opposed himself to those who were for making change.", "1662": "Accordingly, in the Senate, he made an attack upon the law, and so alarmed the promoters of it that they had nothing to say against him.", "1663": "When they made a second attempt, and being fully prepared invited the consuls to appear before the people, Cicero, nothing alarmed, bade the Senate follow him, and coming forward, he not only caused the rejection of the law, but made the tribunes give up even the rest of their measures and to yield to his overpowering eloquence.", "1664": "XIII.", "1665": "For this man moot of all showed the Romans what a charm eloquence adds to a good thing, and that justice is invincible if it be rightly expressed in words, and that it befits him who dulydirects political affairs, always in his acts to choose the good instead of that which merely pleases, and in his speech to deprive what is useful of that which gives pain.", "1666": "And a sample of his­ persuasiveeloquence was what happened in his consul­ ship with respect to the public exhibitions.", "1667": "In former times those of the equestrian class were mingled with the crowd in the theatres and were spectators among the people, just as chance would have it;", "1668": "but Marcus Otho* in his prætorship was the first who, for the sake of dis­ tinction, separated the equites from the rest of the citizens, and gave them a particular place, which they still retain", "1669": "The people took this as a disparagement of themselves, and when Otho appeared in the theatre, they hissed for the purpose of insulting him, but the equites received him with loud applause.", "1670": "Again the people began to hiss louder, and the equites to make still greater plaudits.", "1671": "Upon this they fell to abusing one another, and kept the theatre in confusion.", "1672": "When Cicero heard of this he came, and summoning the people to the temple of Bellona both rebuked and admonished them, on which they went back to the theatre and loudly applauded Otho, and vied with the equites in doing honour to the man and showing their respect.", "1673": "0XIV.", "1674": "The conspirators with Catilina t at first crouched and were afraid, but they recovered heart, and assembling together urged one another to take matters in hand with more courage before Pompeius returned, who was said to be now coming home with his force.", "1675": "Catilina was chiefly stirred up by the old soldiers of Sulla, who were planted all through Italy, but the greatest number and the most warlike of them were distributed in the Tuscan cities, and were again forming visions of robbery and plunder of the wealth that existed.", "1676": "These men, with Manlius t for their leader, one of those who had served with distinction under Bulla, were on the side of Catilina, and came to Rome to assist at the Comitia;", "1677": "for Catilina was again a candidate for the consulship, and had resolved to kill Cicero in the tumult of the elections.", "1678": "The dæmon also seemed to pre-signify what was going on by earth­ quakes and lightnings and sights.", "1679": "The information from human testimony was indeed clear, but not sufficient for conviction of a man of reputation and great power, like Catilina.", "1680": "Wherefore Cicero deferred the day of election, and summoning Catilina to the Senate questioned him about what was reported.", "1681": "Catilina, thinking that there were many in the Senate who were desirous of change, and at the same time wishing to make a display before the conspirators, gave Cicero an insane answer:", "1682": "“ What am I doing so strange, if when there are two bodies, one lean and wasted, but with a head, and the other headless, but strong and large, I myself furnish it with a head ? \"*", "1683": "This allusion of his was to the Senate and to the people, which made Cicero more alarmed, and putting on his armour he was conducted by all the nobles from his house and by many of the young men to the Campus Martius.", "1684": "And he purposely let the people have a glimpse of his armour by loosing his tunic from his shoulders, and he showed the spectators there was danger.", "1685": "The people were enraged and rallied round him, and at last by their votes they again rejected Catilina, and chose Silanus t and Murena consuls.", "1686": "XV.", "1687": "Not long after the men in Etruria came together to support Catilina, and were forming themselves into companies;", "1688": "and the appointed day for executing their plan was near, when there came to Cicero'a house about midnight men who were among the first and most power­ ful in Rome, Marcus Crassus, and Marcus Marcellus,* and Scipio Metellus;", "1689": "and knocking at the door and calling the door-keeper, they bade him rouse Cicero and tell him that they were there.", "1690": "And the matter was thus:", "1691": "after Crassus had supped, the door-keeper gave him letters brought by some unknown man, which were addressed to different persons, and one to Crassus himself without a signature.", "1692": "Crassus, having read this letter only, and seeing that the letter intimated that there would be great bloodshed caused by Catilina and that it urged him to quit the city, did not open the rest, but went forthwith to Cicero in alarm at the danger, and desiring to acquit himself somewhat of the blame which he bore on account of his friendship with Catilina.", "1693": "Accordingly Cicero after deliberating convened the Senate at daybreak, and taking the letters gave them to the persons to whom they were directed, and bade them read the letters aloud:", "1694": "and all the letters alike gave notice of a conspiracy.", "1695": "When Quintus Arrius, a man of praetorian rank, reported the forming of armed companies in Etruria, and news arrived that Manlius with a large force was hovering about those cities expecting every moment something new from Rome, a decree of the Senate was made to put affairs in the hands of the consuls, and that the consuls on receiving this com­ mission should administer the state as they best could, and save it.", "1696": "The Senate is not used to do this frequently, but only when they apprehend great danger.", "1697": "XVI.", "1698": "Cicero upon receiving this authority intrusted affairs out of the city to Quintus Metellus;", "1699": "he undertook the care of the city himself, and he daily went forth guarded by so large a body of men, that when he entered the Forum those who accompanied him occupied a large part of the ground, whereupon Catilina, no longer enduring delay, resolved to make his escape to Manlius, and he corn­ missioned Malcius * and Cethegus to arm themselves with swords, and going to Cicero's door in the morning on pretence of paying their respects, to fall on him and kill him.", "1700": "Fulvia.t a woman of rank, reported this to Cicero by night, and exhorted him to be on his guard against Cethegus and his associate.", "1701": "The men came at daybreak, and as they were not permitted to enter, they fell to rail­ ing and abuse at the doors, which made them still more suspected.", "1702": "Cicero going out called the Senate to the temple of Jupiter the Stayer, whom the Romans call Stator, which is situated at the commencement of the Sacred Road as you go up to the Palatine.", "1703": "Catilina also came there with the rest to make his defence, but none of the senators would sit down with him, and all moved from the bench.", "1704": "Catilina began to speak, but he was interrupted by cries, and at last Cicero got up and bade him leave the city;", "1705": "for he said it was fit that as he was administering affairs with words and Catilina with arms, there should be a wall t between them.", "1706": "Accordingly Catilina immediately left the city with three hundred armed men, and surrounding himself with fasces and axes as if he were a magistrate, and raising standards he marched to Manlius;", "1707": "and as about twenty thousand men altogether were collected, he visited the cities and en­ deavoured to persuade them to revolt, so that there was open war, and Antonius was sent to fight with the now rebels.", "1708": "XVII.", "1709": "Those who remained in the city of the persona who had been corrupted by Catilina were assembled and encouraged by Cornelius Lentulus Sura,* a man of illus­ trious birth, but who had lived a bad life and been already expelled from the Senate on account of his licentious habits.", "1710": "Ho was then prætor for the second time, as is the custom for those who recover the senatorial dignity.", "1711": "It is said that he got the name Sura from the following circumstance.", "1712": "In the times of Sulla he was quaestor, and lost and wasted much of the public money.", "1713": "Sulla was angry at this, and called him to account before the Senate;", "1714": "but Lentulus, coming forward in a very indifferent and contemptuous way, said that he had no account to give, but he offered his leg, as boys were wont to do when they had made a miss in playing at ball.", "1715": "From this he got the nickname of Sura, for the Romans call the leg ‛ sura.'", "1716": "Again, being brought to trial he bribed some of the judices, and was acquitted by two votes only, whereon he said that what he had given to one of the judices was fairly wasted, for it was enough to be acquitted by a single vote.", "1717": "Such being the character of the man, and being stirred up by Catilina, he was further corrupted by the vain hopes held out by false prophets and jugglers, who recited forged verses and predictions, alleged to be from the Sibylline books, which declared that it was the law of fate that three Cornelii should be monarchs in Rome, two of whom had fulfilled their destiny, Cinnat and Sulla, and that the daemon was come and had brought the monarchy to him the third of the Cornelii, and he ought by all means to accept it, and not to spoil the critical opportunity by delay like Catilina.", "1718": "XVIII.", "1719": "Accordingly Lentulus designed nothing small or trivial, but he determined to kill all the senators, and as many of the rest of the citizens as he could, and to burn the city, and spare nobody except the children of Pom­ peius, whom they intended to seize and keep in their power as securities for coming to terms with Pompeius, for already there was strong and sure report of his return­ ing to Rome from his great expedition.", "1720": "A night had been fixed for the attempt, one of the Saturnalia,.", "1721": "and they took and hid in the house of Cethegus swords and tow and brim­ stone.", "1722": "They also appointed a hundred men, and assigned by lot as many parts of Rome to each, in order that by means of many incendiaries the city might be in a blaze in a short time on all sides.!", "1723": "Others were to stop up the water con­ duits and to kill those who attempted to get water.", "1724": "While this was going on, there happened to be at Rome two ambassadors of the Allobroges,t a nation which espe­ cially at that time was in a bad condition and oppressed by the supremacy of Rome.", "1725": "The partizans of Lentulus, considering them suitable persons for stiring up Gaul to revolt, made them privy to the conspiracy.", "1726": "They gave these men letters to their Senate and letters to Catilina, promising liberty to the Senate, and urging Catilina to free the slaves and to march upon Rome.", "1727": "They also sent with them to Catilina one Titus § of Croton to carry the letters.", "1728": "But inasmuch as the conspirators were unsteady men, who for the most part met one another over wine and in company with women, and Cicero followed up their designs with labour and sober consideration and unusual prudence, and had many men out of their body to keep watch and to help him in tracking out their doings, and as he had secret conversation with many of those who were considered to be in the conspiracy and whom he trusted, he became acquainted with their communication with the strangers, and laying an ambuscade by night he seized the man of Cretan and the letters, with the secret assistance of the Allobroges.", "1729": "XIX.", "1730": "At daybreak* Cicero, assembling the Senate at tho temple of Concord, read the letters and examined the informers.", "1731": "Silanus Junius also said that some persons had heard Cethegus say, that three consuls and four prefers were going to be killed.", "1732": "Piso, a man of consular rank, gave evidence to the same effect.", "1733": "Caius Sulpicius, one of the prætors, being sent to the house of Cethegus, found there many missiles and arms, and a great quantity of swords and knives newly sharpened.", "1734": "At length tho Senate having by a vote promised a pardon to the man of Croton on condition of his giving information, Lentulus being convicted abdicated his office, for he happened to be prætor, and laying down his robe with the purple hem before the Senate assumed a dress suitable to the occasion.", "1735": "Lentulus and his associates were delivered up to the prætors to be kept in custody, but without chains.", "1736": "It was now evening, and the people in crowds were waiting about the temple, when Cicero came forth and told the circumstance to the citizens, by whom he was conducted to the house of a neighbouring friend, for his own house was occupied by the women who were celebrating the mysterious rites to a goddess whom the Romans called Bona,t and the Greeks call Gynæceia.", "1737": "A sacrifice is made to the goddess annually in the house of the consul by his wife or his mother in the presence of the Vestal Virgins.", "1738": "Cicero, going into the house, deliberated with a very few persons what he should do with the men:", "1739": "for he had some scruples about inflicting the extreme punishment and that which was due to such great crimes;", "1740": "and he hesitated about it both from the humanity of his disposition, and bee'use he feared that he might seem to be too much elated with his power and to be handling severely men who were of the highest rank and had powerful friends in the State ;", "1741": "and if he treated them leniently, he dreaded danger from them.", "1742": "For he considered that they would not be well content if they were punished short of death, but would break forth in all extravagance of audacity and add fresh indignation to their old villainy;", "1743": "and that he should be judged a coward and a weak man, especially as the many had by no means a good opinion of his courage.", "1744": "XX.", "1745": "While Cicero was thus doubting, there was a sign to the women who were sacrificing:", "1746": "for though the fire seemed to have gone out, the altar sent forth from the ashes and burnt bark a large and brilliant blaze.*", "1747": "This alarmed the women, except the sacred virgins, who urged Terentia, the wife of Cicero, to go with all speed to her husband and tell him to take in hand what he had resolved on behalf of his country, for the goddess was displaying a great light to lead him to safety and honour.", "1748": "Terentia, who generally was not a woman of a mild temper nor naturally without courage, but an ambitious woman, and as Cicero himself says,t more ready to share in his political perplexities than to communicate to him her domestic matters, reported this to her husband and stimulated him against the conspirators :", "1749": "in like manner too his brother Quintus and Publius Nigidius, one of his philosophical companions, whose advice he used in the most and chiefest of his political measures.", "1750": "On the following day ‡ there was a discussion in the Senate about the punishment of the conspirators, when Silanus, who was first asked his opinion, said that they ought to be taken to prison and suffer the extreme punishment:", "1751": "and all who spoke in succession acceded to this opinion, till it came to the turn of Caius Cæsar, who was afterwards Dictator.", "1752": "Cæsar, who was then a young man and in the very beginning of his rise to power, and already in his policy and his hopes had entered on that road by which he changed the state of Rome into a monarchy, though he eluded the penetration of the rest, caused great suspicion to Cicero, without however giving him any hold for complete proof;", "1753": "but there were some heard to say that he came near being caught and yet had escaped from Cicero.", "1754": "However, some say that Cicero purposely over­ looked and neglected the information against Cæsar through fear of his friends and his power, for it was plain to every man, that the conspirators would rather become an appendage- to Caesars acquittal, than Cæsar would become an appendage to their punishment.", "1755": "XXI.", "1756": "When, then, it came to Cæssar's†turn to deliver his opinion, he rose and expressed it against putting the men to death, but he proposed to confiscate their property and remove them to the cities of Italy of which Cicero might approve, and there keep them confined till Catilina was defeated.", "1757": "The proposal was merciful and the speaker most eloquent, and Cicero added to it no small weight, for when Cicero rose‡ he handled the matter both ways, partly arguing in favour of the first opinion and partly in favour of Cæsar's;", "1758": "and all his friends thinking that Cæsar's opinion was for the advantage of Cicero, for he would be subject to less blame if he did not condemn the men to death, chose the second opinion rather, so that even Silanus himself changed and made his explanation, saying that neither had he delivered his opinion for death, for that the extreme punishment to a Roman senator was the prison.", "1759": "After the opinion was given, Catulus Lutatius was the first to oppose it;", "1760": "and he was followed by Cato, who in his speech vehemently urged suspicion against Cæsar, and so filled the Senate with passion and resolution that they passed a vote of death against the men.", "1761": "With respect to the confiscation of their property Cæsar made opposition, for he did not think it fair that they should reject the merciful part of his proposition and adopt the most severe part.", "1762": "As many of them made violent resist­ ance, he invoked the tribunes, who however paid no attention to the call, but Cicero himself gave way and remitted that part of the vote which was for confisca­ tion.", "1763": "XXII.", "1764": "Cicero went with the Senate to the conspirators, who were not all in the same place, but kept by the different prætors.", "1765": "He first took Lentulus * from the Palatine and led him through the Sacred Road and the middle of the Forum, with the men of highest rank in a body around him as his guards, the people the while shuddering at what was doing and passing by in silence, and chiefly the youth, who felt as if they were being initiated with fear and trembling in certain national rites of a certain aristocratical power.", "1766": "When Cicero had passed through the Forum and come to the prison, he delivered Lentulus to the executioner and told him to put him to death ;", "1767": "he then took down Cethegus and every one of the rest in order and had them put to death.", "1768": "Seeing that there were still many members of the conspiracy standing together in the Forum, who did not know what had been done and were waiting for the night, supposing that the men were still alivo and might be rescued, Cicero said to them in a loud voice, “ They have lived.", "1769": "”In these terms the Romans are used to speak of death when they do not choose to use words of bad omen.", "1770": "It was now evening, and Cicero went up from the Forum to his house, the citizens no longer accompanying him in silence or in order, but receiving him with shouts and clapping as he passed along and calling him the saviour and founder of his country.", "1771": "And numerous lights illuminated the streets, for people placed lamps and torches at their doors.", "1772": "The women too showed lights from the roofs to honour the man and in order to see him going home, honourably attended by the nobles ;", "1773": "most of whom, having brought to an end great wars and entered the city in triumph, and added to the Roman possessions no small extent of land and sea, walked along confessing to one another that the Roman people were indebted for wealth and spoils and power to many living commanders and generals, but for their security and safety to Cicero alone, who had removed from them so great a danger.", "1774": "For it was not the prevent­ ing of what was in preparation and the punishing of the doers which appeared worthy of admiration, but that he had quenched the greatest of dangers that ever threatened the State with the least evils, and without disturbance and tumult.", "1775": "For most of those who had flocked to Catilina* as soon as they heard of the fate of Lentulus and Cethegus left him and went away:", "1776": "and Catilina, after fighting a battle with those who remained with him against Antonius, perished and his army with him.", "1777": "XXIII.", "1778": "However there were some who were ready to abuse Cicero for this and to do him harm, and they had for their leader among those who were going to hold magis­ tracies, Cæsar as prætor, and Metellus * and Bestia as tribunes.", "1779": "Upon entering on office, while Cicero had still a few days in authority, they would not let him address the people, and placing their seats above the Rostra they would not permit him to come forward to speak ;", "1780": "they told him that he might, if he chose, take the oath usual on giving up office and then go down.", "1781": "Upon this Cicero came forward as if he were going to take the oath, and when he had procured silence, he swore not the usual oath, but one of his own and a new oath, to the effect that he had saved his country and preserved the supremacy of Rome:", "1782": "and the whole people confirmed the truth of his oath.", "1783": "At this Cæsar and the tribunes, being still more vexed, con­ trived other cavils against Cicero, and a law was brought forward by them that Pompeius and his army should be recalled on the pretext of putting down the power of Cicero.", "1784": "But Cato, who was then tribune, was a great help to Cicero and to the whole State, and he opposed himself to Caesar's measures with equal authority and greater good opinion.", "1785": "For he easily

then,\" said Cicero, \"do you not keep him to take care of your children?\"", "1976": "When some were commending Theophanes t the Lesbian, who was a Præfectus of Fabri in the camp, for his excellent consolation of the Rhodians on the loss of their fleet, “ What a huge blessing it is,\" he said, “ to have a Greek Præfect!”", "1977": "When Cæsar was successful in most things and in a manner was blockading them, he replied to the remark of Lentulus that he heard that Cæsar's friends were dispirited, “ You mean to say that they are ill­ disposed * to Caesar ?”", "1978": "One Marcius, who had just arrived from Rome, said that a report prevailed in Rome that Pompeius was blockaded.", "1979": "“ I suppose you sailed hither then,\" said Cicero, “ that you might see it with your own eyes and believe.\"", "1980": "After the defeat Nonnius observed that they ought to have good hopes, for that seven eagles were left in the camp of Pompeius, “ Your advice would be good,\" said Cicero, “ if we were fighting with jack­ daws.\"", "1981": "When Labienus was relying on certain oracular answers, and saying that Pompeius must get the victory, \" Yes,\" said Cicero, “ it is by availing ourselves of such generalship as this that we have lost the camp.", "1982": "\"XXXIX.", "1983": "After the battle at Pharsalus, in which he was not present by reason of illness, and when Pompeius had fled, Cato, who had a large army at Dyrrachium and a great fleet, asked Cicero to take the command according to custom, and as he had the superior dignity of the consulship.", "1984": "But as Cicero rejected the command and al­ together was averse to joining the armament, he narrowly escaped being killed, for the young Pompeius and his friends called him a traitor and drew their swords, but Cato stood in the gap and with difficulty rescued Cicero and let him go from the army.", "1985": "Having put in at Brun­ dusium he stayed there waiting for Cæsar, who was delayed by affairs in Asia and in Egypt.", "1986": "But when news came that Cæsar was landed at Tarentum t and was coming round by land to Brundusium, Cicero went to him, not being altogether without hope, but feeling shame in the presence of many persons to make trial of a marl who was his enemy and victorious.", "1987": "However there was no need for him to do or say anything unworthy of him­ self;", "1988": "for when Cæsar saw Cicero coming to meet him at a great distance before all the rest, he got down and embraced him and talking with him alone walked several stadia.", "1989": "From this time he continued to show respect to Cicero and friendly behaviour, so that even in his reply to Cicero, who had written a panegyric on Cato, he com­ mended his eloquence and his life, as most resembling those of Perikles and Theramenes.*", "1990": "Cicero's discourse was called Cato, and Caesar's was entitled Anticato.", "1991": "It is said also that when Quintus Ligarius t was under prose­ cution, because he had been one of Cæsar’s enemies and Cicero was his advocate, Cæsar said to his friends, “ What hinders us listening after so long an interval to Cicero's speech, since the man has long been adjudged a villain and an enemy ? \"", "1992": "But when Cicero had begun to speak and was making a wonderful sensation, and his speech as he proceeded was in feeling varied and in grace admir­ able, the colour often changed in Cæsar’s face, and it was manifest that he was undergoing divers emotions in his mind;", "1993": "but at last when the orator touched upon the battle at Pharsalus, he was so affected that his body shook and he dropped some of the writings from his hands.", "1994": "Accord­ ingly he acquitted the man of the charge perforce.", "1995": "XL.", "1996": "After this, as the constitution was changed to a monarchy, Cicero ‡ detaching himself from public affairs applied himself to philosophy with such young men as were disposed;", "1997": "and mainly from his intimacy with the noblest born and the first in rank, he again got very great power in the state.", "1998": "His occupation was to compose philosophical dialogues and to translate and to transfer into the Roman language every dialectical or physical term;", "1999": "for it is he, as they say, who first or mainly formed for the Romans the terms Phantasia, Syncatathesis, Epoche, and Catalepsis, and also Atom, and Indivisible, and Vacuum, and many other like terms, some of which by metaphor, and others by other modes of assimilation he contrived to make intelligible and to bring into common use:", "2000": "and he employed his ready turn for poetry to amuse himself.", "2001": "For it is said that when he was dis­ posed that way, he would make five hundred verses in a night.", "2002": "The greatest part of his time he now spent in his lands at Tusculum, and he used to write to his friends that he was living the life of Laertes,* whether it was that he said this in jest, as his manner was, or whether from ambition he was bursting with desire to participate in public affairs and was dissatisfied with matters as they were.", "2003": "He seldom went down to the city, and when he did, it was to pay court to Caesar, and he was foremost among those who spoke in favour of the honours given to him and were eager always to be saying something new about the man and his acts.", "2004": "Of this kind is what he said about the statues of Pompeius, which Cæsar ordered to be set up after they had been taken away and thrown down, and they were set up again.", "2005": "For Cicero said that by this mild behaviour Cæsar placed the statues of Pompeius, but firmly fixed his own.", "2006": "XLI.", "2007": "His intention being, as it is said, to comprehend in one work the history of his country and to combine with it much of Greek affairs and in fine to place there the stories and myths which he had collected, he was prevented by public and many private affairs contrary to his wish, and by troubles, most of which seem to have been of his own causing.", "2008": "For first of all, he divorced his wife Terentia,t because he had been neglected by her during the war, so that he set out in want even of necessaries for his journey, and did not even on his return to Italy find her well-disposed to him.", "2009": "For she did not go to him, though he was staying some time in Brundusium, and when her daughter, who was a young woman, was going so long a journey, she did not supply her with suit­ able attendance, nor any means, but she even made Cicero'a house void of everything and empty, besides incurring many great debts.", "2010": "These are the most decent reasons for the separation which are mentioned.", "2011": "But Terentia denied that these were the reasons, and Cicero made her defence a complete one by marrying no long time after a maid;", "2012": "* as Terentia charged it, through passion for her beauty, but as Tiro * the freedman of Cicero has recorded it, to get means for paying his debts.", "2013": "For the young woman was very rich and Cicero had the care of her property, being left fiduciary heir.", "2014": "Being in debt to the amount of many ten thousands he was persuaded by his friends and relatives to marry the girl, not withstanding the disparity of age, and to get rid of his creditors by making use of her property.", "2015": "But Antonius, who made mention of the marriage in reply to the Philippics, says that he put out of doors his wife with whom he had grown old, and at the same time he made some cutting jibes on the house­ keeping habits of Cicero as a man unfit for action and for arms.", "2016": "No long time after his marriage Cicero's daughter died in child-birth, for she had married Lentulus after the death of her former husband Piso.", "2017": "The philosophers from all quarters came together to console Cicero, but h3 bore his misfortune very ill, and even divorced his wife because he thought that she was pleased at the death of Tullia.", "2018": "†XLII.* Such were Cicero's domestic affairs.", "2019": "He had no share in the design that was forming against Cæsar, though he was one of the most intimate friends of Brutus and was supposed to be annoyed at the present state of affairs and so long for the old state more than anybody else.", "2020": "But the men feared his temper as being deficient in daring, and the occasion was one in which courage fails even the strongest natures.", "2021": "When the deed was accom­ plished by the partisans of Brutus and Cassius, and Cæsar’s friends were combining againt the conspirators, and there was fear of the city again being involved in civil wars, Antonius, who was consul, brought the Senate together and said a few words about concord;", "2022": "and Cicero, after speaking at length and suitably to the occasion, persuaded the Senate to imitate the Athenians and decree an amnestyt for what had been done to Cæsar, and to give provinces to Brutus and Cas sius.", "2023": "But none of these things came to a conclusion.", "2024": "For the people of themselves being transported to pity, when they saw the corpse carried through the Forum, and Antonius showed them the garments filled with blood and slashed in every part by the swords, maddened by passion sought for the men in the Forum and ran with tire in their hands to their houses to burn them.", "2025": "The conspirators escaped the danger -by being prepared for it, but as they expected other great dangers, they quitted the city.", "2026": "XLIII.", "2027": "Antonius was forthwith elated, and was for­ midable to all, as about to become sole ruler;", "2028": "but to Cicero most formidable.", "2029": "For Antonius seeing that Cicero's power was recovering strength in the State, and knowing that he was closely allied with Brutus, was annoyed at his presence.", "2030": "And there existed even before this some ill-will between them on account of the unlike­ ness and difference in their lives.", "2031": "Cicero fearing these things, first made an attempt to go with Dolabella* to Syria as legatus:", "2032": "but the consuls for the next year, Irtius and Pansa,t who were good men and admirers of Cicero, prayed him not to desert them, and they undertook if he were present to put down Antonius.", "2033": "Cicero, neither dis­ trusting altogether nor trusting gave up his design as to Dolabella, and agreed with Irtius to spend the summer in Athens, and when they had entered on their office, to come back, and he sailed off by himself.", "2034": "But as there was some delay about the voyage, and new reports, as the wont is, reached him from Rome that Antonius had under­ gone a wonderful change, and was doing and administer­ ing everything conformably to the pleasure of the Senate, and that matters only required his presence to be brought to the best arrangement, himself blaming his excessive caution turned back to Rome.", "2035": "And he was not deceived in his first expectations, so great a crowd of people through joy and longing for him poured forth to meet him, and near a whole day was taken up at the gates and upon his entrance with greetings and friendly reception.", "2036": "On the following day Antonius summoned a Senate and invited Cicero, who did not come, but was lying down pretending to be indisposed from fatigue.", "2037": "But the truth appeared to be that he was afraid of some design against him, in con­ sequence of certain suspicions and of information which reached him on the road.", "2038": "Antonius was irritated at the calumny and sent soldiers with orders to bring Cicero or burn his house, but as many persons opposed Antonius and urged him by entreaties he took securities only and desisted.", "2039": "And henceforward they continued to pass by without noticing one another and to be mutually on their guard, till the young Cæsar* having arrived from Apollonia took possession of the inheritance of the elder Cæsar, and came to a quarrel with Antonius about the two thousand five hundred ten thousands t which Antonius detained of his substance.", "2040": "XLIV.", "2041": "Upon this, Philippus { who was married to young Caesar's mother, and Marcellus, who was married to his sister, came with the young man to Cicero, and made a compact that Cicero should lend to Cæsar both in the Senate and before the people the power that he derived from his eloquence and his political position, and that Cæsar should give to Cicero the security that could be derived from money and from arms.", "2042": "For the young man had about him many of those who had served under Cæsar.*", "2043": "There appeared also to have been some stronger reason for Cicero readily accepting the friendship of Cæsar.", "2044": "For, as the story goes, while Pompeius and Caesar were living, Cicero dreamedt that some one sum­ moned the sons of the senators to the Capitol, as Jupiter was going to appoint one of them chief of Rome, and that the citizens ran eagerly and placed themselves around the temple and the youths seated themselves in their prætextæ in silence.", "2045": "The doors opened suddenly and one by one the youths rising walked round before the god, who looked at them all and dismissed them sorrowing.", "2046": "But when young Cæsar was advancing towards him, the god stretched out his hand and said, \" Romans, there is an end to civil wars when this youth becomes your leader.\"", "2047": "They say that Cicero having had such a dream as this had im­ printed on his memory the appearance of the youth and retained it distinctly, but he did not know him.", "2048": "The following day as he was going down to the Campus Martius, the boys who had taken their exercise were returning, and the youth was then seen by Cicero for the first time just as he appeared to him in his dream, and being struck with surprise Cicero asked who were his parents.", "2049": "Now his father was Octavius, not a man of very illustrious station, but his mother was Atia, a niece? of Cæsar.", "2050": "Accordingly Cæsar, who had no children of his own, gave the youth his property and family name by his will.", "2051": "After this they say that Cicero took pains to notice the youth when he met him, and the youth received well his friendly attentions;", "2052": "for it had also happened that he was born in Cicero's consulship.", "2053": "XLV.", "2054": "These were the reasons which were mentioned;", "2055": "but his hatred of Antonius in the chief place, and then his disposition, which was governed by ambition, attached, him to Cæsar in the expectation of adding to his own political influence Caesar's power.", "2056": "For the young man went so far in paying his court to Cicero as to call him father.-", "2057": "At which Brutus being much annoyed blamed Cicero in his letters to Atticus, that through fear of Antonius he was courting Caesar and was thus manifestly not procuring liberty for his country, but wooing for himself a kind master.", "2058": "However Cicero's son,† who was studying philosophy at Athens, was engaged by Brutus and employed in command in many things which he did successfully.", "2059": "Cicero's power in the city was then at its height, and as he could do what he liked, he drove Antoni as out and raised a faction against him and sent out the two consuls Irtius and Pansa* to fight against him, and he persuaded the Senate by a vote to give Cæsar lictors and the insignia of a prætor, as if he were fighting in defence of their country.", "2060": "But when Antonius had been defeated and on the death of the two consuls after the battle the forces joined Caesar, and the Senate through fear of a youth who had enjoyed splendid success was attempting by honours and gifts to call away from him the armies, and to divide his power, on the ground that there was no need of troops to defend the state now that Antonius was fled, under these circumstances Cæsar being alarmed secretly sent messengers to Cicero, to entreat and urge Cicero to get the consulship for the two, but to manage matters as he thought best, and to have the power, and to direct the young man who was only desi­ rous of a name and reputation.", "2061": "And Cæsar himself ad­ mitted that it was through fear of his troops being dis­ banded and the danger of being left alone, that he had availed himself in a time of need of Cicero's love of power by urging him to take the consulship, and promising that he would act with him and assist in the canvass at the same time.", "2062": "XLVI.", "2063": "In this way indeed Cicero being very greatly pushed on, he an old man by a young one, and cajoled, assisted at the canvass of Cæsar t and got the Senate in his favour, for which he was blamed by his friends at the time, and he shortly after saw that he had ruined himself and betrayed the liberty of the people.", "2064": "For when the youth was strengthened and had got the consulship, he gave himself no concern about Cicero, but making friends with Antonius and Lepidus* and uniting his forces with theirs, he divided the chief power with them, just as if it were a piece of property.", "2065": "And a list of above two hundred men was made out, who were doomed to die.", "2066": "The proscription of Cicero caused most dispute among them in their discussions, for Antonius was not inclined to come to any terms unless Cicero was the first to be doomed to death, and Lepidus sided with Antonius, but Cæsar held out against both.", "2067": "They held their meeting by themselves in secret near the city Bononia† for three days, and they met in a place at some distance from the camps which was surrounded by a river.", "2068": "It is said that during the first two days Cæsar struggled in behalf of Cicero, but that he yielded on the third and gave up the man.", "2069": "And the matter of their mutual surrender was thus.", "2070": "Cæsar was to give up Cicero, and Lepidus his brother Paulus,‡ and Antonius was to give up Lucius Cæsar, who was his uncle on the mother's side.", "2071": "So far did they through resentment and rage throw away all human feeling, or rather they showed that no animal is more savage than man when he has gotten power added to passion.", "2072": "XLVII.*", "2073": "While this was going on, Cicero was on his lands at Tusculum, and his brother with him;", "2074": "and on hearing of the proscriptions they determined to remove to Astura,t a place belonging to Cicero on the sea-coast, and thence to sail to Macedonia to Brutus, for there was already a rumour about him that he had a force.", "2075": "They were conveyed in litters, being worn out by grief;", "2076": "and halting by the way and placing their litters side by side they lamented to one another.", "2077": "Quintus‡ was the more desponding, and he began to reflect on his needy condi­ tion, for he said that he had brought nothing from home;", "2078": "and indeed Cicero was but scantily provided for his journey ;", "2079": "it was better then, he said, for Cicero to hurry on in his flight, and for him to hasten back and to pro­ vide himself from home with what he wanted.", "2080": "This was agreed, and embracing one another with tears they sepa­ rated.", "2081": "Now Quintus, not many days after, was betrayed by his slaves to those who were in search of him and put to death with his son.", "2082": "Cicero arrived at Astura, and finding a vessel he immediately embarked, and sailed along the coast to Circæum,§ the wind in his favour.", "2083": "When the sailors were wishing to set sail immediately from thence, whether it was that he feared the sea, or had not quite despaired of all trust in Cæsar, he landed, and went on foot about a hundred stadia on the road to Rome.", "2084": "But again perplexed and changing his mind he went down to the sea of Astura ;", "2085": "and there he spent the night in dreadful and desperate reflections, so that he even formed a design to get secretly into Caesaris house, and by killing himself on the hearth to fasten on him an avenging daemon.", "2086": "But the fear of tortures drove him from this measure also;", "2087": "and after perplexing himself with other schemes and shifting from one to another, he put himself in the hands of his slaves to convey him by sea to Capitæ,* for he had lands there and a place of retreat which was very agreeable in bummer, when the Etesian winds blow most softly.", "2088": "The place has also a temple of Apollo, a little above the sea.", "2089": "A flock of crows winging their flight from thence with loud cawing approached the vessel of Cicero as it was rowing to land, and settling at each end of the sail-yard some made a noise, and others gnawed the end of the ropes, and all were of opinion that the omen was bad.", "2090": "Cicero landed, and going to the villa he lay down to rest.", "2091": "But most of the crows perched themselves on different parts of the window, cawing clamorously;", "2092": "and one of them, going down to the couch where Cicero lay wrapped up, by degrees removed with its beak the covering from his face.", "2093": "The slaves seeing this, and considering it a reproach to them if they should wait to be spectators of their master's murder, while even brute beasts came to his aid and cared for him in his unmerited misfortune, but they themselves were giving no help, partly by entreaty, partly using force, took him up and carried him in a litter towards the sea.", "2094": "XLVIII.", "2095": "In the meantime the murderers with their helpers came on, Herennius* a centurion, and Popilius a tribune, who had once been prosecuted for parricide and Cicero was his advocate.", "2096": "Finding the doors closed they broke them open, and as Cicero was not seen and those who were within denied that they knew where he was, it is said that a youth who had been brought up by Cicero in liberal studies and learning, and was a freedman of Cicero's brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the tribune that the litter was being conveyed through the wooded and shady paths to the sea.", "2097": "Accordingly the tribune, taking a few men with him, ran round to the out­ let.", "2098": "And as Herennius was running along the paths, Cicero saw him and bade the slaves place down the litter there;", "2099": "and, as his wont was, holding his chin with his left hand he looked steadily on the murderers, being all squalid and unshorn, and his countenance wasted by care, so that most of them covered their faces while Herennius was killing him.", "2100": "He stretched his neckt out of the litter and was killed, being then in his sixty-fourth year.", "2101": "Herennius cut off his head and the hands, pursuant to the command of Antonius, with which he wrote the Philippies.", "2102": "For Cicero himself entitled Philippics the speeches which he wrote against Antonius, and to the present day they are called Philippics.", "2103": "XLIX.", "2104": "When the head and hands‡ were brought to Rome, Antonius happened to be holding an election of magistrates, and when he heard the news and saw what had been done, he called out that the proscriptions were now at an end.", "2105": "He ordered the head and hands to be placed above the Rostra on the place whence the orators spoke, a sight that made the Romans shudder, who thought that they saw, not the face of Cicero, but an image of the soul of Antonius.", "2106": "Still he showed herein one sentiment of just dealing, for he delivered up Philologus to Pomponia the wife of Quintus, who having got him into her power, inflicted terrible vengeance upon him, and among other things compelled him to cut off his flesh bit by bit, and to roast and eat it.", "2107": "Thus some of the historians have told the story, but Tiro, who was Cicero's freedman, makes no mention at all of the treachery of Philologus.*", "2108": "I have heard that Caesar a long time after once went to see one of his daughter's sons,t and as the youth had in his hands one of Cicero's writings, he was afraid and hid it in his vest;", "2109": "the which Caesar observing took the book and read a good part of it while he was standing, and then returning the book to the boy said, “ A wise man, my boy, a wise man and a lover of his country.\"", "2110": "As soon as Cæsar had finally defeated Antonius, he took Cicero's son‡ to be his colleague in the consulship, in whose magistracy the Senate threw down the statues of Antonius and destroyed all other testimonials in honour of him, and further decreed that no Antonius should bear the name of Marcus.", "2111": "That the daemon reserved for the family of Cicero the final vengeance on Antonius.", "2112": "I.", "2113": "The above is all I have been able to find out that is worth being recorded about Demosthenes and Cicero.", "2114": "With­ out attempting to compare their different styles of oratory, I think it necessary to remark that Demosthenes devoted all his powers, natural and acquired, to the study of eloquence alone, so that he surpassed all his rivals in the law courts and public assembly in perspicuity and ability, all the writers of declamations in splendour and pomp of diction, and all the professional sophists in accuracy and scientific method.", "2115": "Cicero, on the other hand, was a man of great learning and various literary accomplishments.", "2116": "He wrote a considerable number of philosophic treatises modelled on the works of the Academic school, and in all his forensic and political speeches we can detect a desire to let his audience know that he was a man of letters.", "2117": "In their speeches, too, we can discern the impress of their respective characters.", "2118": "The eloquence of Demosthenes never stoops to jest, and is utterly without ornament, but has a terrible concen­ trated earnestness, which does not smell of the lamp, as Pytheas sneeringly said, but which reminds us of the ungenial, painstaking, acrimonious nature of the man:", "2119": "while Cicero often is carried by his love of jesting to the verge of buffoonery, and in his pleadings treats serious matters in a tone of most unbecoming levity and flippancy, as in the oration for Cæcilius he argues that in an age of such luxury and extravagance there can be nothing to wonder at if a man takes his pleasure;", "2120": "for not to help oneself to the pleasures which are within one's reach is the part of a madman, seeing that the most eminent philosophers have declared the chief felicity of man to consist in pleasure.", "2121": "It is related that when Cato prosecuted Murena, Cicero, who was consul at the time, defended him, and cracked many jokes on Cato as an adherent of the Stoic philosophy, and on the absurdity of the paradoxes which it maintains.", "2122": "The audience, and even the judges, laughed heartily;", "2123": "but Cato merely remarked to those near him, with a quiet smile, \"Gentlemen, what a witty consul we have.”", "2124": "Cicero, indeed, seems to have been fond of laughter and mirth, and his countenance was calm and smiling;", "2125": "while that of Demosthenes always bore the marks of gloomy, anxious thought, which caused his enemies, as he himself tells us, to call him disagreeable and ill-natured.", "2126": "II.", "2127": "In their speeches we may observe that Demosthenes praises himself with great moderation, in a manner which can offend no one, and only when he has some more important object in view, while he is usually modest and cautious in his language;", "2128": "whereas Cicero's show a ridi­ culous amount of egotism and craving for applause, when he demands that “ arms shall yield to the toga, and the triumphal laurel.", "2129": "give place to his tongue.\"", "2130": "At last he took to praising not only his own deeds, but even his spoken and written t orations, as though he were engaged in some contest with professional rhetoricians like Isokrates or Anaximenes, rather than endeavouring to lead and reform the Roman people­ .", "2131": "SavAge and rude, whose sole delight Was with their foes to strive in tight.\"", "2132": "A politician must of necessity be a powerful speaker, but it is a contemptible thing for him to be too greedy and covetous of applause for his fine speeches.", "2133": "Wherefore, in this respect Demosthenes appears far graver, and of a nobler nature;", "2134": "for he himself declared that his eloquence came only by practice, and depended on the favour of his audience, and that he regarded those who boasted of their oratorical powers as vulgar and despicable characters.", "2135": "III.", "2136": "They were both alike in their power and influence with the people, which caused even the commanders ot armies in the field to look to them for support;", "2137": "for Demos­ thenes was courted by Chares, Diopeithes, and Leosthenes, as was Cicero by Pompeius and the younger Cæsar,* as Cæsar himself admits in his memoirs addressed to Mæcenas and Agrippa.", "2138": "We cannot judge of Demosthenes by that which is said to afford the most certain test of a man's true character-his conduct when in power-for he has not afforded us any opportunity of doing so, as he would not even take the command of the confederacy which he himself organised to oppose Philip.", "2139": "Now Cicero was sent to Sicily as quæstor, and to Cilicia and Cappadocia as proconsul, at a period when the love of wealth was at its height, and when the Roman generals and governors, thinking it beneath them to steal money, used to resort to open robbery.", "2140": "It was not thought discreditable to plunder a province, but he who did so with moderation was esteemed as an excellent governor.", "2141": "Cicero on these occasions gained great credit by the many proofs which he gave of indifference to money, and of goodness and kindness of heart.", "2142": "At Rome itself also, he was elected nominally consul, but really dictator with unlimited powers to deal with Catilina's conspiracy, and he then proved the truth of Plato's aphorism, that a state finds rest from its misfortunes when by good luck a powerful and able man is found to rule it with justice.", "2143": "Demos­ thenes again is said to have made money dishonourably by writing speeches for other men, as in the case of the speeches with which he secretly furnished Phormio and Apollodorus, when they were opposed to one another.", "2144": "He also was suspected of receiving bribes from the King of Persia, and was caught in the act of taking a bribe from Harpalus.", "2145": "Even if we suppose these charges, sup­ ported as they are by the testimony of so many writers, to be false, yet it is impossible to deny that Demosthenes, who trafficked in that peculiarly discreditable form of usury, marine insurances,t would not have been able to refuse a present offered in all honour by a king, while we have already related how Cicero refused to take money from the Sicilians when he was quæstor,* and from the Cappadocians when he was proconsul, and even from his friends, who pressed him to accept large sums when he was exiled from Rome.", "2146": "IV.", "2147": "Moreover, Demosthenes was exiled in great dis­ grace, after he had been convicted of having received a bribe, while Cicero's banishment was the consequence of the noblest action of his life, the ridding his country of wicked men.", "2148": "Wherefore, no one could plead for Demos­ thenes when he left the country, but the Senate publicly put on mourning for Cicero, grieved for his absence, and refused to transact any business before voting that he should be restored to Rome.", "2149": "Yet Cicero spent his exile idly in Macedonia, while Demosthenes carried out an important part of his policy while in exile;", "2150": "for, as has been related, he accompanied the Athenian embassy to the various states of Greece, discomfited the

pursue the same policy of unceasing opposition to Anti­ pater and the Macedonians, while Lælius reproached Cicero for sitting silent in the senate-house when young Octavius Cæsar, before his beard was grown, petitioned to be allowed to sue for the consulship in spite of the law.", "2152": "Brutus also blamed him for having fostered a greater and harsher tyranny than that which put down.", "2153": "V.", "2154": "In conclusion, we must regard the death of Cicero as most pitiable, that an old man, through cow.", "2155": "rice should be carried hither and thither by his slaves, seeking to escape death, and hiding himself from his foes, although he could in any case have but a short time to live, and then be murdered after all;", "2156": "while Demosthenes, though he did beg somewhat for his life, must be admired for his forethought in providing himself with the poison, and also for the use which he made of it, to escape from the cruelty of Antipater even when surrounded by his soldiers, and to betake himself to a greater sanctuary, as that of the god was unable to protect him.", "2157": "I.", "2158": "He who first compared the arts to our senses seems to me to have especially alluded to the power which they both exhibit of dealing with objects of completely con­ trary qualities.", "2159": "In this respect they coincide;", "2160": "but they differ in respect of the use and purpose of the object of which they take cognisance.", "2161": "Our senses are influenced indifferently by things white or black, sweet or bitter, soft or hard, for the proper function of each sense is merely to receive all these impressions and to convey them to the mind.", "2162": "But the arts, which have been in­ vented in order to cultivate the qualities proper to their own nature and to eschew those which are foreign to it, view some with especial favour, as partaking of their own essence, and avoid others as mere untoward accidents.", "2163": "Thus the art of medicine deals with diseases and the art of music deals with discord merely with a view to produce their respective opposites;", "2164": "while self-control, justice and wisdom, which are the most perfect of all arts, because they decide not only what is honourable, righteous and useful but likewise what is hurtful, shameful, and unjust, do not praise innocency which prides itself upon inexperience of evil, but think it to be folly and ignorance of what all who intend to live as becomes them ought to know.", "2165": "The ancient Spartans at their feasts used to com­ pel their helots to drink a large quantity of wine, and then brought them into the banqueting-hall, in order to show the young Spartans what drunkenness was like.", "2166": "I think that to instruct one class of men by the ruin of another is neither humane nor politic, yet I conceive that it may be useful to insert among my Parallel Lives some examples of men who have been careless of their own reputation, and who have used their great place and power only to make themselves notorious for evil.", "2167": "The description of such men's lives is not indeed an agreeable task, or a pleasant mode of employing my leisure, still, as Ismenias the Theban, when instructing his scholars how to play the flute, used to say, “ Thus you should play;", "2168": "” and again, \"", "2169": "Thus you should not play,\" while Antigen­ ides even thought that the young would take more pleasure in listening to good flute-players, if they had first heard bad ones, so I think that we shall be more inclined both to admire and to imitate the lives of good men, if we are well acquainted with those of bad ones.", "2170": "This book, then, will contain the lives of Demetrius, surnamed the City- taker, and of Antonius the Triumvir, men who bear signal witness to the truth of Plato's remark, that great men have great vices as well as great virtues.", "2171": "Both alike loved passionately, drank deep, and fought bravely;", "2172": "both were freehanded, extravagant and arrogant.", "2173": "Fortune served them both alike, not only in their lives, for each of them had great successes and great disasters, each won great empire and lost it again, each unexpectedly fell and rose again;", "2174": "but also in their deaths, as the one was captured by his enemies, and the same fate all but betel the other.", "2175": "II.", "2176": "Antigonus * had two sons by Stratonike the daughter of Korragus, one of whom he named Demetrius after his brother, and the other Philip after his father.", "2177": "This is the account given by most historians, though some say that Demetrius was not the son, but the nephew, of Antigonus;", "2178": "but that, as his father died while he was still an infant and his mother at once married Antigonus, he was commonly regarded as his son.", "2179": "His brother Philip, who was a few years younger than himself, died soon, but Demetrius grew up to be a tall man, though not so tall as his father.", "2180": "His face and figure were of extra­ ordinary beauty, which baffled all the attempts of painters and sculptors to do it justice.", "2181": "His expression was at once sweet, commanding and terrible;", "2182": "and his countenance showed all the eagerness and fire of youth combined with the calm dignity of a hero and a king.", "2183": "In like manner his disposition was one which was equally capable of inspiring terror or love.", "2184": "He was the pleasantest of companions, more given to wine-drinking and the enjoy­ ment of luxurious idleness than any other king of his age, and yet he displayed remarkable energy and persistent e in action;", "2185": "so that he emulated the fame of the god Dionysius,* being like him a famous warrior, and when the war was over most capable of thoroughly enjoying the arts of peace.", "2186": "III.", "2187": "He was remarkably fond of his father;", "2188": "and the love and respect which he paid to his father and mother seem to have been prompted by true affection, not by a wish to stand well with those in power.", "2189": "Once when Antigonus was receiving an embassy from some foreign state, Demetrius, who had been out hunting, came up to his father, kissed him, and sat down beside him just as he was, with his javelins still in his hand.", "2190": "When the ambassadors had transacted their business and were about to leave his presence, Antigonus said to them in a loud voice, \" And, gentlemen, you may carry home this news about me and my son, that these are the terms on which we live,\" thinking that so great a proof of his trust in his son's loyalty would add considerable strength to his throne.", "2191": "So much mistrust and suspicion is bred by absolute power, and so hard a thing is it for a king to have a companion, that the eldest and greatest of the successors of Alexander publicly boasted that he was not afraid to have his own son sitting by his side with a spear in his hand.", "2192": "Indeed, this was the only royal family which through many generations remained unpolluted by this species of crime, for of all the successors of Antigonus only one, Philip, assassinated his son.", "2193": "All the records of other dynasties are full of murders of sons, mothers and wives;", "2194": "for the murder of brothers had grown to be considered, like an axiom in mathematics, as a necessary precaution to be taken by all kings on ascending to the throne.", "2195": "IV.", "2196": "The following anecdote seems to prove that Demetrius when young was of a kind and loving nature.", "2197": "Mithlidates, the son of Ariobarzanes, was his friend and companion, and was a good subject of Antigonus, of thorough and unsuspected loyalty, but at length incurred the suspicion of Antigonus in consequence of a dream.", "2198": "Antigonus dreamed that he walked over a large and fair plain, sowing it with gold dust;", "2199": "and that shortly after­ wards, returning that way again, he found nothing but stubble left.", "2200": "While grieving over this he heard some men say that Mithridates had gone away to Pontus on the Euxine, after having gathered the golden harvest.", "2201": "Antigonus was much disturbed at this vision, and after having compelled his son to swear that he would keep silence about it, told him of the vision, and added that he had made up his mind to make away with the man.", "2202": "Demetrius was greatly grieved at hearing this, and when the young man, as he was wont to do, again joined him, and spent the day with him, Demetrius dared not tell him by word of month what danger he was in, because of the oath ;", "2203": "but he drew him aside into a quiet place, and there, as soon as they were alone together, he wrote on the ground with the but-end of his spear, in sight of the other, the words “", "2204": "Fly, Mithridates \"", "2205": "Mithridates understood his meaning, and ran away that very night to Cappadocia.", "2206": "Not long afterwards, he showed Antigonus what was the real meaning of his dream ;", "2207": "for he made himself master of an extensive territory, and became the founder of the dynasty of the kings of Pontus, which was overthrown by the Romans in about the eighth generation after him.", "2208": "By this example we may perceive the noble and loyal nature of Demetrius.", "2209": "V.", "2210": "As the elements, because of their mutual attraction and repulsion, are, according to Empedokles, always at variance with one another, and especially with those with which they happen to be in contact, so, while all the successors of Alexander were always at war, circumstances from time to time caused hostilities between two or more of them to take an especially active form.", "2211": "At this time Antigonus was at war with Ptolemy, and, hearing that Ptolemy had left the island of Cyprus, had landed in Syria and was ravaging that country, he himself remained in Phrygia, but sent his son Demetrius to oppose him.", "2212": "Dometrius was now two and twenty years of age, and was now for the first time entrusted with the sole manage­ ment of an important campaign.", "2213": "As might be expected of so young and untried a commander, when pitted against a man trained to war under Alexander, and who had since his death waged many wars with success, Demetrius was defeated near the city of Gaza with a loss of fifteen thousand killed and eight thousand prisoners.", "2214": "He also lost his own tent, his property, and all his personal attendants.", "2215": "These, however, were restored to him, with all his captured friends, by Ptolemy, who sent him a kindly-worded message to the effect that they ought not to fight as mortal foes, but only for honour and empire.", "2216": "Demetrius, after receiving this message and his property, prayed to the gods that he might not long remain in Ptolemy's debt, but that he might soon recompense him in like manner.", "2217": "He did not behave himself like a youth who has received a check at the outset of his first cam­ paign, but repaired his failure like an old and wary commander, enrolling fresh soldiers, providing new supplies of arms, keeping a firm hold over the cities near him and carefully drilling his new levies.", "2218": "VI. Antigonus when he heard of the defeat remarked that Ptolemy had conquered beardless boys, but that he would have to fight his next battle with grown men.", "2219": "He yielded however to his son's entreaty to be allowed to repair his fault by himself, and, as he did not wish to damp his spirits, left him in sole command.", "2220": "Soon after this Killes, Ptolemy's lieutenant, arrived in Syria with a large force, meaning to chase Demetrius, whom he supposed to be disheartened by his defeat, quite out of Syria.", "2221": "But Demetrius by a sudden attack sur­ prised his army and struck it with panic.", "2222": "He cap­ tured the enemy's camp and their general, and took eight thousand prisoners and a great quantity of booty.", "2223": "He was overjoyed at this, not because he meant to keep what he had won, but to give it back, and did not so much value the glory and wealth which he had gained as the opportunity now offered him for repaying the courtesy of Ptolemy.", "2224": "He did not presume to do this on his own responsibility, but wrote first to his father.", "2225": "On receiving permission from him to deal as he pleased with the fruits of his victory, he gave costly presents to Killes and his friends, and sent them back to Ptolemy.", "2226": "This battle forced Ptolemy to retire from Syria, and brought Antigonus from Kelænæ re­ joicing at the victory and eager to see his son.", "2227": "VII.", "2228": "After this Demetrius was sent to subdue the Nabathean Arabs, in performing which service he incurred great danger by journeying through waterless deserts;", "2229": "but his intrepid courage overawed the barbarians, and he returned loaded with plunder, having captured seven hundred camels.", "2230": "Seleukus had once lost his capital city, Babylon, which Antigonus took from him ;", "2231": "but he had since recovered it by his own arms, and at this time was marching with an army to attempt the conquest of the nations bordering upon India, and the provinces near mount Caucasus.", "2232": "Demetrius, hoping that he might find Mesopotamia in a defenceless condition, suddenly crossed the Euphrates, took Babylon by surprise, and made himself master of one of its two citadels, driving out the garrison placed there by Seleukus.", "2233": "Demetrius placed seven thousand of his own troops in the citadel, ordered his troops to enrich themselves by the plunder of the surrounding country, and then returned to the sea-coast, leaving Seleukus more firmly established on his throne than before;", "2234": "for by plundering the country he seemed to admit that he had no claim to it.", "2235": "As Ptolemy was now besieging Halikarnassus, he quickly marched thither and succeeded in saving the city.", "2236": "VIII.", "2237": "As the glory which he won by this action was very great, he and his father Antigonus conceived a strong desire to liberate the whole of Greece from the tyranny of Ptolemy and Kassander.", "2238": "None of the suc­ cessors of Alexander ever waged a more just or honourable war than this;", "2239": "for Demetrius and Antigonus, to gain themselves honour by freeing the Greeks, spent upon­ them the treasure which they had won in their victories over the barbarians.", "2240": "They determined first of all to attack Athens, and when one of the friends of Antigonus advised him, if he captured that city, to keep it in his own hands because it was the key of Greece, Antigonus replied that the best key to a country was the goodwill of its people, and that Athens was the watch-tower of the world, from whence the glory of his deeds should shine like a beacon-light to all mankind.", "2241": "Demetrius now set sail for Athens with five thousand talents of silver, and a fleet of two hundred and fifty vessels.", "2242": "At this time Demetrius of Phalerum governed the city as Kassander's lieutenant, and a garrison was placed in Munychia.", "2243": "By good fortune and good management the fleet arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the month Thar­ gelion, without anyone being aware of its coming.", "2244": "When the ships were seen, they were thought to form part of Ptolemy's fleet, and preparations were made to give them a friendly reception.", "2245": "At last the officers in command discovered their mistake, and a scene of great confusion ensued, as they hastily made preparations to resist the enemy, who were already in the act of disembarking;", "2246": "for Demetrius, finding the mouths of the harbours open, sailed straight in, and could be seen distinctly by all standing on the deck of the ship, and making signs to the Athenians to be quiet and keep silence.", "2247": "When this was done, he bade a herald proclaim that his father Antigonus had sent him thither in an auspicious hour to liberate the Athenians, drive out their Macedonian garrison, and restore to them their own laws and ancient constitution.", "2248": "IX.", "2249": "Upon hearing this proclamation the greater part of the people laid down their shields at their feet, clapped their hands, and shouted to Demetrius to come ashore, call­ ing him their saviour and benefactor;", "2250": "while Demetrius of Phalerum thought it necessary to admit so powerful a man to the city, even though he might have no intention of performing any of his promises.", "2251": "He therefore sent ambassadors to make their submission.", "2252": "Demetrius received them graciously and sent back with them Aristodemus of Miletus, one of his father's friends.", "2253": "As the Phalerean, In consequence of this sudden turn of fortune, was more afraid of his own countrymen than of the enemy, Demetrius, who admired his courage and public spirit, took care to have him conveyed in safety to Thebes, to which town he himself wished to go.", "2254": "Demetrius himself now declared that, although he was very eager to view the city, he would not do so until he had completely set it free and expelled its garrison.", "2255": "He therefore surrounded Munychia with a ditch and rampart, cutting it off from the rest of the city, and then sailed to attack Megara, which town was held by a garrison of Kassander's troops.", "2256": "As he heard that Kratesipolis, the wife of Alexander the son of Polysperchon, a celebrated beauty, was at Patræ, and was not unwilling to grant him an interview, he left his army encamped in the territory of Megara and proceeded thither with only a few lightly equipped followers.", "2257": "When he was near the place, he pitched his own tent apart from his men, that the lady might not be seen when she came to visit him.", "2258": "Some of the enemy dis­ covered this, and made a sudden attack upon him.", "2259": "He only escaped by putting on a mean cloak and running away alone;", "2260": "so that his licentiousness very nearly ex­ posed him to ignominious capture.", "2261": "When Megara was taken the soldiers were about to plunder the city, but the Athenians with great difficulty prevailed upon Demetrius to spare it.", "2262": "He drove out the Macedonian garrison and made the city independent.", "2263": "While he was doing this he remembered Stilpon the philosopher, who was reputed to have chosen for himself a life of retirement and study.", "2264": "Demetrius sent for him, and inquired whether anything had been stolen from him.", "2265": "“ Nothing,\" replied Stilpon. \" I saw no one taking away any knowledge.\"", "2266": "As, however, nearly all the slaves were stolen, after Demetrius had talked graciously to Stilpon and at length dismissed him with the words, \" My Stilpon, I leave you a free city;", "2267": "\" \" Quite true,\" replied Stilpon, “ for you have not left us a single slave.", "2268": "\"X. Demetrius now returned to Munychia, encamped before it, dislodged the garrison, and demolished the fort.", "2269": "And now at the invitation of the Athenians he proceeded into the city, where he assembled the people and re- established the ancient constitution.", "2270": "He also promised that his father Antigonus would send them one hundred and fifty thousand bushels of wheat and timber enough to build a fleet of one hundred ships of war.", "2271": "Thus did the enians recover their democratic constitution fifteen after it had been dissolved:", "2272": "for during the period between the Lamian war and the battle of Krannon their government had nominally been an oligarchy, but practi­ cally had been a despotism, on account of the great power of Demetrius of Phalerum.", "2273": "The benefits which Demetrius conferred upon the Athe­ nians rendered him indeed great and glorious;", "2274": "but they rendered his fame invidious by the extravagant honours which they conferred upon him.", "2275": "They were the first of all men who bestowed upon Antigonus and Demetrius the title of Kings, a name which they greatly disliked because of its association, and which moreover belonged at that time in an especial manner to the descendants of Philip and Alexander, being the only one of their ensigns of royalty which had not been adopted by other princes", "2276": "The Athenians too were the only people who styled Antigonus and Demetrius their saviour gods, and they even abolished the ancient office of the archon from whom the year received its name, and elected in his place every year a priest to minister at the altar of the saviour gods.", "2277": "They also decreed that their images should be woven into the sacred peplus of Athena,* with those of the gods.", "2278": "They consecrated the spot where Demetrius first set his foot on the ground when he alighted from his chariot, and built an altar upon it which was called the altar of “ The Descending Demetrius.\"", "2279": "They added two to the number of their tribes, and called them Demetrias and Antigonis;", "2280": "and consequently they raised the number of the senators from five to six hundred, because each tribe supplied it with fifty members.", "2281": "XI.", "2282": "But the most outrageous of these devices of Strato­ kles, for it was he who invented all these new extrava­ gancies of adulation, was a decree that ambassadors sent to Antigonus or to Demetrius should wear the same holy title which had hitherto been given to the envoys who conducted the public sacrifices to the great festivals at Olympia and at Delphi.", "2283": "Indeed, in all other respects Stratokles was a man of shameless effrontery and debauched life, who appeared to imitate the scurrility of Kleon in ancient times by the reckless contempt with which he treated the people.", "2284": "He publicly kept a cour tesan named Phylakion;", "2285": "and one day when she had bought some necks and brains in the market, he said to her, \" Why, you have bought us the same things for dinner which we politicians play at ball with.\".", "2286": "When the Athenians were defeated in the great sea- fight at Amorgos, he reached Athens before the news of the disaster, and drove though the Kerameikus with a garland on his head, telling all the people that a victory had been won.", "2287": "He decreed a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and had meat publicly distributed among the tribes for entertain­ ments.", "2288": "Shortly afterwards the scattered ships began to arrive, coming home as well as they could after the defeat.", "2289": "When the people angrily turned upon him, resenting the trick which he had played them, he met their clamour with the utmost impudence, and said, “ What harm have I done you, in giving you two days of happiness ?", "2290": "\" Such was the audacity of Stratokles.XII.", "2291": "There were, however, other marks of servility, “ hotter than fire,” as Aristophanes calls it.", "2292": "One Athenian surpassed Stratokles himself by passing a decree that Demetrius, whenever he visited Athens, should be received with the same divine honours which were paid to Demeter and Dionysius, and that money should be granted from the public treasury to the person who should celebrate the festival of the reception with the greatest magnifi­ cence, in order that with it he might erect some memorial of his success.", "2293": "At last the name of the month Munychion was changed to Demetrion, and the first day of it named Demetrias, while the name of the festival of the Dionysia was changed to Demetria.", "2294": "Most of these acts produced manifest signs of the dis­ pleasure of the gods.", "2295": "The peplus, upon which, according to the decree, the images of Zeus and Athena were woven together with those of Antigonus and Demetrius, was rent in two by a violent gust of wind as it was being conveyed in procession through the Kerameikus, while a great quantity of hemlock grew up round the altars which were erected in their honour, although it was not a common plant in the neighbourhood.", "2296": "On the day of the festival of Dionysius the procession was put a stop to by excessive cold, which came entirely out of season, and a severe frost not only destroyed all the fig-trees and vines, but even cut off a great part of the corn in the blade.", "2297": "In consequence of this, Philippides, who was an enemy of Stratokles, made the following allusion to him in one of his comedies:", "2298": "is Who was it caused the peplus to be rent ?", "2299": "Who was it caused the frost to blight our vines?", "2300": "The wretch, who worships mortals like to gods, His crimes destroy is, not my harmless rhymes?”", "2301": "This Philippides was a friend of Lysimachus, who for his sake conferred many benefits on the Athenians.", "2302": "Lysi­ machus imagined that the sight of Philippides before any campaign or expedition was a certain omen of good luck;", "2303": "while Philippides was beloved by him on other grounds, because he gave no trouble and never veiled his thoughts in courtly periphrases.", "2304": "Once Lysimachus, meaning to be very civil to him said, “ Philippides, which of my possessions shall I bestow upon you ? \" \"", "2305": "Whichever you please,\" answered he, \" except your secrets.\"", "2306": "I have mentioned these incidents in the life of Philippides, in order to mark the distinction between the comic poet an the mob-orator.", "2307": "XIII.", "2308": "The most extraordinary of all the honours con­ ferred upon Demetrius was the proposal made by Demo­ kleides of Sphettus to go and ask for an oracular response from him about the consecration of the shields at Delphi.", "2309": "I will write down the exact words of the law as it was proposed. \"", "2310": "In a happy hour the people decree that one man shall be chosen from the citizens of Athens, who shall go to our saviour, and after he has done

husband's death.", "2315": "The Athenians were greatly delighted at this marriage, which they regarded as an honour to their city;", "2316": "though Deme­ trius made no sort of difficulty about marriage, and had many wives at the same time.", "2317": "The chief of his wives, and the one whom he most respected, was Phila, the daughter of Antipater, and the widow of Kraterus, who was the most popular with the Macedonians of all the successors of Alexander during his life, and the most lamented by them after his death.", "2318": "Demetrius when very young was forced by his father to marry

Euripides:", "2320": "\"To gain a fortune, marriage must be dared.\" substituting the word \" marriage \" for “ bondage,\" which occurs in the original.", "2321": "However, the respect which Demetrius paid to her and to his other wives did not prevent his intriguing with various courtesans and mistresses, but he had a worse reputation in this respect than any other king of his age.", "2322": "XV.",

desist from the war in defence of the liberties of Greece, a much more noble and glorious struggle, he first endeavoured to bribe Ptolemy's lieutenant in command of the garrison of Sikyon and Corinth to evacuate those cities and render them independent.", "2325": "As this attempt failed he quickly set sail, collected a large force, and proceeded to Cyprus.", "2326": "Here he fought a battle with

messages of scornful defiance.", "2329": "Ptolemy bade Demetrius put to sea before his own host assembled and overwhelmed him, while Demetrius offered to permit Ptolemy to withdraw from Cyprus on condition that he would give up Corinth and Sikyon.", "2330": "The battle which ensued was one of the deepest interest, not merely to the combatants themselves, but to all the other princes, since its

hundred and fifty sail, and ordered Menelaus, when the battle was at its hottest, to sally out from Salamis with his sixty ships and throw the fleet of Demetrius into disorder by attacking it in the rear.", "2333": "Demetrius sent ten ships to oppose these sixty, for the mouth of the harbour (of Salamis) was so narrow that this number sufficed to close it.", "2334": "He himself now got his land force under arms, disposed it upon several neighbouring promontories, and put to sea with one hundred and eighty ships.", "2335": "He bore straight down upon the enemy's fleet, and completely defeated it.", "2336": "Ptolemy himself, when all was lost, escaped with only eight ships, the sole survivors of his fleet.", "2337": "All the rest were sunk, except seventy which were captured with their crews on board.", "2338": "All his numerous train of servants, friends and wives, all his arms, money and military engines, which were stationed near the fleet in transports, were captured by

flute-player, and who had afterwards become notorious by her amours.", "2340": "Her beauty was at this time somewhat faded, yet, although Demetrius was much younger than herself, she so fascinated and enslaved him by her charms, that, though many other women wished for his love, he cared only for her.", "2341": "After the sea-fight, Menelaus held out no longer, but surrendered Salamis to Demetrius,

he came near, he stretched forth his right hand, and in a loud voice exclaimed, “ Hail, King Antigonus.", "2354": "We have defeated Ptolemy in a sea-fight.", "2355": "We are masters of Cyprus, and have taken sixteen thousand eight hundred prisoners.\"", "2356": "To this Antigonus answered, “ Hail to you, also;", "2357": "but you shall pay the penalty of having tortured us so long:", "2358": "you shall wait long before you receive the reward for your good news.", "2359": "\"", "2360": "XVIII.", "2361": "After this success, the people for the first time saluted Antigonus and Demetrius with the title of kings.", "2362": "The friends of Antigonus at once placed a diadem upon his head, and he sent one to Demetrius, with a letter in which he addressed him as king.", "2363": "The Egyptians, when they heard of this, also proclaimed Ptolemy king, that they might not appear to be dispirited by their defeat.", "2364": "Their example was soon followed by the other successors of Alexander, out of rivalry, for Lysimachus and Seleukus now began to wear the diadem in the presence of Greeks, though Seleukus had long before adopted the royal style in his dealings with Asiatics.", "2365": "Kassander, however, although every one both in interviews and letters addressed him as king, never used the title in his own letters, but signed them simply with his own name as he had been wont to do.", "2366": "The assumption of this title produced more important results than a mere empty change of name and style.", "2367": "It caused its bearers to be more exalted in their ideas, more extensive in their ambition, and more pompous and stately in their demeanour, just as actors when they put on royal robes adopt also the lofty port and the haughty voice and carriage of a king.", "2368": "They also became more severe in their administration of justice, because they now laid aside that dissimulation by which they had hitherto concealed their power, and which had rendered them so much more lenient and gentle in their treatment of their subjects.", "2369": "So great was the power of the voice of one flatterer, and such great changes did it effect in the entire world.", "2370": "XIX.", "2371": "Antigonus, elated by the successes of Demetrius at Cyprus, at once marched to attack Ptolemy.", "2372": "He him­ self led the land force, while Demetrius accompanied him along the coast with an enormous fleet.", "2373": "But Medius, a friend of Antigonus, was warned in a dream of what was destined to be the issue of the campaign.", "2374": "He dreamed that Antigonus with all his army was running a race in the circus.", "2375": "At first he appeared to be running strongly and fast, but soon his strength seemed to be ebbing away, and at last when he turned round the extreme point of the course and began to return, he was so weak and out of breath that he could hardly recover himself.", "2376": "Indeed Antigonus by land met with many disasters, while Demetrius at sea met with a terrible storm, and narrowly escaped being driven ashore upon an iron-bound coast.", "2377": "He lost many ships, and returned without having accomplished anything.", "2378": "Antigonus was now very near eighty years of age, and was incapacitated for active service by his size and unwieldiness rather than by his age.", "2379": "He consequently entrusted the management of the war to Demetrius, who had already by his good fortune and skill conducted several most important campaigns with success.", "2380": "Antigonus was not alarmed at his amours, his extrava­ gancies, or his carousals, for he knew that, although in time of peace Demetrius used to indulge unrestrainedly in these pleasures, yet that in war he was as sober as though it were natural to him to be so.", "2381": "It is said that, in allusion to the empire which Lamia had now gained over Demetrius, once when he affectionately embraced his father on his return from a journey, Antigonus said, “ My boy, you seem to think that you are caressing Lamia.\"", "2382": "Another time, when Demetrius spent several days in drinking, and excused himself by saying that he had been laid up with a severe cold, Antigonus answered, “So I understood, but was the cold Chian or Thasian ? \" Once Antigonus heard that Demetrius had a fever, and went to see him.", "2383": "At the door he met one of his favourites coming out.", "2384": "He went in, sat down by his bedside, and took him by the hand.", "2385": "When Demetrius said that the fever had just left him, Antigonus answered, “ Yes, I met it just now at the door.\"", "2386": "So gently did he deal with the vices of Demetrius, because of his many other good qualities.", "2387": "The Scythians have a custom of twanging their bows while they are drinking and carousing, as though to recall their courage while it is melting away in pleasure;", "2388": "but Demetrius used to give up his whole thoughts at one time to pleasure, and at another to serious work, concen­ trating his entire attention upon the matter in hand, so that his amusements never interfered with his preparations for war.", "2389": "XX.", "2390": "He appears indeed to have been better able to make preparations for war than to use them, for he always liked to be more than sufficiently provided with stores of every kind, and always wished to construct larger ships, and more powerful battering engines, in the working of which he took an especial delight.", "2391": "He was intelligent and clever, and did not waste his mechanical ingenuity in mere pastime, like other princes, who have amused them­ selves by playing on the flute, painting, or working in metal.", "2392": "Æropus, king of Macedonia, used to employ his leisure time in making little tables and lamps;", "2393": "while Attains, surnamed Philometor, amused himself by culti­ vating poisonous herbs, not merely hyoscyamus and helle­ bore, but even hemlock, aconite and dorycnium.*", "2394": "These he used to plant and tend with his own hands in the royal gardens, and made it his business to know their various juices and fruit, and to gather it in due season.", "2395": "The kings of Parthia, too, used to pride themselves upon sharpening the points of their own javelins.", "2396": "But the mechanics of Demetrius were always upon a royal scale, and his engines were of enormous size, showing by their admirable and ingenious construction the grand ideas of their inventor;", "2397": "for they appeared worthy not only of the genius and wealth, but of the hand of a king.", "2398": "Their size astonished his friends, while their beauty charmed even his enemies, and this praise is far from being as exaggerated as it sounds;", "2399": "for his enemies actually stood in crowds along the sea-shore to admire his ships of fifteen and sixteen banks of oars, while his \" city-takers ” t were regarded as wonders even by the towns against which they were em­ ployed, as we may see in a notable example.", "2400": "Lysimachus, who of all the kings of his time was the bitterest enemy of Demetrius, when he was endeavouring to force Deme­ trius to raise the siege of Soli in Cilicia, sent a message to him asking to be allowed to see his siege engines and his ships of war.", "2401": "Demetrius indulged his curiosity, and after viewing them he retired home.", "2402": "The Rhodians also, after they had stood a long siege, when they came to terms with Demetrius, begged for some of his machines, which they wished to keep both as a memorial of his power and of their own courage.", "2403": "XXI.", "2404": "Demetrius went to war with the Rhodiana because they were the allies of Ptolemy, and brought up to their walls his largest \" city-taker,\" a machine with a square base, each side of which measured eight-and-forty cubits at the bottom.", "2405": "It was sixty-six cubits in height, and its upper part was much narrower than the base.", "2406": "Within, 24, was divided into many separate storeys and chambers, with windows on each storey opening towards the enemy, through which missiles of every kind could be shot, as it was full of soldiers armed with every kind of weapon.", "2407": "It never shook nor trembled, but rolled steadily onwards, upright and firm, with a regular, equable motion, which filled all spectators with terror and delight.", "2408": "Two steel corslets were brought from Cyprus for Demetrius to use in this war, each of which weighed forty minæ.*", "2409": "The maker, Zoilus, in order to show their strength and power of resisting a blow, bade Demetrius shoot a dart out of a catapult at one of them at a distance of twenty paces.", "2410": "Where it struck, the iron remained unbroken, and only showed a trifling scratch, such as might be made by a stilus, or iron pen for writing on wax.", "2411": "This corslet Demetrius wore himself.", "2412": "He gave the other to Alkimus of Epirus, the bravest and most warlike man in all his army, who wore a suit of armour weighing two talents,t while that of all the rest weighed only one talent.", "2413": "This man fell during the siege of Rhodes, in a battle near the theatre.", "2414": "XXII.", "2415": "The Rhodians defended themselves with great spirit, and Demetrius was unable to accomplish anything against them;", "2416": "but he still continued the siege out of anger, because they had captured a ship in which his wife Phila had sent him letters, clothes and bedding, and had sent it at once to Ptolemy, just as it was.", "2417": "In this they were far from imitating the courtesy of the Athenians, who, when Philip was at war with them, captured a mes­ senger and read all the letters which he carried except one written by Olympias, which they did not open, but sent it on to him with the seal unbroken.", "2418": "However, although Demetrius was much nettled by the conduct of the Rho­ dians, he did not stoop to retaliation upon them, although be soon had an opportunity of doing so.", "2419": "Protogenes of Kaunus happened at that time to be painting a picture of lalysus ‡ for the Rhodians, and Demetrius found the picture very nearly completed in one of the suburbs of the city.", "2420": "The Rhodians sent a herald and begged him to spare the work, and not destroy it, to which he answered, that he would rather burn his father's statues than such a precious work of art.", "2421": "Apelles tells us that when he saw this picture, the sight at first took away his breath;", "2422": "and that at last he said, \" Indeed this is a wonderful piece of work, and must have cost great labour.\"", "2423": "Yet it has not that grace which gives so divine a charm to the works of Apelles himself.", "2424": "This picture shared the common lot of all Greek works of art, being taken to Rome, where it was destroyed by fire.", "2425": "As the Rhodians gallantly held their own in the war, Demetrius became weary of the siege, and gladly accepted the offer of the Athenians to act as mediators.", "2426": "They made peace between them on condition that the Rhodians should act as the allies of Antigonus and Demetrius, except against Ptolemy.", "2427": "XXIII.", "2428": "The Athenians now invited Demetrius to come to their aid, as Kassander was besieging Athens.", "2429": "Deme­ trius arrived with three hundred and thirty ships, and a large land force.", "2430": "He not only drove Kassander out of Attica, but pursued him as far as Thermopylae, where he defeated him in a battle, and gained possession of the city of Heraklea, which voluntarily surrendered to him.", "2431": "A body of six thousand Macedonians also deserted from Kassander and joined him.", "2432": "On his return he freed the Greeks south of Thermopylae from Macedonian domina­ tion, formed an alliance with the Boeotians and took Kenchreæ.", "2433": "He destroyed the forts at Phyle and Panak­ turn in Attica, which had been garrisoned by Kassander's troops, and restored them to the Athenians.", "2434": "They, al­ though they appeared to have exhausted every possible form of adulation during his former visit, yet contrived to flatter him by the invention of fresh honours.", "2435": "They assigned the interior of the Parthenon to him for his lodging;", "2436": "and there he dwelt with the title of “ the guest of Athena,\" though he was a very ill-behaved guest to be quartered in the house of a virgin goddess.", "2437": "Yet once, when his father heard that his brother Philip was staying in a house where there were three young women, he said nothing to Philip, but in his presence sent fur the quartermaster and said to him, “ Will you be so good as to find some less crowded quarters for my son.", "2438": "\"XXIV.", "2439": "Demetrius, however, without paying the least respect to Athena, although he was wont to call her his elder sister, filled the Acropolis with such a series of outrages on well-born youths and women of the upper classes that the place became comparatively decent when he contented himself with holding an orgie in the society of the celebrated courtesans, Chrysis, Lamia, Demo and Antikyra.", "2440": "For the sake of the city I will say no more about his other debaucheries, but I cannot refrain from mentioning the virtue and chastity shown by Demokles.", "2441": "He was very young, and his beauty did not escape the notice of Demetrius;", "2442": "indeed his nickname betrayed him, for he was always spoken of as Demokles the Handsome.", "2443": "He turned a deaf ear to all advances, presents, or threats, and at last ceased to frequent the gymnasium and the palæstra, and used only a private bath.", "2444": "Demetrius watched his opportunity, and surprised him there alone.", "2445": "The boy, when he saw that he was caught where no one could help him, rather than suffer violence, took off the lid of the copper, leaped into the boiling water, and destroyed himself.", "2446": "He deserved a better fate, but the spirit which prompted the act was worthy of his country and of his beauty, and was very different to that of Kleaenetus the son of Kleomedon, who, when his father was condemned to pay a fine of fifty talents, obtained a remission of it from Demetrius, and showed a letter from Demetrius to the Athenian people signifying his pleasure in the matter;", "2447": "by which conduct Kleaenetus not only disgraced himself, but threw the whole city into a fer­ ment.", "2448": "Kleomedon's fine was remitted, but the people decreed that no citizen should ever again bring them a letter from Demetrius.", "2449": "However, as Demetrius was greatly incensed at this, and did not conceal his dis­ pleasure, the Athenians in terror not only reversed the decree, but put to death some of those who had advocated it, and banished others.", "2450": "Moreover, they actually decreed that “ the entire people of Athens should regard anything which King Demetrius might be pleased to command as both righteous in respect of the gods, and legal as regards men.\"", "2451": "When one of the better class of, citizens observed that Strategies must be mad to propose such a decree, Demochares* of Leukonoe answered “", "2452": "He would be mad not to be mad,”† for Stratokles made a great fortune by his flattery of Demetrius.", "2453": "This speech was reported to Stratokles, and Demochares was forced to go into exile.", "2454": "Such was the conduct of the Athenians when they were relieved of their Macedonian garrison and were thought to have become a free people.", "2455": "XXV.", "2456": "Demetrius now proceeded to Peloponnesus, where he met with no resistance, as the enemy fled before him, and surrendered their cities to him.", "2457": "He made himself master of the district known as Akte, and of the whole of Arcadia, except Mantinea, while he set free Argos, Sikyon and Corinth, by bribing their garrisons to evacuate them with a hundred talents.", "2458": "At Argos he acted as president of the games at the festival of Hera, which took place whilst he was there.", "2459": "On this occasion he held a solemn assembly of all the Greeks, and publicly married Deidameia, a daughter of Æakides, king of the Molossi, and sister of Pyrrhus.", "2460": "He remarked to the people of Sikyon that they lived out of their proper city, and prevailed upon them to remove to the spot which they now inhabit.", "2461": "He changed the name as well as the situation of the city, and instead of Sikyon named it Demetrias.", "2462": "At a largely attended meeting held at the Isthmus, Demetrius was proclaimed chief of Greece, as Philip and Alexander had been in former days;", "2463": "though Demetrius considered himself to be not a little superior to either of them, being elated by his good fortune and the immense force at his disposal.", "2464": "Alexander never deprived a king of his title, nor did he ever call himself king of kings, though he raised many to the dignity and style of kings;", "2465": "but Demetrius scoffed at those who called any one king, except himself and his father, and was much pleased at his carousals to hear toasts drunk to the health of Deme­ trius the King, Seleukus the Commander of the Elephants, Ptolemy the Admiral, Lysimachus the Treasurer, and Agathokles of Sicily the Lord of the Isles.", "2466": "The other princes laughed at these sallies of Demetrius, and only Lysimachus was angry that Demetrius should think him a eunuch ;", "2467": "for it was a pretty general custom to appoint eunuchs to the post of treasurer.", "2468": "Indeed Lysimachus hated him more bitterly than all of the rest, and, sneering at his passion for Lamia, used to declare that he had never before seen a whore act in a tragedy :", "2469": "to which Demetrius retorted that his whore was a more respectable woman than Lysimachus's Penelope.", "2470": "XXVI.", "2471": "Demetrius now set out for Athens, and sent a letter to the Athenians informing them that he desired to be initiated, and that he wished to go through the whole course, including both the lesser and the greater mysteries.", "2472": "This is not lawful, and never took place before, as the minor initiation used to take place in the month Anthesterion, and the greater in Boedromion.", "2473": "When the letter was read, no one ventured to offer any opposition except Pythodorus the torchbearer,* and he effected nothing;", "2474": "for, at the instance of Stratokles, the Athenians decreed that the month Munychion should be called Anthesterion, and in it celebrated the mysteries of Demeter which are held at Agræ.†", "2475": "After this the name of the month Munychion was changed again from Anthes­ terion to Bœdromion, and Demetrius was admitted to the second degree, and allowed the privileges of an “epoptes.\"", "2476": "In allusion to this Philippides rails at Stratokles in his verses as the man “Who crowds into one month the entire year.\"", "2477": "And, in allusion to the lodging of Demetrius in the Par­ thenon, he wrote “ Who treats Acropolis as t'were an inn And makes the Virgin's shrine a house of sin.", "2478": "\"XXVII.", "2479": "But of all the outrages and illegal acts of which Demetrius was guilty at this period, nothing seems to have enraged the Athenians so much as his ordering them speedily to levy a sum of two hundred and fifty talents, which, when it had been raised by a most harsh and pitiless series of exactions, was publicly presented by Demetrius to Lamia and her sisterhood to furnish their toilet-tables.", "2480": "It was the disgrace of the whole business and the scorn which it brought upon them, which stung them to the quick, more than the loss of the money.", "2481": "Some writers say that it was the people of Thessaly, not the Athenians, whom he treated in this manner.", "2482": "How­ ever, besides this, Lamia extorted money from many citizens on pretence of providing a supper for the king.", "2483": "This supper was so famous on account of the enormous sum which it cost, that a history of it was written by Lynkeus of Samoa.", "2484": "For this reason one of the comic poets very cleverly called Lamia a \"city-taker.\"", "2485": "Demochares of Soli called Demetrius himself “Mythus,” or \" Fable,” because he too had his Lamia.", "2486": "*Indeed the passion of Demetrius for Lamia caused not only his wives but his friends to dislike her and be jealous of her.", "2487": "Some of them went on an embassy to Lysimachus, and he when at leisure showed them on his thighs and arms the scars of deep wounds caused by a lion's claws, telling them of how King Alexander had fastened him in the same cage with the beast, and the battle he had fought with it.", "2488": "On hearing this they laughingly said that their master also frequently showed upon his neck the marks of a savage beast called Lamia, which he kept.", "2489": "The wonder was that Demetrius, who had objected to Phila as being past her first youth, should yet be so captivated by Lamia, who was now far advanced in years.", "2490": "Once when Lamia was playing on the flute at a banquet, Demetrius asked the courtesan Demo, who was surnamed Mania, what she thought of her.", "2491": "“ I think her an old woman, my king, replied she.", "2492": "Again when the sweet­ meats were placed on the table, Demetrius said to Demo, \" Do you see what fine things Lamia sends me ? \" \" My mother,\" answered Demo, “ will send you many more if only you will sleep with her.\"", "2493": "A saying of Lamia's about the well-known judgment of Bocchoris has been recorded.", "2494": "A certain Egyptian became enamoured of the courtesan Thonis, but she set too high a price upon her favours for him.", "2495": "Afterwards he dreamed that he had enjoyed her, and his passion for her cooled.", "2496": "Upon this Thonis sued him in court for the money, and Bocchoris, having heard the case argued, ordered the man to place the exact sum which she demanded in a glass vessel, and to wave it backwards and forwards while she clutched at the shadow, because the young man's dream had been a shadow of the reality.-", "2497": "Lamia said that she did not think this decision a just one, because the woman's desire for the gold was not satisfied by the shadow, as the young man's passion had been by his dream.", "2498": "XXVIII.", "2499": "But now the fortunes and deeds of the subject of our narrative force us to pass from a comic to a tragic scene, for all the other kings conspired against Antigonus, and united their forces together.", "2500": "Demetrius hereupon sailed away from Greece and joined his father, who was making wonderful exertions for a man of his age, and who was greatly encouraged by his son's arrival.", "2501": "Yet it appears as though Antigonus, if only he would have made some small concessions and restrained his excessive love of power, might have enjoyed his supreme dignity to the end of his life, and might have bequeathed to his son his position of chief of all the successors of Alexander.", "2502": "Being, however, by nature haughty and disdainful, and even harsher in word than in deed, he alienated from himself and exasperated many young and powerful men;", "2503": "and even now he boasted that he would scatter the con­ federacy by which he was menaced as easily as a man scares a flock of birds away from a field.", "2504": "He took the field with more than seventy thousand infantry, ten thousand cavalry, and seventy-five elephants, while his enemies' army numbered sixty-four thousand infantry, five hundred more cavalry than his own, four hundred elephants, and one hundred and twenty war-chariots.", "2505": "When they drew near he became less hopeful rather than less determined.", "2506": "He was always wont to show a lofty and boastful spirit in the hour of danger, speaking in a loud tone, using confident language, and after making some jest when in the presence of the enemy, to show his own assurance of success and contempt for his opponents.", "2507": "Now, however, he was thoughtful and silent, and presented his son to the army as his successor.", "2508": "But what astonished every one most of all was that he held council with Deme­ trius alone in the tent, although he never before had shared his secret thoughts even with his son, but had always privately formed his own plans, and publicly carried them out on his own responsibility.", "2509": "It is said that Demetrius, when still very young, once asked him at what hour he proposed to march, to which Antigonus angrily answered, “ Do you fear, that you alone will not hear the sound cf the trumpet?", "2510": "\"XXIX.", "2511": "On this occasion it appears that they were also disheartened by sinister omens.", "2512": "Demetrius dreamed that Alexander appeared before him in shining armour, and inquired what would be their watch-word for the battle.", "2513": "When Demetrius answered “ Zeus and victory,\" Alexander replied, ”I will go away now, and tell this to the enemy;", "2514": "for I am going over to them.\"", "2515": "Antigonus, too, as he stepped out of his tent to see his line formed stumbled and fell heavily upon his face.", "2516": "When he rose, he lifted his hands to heaven and prayed to the gods that they would either grant him victory or a painless death before his army was routed.", "2517": "When the battle began, Demetrius with the flower of the cavalry charged Antiochus the son of Seleukus, and brilliantly routed the enemy, but he lost the day by his headstrong eagerness to pursue too far.", "2518": "He was unable to rejoin the infantry, for the enemy's elephants interposed between him and the phalanx, which was thus left without any cavalry to cover its flanks.", "2519": "Seeing this,", "2520": "Seleukus kept the rest of his cavalry ever threatening to charge, but never actually doing so, hovering near the phalanx and both terrifying it and giving the men an opportunity of changing sides, which indeed took place;", "2521": "for a great mass of Antigonus's infantry came over to Seleukus, and the rest fled.", "2522": "Many enemies now beset Antigonus, and one of his attendants said to him, “ My king, it is you whom they are making for.\" “ Why,\" replied he, “ what other mark could they have but me?", "2523": "But Demetrius will soon be here to the rescue.\"", "2524": "While he looked round hoping in vain to see his son, a shower of darts fell, and laid him low.", "2525": "All his friends and attendants now fled, except one named Thorax, a native of Larissa, who remained by the corpse.", "2526": "XXX.", "2527": "After this battle the victorious kings proceeded to divide the empire of Antigonus and Demetrius amongst them, each annexing the portion which lay nearest to his own dominions, as though they were cutting slices out of some huge slaughtered beast.", "2528": "Demetrius fled with five thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry, and directed his march with the utmost speed towards Ephesus.", "2529": "All imagined that in his distress for money he would not spare the rich temple there, and he himself, fearing lest his soldiers should do so, set sail as quickly as possible for Greece, as his chief hopes now lay in Athens.", "2530": "Indeed he had left there a part of his fleet, some treasure and his wife Deidameia, and imagined that he could find no surer refuge in his adversity than Athens, where he felt assured of the loyalty of the people.", "2531": "But while he was passing the Cyclades he met an embassy from Athens begging him not to approach that city, since the people had decreed that none of the kings should be admitted within its walls.", "2532": "The ambassadors added that his wife Deidameia had been escorted with due honour and respect to Megara.", "2533": "On hearing this, Demetrius, who had borne the rest of his misfortunes with the utmost serenity, and had never hitherto allowed an unworthy expression to escape him, became transported with anger.", "2534": "He was, in truth, bitterly grieved at being thus unexpectedly betrayed by the Athenians, and at finding that their apparent enthusiasm in his cause had all the while been unreal and fictitious.", "2535": "Apparently the bestowal of excessive honours upon kings and potentates by the people is but a poor test of their real loyalty, for the essence of these honours lies in their being freely offered, and they are worthless if prompted by fear;", "2536": "and men fawn upon those they fear just as they do upon those whom they really love.", "2537": "For this reason sensible man know how to value the erection of their statues, flattering decrees, and other public honours, by reflecting upon what they themselves have done for their admirers;", "2538": "for by this means they can discern whether these are really genuine expressions of respect, or are extorted by terror;", "2539": "for peoples frequently confer these very distinctions upon men whom they hate and abhor, but whom they are forced to honour against their will.", "2540": "XXXI.", "2541": "Demetrius, although he considered that he had been very badly treated by the Athenians, was powerless to resent their conduct.", "2542": "He sent an embassy to Athens, gently complaining of their conduct, and requesting that they would restore his ships, one of which was a vessel of thirteen banks of oars.", "2543": "Having received them he coasted along as far as the Isthmus, where he found that all his garrisons had been driven out of the cities, and that the whole country had gone over to his enemies.", "2544": "He now left Pyrrhus to act as his lieutenant in Greece, and himself sailed to the Chersonese.*", "2545": "Here he enriched his troops at the expense of Lysimachus by plundering the country, and soon found means again to collect a very consider­ able army.", "2546": "The other kings paid no regard to Lysima­ chus, thinking that he was no better a man than Demetrius, and more to be feared because he was more powerful.", "2547": "Not long after this Seleukus sent an embassy to Deme­ trius to make proposals for the hand of Stratonike, the daughter of Demetrius by his wife Phila.", "2548": "Seleukus already had one son named Antiochus by his wife Apama, a Persian lady, but he thought that his empire would suffice for more than one heir, and he desired to form an alliance with Demetrius, because Lysimachus had recently married one of Ptolemy's daughters himself, and taken the other for his son Agathokles.", "2549": "To Demetrius this offer of marriage from Seleukus was a most unexpected piece of good fortune.", "2550": "He placed his daughter on board ship, and sailed with his entire fleet to Syria.", "2551": "On his way he was forced to land several times to obtain supplies, especially on the coast of Cilicia, which province, after the battle in which Antigonus fell, had been bestowed upon Pleistarchus, the brother of Kassander.", "2552": "Pleistarchus took umbrage at the intrusion of Demetrius into his territory, and retired to Macedonia to complain to his brother that Seleukus was betraying the

the sum of twelve hundred talents still remaining.", "2555": "Having made himself master of this, he quickly reem­ barked and put to sea.", "2556": "He was now joined by his wife Phila, and met Seleukus at Rhossas.", "2557": "Here the two princes conversed together in a truly royal style, without the least suspicion or fear of treachery.", "2558": "First Seleukus feasted Demetrius in his tent in the midst of his camp, and after­ wards Demetrius entertained him at a banquet on board his great thirteen-banked ship.", "2559": "They also talked freely together for a long time, spending several days in friendly intercourse without any body-guard or arms, till at length Seleukus took Stratonike, and escorted her with great pomp to Antiocheia.*", "2560": "Demetrius now made himself master of Cilicia, and sent his wife Phila to her brother, Kassander, to answer the accusations brought against him by Pleistarchus.", "2561": "During this time Deidameia sailed from Greece and joined Demetrius, but not long after her arrival she sickened and died.", "2562": "By the good offices of Seleukus, Demetrius was now reconciled with Ptolemy, and arranged to take Ptolemäis, Ptolemy's daughter, for his wife.", "2563": "So far Seleukus behaved very well;", "2564": "but he could not prevail upon Demetrius to give up Cilicia to him for a sum of money, and when he angrily demanded the surrender of Tyre and Sidon, his conduct appears very overbearing and ungenerous, as though he, who had made himself master of all the country between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, were so poor and needy as to be­ obliged to squabble with his father-in-law about two cities, at a time, too, when the latter was suffering from a great reverse of fortune.", "2565": "How strongly does this bear out the truth of Plato's maxim, that he who wishes to be really rich ought to lessen his desires rather than increase his property, because if a man places no bounds to his covetousness, he never will be free from want and misery.", "2566": "XXXIIL Demetrius on this occasion showed no want of spirit.", "2567": "He declared that not if he had lost ten thousand fields like Ipsus would he consent to buy Seleukus for his son-in-law.", "2568": "He strengthened the garrisons of the cities,.", "2569": "and hearing that Lachares, taking advantage of the factions into which the Athenians were divided,

against the Athenians.", "2572": "As, however, he could not effect anything, he sent his lieutenants to collect an­ other fleet, and meanwhile proceeded to Peloponnesus.", "2573": "Here he laid siege to Messene, and during an assault nearly lost his life, for he was struck full in the face by a dart from a catapult, which pierced through his jaw into his mouth.", "2574": "He recovered from his wound, received the sub­ mission of several insurgent cities, and returned to Attica, where he made himself master of Eleusis and Rhamnus, and ravaged the country.", "2575": "He captured a ship loaded with wheat bound for Athens, and hanged the captain and pilot, which measure terrified the other merchants so much that they avoided Athens, and a terrible famine took place there, and the want of food brought about a scarcity of everything else.", "2576": "A medimnus t of salt was sold for forty drachmas, and a modius ‡ of corn sold for three hundred drachmas.", "2577": "The Athenians gained a short respite from their sufferings by the appearance near Ægina of a fleet of a hundred and fifty sail, which was sent by Ptolemy to aid them.", "2578": "Soon, however, Demetrius collected from Peloponnesus and Cyprus a fleet of three hundred ships, before which those of Pto­ lemy were forced to retire.", "2579": "Upon this the despot Lachares made his escape and abandoned the city to its fate.", "2580": "XXXIV.", "2581": "The Athenians, although they had decreed that anyone who proposed to make peace and come to terms with Demetrius should be put to death, now at once opened their

incidents, it happened that a father and a son were sitting in the same room, without any hopes of surviving, when a dead mouse fell from the roof, upon which they both started up and began to fight for it.", "2584": "We are told that during this time the philosopher Epikurus kept his disciples alive by counting out to them a fixed allowance of beans every day.", "2585": "This was the con­ dition of the city when Demetrius made his entry into it.", "2586": "He ordered all the Athenians to assemble in the theatre, occupied the stage with armed men, placing his own body- guard round the part usually reserved for the actors, and made his appearance, like a tragic actor, through the entrance at the back.-", "2587": "The Athenians were greatly terrified at these proceedings, but the first words of his address put an end to their fears.", "2588": "He spoke in a mild and conciliatory tone, briefly and gently complained of their conduct towards him, and announced his forgive­ ness of

which he killed two hundred Spartans, and took five hundred prisoners;", "2596": "and he very nearly took the city itself, which up to that time had never been taken, Fortune, however, seems to have introduced greater and more sudden vicissitudes into the life of Demetrius than into that of any other prince, for he was constantly rising from the most abject poverty to the highest pinnacles of wealth and power, and then being as suddenly cast down again.", "2597": "He himself is said, when his fortunes were at their lowest, to have quoted the verse of Æschylus, \" Thou raisest up, and thou

as an honoured guest, but gave him to understand that he uc longer stood in need of his services.", "2608": "Upon this each began to suspect the other, and Demetrius, when he was proceeding to a banquet to which he had been invited by the young prince, was warned that his host intended to assassinate him while they were drinking after dinner.", "2609": "Demetrius was not in the least disturbed at this intelli­ gence, but merely delayed going to the banquet for a short time, while he ordered his officers to keep their men under arms, and bade his personal followers and pages, who far out-numbered the retinue of Alexander, to enter the banqueting hall with him, and to remain there until he left the table.", "2610": "Alarmed by these precautions, Alex­ under did not venture to offer him any violence;", "2611": "and Demetrius soon left the room, excusing himself on the ground that his health would not permit him to drink wine.", "2612": "On the following day Demetrius made preparations for departure, announcing that he had received news which made this necessary.", "2613": "He begged Alexander to pardon him for so sudden a retreat, and promised that when he was more at leisure he would pay him another visit.", "2614": "Alexander was delighted at this, thinking that Demetrius was leaving the country of his own free-will, and not as an enemy;", "2615": "and he

an attack from the army of Demetrius, became reassured, as nothing of the kind took place;", "2626": "and when Demetrius intimated to them his wish to address them and to explain his conduct, they received him in a friendly manner.", "2627": "When he appeared, he had no need to make a long speech, for the Macedonians, who hated Antipater for having murdered his mother, and who knew not where to look for a better sovereign, saluted Demetrius as King of the Macedonians, and at once conducted him into Macedonia.", "2628": "The new reign was not displeasing to the remainder of the Macedonians, who had never forgotten the disgraceful couduct of Kassander after the death of Alexander.", "2629": "If any remembrance of the moderation of their old governor Antipater still remained amongst them, Demetrius reaped the benefit of it, as his wife Phila was the daughter of Antipater, and his son,* by her, who was nearly grown up, and accompanied his father on this campaign, was now the heir to the throne.", "2630": "XXXVIII.", "2631": "After this brilliant piece of good fortune, Demetrius received the news that his mother and children had been set at liberty by Ptolemy, who had given them

life.", "2635": "Under pretence of illness he refused to take nourishment, neg­ lected his person, and was quietly sinking.", "2636": "Erasistratus, his physician, had without nuch difficulty perceived that he was in love, but could not guess with whom.", "2637": "He consequently spent the entire day in the same room with Antiochus, and whenever any young persons came to visit him, narrowly watched his countenance and those parts by which emotion is especially betrayed.", "2638": "He found that his condition was unaltered except when Stratonike came to see him, either alone or with her husband, Seleukus, and that then all the symptoms mentioned by Sappho were visible in him, such as stammering, fiery blushes, failure of eyesight, violent perspiration, disturbed and quickened pulse, and at length, as his passions gained the mastery over him, pallor and bewilderment.", "2639": "Erasis­ tratus, after making these observations, reflected that it was not probable that the king's son would starve himself to death in silence for love of any other woman than his mother-in-law.", "2640": "He judged it to be a perilous enterprise to explain the real state of the case, but, nevertheless, trusting to the love of Seleukus for his son, he one day ventured to tell him that love was really the disorder from which young Antiochus was suffering, and that it was a hopeless and incurable passion.", "2641": "\"", "2642": "How incurable ? \" inquired Seleu­ kus.", "2643": "\"Because,\" answered Erasistratus, \" he is in love with my wife.\"", "2644": "\" Well, then,\" said Seleukus, \" will you not give her up, Erasistratus, and marry her to my son, who is your friend, especially as that is the only way out of this trouble for us ? \" \" No,\" said Erasistratus, \" I will not.", "2645": "Why, you yourself, although you are his father, would not do this, if Antiochus were enamoured of Strato­ nike.\"", "2646": "To this Seleukus replied, \"My friend, I would that by any means, human or divine, his passion could be directed to her;", "2647": "for I would willingly even give up my crown if I could thereby save Antiochus.", "2648": "\"When Seleukus, in a tone of deep feeling and with tears in his eyes, made this avowal, Erasistratus took him by the hand, in token of good faith, and declared that his own services were quite useless, for that Seleukus himself was best able to heal the disorders which had arisen in his household.", "2649": "After this Seleukus convoked a general assembly of his people, and declared to them that he had determined to nominate Antiochus king, and Stratonike queen of all the nations of the interior, and that they were to be married.", "2650": "He believed, he said, that his son, who had always been accustomed to obey him, would raise no objection to the marriage;", "2651": "and that if his wife was dis­ contented with it on the ground of its illegality, he begged his friends to argue with her and persuade her to regard everything as legal and honourable which the king decided upon as expedient.", "2652": "In this manner it is said to have come to pass that Antiochus was married to Stratonike.", "2653": "XXXIX.", "2654": "After obtaining Macedonia, Demetrius made himself master of Thessaly also.", "2655": "As he possessed the greater part of Peloponnesus, besides Megara and

the most influential citizen of Thespiæ, encouraged them to recover their liberty, they revolted from Demetrius.", "2657": "Upon this, Demetrius brought up his famous siege train to attack their cities..", "2658": "Kleony­ mus was so terrified that he secretly withdrew, and the Bœotians were scared into submission.", "2659": "Demetrius, though he garrisoned all their cities with his own troops, levied a large sum of money, and left Hieronymus t the historian as governor of the province, was thought to have dealt very mildly with the Bœotians, especially because of his treatment of Pisis;", "2660": "for he not only dismissed him un­ harmed when brought before him as a prisoner, but conversed with him in a friendly manner, and nominated him polemarch of Thespiæ.-", "2661": "Not long after these events, Lysimachus was taken prisoner by Dromichætus.", "2662": "Upon this, Demetrius at once hurriedly marched towards", "2663": "Thrace, hoping to find it unguarded.", "2664": "The Bœotians seized the opportunity of his absence to revolt, while news was brought to Demetlius that Lysimachus had been dismissed by his captors.", "2665": "Enraged at this, he speedily returned, and

leaving ten thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry in Thessaly, returned to press the siege of Thebes.", "2669": "He now brought up his great machine, called the \" City-taker,\" which was moved by

Antigonus, grieved at the number of men who had fallen, said, \" My father, why do we allow all these men to perish, when there is no occasion for it?\"", "2674": "Demetrius sharply an­ swered, \" Why do you take offence at this ?", "2675": "Do you have to pay the dead ? \"", "2676": "Yet Demetrius, not wishing it to be thought that he was lavish of other men's blood and not of his own, but being anxious to fight among the foremost, was wounded by a dart thrown from a catapult, which pierced through his neck.", "2677": "He suffered much from this wound, but still continued the siege, and at length took Thebes for the second time.", "2678": "When he entered the city, he inspired the citizens with the most intense terror, as they expected to be treated with the greatest severity.", "2679": "He was satisfied, however, with putting to death thirteen of the citizens, and banishing a few others.", "2680": "Thus was Thebes taken twice within less than ten years since it was first rebuilt.", "2681": "As the time for the Pythian games had now come round, Demetrius took upon himself to make a most startling innovation.", "2682": "As the passes leading to Delphi were held by the Ætolians, he celebrated the games in Athens, declaring that it was right that especial honour should be paid there to Apollo, who is the tutelary god of the Athenians, and is said to have been the founder of their race.", "2683": "XLI.", "2684": "Demetrius now returned to Macedonia.", "2685": "As he could not bear a life of repose, and found that his subjects were more easily governed on a campaign, since they were troublesome and turbulent when at home, he marched against the Ætolians.", "2686": "After laying waste their country he left Pantauchus there with a large portion of his army, and with the rest marched to attack Pyrrhus.", "2687": "Pyrrhus was equally eager to meet him, but they missed each other, so that Demetrius invaded and ravaged Epirus, while Pyrrhus * fell in with Pantauchus and fought with him.", "2688": "He himself exchanged blows with Pantauchus and put him to flight, killing many of his followers, and taking five thousand prisoners.", "2689": "This did more damage to the cause of Demetrius than anything else ;", "2690": "for Pyrrhus was not so much disliked for the harm which he had done them, as he was admired for his personal prowess.", "2691": "His fame became great in Macedonia after this battle, and many Macedonians were heard to say that he alone, of all the princes of the time, revived the image of Alexander's daring courage, while the rest, and especially Demetrius, only imitated his demeanour by their threatrical pomp and trappings of royalty.", "2692": "Indeed, Demetrius gave himself the most extravagant airs, wearing magnificent purple robes and hats with a double crown, and even wore shoes of purple felt em­ broidered with gold.", "2693": "There was a cloak which was for a long time being embroidered for his use, a most extravagantly showy piece of work, upon which was depicted a figure of the world and of the heavenly bodies.", "2694": "This cloak was left unfinished when Demetrius lost his crown, and none of his successors on the throne of Mace­ donia ever presumed to wear it, although some of them were very ostentatious princes.", "2695": "XLII.", "2696": "The spectacle of this unusual pomp irritated the Macedonians, who were not accustomed to see their kings thus attired, while the luxury and extravagance of Demetrius's mode of life also gave offence to them.", "2697": "They were especially enraged at his haughty reserve, and the difficulty of obtaining access to him ;", "2698": "for he either refused to grant an interview, or else treated those who were admitted to his presence with harshness and insolence.", "2699": "He kept an embassy of the Athenians, whom he respected beyond all other Greeks, waiting for two years for an audience;", "2700": "and when one ambassador arrived from Lacedæ­ mon, he construed it as a mark of disrespect, and was angry.", "2701": "But when Demetrius said to the ambassador:", "2702": "— \" What is this that you tell me ?", "2703": "the Lacedæmonians have sent one ambassador! \" \" Yes,\" answered he cleverly and laconically, \" one ambassador to one king.", "2704": "\"One day when Demetrius came out of his palace he appeared to be in a more affable humour than usual, and willing to converse with his subjects.", "2705": "Upon this, many persons ran to present him with written statements of their grievances.", "2706": "As he received them all and placed them in the folds of his cloak, the petitioners were greatly delighted, and accompanied him;", "2707": "but when he came to the bridge over the Axius, he emptied them all out of his cloak into the river.", "2708": "This conduct greatly exasperated the Macedonians, who declared that they were insulted instead of being governed by him, and who remembered or were told by older men how gentle and easy of access Philip was always wont to be.", "2709": "Once an old woman met him when he was walking, and begged repeatedly for a hearing.", "2710": "When he replied that he had no leisure to attend to her, she loudly cried out, \" Then be king no more.\"", "2711": "Stung by this taunt he re­ turned to his palace, and gave audiences to all who wished it, beginning with the old woman, and so continued for many days.", "2712": "Indeed nothing becomes a king so much as to do justice to his subjects.", "2713": "As Timotheus the poet has it, Ares is a despot, but Pindar tells us that law is lord of all.", "2714": "Homer also says that kings have been entrusted by Zeus, not with City-takers or brazen-bound ships, but with justice, which they must keep and respect;", "2715": "and that Zeus does not love the most warlike or the most unjust of kings, but the most righteous, and calls him his friend and dis­ ciple.", "2716": "Demetrius however rejoiced in being called by a name most unlike that of the Lord of Heaven, for his title is \" The Preserver of Cities,\" while Demetrius was known as \" The Besieger.\"", "2717": "Thus through the worship of mere brute force, the bad gradually overcame the good side of his character, and his fame became sullied by the unworthy acts with which it was associated.", "2718": "XLIII.", "2719": "While Demetrius lay dangerously ill at Pella, he very nearly lost his kingdom, as Pyrrhus invaded the country and briskly overran it as far as Edessa.", "2720": "However, on his recovery, Demetrius easily drove Pyrrhus out of Macedonia, and then made terms with him, because he did not wish to be entangled in a border warfare, which would interfere with the realisation of his more important projects.", "2721": "He meditated a colossal enterprise indeed, nothing less than the recovery of the whole of his father's empire.", "2722": "His preparations were on a commensurate scale, for he had collected a force of ninety-eight thousand foot soldiers and nearly twelve thousand horse, while at Peiræus, Corinth, Lhalkis, and the ports near Pella he was engaged in the construction of a fleet of five hundred ships.", "2723": "He himself personally superintended the works, visiting each dockyard and giving directions to the artificers;", "2724": "and all men were astounded not only at the number, but at the size of the vessels which were being built.", "2725": "Before his time no one had ever seen a ship of fifteen or sixteen banks of oars, although in later times Ptolemy Philopator built a ship of forty banks of oars, which measured two hundred and eighty cubits in length, and forty-eight cubits in height.", "2726": "This ship was navigated by four hundred sailors, four thousand rowers, and, besides all these, had room upon its decks for nearly three thou­ sand soldiers.", "2727": "But this ship was merely for show, and differed little from a fixed building, being totally useless, and only moved with great risk and labour;", "2728": "whereas the beauty of-the ships of Demetrius did not render them less serviceable, nor was their equipment so elaborate as to interfere with their use, but they were no less admirable for speed and strength as for greatness of size.", "2729": "XLIV.", "2730": "When this great armament, the largest ever collected since the death of Alexander, began to menace Asia, the three princes, Ptolemy, Seleukus, and Lysimachus, formed a confederation to oppose it.", "2731": "They next sent a joint letter to Pyrrhus, in which they urged him to attack Macedonia, and not to pay any regard to a peace by which Demetrius had not made any engagement not to go to war with him, but had merely obtained time to attack the others first.", "2732": "Pyrrhus agreed to this proposal, and Deme­ trius, before his preparations were completed, found him­ self involved in a war of considerable magnitude:", "2733": "for Ptolemy sailed to Greece with a large fleet and caused it to revolt from Demetrius, while Lysimachus from Thrace and Pyrrhus from Epirus invaded Macedonia and ravaged the country.", "2734": "Demetrius left his son to command in Greece, and himself marched to attack Lysimachus, in order to free Macedonia from the enemy.", "2735": "He shortly, however, received the news that Pyrrhus had taken the city of Berœa, and when the Macedonians heard this, there was an end to all discipline, for the camp was full of tears and lamentations, and abuse of Demetrius.", "2736": "The men no longer cared to remain with him, but became eager to go away, nominally to their homes, but really to desert to Lysimachus.", "2737": "Demetrius upon this determined to place the greatest possible distance between Lysimachus and himself, and accordingly marched to attack Pyrrhus;", "2738": "reasoning that Lysimachus was a native of Macedonia, and was popular with many of the Macedonians because he had been a companion of Alexander, while he thought that the Macedonians would not prefer a foreigner like Pyrrhus to himself.", "2739": "However, in this expectation he was freatlydeceived:", "2740": "for as soon as he encamped near yri hus, his soldiers had a constant opportunity of admir­ ing his personal prowess in battle, and they had from the most ancient times been accustomed to think that the best warrior is the best king.", "2741": "When besides this they learned how leniently Pyrrhus had dealt with the captives, as they had long been determined to transfer their allegiance from Demetrius to some one else, they now gladly agreed that it should be to Pyrrhus.", "2742": "At first they deserted to him secretly and few at a time;", "2743": "but soon the whole camp became excited and disturbed, and at last some had the audacity to present themselves before Demetrius, and bid him seek safety in flight, for the Macedonians were tired of fighting to maintain his extravagance.", "2744": "Compared with the harsh language held by many other Macedonians, this appeared to Demetrius to be very reasonable advice, and so proceeding to his tent, as though he were really a play-actor and not a king, he changed his theatrical cloak for one of a dark colour, and made his way out of the camp unobserved.", "2745": "Most of his soldiery at once betook themselves to plundering, and while they were quar­ relling with one another over the spoils of the royal tent, Pyrrhus appeared, encountered no resistance, and made himself master of the camp.", "2746": "Pyrrhus and Lysimachus now divided between them the kingdom of Macedonia, which had for seven consecutive years been ruled by Demetrius.", "2747": "XLV.", "2748": "After this great disaster, Demetrius retired to Kassandreia.", "2749": "His wife Phila was greatly grieved at his fall, and

outweighed by his misfortunes, she ended her life by poison.", "2751": "Now Demetrius, anxious to save what he could from the wreck of his fortunes, pro­ ceeded to Greece, and there collected his generals and forces.", "2752": "The verses spoken by Menelaus in Sophokles's play­ .", "2753": "But ever whirling on the wheel of fate", "2754": "My fortune changes, like the changing moon", "2755":

again, and loses all her light,\" seem to express very well the strange waxing and waning of the fortunes of Demetrius, who, as in the present in­ stance, sometimes appeared to be quite extinguished, and then burst forth again as brilliant as ever, as little by little his power increased until he was able to carry out his plans.", "2760": "At first he visited the various cities of Greece dressed as a private man, without any of the insignia of royalty.", "2761": "One of the Thebans seeing him in this guise, cleverly applied to him the verses of Euripides:", "2762": "\"A god no more, but dressed in mortal guise, He comes to where the springs of Dirké rise.\"", "2763": "XLVI.", "2764": "When he again hoped to regain the style of royalty, and began to gather around him the form and substance of an empire, he permitted the Thebans to remain independent.", "2765": "The Athenians, however, revolted from him.", "2766": "They erased the name of Diphilus, who was inscribed upon the rolls as \" priest of the Saviours,\" * and decreed that archons should be elected after their ancestral custom;", "2767": "and they also sent to Macedonia to invite Pyrrhus to come and help them, as they perceived that Demetrius was becoming more powerful than they had expected.", "2768": "Demetrius indeed angrily marched upon Athens, and began to besiege the city, but the philosopher Krates, an able and eloquent man, who was sent to make terms with him by the Athenian people, partly by entreaties, and partly by pointing out in what quarter his true interests lay, prevailed upon him to raise the siege.", "2769": "Demetrius now collected what ships he could, and with eleven thousand infantry and a few cavalry soldiers sailed to Asia, intending to detach the provinces of Lydia and Karia from Lysima­ chus's dominions.", "2770": "At Miletus he was met by Eurydike,* the sister of Phila, who brought him her daughter Ptole­ mais, who had been long before promised to him in the treaty concluded by the mediation of Seleukus.", "2771": "Demetrius married her, and immediately after the wedding betook himself to gaining over the cities of Ionia, some of which joined him of their own accord, while others were forced to yield to his arms.", "2772": "He also captured Sardis, and several of the officers of Lysimachus deserted to him, bringing him both soldiers and money.", "2773": "When, however, Lysi­ uiachus's son Agathokles came to attack him with a large force, he withdrew into Phrygia, meaning if possible to gain possession of Armenia, stir up Media to revolt, and make himself master of the provinces in the interior, among which a fugitive could easily find an abundance of places of refuge.", "2774": "Agathokles pressed him hard, and Demetrius, although victorious in all the skirmishes which took place, was reduced to great straits, as he was cut off from his supplies of provisions and forage, while his soldiers began to suspect him of meaning to lead them to Armenia and Media.", "2775": "Famine now began to distress his army, and he also lost a large body of men, who were swept away in crossing the river Lykus through mis­ taking the ford.", "2776": "Yet the men did not cease to joke;", "2777": "and one of them wrote before the tent of Demetrius the first verses of the play of CEdipus at Kolonus, slightly altered:", "2778": "\" Child of Antigonus, the blind old man, What place is this, at which we have arrived ?\"XLVII.", "2779": "At last famine, as usually happens, produced a pestilence, because the men ate whatever they could find;", "2780": "and Demetrius, after losing no less than eight thousand, gave up his project, and led back the remainder.", "2781": "He proceeded to Tarsus, and would, if possible, have abstained from living on the neighbouring country which belonged.", "2782": "to Seleukus, and so giving him an excuse for attacking him.", "2783": "However, this was impossible, as his soldiers were reduced to the last extremities of want, and Agathokles had forti­ fled the passes of the Taurus range of mountains.", "2784": "Deme­ trius now wrote a letter to Seleukus, containing a long and piteous account of his misfortunes, and begging Seleukus as a relative to take pity on one who had suffered enough to make even his enemies feel compassion for him.", "2785": "Seleukus seems to have been touched by this appeal.", "2786": "He wrote to his generals, ordering them to show Demetrius the respect due to royalty, and to supply his troops with provisions;", "2787": "but now Patrokles, who was thought to be a man of great wisdom, and who was a friend of Seleukus, pointed out to him that the expense of feeding the troops of Demetrius was not a matter of great importance, but that it was a grievous error to allow Demetrius himself to remain in his territory.", "2788": "He reminded him that Demetrius had always been the most turbulent and enterprising of princes, and that he was now in a position which would urge the most moderate and peaceable of men to deeds of reckless daring and treachery.", "2789": "Struck by this reasoning, Seleukus started for Cilicia in person, at the head of a large army.", "2790": "Deme­ trius, astonished and alarmed at this rapid change in Seleukus's attitude, retreated to a strong position at the foot of the Taurus mountains, and in a second letter requested Seleukus to allow him to conquer some native territory occupied by independent tribes, in which he might repose after his wanderings, or at least to let him maintain his forces in Cilicia during the winter, and not to drive him out of the country and expose him to his enemies in a destitute condition.", "2791": "XLVIII.", "2792": "Seleukus viewed all these proposals with sus­ picion, and offered to let him pass two months of the winter in Cataonia, but demanded his chief officers as hostages, and at the same time began to secure the passes leading into Syria.", "2793": "Demetrius, who was now shut up like a wild beast in a trap, was driven to use force, overran the country, and fought several slight actions successfully with Seleukup.", "2794": "On one occasion he withstood a charge of scythed chariots, and routed the enemy, and he also drove away the garrison of one of the passes, and gained the command of the road to Syria.", "2795": "He now became elated by success, and perceiving that his soldiers had recovered their confidence, he determined to fight Seleukus for his kingdom.", "2796": "Seleukus himself was now in difficulties.", "2797": "He had refused Lysimachus's offer of assistance, through SUB­ picion, and he feared to engage with Demetrius in battle, dreading the effects of his despair and the sudden turns of his fortune.", "2798": "However, at this crisis Demetrius was seized by a disorder which nearly carried him off, and utterly ruined his prospects;", "2799": "for some of his soldiers deserted to the enemy, and some dispersed to their own homes.", "2800": "After forty days he was able to place himself at the head of the remaining troops, and with them marched so as to lead the enemy to suppose that he meant to return to Cilicia;", "2801": "but as soon as it was dark he started without any sound of trumpet in the opposite direction, crossed the pass of Amanus, and began to plunder the plain of Kyrrhestis.", "2802": "XLIX.", "2803": "Shortly afterwards", "2804": "Seleukus made his appear­ ance, and pitched his camp hard by.", "2805": "Demetrius now got his men under arms in the night and started to surprise Seleukus, whose army expected no attack, and was for the most part asleep.", "2806": "When he was informed of his danger by some deserters he leaped up in terror, and began putting on his boots and shouting to his friends that a savage beast was coming to attack them.", "2807": "Demetrius, observing from the noise which filled the enemy's camp that they had notice of his attempt, quickly marched back again.", "2808": "He was attacked at daybreak by Seleukus, and gained some advantage by a flank attack.", "2809": "But now Seleukus himself dismounted, took off his helmet, and with only a small shield in his hand went up to the mercenary troops of Demetrius, showing himself to them and inviting them to join him.", "2810": "They knew that he had for a long time refrained from attacking them out of a wish to spare their lives, and not for the sake of Demetrius;", "2811": "and they all greeted him, saluted him as King, and joined his army.", "2812": "Demetrius, who had seen so many turns of good and ill fortune, felt that this blow was final.", "2813": "He fled towards the pass of Amanus, and with a few friends and attendants took refuge in a thick wood for the night, hoping to be able to gain the road to Kaunus and so to reach the sea, where he hoped to find his fleet assembled.", "2814": "But when he found that his party had not enough money to procure them pro­ visions even for one day, he was forced to adopt other plans.", "2815": "Soon, however, he was joined by Sosigenes, one of his friends, who had four hundred gold pieces in his belt, and with this treasure they hoped to be able to reach the sea, and started as soon as it grew dark to make their way over the mountains.", "2816": "But when they saw the enemy's watch-fires blazing all along the heights, they despaired of effecting their passage by that route, and returned to the place whence they had set out, diminished in numbers, for some had deserted, and greatly disheartened.", "2817": "When one of them ventured to hint that Demetrius ought to surrender himself to Seleukus, Demetrius seized his sword and would have made away with himself, but his friends stood round him, and at length talked him over into giving himself up.", "2818": "He sent a messenger to Seleukus, putting himself unreservedly in his hands.", "2819": "L. Seleukus, when he heard what had happened, said that it was his own good fortune, not that of Demetrius, which had saved Demetrius's life, and had given himself an opportunity of displaying his clemency and goodness as well as his other virtues.", "2820": "He at once sent for his ser­ vants and bade them construct a royal tent, and make every preparation for the reception of Demetrius in a mag­ nificent fashion.", "2821": "There was one Apollonides at the court of Seleukus, who had been an intimate friend of Demetrius, and Seleukus at once sent him to Demetrius, to bid him be of good cheer, and not fear to meet his friend and relative Seleukus.", "2822": "When the King's pleasure became known, a few at first, but afterwards the greater part of his followers, eagerly flocked to pay their court to Demetrius, who they imagined would become the second man in the kingdom.", "2823": "This ill-judged zeal of theirs turned the compassion of Seleukus into jealousy, and enabled mischief-makers to defeat his kindly intentions by warning him that as soon as Demetrius was seen in his camp all his troops would rise in mutiny against him.", "2824": "Apollonides had just reached Demetrius in high spirits, and others were arriving with wonderful stories about the goodness of Seleukus.", "2825": "Deme­ trius himself was just recovering his spirits after his dis­ aster, was beginning to think that he had been wrong in his reluctance to surrender himself, and was full of hope for the future, when Pausanias appeared with about a thousand horse and foot-soldiers.", "2826": "He suddenly surrounded Demetrius with these troops, separated him from his friends, and, instead of bringing him into the presence of Seleukus, conducted him to the Syrian Chersonese, where, though strongly guarded, he was supplied by Seleukus with suitable lodging and entertainment, and allowed to take the air and hunt in the royal park which adjoined his dwelling.", "2827": "He was permitted to associate with any of the companions of his exile whom he wished to see, and many polite messages were sent to him from Seleukus to the effect that as soon as Antiochus and Stratonike arrived, they would come to some amicable arrangement.", "2828": "LI.", "2829": "Demetrius now despatched letters to his son, and to the commanders of his garrisons at Athens and Corinth, warning them not to pay any attention to any despatches which they might receive in his name, or even to his royal signet, but to regard him as practically dead, and to hold the cities in trust for his heir Antigonus.", "2830": "His son was much grieved at hearing of his father's capture, put on mourning, and sent letters to all the other kings, and to Seleukus himself, begging for his father's liberation.", "2831": "He offered to give up all the places which he still held, and even proposed to surrender himself as a hostage in place of his father.", "2832": "Many cities and princes supported his request, except Lysimachus, who offered to give Seleukus a large sum of money if he would put Demetrius to death.", "2833": "But Seleukus, who had always disliked Lysimachus, now regarded him with abhorrence as a savage villain, and still continued to keep Demetrius in captivity, under the pre­ text that he was waiting for the arrival of his son Antio- ChUB and Stratonike, that they might have the pleasure of restoring him to liberty.", "2834": "LI I. Demetrius at first bore up manfully against his misfortunes, and learned to endure captivity, taking exer­ cise as well as he could, by hunting in the park, and by running;", "2835": "but, little by little, he neglected these amuse­ ments, addicted himself to drinking and dicing, and thus spent most of his time;", "2836": "either in order to escape from the thoughts of his present condition by intoxication, or else because he felt that this was the life which he had always wished to lead, and that he had caused great suffering both to himself and to others by fighting by sea and land in order to obtain that comfort which he had now unex­ pectedly discovered in repose and quiet.", "2837": "What, indeed, is the object of the wars and dangers which bad kings endure, in their folly, unless it be this?", "2838": "although they not only strive after luxury and pleasure, instead of virtue and honour, but do not even understand in what real luxury and enjoyment consist.", "2839": "Be that as it may, Deme­ trius, after living in confinement in the Chersonese for three years, died of laziness, surfeit and over-indulgence in wine, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.-", "2840": "Seleukus was greatly blamed for the suspicions which he had enter­ tained about Demetrius, and greatly repented that he had not imitated the wild Thracian Dromichætes, who dealt so kindly and royally with Lysimachus when he had taken him prisoner.", "2841": "LIII.", "2842": "Even the funeral of Demetrius had an air of tragedy and theatrical display.", "2843": "His son Antigonus, as soon as he heard that the ashes of his father were being brought to him., collected all his fleet and met the vessels of Seleukus near the Cyclades.", "2844": "Here he received the relics in a golden urn on board of his own flagship, the largest of his fleet.", "2845": "At every port at which they touched the citizens laid garlands upon the urn, and sent deputies in mourning to attend the funeral.", "2846": "When the fleet arrived at Corinth, the urn was beheld in a conspicuous place upon the stem of the ship, adorned with a royal robe and diadem, and surrounded by armed soldiers of the king's body- guard.", "2847": "Near it was seated the celebrated flute-player Xenophantus, playing a sacred hymn;", "2848": "and the measured dip of the oars, keeping time to the music, sounded like the refrain of a dirge.", "2849": "The crowds who thronged the sea- shore were especially touched by the sight of Antigonus himself, bowed down with grief and with his eyes full of tears.", "2850": "After due honours had been paid to the relics at Corinth, he finally deposited them in the city of Demetrias, which was named after his father, and which had been formed by amalgamating the small villages in the neigh­ bourhood of Iolkos.", "2851": "Demetrius, by his wife Phila, left one son, Antigonus, and one daughter, Stratonike.", "2852": "He also had two sons named Demetrius, one, known as Leptus, by an Illyrian woman, and the other, who became ruler of Cyrene, by Ptolemais.", "2853": "By Deidameia he had a son named Alexander, who spent his life in Egypt.", "2854": "It is said, too, that he had a son named Korrhagus by Eurydike.", "2855": "His family retained the throne of Macedonia for many genera­ tions, until it ended in Perseus, during whose reign the Romans conquered that country.",

orator Antonius,* who belonged to the party of Sulla and was put to death by Marius.", "2859": "His father was Antonius, surnamed Creticus, † not a man of any great note or distinction in political affairs, but of good judgment and integrity, and also liberal in his donations, as one may know from a single instance.", "2860": "He had no large property and for this reason he was prevented by his wife from indulging his generous dis­ position.", "2861": "On one occasion when an intimate friend came to him who was in want of money, and Antonius had none, he ordered a young slave to put some water into a silver vessel and to bring it;", "2862": "and when it was brought, he moistened his chin as if he were going to shave himself.", "2863": "The slave being sent away on some other business, Antonius gave the cup to his friend and bade him make use of it , but as a strict inquiry was made among the slaves, and Antonius saw that his wife was vexed and intended to torture them one by one, he acknowledged what he had done and begged her pardon.", "2864": "II.", "2865": "His wife was Julia of the family of the Cæsars, a woman who could compare with the noblest and most virtuous of that day.", "2866": "She brought up her son Antonius, having married after his father's death Cornelius Lentulus,* who was one of the conspirators with Catilina and was put to death by Cicero.", "2867": "This appears to be the reason and the foundation of the violent enmity between Antonius and Cicero.", "2868": "Now Antonius says that even the corpse of Lentulus was not given up to them until his mother begged it of the wife of Cicero.", "2869": "But this is manifestly false, for no one of those who were then punished by Cicero was deprived of interment.", "2870": "Antonius was of distinguished appearance in his youth, but his friendship and intimacy with Curiof fell upon him, as they say, like some pestilence, for Curio himself was intemperate in his pleasures, and he hurried Antonius, in order to make him more manageable, into drinking and the company of women and extravagant and licentious expenditure.", "2871": "All this brought on him a heavy debt, and out of all bounds for his age, of two hun­ dred and fifty talents.", "2872": "Curio became security for all this, and when his father heard of it he banished Antonius from the house.", "2873": "Antonius for a short time mixed himself up with the violence of Clodius, the most daring and scandalous of the demagogues of the day, which was throwing every thing into confusion ;", "2874": "but becoming soon satiated with that madness and being afraid of those who were combining against Clodius, he left Italy for Greece and spent some time there, exercising his body for military contests and practising oratory.", "2875": "He adopted what was called the Asiatic style of oratory, which flourished most at that time, and bore a great resemblance to his mode of life, which was boastful and swaggering and full of empty pride and irregular aspiration after distinction.", "2876": "III.", "2877": "When Gabinius, ‡ a man of consular rank, was sailing for Syria, he endeavoured to persuade Antonius to join tho expedition.", "2878": "Antonius said that he would not go out with him as a private individual, but on being appointed commander of the cavalry, lie did go with him.", "2879": "In the first place he was sent against Aristobulus,* who was stir­ ring the Jews to revolt, and he was the first man to mount the largest of the fortifications;", "2880": "and he drove Aristobulus from all of them.", "2881": "lIe next joined battle with him and with the few men that he had put to flight the forces of Aristobulus, which were much more numerous, and killed all but a few;", "2882": "and Aristobulus was captured with his son.", "2883": "After this Ptolemæus † attempted to persuade Gabinius for ten thousand talents to join him in an invasion of Eygpt and to recover the kingdom for him;", "2884": "but most of the officers opposed the proposal, and Gabinius himself was somewhat afraid of the war, though he was hugely taken with the ten thousand talents;", "2885": "but Antonius, who was eager after great exploits and wished to gratify the request of Ptolemæus, persuaded Gabinius and urged him to the expedition.", "2886": "They feared more than the war the march to Pelusium, which was through deep sand where there was no water along the Ecregma ‡ and the Serbonian marsh, which the Egyptians call the blasts of Typhon,§ but which really appears to be left behind by the Red Sea|| and to be caused by the filtration of the waters at the part where it is separated by the narrowest part of the isthmus from the internal sea.", "2887": "Antonius being sent with the cavalry not only occupied the straits, but taking Pelusium also, a large city, and the soldiers in it, he at the same time made the road safe for the army and gave the general sure hopes of victory.", "2888": "Even his enemies reaped advantage from his love of distinction ;", "2889": "for when Ptolemæus entered Pelusium, and through his passion and hatred was moved to massacre the Egyptians, Antonius stood in the way and stopped him.", "2890": "And in the battles and the contests which were great and frequent, he displayed many deeds of daring and prudent generalship, but most signally in encircling and surrounding the enemy in the rear, whereby he secured the victory to those in front, and received the rewards of courage and fitting honours.", "2891": "Nor did the many fail to notice his humanity towards Archelaus* after his death;", "2892": "for Antonius, who had been his intimate and friend, fought against him during his lifetime of necessity, but when he found the body of Archelaus, who had fallen, he interred it with all honours and in kingly fashion.", "2893": "He thus left among the people of Alexandria the highest reputation, and was judged by the Roman soldiers to be a most illus­ trious man.", "2894": "IV.", "2895": "With these advantages he possessed a noble dignity of person;", "2896": "and his well-grown beard, his broad forehead and hooked noset appeared to express the manly character which is observed in the paintings and sculptures of Her­ cules.", "2897": "And there was an old tradition that the Antonii were Herakleidæ, being sprung from Anton, a son of Her­ cules.", "2898": "This tradition Antonius thought that he strength­ ened by the character of his person, as it has been observed, and by his dress.", "2899": "For on all occasions, when he was going to appear before a number of persons, he had his tunic girded up to his thigh, and a large sword hung by his side, and a thick cloak thrown round him.", "2900": "Besides, that which appeared to others to be offensive, his great boasting and jesting and display of his cups, and his sitting by the soldiers when they were eating, and his eating himself as he stood by the soldiers' table -it is wonderful how much affection and attachment for him it bred in the soldiers.", "2901": "His amorous propensities, too, had in them something that was not without a charm, but even by these he won the favour of many, helping them in their Jove affairs and submitting to be joked with good humour about his own amours.", "2902": "His liberality and his habit of gratifying the soldiers and his friends in nothing with a stinted or Sparing hand, both gave him a brilliant foundation for power, and, when he had become great, raised his power still higher, though it was in danger of being subverted by ten thousand other faults.", "2903": "I will relate one instance of his profusion.", "2904": "He ordered five-and-twenty ten thou­ sands to be given to one of his friends;", "2905": "this sum the Romans express by Decies.*", "2906": "But as his steward wondered thereat, and to show him how much it was, placed the money out, he asked as he was passing by, What that was.", "2907": "The steward replying that this was what he had ordered to be given, Antonius, who conjectured his trickery;", "2908": "said, \"I thought a Decies was more:", "2909": "this is a small matter;", "2910": "and therefore add to it as much more.\"V. Now these things belong to a later period.", "2911": "But when matters at Rome came to a split, the aristocratical party joining Pompeius who was present, and the popular party inviting Cæsar from Gaul, who was in arms, Curio, the friend of Antonius, † changing sides in favour of Cæsar, brought Antonius over;", "2912": "and as he had great influence among the many by his eloquence, and spent money lavishly, which was supplied by Cæsar, he got Antonius appointed tribune, and then one of the priests over the birds, whom the Romans call Augurs.", "2913": "As soon as An­ tonius entered on his office, he was of no small assistance to those who were directing public affairs on Cæsar's behalf.", "2914": "In the first place, when Marcellus the consul attempted to give to Pompeius the troops that were already levied, and to empower him to raise others, An­ tonius opposed him by proposing an order, that the col­ lected force should sail to Syria and assist Bibulus, who was warring with the Parthians, and that the troops which Pompeius was levying should not pay any regard to him:", "2915": "and, in the second place, when the Senate would not receive Cæsar's letters, nor allow them to be read, Antonius, whose office gave him power, did read them, and he changed the disposition of many, who judged from Cæsar's letters that he only asked what was just and reasonable.", "2916": "Finally, when two questions were proposed in the Senate, of which one was, whether Pompeius should disband his troops, and the other, whether Cæsar should do it, and there were a few in favour of Pompeius laying down his arms, and all but a few were for Cæsar doing so, Antonius arose and put the question, Whether the Senate was of opinion that Pom­ peius and Cæsar at the same time should lay down their arms and disband their forces.", "2917": "All eagerly accepted this proposal, and with shouts praising Antonius, they urged to put the question to the vote.", "2918": "But as the consuls would not consent, the friends of Cæsar again made other pro­ posals, which were considered reasonable, which Cato resisted, and Lentulus, who was consul, ejected Antonius from the Senate.", "2919": "Antonius went out uttering many im­ precations against them, and assuming the dress of a slave, and in conjunction with Cassius Quintus* hiring a chariot he hurried to Caesar ;", "2920": "and as soon as they were in sight, they called out that affairs at Rome were no longer in any order, since even tribunes had no liberty of speech, but every one was driven away and in danger who spoke on the side of justice.", "2921": "VI. Upon this Cæsar with his army entered Italy.", "2922": "Accordingly Cicero, in his Philippica, said that Helen- was the beginning of the Trojan war, and Antonius of the civil war, wherein he is manifestly stating a falsehood.", "2923": "For Caius Cæsar was not such a light person, or so easy to be moved from his sound judgment by passion, if he had not long ago determined to do this, as to have made war on his country all of a sudden, because he saw Antonius in a mean dress and Cassius making their escape to him in a hired chariot;", "2924": "but this gave a ground and specious reason for the war to a man who had long been wanting a pretext.", "2925": "He was led to war against the whole world, as Alexander before him and Cyrus of old had been, by an insatiable love of power and a

them, and making them presents out of his means ;", "2930": "but to everybody else he was odious.", "2931": "For owing to his carelessness he paid no attention to those who were wronged, and listened with ill-temper to those who addressed him, and had a bad repute about other men's wives.", "2932": "In fine, Cæsar's friends brought odium on Cæsar's power, which, so far as con­ cerned Cæsar's acts,

which decided everything at Pharsalus,* he had the right wing himself, but he gave the command of the left to Antonius as being the most skilful and bravest officer that he had.", "2950": "After the battle Cæsar was proclaimed dictator, and he set out in pursuit of Pompeius, but he appointed Antonius master of the horse and sent him to Rome:", "2951": "this is the second office in rank when the dictator is.", "2952": "present;", "2953": "but if he is not, it is the first and almost the only one.", "2954": "For the tribuneship continues, but they put down all the other functionaries when a dictator is chosen.", "2955": "IX.", "2956": "However Dolabella,t who was then a tribune, a young man who aimed at change, introduced a measure for the annulling of debts, and he persuaded Antonius,* who was a friend of his and always wished to please the many, to work with him and to take a part in this political measure.", "2957": "But Asinius and Trebellius gave him the contrary advice, and it happened that a strong suspicion came on Antonius, that he was wronged in the matter of his wife by Dolabella.", "2958": "And as he was much annoyed thereat, he not only drove his wife from his house, who was his cousin, for she was the daughter of Caius Antonius who was consul with Cicero, but he joined Asinius and resisted Dolabella.", "2959": "Dolabella occupied the Forum with the design of carrying the law by force, but Antonius, after the Senate had declared by a vote that it was needful to oppose Dolabella with arms, came upon him and joining battle killed some of the men of Dolabella and lost some of his own.", "2960": "This brought on Antonius the hatred of the many, and he was not liked by the honest and sober on account of his habits of life, as Cicero says, but was detested;", "2961": "for people were disgusted at his drunkenness at unseasonable hours, and his heavy expenditure, and his intercourse with women, and his sleeping by day, and walking about with head confused and loaded with drink, and by night his revellings and theatres and his presence at the nuptials of mimi and jesters.", "2962": "It is said indeed that after being present at the entertainment on the marriage of Hippias the mime, and drinking all night, when the people summoned him early in the morning to the Forum, he came there still full of food and vomited, and one of his friends placed his vest under to serve him.", "2963": "Sergius the mime was one of those who had the greatest influence over him, and Cytheris† from the same school, a woman whom he loved, and whom when he visited the cities he took round with him in a litter;", "2964": "and there were as many attendants to follow the litter as that of his mother.", "2965": "People were also vexed at the sight of golden cups carried about in his excursions as in pro­ cessions, and fixing of tents in the ways, and the laying out of costly feasts near groves and rivers, and lions yoked to chariots, and houses of orderly men and women used as quarters for prostitutes and lute-players.", "2966": "For it was con­ sidered past all endurance that, while Caesar was lodging in the open field out of Italy, clearing up the remnant of war with great labour and danger, others, through means of Caesar's power, were indulging in luxury and insulting the citizens.", "2967": "X.", "2968": "These things appear also to have increased the dis­ order and to have given the soldiers licence to commit shameful violence and robbery.", "2969": "Wherefore, when Cæsar returned, he pardoned Dolabella;", "2970": "and being elected consul for the third time he chose not Antonius, but Lepidus for his colleague.", "2971": "Antonius bought the house of Pompeius when it was sold, but he was vexed when he was asked for the money;", "2972": "and he says himself that this was the reason why he did not join Caesar in his Libyan expedi­ tion, having had no reward for his former successes.", "2973": "How­ ever Cæsar is considered to have cured him of the chief part of his folly and extravagance by not allowing his excesses to pass unnoticed.", "2974": "For he gave up that course of life and turned his thoughts to wedlock, taking for his wife Fulvia, who had been the wife of the demagogue Clodius, a woman who troubled herself not about domestic industry or housekeeping, nor one who aspired to rule a private man, but her wish was to rule a ruler and command a general:", "2975": "so that Cleopatra was indebted to Fulvia * for training Antonius to woman-rule, inasmuch as Cleopatra received him quite tamed and disciplined from the commencement to obey women.", "2976": "However Antonius attempted by sportive ways and youthful sallies to make Fulvia somewhat merrier;", "2977": "as for example, on the occasion when many went to meet Caesar after his victory in Iberia, Antonius also went;", "2978": "but as a report suddenly reached Italy that Cæsar was dead and the enemy wei e advancing, he returned to Rome, and taking a slave's dress he came to the house by night, and saying that he brought a letter from Antonius to Fulvia, he was introduced to her wrapped up in his dress.", "2979": "Fulvia, who was in a state of anxiety, asked, before she took the letter, whether Antonius was alive;", "2980": "but without speaking a word he held out the letter to her, and when she was beginning to open and read it, he embraced and kissed her.", "2981": "These few out of many things I have produced by way of instance.", "2982": "XI.", "2983": "When Cæsar was returning from Iberia* all the first people went several days' journey to meet him;", "2984": "but Antonius was specially honoured by Cæsar.", "2985": "For in his passage through Italy he had Antonius in the chariot with him, and behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavianus the son of his niece, who was afterwards named Cæsar and ruled the Romans for a very long time.", "2986": "When Cæsar was appointed consul for the fifth time, he immediately chose Antonius for his colleague, and it was his design to ab­ dicate the consulship and give it to Dolabella;", "2987": "and this he proposed to the Senate.", "2988": "But as Antonius violently opposed this, and vented much abuse of Dolabella and received as much in return, Cæsar, being ashamed of these unseemly proceedings, went away.", "2989": "Afterwards when he came to proclaim Dolabella, upon Antonius calling out that the birds were opposed to it, Cæsar yielded and gave up Dolabella, who was much annoyed.", "2990": "But it appeared that Caesar abominated Dolabella as much as he did Antonius;", "2991": "for it is said, that when some person was endeavouring to excite his suspicions against both, Cæsar said that he was not afraid of those fat and long-haired fellows, but those pale and thin ones, meaning Brutus and Cassius, who afterwards conspired against him and slew him.", "2992": "XII.", "2993": "And Antonius without designing it gave them a most specious pretext.", "2994": "It was the feast of the Lykæa among the Romans, which they call Lupercalia,* and Cæsar dressed in a triumphal robe and sitting on the Rostra in the Forum viewed the runners.", "2995": "Now many youths of noble birth run the race, and many of the magistrates, anointed with oil, and with strips of hide they strike by way of sport those whom they meet.", "2996": "Antonius running among them paid no regard to the ancient usage, but wrapping a crown of bay round a diadem he ran to the Rostra, and being raised up by his companions in the race he placed it on Cæsar's head, intimating that he ought to be King.", "2997": "But as Cæsar affected to refuse it and put his head aside, the people were pleased and clapped their hands;", "2998": "then Antonius again offered the crown, and Cæsar again rejected it.", "2999": "This contest went on for some time, only a few of the friends of Antonius encouraging him in his pressing the offer, but all the people shouted and clapped when Cæsar refused;", "3000": "which indeed was surprising, that while in reality they submitted to be ruled over with kingly power they eschewed the name of King as if it were the destruction of their freedom.", "3001": "Accordingly Cæsar rose from the Rostra much annoyed, and taking the robe from his neck called out that he offered his throat to any one who would have it.", "3002": "The crown which was placed on one of his statues certain tribunes tore off, and the people fol­ lowed them with loud expressions of goodwill and clap­ ping of hands ;", "3003": "but Cæsar deprived them of their office.", "3004": "XIII.", "3005": "This confirmed Brutus and Cassius, and when they were enumerating the friends whom they could trust in the undertaking, they deliberated about Antonius.", "3006": "The rest were for adding Antonius to their number, but Trebonius opposed it;", "3007": "for he said that at the time when they went to meet Cæsar on his return from Iberia, and Antonius was in the same tent with him and journeyed with him, he tried his disposition in a quiet way and with caution, and he said that Antonius understood him, though he did not respond to the proposal, nor yet did he report it to Cæsar, but faithfully kept the words secret.", "3008": "Upon this they again deliberated whether they should kill Antonius after they had killed Cæsar;", "3009": "but Brutus opposed this, urging that the act which was adventured in defence of the laws and of justice must be pure and free from injustice.", "3010": "But as they were afraid of the strength of Antonius and the credit that his office gave him, they appointed some of the conspirators to look after him in order that when Cæsar entered the Senate house and the deed was going to be done, they might detain him on the outside in conversation about some matter and on the pretence of urgent business.", "3011": "XIV.", "3012": "This being accomplished according as it was planned and Cæsar having fallen in the Senate house, Antonius immediately put on a slave's attire and hid himself.", "3013": "But when he learned that the men were not attacking any one, but were assembled in the Capitol, he persuaded them to come down after giving them his son as a hostage;", "3014": "and he entertained Cassius at supper, and Brutus entertained Lepidus.", "3015": "Antonius having summoned the Senate spoke about an amnesty and a distribution of provinces among Brutus and Cassius and their parti zans, and the Senate ratified these proposals, and decreed not to alter anything that had been done by Caesar.*", "3016": "Antonius went out of the Senate the most distinguished of men, being considered to have prevented a civil war and to have managed most prudently and in a most statesmanlike manner circumstances which involved difficulties and no ordinary causes of confusion.", "3017": "But from such considera­ tions as these he was soon disturbed by the opinion that he derived from the multitude, that he would certainly be the first man in Rome, if Brutus were put down.", "3018": "Now it happened that when Cæsar's corpse was carried forth, as the custom was, he pronounced an oration over it in the Forum ;", "3019": "† and seeing that the people were powerfully led and affected, he mingled with the praises of Caesar coin­ miseration and mighty passion over the sad event, and at the close of his speech, shaking the garments of the dead, which were blood-stained and hacked with the swords, and calling those who had done these things villains and murderers, he inspired so much indignation in the men that they burnt the body of Cæsar in the Forum, heaping together the benches and the tables;", "3020": "and snatching burn­ ing faggots from the pile they ran to the houses of the assassins and assaulted them.", "3021": "XV.", "3022": "For this reason Brutus and his party left the city, and the friends of Cæsar joined Antonius;", "3023": "and Caesar's wife Calpurnia trusting to him had the chief part of the treasures transferred to Antonius from her house, to the amount in all of four thousand talents.", "3024": "He received also the writings of Cæsar, in which there were entries made of what he had determined and decreed;", "3025": "and Antonius inserting entries in them, named many to offices just as he pleased, and many he named senators, and he restored some who were in exile and released others who were in prison, as if Cæsar had determined all this.", "3026": "Wherefore the Romans by way of mockery named all these persons Charonitæ,* because when they were put to the proof they had to take refuge in the memoranda of the deceased.", "3027": "And Antonius managed everything else as if he had full power, being consul himself, and having his brothers also in office, Caius as prætor and Lucius as tribune.", "3028": "XVI.", "3029": "While affairs were in this state, young Cæsar† arrived at Rome, being the son of the niece of the deceased, AS it has been told, and left the heir of his substance;", "3030": "and he was staying in Apollonia at the time of Cæsar's assas­ sination.", "3031": "He went forthwith to pay his respects to Antonius, as being his father's friend, and reminded him of the money deposited with him;", "3032": "for he had to pay to every Roman seventy-five drachmas, which Cæsar had given by his will.", "3033": "Antonius, at first despising his youth, said that he was not in his senses, and that being destitute of all sound reason and friends he was taking up the suc­ cession of Cæsar, which was a burden too great for him to bear;", "3034": "but as Cæsar did not yield to these arguments and demanded the money, Antonius went on saying and doing many things to insult him.", "3035": "For he opposed him in seeking a tribuneship, and when he was preparing to set up a golden chair of his father, as it had been voted by the Senate, he threatened to carry him off to prison, if he did not stop his attempts to win the popular favour.", "3036": "But when the youth, by giving himself up to Cicero and the rest who hated Antonius, by means of them made the Senate his friends, and he himself got the favour of the people and mustered the soldiers from the colonies,* An­ tonius being alarmed came to a conference with him in the Capitol, and they were reconciled.", "3037": "Antonius in his sleep that night had a strange dream ;", "3038": "he thought that his right hand was struck by lightning;", "3039": "and a few days after a report reached him that Cæsar was plotting against him.", "3040": "Cæsar indeed made an explanation, but he did not convince Antonius;", "3041": "and their enmity was again in full activity, and both of them roaming about Italy endeavoured to stir up by large pay the soldiers who were planted in the colonies, and to anticipate one another in gaining over those who were still under arms.", "3042": "XVII.", "3043": "Of those in the city Cicero had the greatest influence;", "3044": "and by inciting everybody against Antonius he finally persuaded the Senate to vote Antonius to be an enemy, and to send Caesar lictors and the insignia of a prætor, and to despatch Pansa and Hirtins† to drive An­ tonius out of Italy.", "3045": "They were consuls for that year;", "3046": "and engaging with Antonius near the city of Mutina, on which occasion Cæsar was present and fought with them, they defeated the enemy, but fell themselves.", "3047": "Many great difficulties befell Antonius in his flight;", "3048": "but the greatest was famine.", "3049": "But it was the nature of Antonius to show his best qualities in difficulties, and in his mis­ fortune he was as like as may be to a good man ;", "3050": "for it is common to those who are hard pressed by straits to per­ ceive what virtue is, but all have not strength enough in reverses to imitate what they admire and to avoid what they do not approve;", "3051": "but some rather give way to their habits through weakness and let their judgment be de­ stroyed.", "3052": "Now Antonius in these circumstances was a powerful pattern to the soldiers, for though he was fresh from the enjoyment of so much luxury and expense, he drank foul water without complaining, and ate wild fruits and roots.", "3053": "Bark too was eaten, as it was said, and in their passage over the Alps they fed on animals that had never been eaten before.", "3054": "XVIII.", "3055": "His design was to fall in with the troops there which Lepidus* commanded, who was considered to be a friend of Antonius and to have derived through him much advantage from the friendship of Cæsar.", "3056": "Having arrived there and encamped near, he found no friendly signs, on which he resolved to try a bold stroke.", "3057": "Antonius had neglected his hair and he had allowed his beard to grow long immediately after his defeat;", "3058": "and putting on a dark garment he approached the lines of Lepidus and began to speak.", "3059": "As many of the soldiers were moved at the sight and affected by his words, Lepidus in alarm ordered the trumpets to sound all at once and so to prevent Antonius from being heard.", "3060": "But the soldiers pitied the more, and t held communication with him by means of Lælius and Clodius, whom they secretly sent to him in the dress of women who followed the camp, and the messengers urged Antonius boldly to attack the lines, for there were many, they said, would undertake even to kill Lepidus, if he wished.", "3061": "Antonius would not consent to their touching Lepidus, but on the next day he began to cross the river with his army.", "3062": "Antonius entered the river first and ad­ vanced to the opposite bank, for he saw already many of the soldiers of Lepidus stretching out their hands to him and tearing down the ramparts.", "3063": "When he had entered and made himself master of all, he approached Lepidus with the greatest kindness, for he embraced him and called him father;", "3064": "and in fact he was master of all, but he continued to preserve to Lepidus the name and honour of an Imperator.", "3065": "This caused also Plancus Munatius to join him, for Plancus was at no great distance with a large force.", "3066": "Being thus raised anew to great power he crossed the Alps into Italy at the head of seventeen legions of infantry and ten thousand cavalry;", "3067": "besides this he left to guard Gaul six legions with Varius, one of his intimates and boon companions, whom they called Cotylon.", "3068": "*XIX.", "3069": "Now Cæsar no longer cared for Cicero when he saw that he clung to liberty, but he invited Antonius through the mediation of his friends to come to terms.", "3070": "The three met together in a small islandt in the middle of a river and sat together for three days.", "3071": "All the rest was easily agreed on, and they distributed the empiret among them as if it were a p aternal inheritance, but the discus­ sion about the men who were destined to perish caused them most trouble, each claiming to get rid of his enemies and to save his relations.", "3072": "But at length surrendering to their passion against those whom they hated both the honour duo to their kinsmen and their goodwill to their friends, Cæsar surrendered Cicero to Antonius, and An­ tonius surrendered to him Lucius Cæsar, who was his uncle on the mother's side;", "3073": "Lepidus also was allowed to put to death his brother Paulus;", "3074": "but others say that Lepidus gave up his brother to Cæsar and Antonius, who required his death.", "3075": "I think nothing could be more cruel or savage than this exchange;", "3076": "for by exchanging murder for murder they equally destroyed those whom they sur­ rendered and those whom they put to death, but they acted more unjustly to their friends, whom they caused to die even without bearing them any hatred.", "3077": "XX.", "3078": "After this settlement, the soldiers, who were around them, required that Caesar should strengthen their friendship by marriage, and should take to wife Clodia,* the daughter of Fulvia, the wife of Antonius.", "3079": "This also being agreed to, three hundred persons were by proscription put to death by them.t", "3080": "When Cicero was murdered, Antonius ordered the head to be cut off and the right hand, with which Cicero wrote the speeches against him.", "3081": "When they were brought, Antonius looked on them with delight and broke out a laughing several times through joy;", "3082": "then being satiated with the sight he ordered them to be placed above the Rostra in the Forum, as if he were insulting the dead, and not showing his own arrogance in his good fortune and abusing his power.", "3083": "His uncle Cæsar being sought and pursued fled for refuge to his sister, who, when the assassins were standing by and trying to force their way into her chamber, fixing herself at the door and spreading out her arms, called out repeatedly, \" You shall not kill Cæsar Lucius, unless you kill me first, me the mother of the Imperator.\"", "3084": "By such her conduct she rescued and saved her brother.", "3085": "XXI.", "3086": "The dominion of the three was in most respects hateful to the Romans;", "3087": "but Antonius had most of the blame, as he was older than Cæsar, and had more influence than Lepidus, and threw himself without restraint into his former luxurious and intemperate habits as soon as he had shaken off all trouble about affairs.", "3088": "There was added to his general bad repute the hatred against him on account of the house that he inhabited, which had been the house of Pompeius Magnus, a man no less admired for his temperance and his orderly and citizenlike mode of life than for his three triumphs.", "3089": "For they were vexed to see his house generally closed to commanders, magis­ trates and ambassadors, who were insolently thrust from the doors, while it was filled with mimi and jugglers and drunken flatterers, upon whom was expended most of the money which was got by the most violent and harsh means.", "3090": "For the three not only sold the substance of those who were murdered, bringing false charges against their kinsmen and wives, and tried all kinds of imposts;", "3091": "but hearing that there were deposits * with the Vestal Virgins made both by strangers and citizens, they went and seized them.", "3092": "Now as nothing was enough for Antonius, Cæsar claimed to share the money with him;", "3093": "and they also distributed the army between them, and both went together into Macedonia to oppose Brutus and Cassius ;", "3094": "and they intrusted Rome to Lepidus.", "3095": "XXII.", "3096": "Crossing over the sea they commenced the campaign and encamped by the enemy, Antonius being opposed to Cassius, and Caesar to Brutus,t wherein no great deed was performed on the part of Cæsar, but it was Antonius who gained all the victory and had all the success.", "3097": "In the first battle, Caesar, being completely routed by Brutus, lost his camp and narrowly escaped from his pursuers;", "3098": "but, as he says in his Memoirs, he retired before the battle in consequence of one of his friends having had a dream.", "3099": "But Antonius defeated Cassius;", "3100": "though some have written that Antonius was not in the battle, but came up after the battle to join in the pursuit.", "3101": "Pindarus, one of the faithful freedmen of Cassius, killed him at his request and order, for Cassius did not know that Brutus was victorious.", "3102": "After an interval of a few days they fought a second battle, in which Brutus being defeated killed himself, and Antonius carried off the chief credit of the victory, inasmuch as Cæsar was sick.", "3103": "Standing over the corpse of Brutus he upbraided it gently for the death of his brother Caius,* for Brutus had put Caius to death in Macedonia to revenge Cicero;", "3104": "but declaring that he blamed Hortensius more than Brutus for the murder of his brother, Antonius ordered him to be massacred on his tomb;", "3105": "and he threw over the body of Brutus his own purple cloak, which was of great value, and commanded one of his freedmen to look after the interment.", "3106": "He afterwards found out that this fellow did not burn the cloak with the corpse and that he had purloined a large part of the expenditure destined for the interment, whereon he put him to death.", "3107": "XXIII.", "3108": "After this Cæsar went back to Rome, and it was supposed that he would not live long on account of his illness.", "3109": "Antonius crossed over into (Greece with a large army, intending to levy money in all the eastern provinces;", "3110": "for as they had promised to every soldier five thousand drachmae, they required more vigorous measures for raising money and collecting contributions.", "3111": "Towards the Greeks his conduct was neither unusual nor

door, and wives of kings vying with one another in their presents and their beauty let themselves be corrupted in order to win his favour, and while Cæsar at Rome was worn out with civil commotions and war, he enjoying perfect leisure and tranquillity was carried back by his passions to his usual habits of life, and Anaxenor t a lute-player and Xuthus a piper and Metrodorus a dancer, and other such rout of Asiatic theatrical folks who surpassed in impudence and shamelessness the pests from Italy, had crept in and managed his residence-it was past all bearing, for everything was waited on these extravagancies.", "3121": "For all Asia, like that city in Sophocles,§ at the same time was filled with incense burning, “ With pæans too 'twas filled and heavy groans.”", "3122": "Thus, when he

from well-born men and gave it to worthless men and flatterers;", "3127": "and certain persons got the substance of many who were still alive by asking for it as if they were dead.", "3128": "He gave the house of a citizen of Magnesia to a cook, who, as it is said, had distinguished himself by a single entertainment.", "3129": "Finally, when he was imposing a second contribution on the citizens, Hybreas* was bold enough in speaking on behalf of Asia to use these words, which were indeed such as the common folks would have in their mouths, but were not ill adapted to flatter† the vanity of Antonius, “ If thou canst take contributions twice in one year, thou canst also make for us summer twice and harvest-time twice but he concluded with these practical and bold words, that Asia had given twenty ten thousands of talents;", "3130": "and “if thou hast not had them, demand them of those who have received the money ;", "3131": "but if thou hast received and hast them not, we are

because in his simplicity he trusted those abc ut him.", "3134": "For there was in his character simplicity and slow perception;", "3135": "but when he did perceive his errors, there was strong repentance, and acknowledg­ ment to those who had been wronged, and excess both in the restitution that he made and the punishment that he inflicted.", "3136": "Yet he was considered to surpass the bounds of moderation rather in conferring favours than in punishing.", "3137": "His rudeness in mirth and bantering carried its own remedy with it;", "3138": "for a man might return him as good as he

spoke so freely in jest, could flatter him in earnest, and so he was easily caught by praise, not knowing that some persons by mingling freedom of expression, like a sharpish sauce, with flattery, took away from flattery its nauseating insipidity, by their boldness and babbling over their cups striving to make their yielding in matters of business and their assent appear, not the way of persons who keep about a man merely to please him, but of those who are overpowered by superior wisdom.", "3142": "XXV.", "3143": "Such was the disposition of Antonius, upon which a crowning evil the love for Cleopatra supervening, and stirring up and maddening many of the passions that were still concealed in him and lying quiet, caused to vanish and utterly destroyed whatever of goodness and of a saving

accordingly, wishing to display some good nature and kindness, obeyed and came.", "3161": "He found a preparation greater than he expected, but he was most surprised at the number of the lights :", "3162": "for it is said that so many lights were hung down and shewn on all sides at once and arranged and put together in such in­ clinations and positions with respect to one another in the form of squares and circles, that of the few things that are beautiful and worthy of being seen this sight was one.", "3163": "XXVII.", "3164": "On the following day when Antonius feasted her in turn he was ambitious to surpass her splendour and taste, but he was left behind and inferior in both, and in these very things he was the first to scoff at the coarse­ ness and rusticity of his own entertainment.", "3165": "Cleopatra, observing in the jests of Antonius much of the soldier and the unpolished man, adopted the same manner towards him freely and boldly.", "3166": "Now her beauty, as they say, was not in itself altogether incomparable nor such as to strike those who saw her;", "3167": "but familiarity with her had an irre­ sistible charm, and her form, combined with her persuasive speech and with the peculiar character which in a manner was diffused about her behaviour, produced a certain piquancy.", "3168": "There was a sweetness also in the sound of her voice when she spoke;", "3169": "and as she could easily turn her tongue, like a many-stringed instrument, to any lan­ guage that she pleased, she had very seldom need of an interpreter for her communication with barbarians, but she answered most by herself, as Ethiopians,* Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Medes, Parthians.", "3170": "She is said also to have learned the language of many other peoples, though the kings her predecessors had not even taken the pains to learn the Egyptian language, and some of them had even given up the Macedonian dialect.", "3171": "XXVIII.", "3172": "Now she so captivated Antonius, that though his wife Fulvia was carrying on war at Rome against Cæsar on behalf of the interests of Antonius, and a Parthian army was hovering about Mesopotamia, of which the king's generals had named Labienus t Parthian governor, and they were about to enter Syria, he allowed himself to be carried off by her to Alexandria;", "3173": "and there staying and amusing himself like a young man who had leisure, he consumed and expended upon pleasure the most costly of all things, as Antiphon said, Time.", "3174": "They had a kind of company called Inimitable Livers;", "3175": "and they daily feasted one another, making an incredible profusion in their expenditure.", "3176": "Now Philotas of Amphissa,* a physi­ cian, used to relate to my grandfather Lamprias, that he was then in Alexandria learning his profession, and hav­ ing got acquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was persuaded by him, as was natural in a young man, to view the costliness and the preparation for the table.", "3177": "Accord­ ingly he was introduced into the kitchen, where he saw everything in great abundance, and eight wild boars roasting, which made him wonder at the number of the guests.", "3178": "Hereupon the cook laughed and said, the party at supper was not large, only about twelve ;", "3179": "but it was necessary that everything which was served up should be in perfection, which a moment of time would spoil.", "3180": "He said it might happen that Antonius should wish to sup immediately, and if it so happened, he might defer it by asking for a cup or by falling into some conversation;", "3181": "and accordingly, he continued, not one supper is prepared, but many, for the exact time is difficult to conjecture.", "3182": "This is what Philotas used to tell ;", "3183": "and in the course of time, as he related, he was among those who attended on the oldest son of Antonius, whom he had by Fulvia, and he supped with him with the rest of his companions, as a general rule, when he did not sup with his father.", "3184": "On one occasion there was a physician present who was brag­ ging greatly and much annoying the company at supper, but Philotas stopped him by a sophism of this kind :", "3185": "“If a man has fever in some degree, we must give him cold water ;", "3186": "but every man who has fever has fever in some degree ;", "3187": "we must therefore give cold water to every man who has fever.\"", "3188": "The man was confounded and put to silence, whereat the youth being pleased, laughed and said, \"All this, Philotas, I give you, pointing to a table full of many large cups.\"", "3189": "Philotas acknowledged his in­ tended kindness, though he was far from thinking that a boy of his age had authority to make such a present;", "3190": "but after awhile one of the young slaves took hold of the cups and bringing them in a vessel bade him put a seal on it.", "3191": "As Philotas made objections and was afraid to take the things.", "3192": "\" Why, you fool,\" said the man,\" do you hesitate ?", "3193": "Don't you know that the giver is the son of Antonius, and that he has permission to give so many things of gold ?", "3194": "If however you tae my advice, you will exchange the whole with us for a sum of money;", "3195": "for perchance the youth's father might call for some of the vessels, which are old and valued for their workmanship.”", "3196": "Such anecdotes as these my grandfather used to say that Philotas would oc­ casionally tell.", "3197": "XXIX.", "3198": "But Cleopatra, by distributing flattery not, as Plato* says, in four ways, but in many ways, and by always adding some new pleasure and charm to whatever was either serious or mirthful, completely ruled Antonius, never leaving him by night nor by day.", "3199": "For she played at dice with him, and drank with him, and hunted with him, and was a spectator when he was exercising in arms, and by night when he was standing at the doors and windows of the common people and jesting with those within, she accompanied him in his rambles and freaks, in the dress of a female slave;", "3200": "for Antonius also used to dress himself in this style.", "3201": "Accordingly he would return home always well loaded with coarse abuse and sometimes with blows.", "3202": "With the greater part he was in no good credit;", "3203": "however the Alexandrines took delight in his extravagances, and joined in his follies without any lack of cleverness or humour, being pleased therewith and saying that Antonius put on the tragic mask to the Romans, but the comic mask to them.", "3204": "Now to relate the greater part of his follies would be mere trifling.", "3205": "How­ ever on one occasion when he was fishing and was vexed at his bad sport, Cleopatra also being present, he ordered the fisherman to dive under the water and secretly to fasten to the hook some fishes that had been already caught;", "3206": "and he pulled up two or three times, but not without being detected by the Egyptian.", "3207": "Pretending to admire, she spoke to her Mends and invited them to come as spectators on the following day.", "3208": "A number of them got into the fishing boats, and when Antonius had let down his line, she ordered one of her own men to anticipate him by diving to the hook and to fasten to it a Pontic salted fish.-", "3209": "Antonius thinking that he had caught something pulled up, on which there was, as was natural, great laughter, whereat Cleopatra said, \" Give up the fishing-rud, Imperator, to us the kings of Pharos and Canopus;", "3210": "your sport is cities and kings and continents.", "3211": "\"XXX.†", "3212": "While Antonius was spending his time in such trifles and extravagances, he was surprised by intelligence from two different quarters;", "3213": "from Rome, that Lucius his brother and Fulvia his wife, having first been at variance with one another and then having warred with Cæsar, were completely defeated and flying from Italy;", "3214": "the other intelligence was in no wise more favourable, which was that Labienus at the head of the Parthians had subdued Asia from the Euphrates and Syria as far as Lydia and Ionia.", "3215": "With difficulty then, like a man roused from sleep and a drunken debauch, he set out to oppose the Parthians, and advanced as far as Phœnice, but as Fulvia sent him letters full of lamentations be turned towards Italy, with two hundred ships.", "3216": "On this voyage he took up his friends who had fled from Italy, and learned from them that Fulvia had been the cause of the war, for she was naturally a busy and bold woman;", "3217": "but her hope was to draw away Antonius from Cleopatra, if their should be any dis­ turbance in Italy.", "3218": "It happened that Fulvia, who was Bailing to meet him, died at Sikyon of some disease, which rendered a reconciliation with Cæsar more easy.", "3219": "For when Antonius approached Italy, and Caesar was evidently not intending to make any charge against him, and Antonius was ready to fix on Fulvia the blame of what he was charged with, their friends would not let them come to any explanation of these grounds, but brought them both to terms and distributed the empire, making the Ionian gulf the boundary, and giving the eastern parts to Antonius and the western to Cæsar;", "3220": "Lepidus was allowed to keep Libya ;", "3221": "and it was settled that the friends of each in turns should be consuls, when it did not please them­ selves to be.", "3222": "XXXI.", "3223": "This arrangement seemed to be good, but it required a stronger security, and fortune offered one.", "3224": "Octavia* was a sister of Caesar, older than Cæsar, but not by the same mother;", "3225": "for she was the daughter of Ancharia, but he was born afterwards of Atia.", "3226": "Cæsar was very greatly attached to his sister, and it is said she was a most admirable woman.", "3227": "Octavia was now a widow, for her husband Caius Marcellus had not long been dead.", "3228": "As Fulvia was dead, Antonius also was considered to be a widower;", "3229": "he did not deny that he had Cleopatra, but he did not admit that he had her as a wife, and he was still struggling in his judgment on this point against his love for the Egyptian.", "3230": "Everybody was proposing this marriage in the hope that Octavia, who in addition to great beauty possessed dignity of character and good sense, if she were united to Antonius and were beloved by him, as it was reasonable to suppose that such a woman must be, would be the conservation and cause of union between them in all respects.", "3231": "This being arranged between them, they went up to Rome where the marriage of Octavia was celebrated, though the law did not allow a woman to marry till ten months after her husband's decease, but the Senate in this case remitted the time by a decree.", "3232": "XXXII.", "3233": "As Sextus* Pompeius was still in possession of Sicily and was ravaging Italy, and with his numerous piratical ships, of which Men as the pirate and Menekrates were commanders, had rendered the sea unsafe to vessels, and as he seemed to be in a friendly disposition towards Antonius, for he had received his mother when she had fled from Rome with Fulvia, it was resolved to come to terms with him also.", "3234": "They met at the promontory of Misenum and the mound, the fleet of Pompeius being anchored close by them, while the forces of Antonius and Caesar were arranged by the side of them.", "3235": "Having agreed that Pompeius should have Sardinia and Sicily on condition of keeping the sea clear of pirates and sending to Rome a certain quantity of grain, they invited one another to an entertainment.", "3236": "They cast lots on the occasion, and it was the lot of Pompeius to feast them first.", "3237": "Upon Antonius asking him where they should sup, \" There,\" said he, point­ ing to the commander's ship of six banks of oars, “ for this is all the paternal residence that is left for Pompeius.\"", "3238": "This he said to reproach Antonius, who had the house that had belonged to the father of Sextus.", "3239": "Fixing his ship at anchor and making a kind of bridge from the promontory, he received them with a hearty welcome.", "3240": "When the banquet was at its height and jokes against Cleopatra and Antonius were plentiful, Menas the pirate approaching Pompeius said to him, so that the rest could not hear, “ Will you let me cut off the anchors of the ship and make you master not of Sicily and Sardinia, but of the Roman em­ pire?\"", "3241": "Pompeius, on hearing this, considered with himself for a short time, and said, \"You ought to have done it, Menas, without mentioning it to me:", "3242": "but now let us be satisfied with things as they are;", "3243": "perjury is not for me.\"", "3244": "Pompeius, after being feasted by Cæsar and Antonius in turn, sailed back to Sicily.", "3245": "XXXIII.", "3246": "After the settlement of affairs, Antonius sent forward Ventidius* into Asia to prevent the Parthians from advancing further, and, in order to please Cæsar, he was appointed priest of the former Cæsar;", "3247": "and everything else that concerned public affairs they transacted in common and in a friendly way.", "3248": "But their games of amusement caused annoyance to Antonius, as he always carried off therein less than Caesar.", "3249": "Now there was with Antonius a man skilled in divinations, an Egyptian, one of those who cast nativities, who, whether it was to please Cleopatra, or whether he said it in good faith, spoke freely to An­ tonius, saying that his fortune, though most splendid and great, was obscured by that of Cæsar, and he advised him to remove as far as possible from the young man:", "3250": "“ For thy daemon,\" he said, “ is afraid of the daemon of Cæsar, and though it is proud and erect when it is by itself, it is humbled by his dæmon when it is near, and becomes cowed.\"", "3251": "And indeed the things which were happening seemed to confirm the Egyptian;", "3252": "for it is said that when they were casting lots by way of amusement, in whatever they might happen to be engaged, and throwing dice, Antonius came off with disadvantage.", "3253": "They frequently matched cocks,* and fighting quails, and those of Caesar were always victorious.", "3254": "Whereat Antonius being annoyed, though he did not show it, and paying more regard to the Egyptian, departed from Italy, leaving the management of his affairs to Cæsar;", "3255": "and he took with him Octavia as far as Greece, there having been a daughter born to them.", "3256": "While he was spending the winter in Athens, he received intelligence of the first successes of Ventidius, who had defeated the Parthians in a battle, in which Labienus lost his life and Pharnapates, the most skilful of the generals of King Hyrodes.t", "3257": "On the occasion of this victory Antonius feasted the Greeks;", "3258": "and he acted as gymnasiarch for the Athenians, and leaving at home the insignia of his rank, he went forth with the rods of a gymnasiarch ‡ and the dress and white shoes;", "3259": "and he took the youths by the neck when he separated them.", "3260": "XXXIV.", "3261": "As he was going to set out for the war, he took a crown from the sacred olive, and in conformity to a certain oracle, he filled a vessel with water from the Clepsydra, and carried it with him.", "3262": "In the mean time Pacorus,* the king's son, with a large Parthian army again advanced against Syria, but Ventidius engaged with him in Cyrrhestica and put his army to flight with great loss;", "3263": "Pacorus himself fell among the first.", "3264": "This exploit, which was one of the most celebrated, gave the Romans full satisfaction for the defeat of Crassus, and again confined the Parthians within Media and Mesopotamia, after being defeated in three successive battles.", "3265": "Ventidius gave up all intention of pursuing the Parthians further, because he feared the jealousy of Antonius, but he visited those who had revolted and brought them into subjection, and be­ sieged Antiochus of Commagene† in the city Samosata.", "3266": "The king proposed to pay a thousand talents and to obey the order of Antonius, but Ventidius told him to send his proposal to Antonius;", "3267": "for he had now advanced near, and he would not allow Ventidius to make peace with Antio­ chus, because hb wished that this single exploit at least should bear his name, and that everything should not be accomplished by Ventidius.", "3268": "As, however, the siege was protracted, and the citizens, after despairing of coming to terms, betook themselves to a vigorous defence, Antonius, who was making no progress, but was ashamed and re­ pented of his conduct, was glad to make peace with An­ tiochus and to take three hundred talents;", "3269": "and after settling some trifling matters in Syria, he returned to Athens, and sent Ventidius to enjoy a triumph after be­ stowing on him the suitable decorations.", "3270": "Ventidius is the only Roman to the present time who has had a triumph over the Parthians;", "3271": "and he was a man of obscure birth, but the friendship of Antonius gave him the opportunity of doing great deeds, of which he made the best use, and so confirmed what was generally said of Antonius and Cæsar, that they were more successful as generals through others than of themselves.", "3272": "For Sossius* also, a legatus of Antonius, had great success in Syria;", "3273": "and Canidius,t who was left by Antonius in Armenia, defeated the Armenians and the kings of the Iberians and Albanians, and advanced as far as the Caucasus.", "3274": "All this success increased the name and the fame of the power of Antonius among the barbarians.", "3275": "XXXV.", "3276": "Antonius being again irritated against Cæsar by certain calumnies, sailed to Italy with three hundred vessels;", "3277": "but as the people of Brundusium would not re­ ceive his fleet, he sailed round and anchored at Tarentum.‡", "3278": "There he sent Octavia, for she accompanied him from Greece, at her request, to her brother:", "3279": "she was then preg­ nant, and had already borne him two daughters.", "3280": "She met Cæsar on the way, and after gaining over his friends Agrippa and Mæcenas,§ she prayed him with much urgency and much entreaty not to let her become a most wretched woman after being most happy.", "3281": "For now, she said, all men turned their eyes upon her, who was the wife of one Imperator and the sister of another;", "3282": "“ but if the worse should prevail,\" she

should give Antonius two legions for the Par­ thian war, and that Antonius should give Cæsar a hundred brazen-beaked vessels.", "3287": "Octavia, independently of what had been agreed, asked for her brother twenty light ships.", "3288": "from her husband, and for her husband a thousand soldiers from her brother.", "3289": "Accordingly, separating from one another, the one immediately engaged in the war against Pompeius,† being desirous to get Sicily;", "3290": "and Antonius, en­ trusting to Cæsar Octavia and his children by her and by Fulvia, crossed over to Asia.", "3291": "XXXVI.", "3292": "That great evil, which had long slept, the passion for Cleopatra, which appeared to be put to rest and to have been tranquillised by better considerations, blazed forth again and recovered strength as Antonius approached Syria.", "3293": "And finally (as Platot says of the stub­ born and ungovernable beast of the soul), kicking away everything that was good and wholesome, he sent Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra to Syria.", "3294": "On her arrival he gave and added to her dominions nothing small or trifling, but Phoenice, Cœle Syria, Cyprus, a large part of Cilicia, and further, that part of J udæa which produces the balsam, and all the part of Arabia Nabathæa which was turned towards the external sea.§", "3295": "These donations caused the Romans the greatest vexation;", "3296": "though he gave tetrarchies and kingdoms ot great nations to many private persons, and took kingdoms from many, as for instance Antigonus || the Jew, whom he brought out and beheaded, though no king before had been punished in this way.", "3297": "But the scandal of the thing was that which gave more offence than all the honours conferred on Cleopatra.", "3298": "The evil report was increased by his acknowledging his twin children by Cleopatra, one of whom he called Alexander and the other Cleopatra;", "3299": "and he gave to one the surname of Sun, and the other of Moon.", "3300": "However, he had some dexterity in putting a good face on bad things, for he said that the greatness of the Roman power was shown not in what they received, but in what they gave;", "3301": "and that noble families were extended by a succession and progeny of many kings.", "3302": "Thus, for instance, he said, that his own ancestor was begotten by Hercules, who did not deposit his successors in a single womb, nor did he fear laws like Solon's* and penalties for conception, but gave nature her course to leave many beginnings and founda­ tions of families.", "3303": "XXX VII.", "3304": "When Phraates† had killed his father Hyrodes and got possession of the kingdom, other Parthians fled, not few in number;", "3305": "and among them Monæses, a man of illustrious rank and great power, fled to Antonius, who likening the fortune of Monæses to that of Themistoclest and comparing his own means and magnanimity to those of the Persian kings, gave him three cities, Larissa and Arethusa and Hierapolis, which was before called Bambyce.", "3306": "Upon the Parthian king sending to Monæses a right hand,§ Antonius gladly despatched Monæses to him, having re­ solved to deceive Phraates with a pretence of peace, but claiming the restoration of the standards taken in the time of Crassus and such of the prisoners as st ill survived.", "3307": "Antonius having sent Cleopatra back to Egypt, marched through Arabia || and Armenia to a place where he reviewed his army, which had assembled there, and also the troops of the confederate kings;", "3308": "and they were many, but the greatest of all was Artavasdes,* king of Armenia, who supplied six thousand horse and seven thousand foot soldiers.", "3309": "There were of the Romans sixty thousand foot soldiers, and the cavalry which was classed with the Romans was ten thousand Iberians† and Celts ;", "3310": "and of the other nations there were thirty thousand together with cavalry and light-armed troops.", "3311": "Yet so great a prepara­ tion and power, which alarmed even the Indians beyond Bactria and shook all Asia, it is said, was made of no avail to him by reason of Cleopatra.", "3312": "For through his eagerness to spend the winter with her, he opened the campaign before the fit time and conducted everything in a dis­ orderly way, not having the mastery over his own judg­ ment, but through the influence of some drugs or magic always anxiously looking towards her, and thinking more of his speedy return than of conquering the enemy.", "3313": "XXXVIII.", "3314": "Now, in the first place, though it was his business to winter there in Armenia and to give his army rest, which was worn out by a march of eight thousand stadia, and before the Parthians moved from their winter- quarters in the commencement of spring, to occupy Media, he did not wait for the time, but immediately led forward his army, leaving Armenia on the left and touching on Atropatene,‡ which he ravaged.", "3315": "In the next place, the engines which were necessary for sieges were carried along with the army in three hundred waggons, and among them was a ram eighty feet long ;", "3316": "and it was not possible for any one of them, if it was damaged, to be repaired when it was wanted, because the upper country only produced wood of insufficient length and hardness:", "3317": "ac­ cordingly in his hurry he left all the engines behind as encumbrances to his speed, after appointing a watch and Statianus as commander over the waggons;", "3318": "and he com­ menced the siege of Phraata,* a large city, in which were the children and wives of the king of Media.", "3319": "But the difficulties soon proved what an error he had committed in leaving behind the engines;", "3320": "and as he wished to come to close quarters with the enemy, he commenced erecting a mound against the city, which rose slowly and with much labour.", "3321": "In the meantime Phraates came down with a great force, hearing of the waggons being left behind that carried the machines, and sent many horsemen against them, by whom Statianus was hemmed in and killed and ten thousand men with him.", "3322": "The barbarians took possession of the engines and destroyed them.", "3323": "They also took many prisoners, among whom was king Polemon.", "3324": "†XXXIX.", "3325": "This misfortune greatly annoyed, as we may suppose, all the soldiers of Antonius, who at the com­ mencement of the war had received this unexpected blow;", "3326": "and the Armenian Artavasdes despairing of the success of the Romans went off with his troops, though he had been the chief cause of the war.", "3327": "The Parthians now showed themselves to the besiegers in gallant array and insult- ingly threatened them, on which Antonius, not wishing to let despondency and dejection abide in his army by their being quiet and to increase, took ten legions and three praetorian cohorts of heavy-armed men and all the cavalry, and led them out to forage in the hope that the enemy would thus be drawn on, and that a regular battle would ensue.", "3328": "After advancing one day's march, he saw that the Parthians were spreading themselves around him and seeking to attack him on the march, on which he hung out in the camp the sign of battle, but at the same time he ordered the tents to be taken down, as if his in­ tention were not to fight but to lead off his troops;", "3329": "and he passed along the line of the barbarians, which was in the form of a crescent, having given orders, as soon as the first ranks of the enemy should be within reach of the heavy-armed soldiers, for the cavalry to ride at them.", "3330": "To the Parthians who stood opposed to the Romans, their discipline appeared to be something indescribable;", "3331": "and they observed the Romans as they marched past at equal intervals without disorder and in silence, brandishing their spears.", "3332": "But when the standard was raised and the cavalry facing about rushed upon the enemy, the Par­ thians received their onset and repelled it, though the Romans were all at once too close to allow them to use their arrows;", "3333": "but when the heavy-armed soldiers joined in the conflict at the same time with shouts and the clatter of arms, the Parthian horses were frightened and gave way and the Parthians fled before they came to close quarters.", "3334": "Antonius pressed on the pursuit, and had great hopes that he had finished the whole war or the chief part in that battle.", "3335": "But when the infantry had followed up the pursuit for fifty stadia and the cavalry for three times that distance, looking at those of the enemy who had fallen and were captured, they found only thirty captives and eighty corpses, which caused dismay and despondency in all the army, when they reflected that though victorious they had killed so few, and that when defeated they must sustain such a loss as they had near the waggons.", "3336": "On the following day they broke up their encampment and took the road towards Phraata and the camp.", "3337": "On their march they fell in at first with a few of the enemy, and then a greater number, and finally with all, who, as if they were unvanquished and fresh, challenged them and fell upon them from all sides, so that with difficulty and much labour they got safe to their camp.", "3338": "As the Medea made a sally against the mound and terrified those who were defending it, Antonius being enraged put in practice what is called decimation- against the cowards;", "3339": "for he divided the whole number into tens, and put to death one out of each ten who was chosen by lot;", "3340": "and to the rest he ordered barley to be measured out, instead of wheat.", "3341": "XL.", "3342": "The war was attended with great hardship to both sides, and the future was still more alarming, as Antonius was expecting famine, for it was no longer possible to get forage without many of the soldiers being wounded and killed.", "3343": "Phraates knowing that the Parthians were able to bear anything rather than to endure hardship in the winter and to encamp in the open air, was afraid lest, if the Romans held out and abided there, his troops would leave him, as the atmosphere was beginning to grow heavy after the autumnal equinox.", "3344": "Accordingly he planned such a stratagem as this.", "3345": "The chiefs of the Parthians,* both in the forages and on other occasions when they met the Romans, made less vigorous resistance, both allowing them to take some things and commending their valour in that they were most courageous men, and were justly admired by their king.", "3346": "After this, riding up nearer to them, and quietly placing their horses near the Romans, they would abuse Antonius, baying that though Phraates wished to come to terms and to spare so many brave men, Antonius would not give him the opportunity, but sat there awaiting those dangerous and powerful enemies, hunger and winter, from whom it would be difficult for them to escape, even under convoy of the Parthians.", "3347": "Many persons reported this to Antonius, and though he was soft­ ened by hope, still he did not send heralds to the Par­ thians until he inquired from the barbarians who assumed this friendly demeanour, whether what they said really expressed the king's meaning.", "3348": "On their saying that it was so, and urging him not to fear or distrust, he sent some of his companions to demand back the standards and the captives, that it might not be supposed that he was so eager to make his escape and get away.", "3349": "The Parthian told him not to trouble himself about that matter, but promised him peace and security if he would depart forth­ with ;", "3350": "whereupon in a few days Antonius got his baggage together and broke up his camp.", "3351": "Though Antonius had great powers of persuasion before a popular assembly, and was skilled above every man of the age in leading an army by his words, he was unable through shame and depression of spirits to encourage the soldiers, and he bade Domitius Ænobarbus† do this.", "3352": "Some of the soldiers took this amiss, considering it as a token of contempt towards them, but the majority were affected by it, and perceived the reason, and they thought that they ought on this account the more to show their respect and obedience to the commander.", "3353": "XLI.", "3354": "As Antonius was intending to lead the troops back by the same road, which was through a plain country without trees, a man, by nation a Mardian,* who was well acquainted with the Parthian habits, and had already shown himself faithful to the Romans in the battle at the waggons, came up to Antonius and advised him in his flight to keep to the mountains on his right, and not to expose a force, in heavy armour and encumbered, to so numerous a cavalry and to the arrows in bare and open tracts, which was the very thing that Phraales designed when he induced him by friendly terms to raide the siege;", "3355": "and that he would lead them a shorter road, where he would find a better supply of necessaries.", "3356": "Antonius on hearing this deliberated;", "3357": "he did not wish to appear to dis­ trust the Parthians after the truce, yet as he approved of the shorter road, and the line of march being along in­ habited villages, he asked the Mardian for a pledge of his fidelity.", "3358": "The Mardian offered himself to be put in chains until he should place the army in Armenia;", "3359": "and he was put in chains, and he conducted them for two days without their meeting with any opposition.", "3360": "On the third day, when Antonius had completely ceased to think of the Par­ thians, and was advancing in a careless way by reason of his confidence, the Mardian observed that an embankment against the overflowing of a river had been recently broken, and that the stream was flowing in a great cur­ rent on the road by which they had to pass, and he knew that the Parthians had done this with the intention of making the river an obstacle to the Roman march by the difficulty and delay that it would occasion;", "3361": "and he bade Antonius look out and be on his guard, as the enemy was near.", "3362": "Just while he was placing the heavy-armed men in order, and taking measures for the javelin-men and slingers to make an attack through their ranks upon the enemy, the Parthians appeared and rode round them with the design of encircling the Romans and putting them in disorder on all sides.", "3363": "The light-armed troops made a sally against them, and the Parthians, after inflicting some wounds with their arrows and receiving as many from the leaden bullets.", "3364": "and javelins of the Romans, retreated.", "3365": "The Parthians then commenced a second attack, which con­ tinued until the Celtæ in a mass drove their horses against them and dispersed them ;", "3366": "and the Parthians showed them­ selves no more on that day.", "3367": "XLII.", "3368": "From this experience Antonius, learning what he ought to do, covered not only the rear, but also both flanks with many javelin men and slingers, and led his army in the form of a quadrangle;", "3369": "and the cavalry received orders to repel the attack of the enemy, but when they had repulsed them, not to pursue far, in consequence of which the Parthians during the four following days sustained as much damage as they inflicted, and their ardour being dulled they thought of retiring, as an excuse for which they alleged the approach of winter.", "3370": "On the fifth day Flavius Gallus, a man of military talent and great activity, who held a command, came and asked Antonius for more light-armed troops for the rear,t and for some of the cavalry from the van, in the expectation of having great success.", "3371": "Antonius gave him the troops, and when the enemy made his attack, he fell upon them, not as on former occasions, at the same time withdrawing towards the heavy-armed soldiers and retreating, but resisting them and engaging with the enemy in a desperate way.", "3372": "The commanders of the rear seeing that he was being separated from them, sent and called him back, but he would not listen to them.", "3373": "They say that Titius the quæstor, seizing the standards, turned them round and abused Gallus for throwing away the lives of many brave men.", "3374": "But as Gallus abused him in turn, and urged those about him to remain, Titius retreated.", "3375": "While Gallus was pushing forwards against the enemy in front, a large body of those in the rear got round him before he perceived it.", "3376": "Being now attacked on all sides he sent for aid ;", "3377": "but the commanders of the heavy- armed troops, among whom was Canidius, a man who had the greatest influence with Antonius, are considered to have committed a great mistake.", "3378": "For when they ought to have moved the whole line against the enemy, they sent a few at a time to help against them;", "3379": "and again when these were being worsted, they sent others, and thus these came near filling the whole army with defeat and flight before they were aware of it;", "3380": "but Antonius himself quickly came with the heavy-armed men from the van to meet the enemy, and the third legion quickly pushing through the fugitives against the enemy stopped their further pursuit.", "3381": "XLIII.", "3382": "There fell no fewer than three thousand;", "3383": "and there were carried to the tents five thousand wounded, and among them Gallus, who was pierced with five arrows in front.", "3384": "Gallus did not recover from his wounds;", "3385": "but Antonius, going about, visited the rest of the wounded, and he encouraged them with tears in his eyes and deep sym­ pathy.", "3386": "The men, cheerfully grasping his right hand, beg­ ged him to go and take care of his health and not to trouble himself about them, calling him Imperator, and saying that they were all secure if he was only safe.", "3387": "For altogether it seems that no Imperator of that age got together an army more distinguished by courage or endurance or strength;", "3388": "but the respect towards the commander himself, and the obedience combined with affection, and the circumstance that all alike, those of good reputation, those of bad, commanders, private soldiers, preferred honour and favour from Antonius to their own lives and safety, left nothing even for the ancient Romans to surpass, And of this there were several reasons, as we have said before;", "3389": "noble birth.", "3390": "powerful eloquence, simplicity, generosity and munificence, affability in his pleasures and conversation.", "3391": "On that occasion, by the pains that he took and his sympathy with the wounded, and by sharing with them whatever they wanted, he made the sick and wounded more full of alacrity than those who were whole.", "3392": "XLIV.", "3393": "However the victory so elated the enemy, who were already worn out and exhausted, and they despised the Romans so much that they even passed the night.", "3394": "close to the camp, expecting that they should soon plunder the deserted tents and the baggage of the Romans skulking away.", "3395": "At daybreak the enemy crowded upon them in still greater numbers, and there are said to have been not fewer than forty thousand horseman, as the king had sent even those who were always placed around himself, as to certain and secure success;", "3396": "for the king himself was never present in any battle.", "3397": "But Antonius, wishing to harangue the soldiers, asked for a dark garment that he might appear more piteous.", "3398": "But as his friends opposed him, he came forward in the purple dress of a general and addressed the troops, praising those who had been victorious, and up­ braiding those who had fled.", "3399": "The former exhorted him to be of good cheer, and the others making their apology offered themselves to him either to be decimated or to be punished in any other way ;", "3400": "only they prayed him to cease being troubled and grieved.", "3401": "Hereupon, raising his hands, he prayed to the gods, that if any reverse of fortune should follow on account of his former prosperity, it might come upon him, but that they would give safety and victory to the rest of the army.", "3402": "XLV.", "3403": "On the following day they advanced under better protection;", "3404": "and when the Parthians made their attack, the result was very contrary to their expectations.", "3405": "For they expected to advance to plunder and booty, and not to battle;", "3406": "but as they were assailed by many missiles, and saw that the Romans were encouraged and fresh with alacrity, they were again completely wearied of the contest.", "3407": "However the Parthians again fell upon them as they were descending some steep hills, and galled them with arrows as they were slowly retreating, whereon the shield-bearerst faced about and placing the light-armed troops within their ranks, dropped down on one knee and held their shields before them;", "3408": "those behind held their shields before the front rank, and those who were behind the second rank did the same.", "3409": "This form, which very much resembles a roof,.", "3410": "presents a theatrical appearance, and is the safest of bul­ warks against the arrows, which thus glance off.", "3411": "But the Parthians, who thought that the Romans bending on one knee was a sign of exhaustion and fatigue, laid aside their bows, and grasping their spears by the middle, came to close quarters.", "3412": "But the Romans with one shout all at once sprang up, and pushing with their javelins which they held in their hands, killed the foremost and put all the rest to flight.", "3413": "This took place also on the following days, the Romans making only small way.", "3414": "Famine also attacked the army, which could get little grain and that with fight­ ing, and they had few implements for grinding;", "3415": "for the greater part were left behind, owing to some of the beasts dying, and others being employed in carrying the sick and wounded.", "3416": "It is said that an Attic choenixt of wheat was sold for fifty drachmae;", "3417": "and they sold barley loaves for their weight in silver.", "3418": "Then they betook themselves to vegetables and roots;", "3419": "but they found few of the kind that they were accustomed to, and being compelled to make trial of what they had never tasted before, they ate of one herb that caused madness and then death.", "3420": "For he who had eaten of it recollected nothing, and understood nothing, and busied himself about nothing except one sole thing, which was to move and turn every stone, as if he were doing something of great importance.", "3421": "The plain was full of men stooping to the ground and digging round stones and moving them;", "3422": "and finally they vomited bile and died, for wine, which was the only remedy, failed them.", "3423": "As many were dying and the Parthians did not desist from their attack, they say that Antonius often cried out “ 0 the ten thousand! \"* whereby he expressed his admiration of the ten thousand, that though they marched even a greater distance, from Babylonia, and fought with many more enemies, yet they made good their retreat.", "3424": "XL VI.", "3425": "The Parthians, not being able to break through the Roman army nor yet to separate their ranks, and being already often defeated and put to flight, again mingled in a friendly way with those who went out for grass or corn, and pointing to the strings of their bows which were unstrung, said, that they were going back and this was the end of their attack;", "3426": "but that a few of the Medes would follow still one or two clays'journey without annoying them at all, and for the purpose of protecting the more distant villages.", "3427": "To these words were added embraces and signs of friendship, so that the Romans were again of good cheer ;", "3428": "and Antonius hearing this resolved to keep nearer to tho plains, as the road through the mountains was said to be waterless.", "3429": "While he was intending to do this, there came to the camp a man from the enemy, named Mithridates, a cousin of Monæses, of him who had been with Antonius and had received the three cities as a present.", "3430": "And he asked for some one to come near to him who could speak the Parthian or the Syrian language.", "3431": "Alexander of Antioch came to him, and he was an intimate friend of Antonius, whereupon Mithridates, saying who he was, and intimating that they must thank Monæses for what he was going to say, asked Alexander, if he saw in the distance a continuous range of lofty mountains.", "3432": "On Alexander saying that he saw them, he replied, \"Under those mountains the Parthians with all their forces lie in ambush for you.", "3433": "For the great plains border on these mountains, and they expect that you will be deceived by them and will turn in that direction and leave the road through the mountains.", "3434": "The way over the mountains is attended with thirst and labour to which you are accustomed, but if Antonius goes by the plain, let him be assured that the fate of Crassus awaits him \"XL VII.", "3435": "Having said this, he went away ;", "3436": "and Antonius, who was troubled at these words, called together his friends and the Mardian who was their guide, and had exactly the same opinion.", "3437": "For even if there were no enemy, he knew that the want of roads in the plains and the mistakes in the track which they might make there were matters of hazard and difficulty;", "3438": "but he declared that the road over the mountains presented no other risk than the want of water for a single day.", "3439": "Accordingly Antonius turned aside and led his army by this route by night, having given orders to the men to take water with them.", "3440": "But the greater part had no vessels, and accordingly they filled their helmets with water and carried them, and others took it in skins.", "3441": "As soon as Antonius began to advance, the Parthians had intelligence of it, and contrary to their custom they commenced the pursuit while it was still night.", "3442": "Just as the sun was rising, they came up with the rear, which was in weak condition through want of sleep and fatigue :", "3443": "for they had accomplished two hundred and forty stadia in the night;", "3444": "and the enemy coming upon them so suddenly when they did not expect it, dispirited them.", "3445": "The contest increased their thirst, for they still advanced while they were defending themselves.", "3446": "Those who were in the first ranks, as they were marching onwards, came to a river,* the water of which was cool and pellucid, but salt and of a medicinal nature;", "3447": "and this water, when drank of immoderately, caused pains with purging and augmentation of the thirst:", "3448": "and though the Mardian had warned them of this, the soldiers nevertheless forced away those who tried to hinder them and drank of the water.", "3449": "Antonius went round to the men and prayed them to hold out for a short time, and he said there was another river not far off, and besides this, the rest of the route was impracticable for horses and rough, so that the enemy must certainly turn back.", "3450": "At the same time he summoned those who were engaged in the fight and gave the signal for pitching the tents, that the soldiers mignt at least enjoy the shade a little.", "3451": "XLVIII.", "3452": "While then the tents were being fixed and the Parthians as usual were immediately retiring, Mithridates came again, and upon Alexander going up to him, he ad­ vised him to put the army in motion after it had rested a little and to hasten to the river:", "3453": "for he said that the Parthians would not cross it, but would follow up the pursuit as far as the river.", "3454": "Alexander reported this to Antonius, and then brought out from him numerous gold cups and goblets, of which Mithridates taking as many as he could hide in his dress, rode off.", "3455": "As it was still day­ light, they broke up their tents and advanced, without being annoyed by the enemy;", "3456": "but they made that night of all others the most painful and frightful to themselves.", "3457": "For they killed and plundered those who had silver or gold, and took the things that were carried by the beasts ;", "3458": "and finally falling upon the baggage of Antonius, they cut in pieces and divided among them cups and costly tables, there being great disturbance and confusion through the whole army;", "3459": "for they thought that the enemy had fallen upon them and that flight and dispersion had ensued.", "3460": "Antonius called one of the freedmen, who was on his guard, named Rhamnus, and bound him by oath when he gave him the order, to push his sword through him and to cut off his head, that he might neither be taken alive by the enemy nor be recognised when dead.", "3461": "His friends broke out in tears, but the Mardian encouraged Antonius by telling him that the river was near;", "3462": "for a moist breeze blowing and a cooler air meeting them made their respiration more agreeable;", "3463": "and he said that the time they had been on the march confirmed his estimate of the distance, for what now remained of the night was not much.", "3464": "At the same time others reported that the disorder was owing to their own wrongful deeds and rapacity.", "3465": "Accordingly Antonius, wishing to bring the army into order from their state of disorder and confusion, commanded the signal to be given for pitching the tents.", "3466": "XLIX.", "3467": "Day was now dawning, and as the army was beginning to get into certain order and tranquillity, the arrows of the Parthians fell upon the rear, and the signal for battle was given to the light-armed troops.", "3468": "The heavy-armed troops again covering one another in like manner as before with their shields, stood the assault of the missiles, the enemy not venturing to come near.", "3469": "The first ranks advancing slowly in this form, the river was seen;", "3470": "and Antonius drawing up his cavalry on the banks in face of the enemy, took across the weak first.", "3471": "Those who were fighting were now relieved from apprehension, and had the opportunity of drinking;", "3472": "for when the Parthians saw the river, they unstrung their bows and bade the Romans pass over in confidence, with great encomiums on their valour.", "3473": "Accordingly, they crossed, and recruited themselves quietly;", "3474": "and then they marched forwards, but yet not with full confidence in the Parthians.", "3475": "On the sixth day after the last battle they reached the river Araxes,* which is the boundary between Media and Armenia.", "3476": "It appeared dangerous both for its depth and roughness, and a rumour went through the army that the enemy was in ambush there, and would fall on them as they were crossing.", "3477": "When they had safely crossed and had set foot in Armenia, as if they had just got sight of that land from the sea, they saluted it and fell to shedding of tears and embracing of one another for joy.", "3478": "In their progress through a fertile country, during which they used everything freely after having suffered great want, they were subject to dropsical and bowel complaints.", "3479": "L.", "3480": "Antonius there made a review of his men, and he found that twenty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry had perished;", "3481": "not all by the enemy, but above half by disease.", "3482": "They marched from Phraata twenty­ seven days, and they defeated the Parthians in eighteen battles;", "3483": "but these victories brought neither strength nor security, because their pursuits were short and ineffectual.", "3484": "And this mainly showed that it was Artavasdes* the Armenian who had deprived Antonius of the means of bringing that war to an end.", "3485": "For if the sixteen thousand horsemen whom he drew out of Media had been present, who were equipped like the Parthians, and were accustomed to fight against them, and if, while the Romans put to flight the fighting enemy, they had overtaken the fugitives, it would not have been in their power after a defeat to recover themselves and venture again so often.", "3486": "All the army accordingly in passion endeavoured to incite Antonius to punish the Armenian.", "3487": "But Antonius upon considerations of prudence neither reproached him for his treachery nor abated of his usual friendly behaviour and respect towards him, being weak in numbers and in want of supplies.", "3488": "Afterwards, however, when he again broke into Armenia, and by many promises and invitations, persuaded Artavasdes to come into his hands, he seized him and took him in chains to Alexandria, where he was led in triumph.", "3489": "And herein chiefly he offended the Romans, by giving to the Egyptians for the sake of Cleopatra the honourable and solemn ceremonial of his native country.", "3490": "This however took place later.", "3491": "LI.", "3492": "Antonius now pressed on his march, the winter having already set in with severity, through incessant snow-storms, in which he lost eight thousand men on the route.", "3493": "Going down to the sea-coast with a very small body of men, he waited for Cleopatrat in a place between Berytus and Sidon, called “", "3494": "White village \";", "3495": "and as she was slow in coming, he became uneasy and restless, soon giving himself up to drinking and intoxication, but yet being unable to continue at table;", "3496": "for while his companions were drinking he would rise and often spring up to look out, till Cleopatra arrived there by sea bringing a quantify of clothes and supplies for the soldiers.", "3497": "There are some who say that Antonius received the clothes from he:", "3498": ", but that the money was his own, though he distributed it as if it were a present to him from Cleopatra.", "3499": "LII.", "3500": "A quarrel arose between the king of the Modes and Phraortes* the Parthian, which originated, as they say, about the Roman spoils, but caused the Mede to have sus­ picions and fear of being deprived of his dominions.", "3501": "For this reason he sent to invite Antonius, and proffered to join him in a war with his own forces.", "3502": "Antonius accord­ ingly being put in great hope-for the only thing as he thought which had been the cause of his failing to subdue the Parthians, his having gone against them without many horsemen and bowmen, he now saw was offered to him in such way that his part was rather to do a favour by accepting than to ask for one-was preparing again to march into the upper country through Armenia, and after joining the Mede near the Araxes, then to recom­ mence the war.", "3503": "LIII.", "3504": "At Rome Octaviat was desirous of going to An. tonius, and Cæsar gave her permission;", "3505": "as the greater part say, not with the design of pleasing her, but in order that if she were greatly insulted and neglected, he might have a specious pretext for the war.", "3506": "On reaching Athens she received letters from Antonius, in which he told her to stay there, and informed her of his intended expedition.", "3507": "Though Octavia was annoyed, and saw that this was only a pretext, she wrote to him to ask to what place he would have the things sent which she was bringing to him.", "3508": "And she was taking a great quantity of clothing for the army, many beasts, and money and presents for his officers and friends;", "3509": "and besides this, two thousand picked soldiers equipped as praetorian cohorts, with splendid armour.", "3510": "A certain Niger, a friend of Antonius, who was sent by Octavia, reported this to him, and he added commendation of Octavia such as she merited and was just.", "3511": "But Cleo­ patra, seeing that Octavia was entering into a contest with her, and fearing that if to the dignity of her behaviour and the power of Cæsar she added the pleasure of social intercourse and attention to Antonius, she would be in­ vincible and get complete mastery over her husband, pre­ tended to be desperately in love with Antonius, and she wasted her body by spare diet;", "3512": "and she put on the ex­ pression of strong passion when he approached her, and of sorrow and depression when he went away.", "3513": "She also con­ trived to be often seen in tears, which she would all at once wipe away and affect to conceal, as if she did not wish Antonius to observe it.", "3514": "She practised these arts while Antonius was preparing for his expedition from Syria against the Mede.*", "3515": "Flatterers, too, who were busy in her behalf, abused Antonius as a hard and unfeeling man, who was causing the death of a woman who was devoted to him alone.", "3516": "As to Octavia, she came to meet Antonius upon business on her brother's account, and enjoyed the name of wife of Antonius;", "3517": "but Cleopatra, who was the queen of so many people, was only called the beloved of Antonius, and she did not shun nor disdain this name, so long as she could see Antonius and live with him;", "3518": "but if she were driven away from him, she would not survive.", "3519": "At last they so melted and softened the man, that through fear that Cleopatra might destroy herself, he returned to Alex­ andria, and put off the Mede to the summer season, though the affairs of Parthia were said to be in a state of anarchy.", "3520": "However, he went up into the country, and brought over the king to friendly terms, and after betrothing to one of his sons by Cleopatra one of the daughters of the king, who was still a young child, he returned, being now engaged in preparing for the civil war.", "3521": "LIV.", "3522": "When Octavia returned from Athens, as Cæsar conceived her to have been insulted, he ordered her to dwell in her own house.", "3523": "But she refused to leave her husband's house, and she advised her brother, if he had not for other reasons determined to go to war with An­ tonius, to let her affairs alone, for it was not even decent to be said, that of the greatest Imperators, one through love for a woman, and the other through jealousy, brought the Romans to civil war.", "3524": "This she said, and she con­ firmed what she said by her acts;", "3525": "for she lived in her husband's house, just as if he were at home, and she took care of the children, both her own and those of Fulvia, in an honourable and liberal way;", "3526": "she also received the friends of Antonius who were sent to Rome to get offices or on business, and assisted them in obtaining from Cæsar what they wanted.", "3527": "She thus unintentionally damaged Antonius, for he was hated for wronging such a woman.", "3528": "He was also hated for the division which he made among his children at Alexandria, which appeared to be tragical* and arrogant, and to show hatred of the Romans.", "3529": "For he filled the gymnasium with a crowd, and caused to be placed on a tribunal of silver two thrones of gold, one for himself, and the other for Cleopatra, and for the children othei thrones which were lower;", "3530": "and first of all he declared Cleopatra Queen of Egypt and Cyprus and Libya and Coele Syria, with Cæsarion as co-regent, who was believed to be the son of the former Cæsar, who left Cleopatra preg­ nant ;", "3531": "in the next place he proclaimed his sons and Cleo­ patra's to be Kings of Kings;", "3532": "and to Alexander he gave Armenia, and Media, and Parthia, when he should have subdued it, and to Ptolemæus he gave Phoenice and Syria and Cilicia.", "3533": "At the same time also he led forth Alexander, dressed in a Median vest with a tiara and cittaris† upright, and Ptolemæus in boots, and a chlamys, and a causia with a diadem attached to it;", "3534": "for this was the dress of the kings who followed Alexander, and the other was the dress of the Medes and Armenians.", "3535": "After the children had em­ braced their parents, a guard of Armenians was placed around the one, and of Macedonians around the other.", "3536": "Cleopatra, both on that occasion and on other occasions when she went out before the people, used to put on a dress sacred to Isis, different from her ordinary dress, and she was called the new Isis.", "3537": "LV.", "3538": "By bringing these matters before the Senate, and often complaining of them before the people, Caesar excited the multitude against Antonius.", "3539": "Antonius also sent and made recriminations against Cæsar.", "3540": "The chief charges which Antonius made against him were, in the first place, that though he had taken Sicily from Pompeius, he did not give him a part of the island;", "3541": "second, that Cæsar had bor­ rowed ships from him for the war and had kept them;", "3542": "third, that after ejecting his colleague Lepidus from his authority and degrading him, Cæsar kept the army and teriitory and revenues that were assigned to Lepidus;", "3543": "* and, finally, that lie had distributed nearly all Italy in allotments among his own soldiers, and had left nothing for the soldiers of Antonius.", "3544": "To these charges Caesar replied, that he had deprived Lepidus of his authority because he was abusing it, and as to what he had acquired in war, he would share it with Antonius, when Antonius should share Armenia with him.", "3545": "He further said that the soldiers of Antonius had no claim to any share of Italy, for that they had Media and Parthia, which they had added to the Roman possessions by their brave conduct in war under their Imperator.", "3546": "LVI.", "3547": "Antonius heard of this while he was tarrying in Armenia ;", "3548": "and he immediately gave orders to Canidius to take sixteen legions and to go down to the sea.", "3549": "Himself taking Cleopatra with him went to Ephesus.", "3550": "Here the navy collected from all quarters, eight hundred ships, including merchant vessels, of which Cleopatra furnished two hundred, and twenty thousand talents and supplies for the war for all the army.", "3551": "Antonius, being persuaded by Domitius and some others, told Cleopatra to sail to Egypt and there to wait the result of the war.", "3552": "But as Cleopatra feared that there would again be a reconciliation through Octavia, she persuaded Canidius by a large bribe to speak to Antonius about her, and to say, that it was neither just for a woman to be kept away from the war, who supplied so many large contributions, nor was it to the interest of Antonius to dispirit the Egyptians, who composed a large part of the naval force;", "3553": "and besides this, he did not see to which of the kings who joined the expe­ dition Cleopatra was inferior in understanding, she who for a long time by herself had governed so large a king­ dom, and had long enjoyed his company, and had learned to manage great affairs.", "3554": "These arguments prevailed, for it was fated that all the power should come into Cæsar's hands;", "3555": "and after the forces had come together, they sailed to Samos and enjoyed themselves there.", "3556": "For as orders had been given to kings and rulers and tetrarchs and nations and all the cities between Syria and the Mæotis and Armenia and the Illyrians* to send and bring their supplies for the war, so all the persons who assisted at theatrical entertainments were required to meet Antonius at Samos;", "3557": "and while nearly all the world around was lamenting and groaning, one island for many days re­ sounded with pipes and stringed instruments, and the theatres were filled and the chori were vying with one another.", "3558": "Every city also joined in the celebration by sending an ox, and kings rivalled one another in giving entertainments and presents.", "3559": "So that it went abroad and was said, how will persons behave in the rejoicings after a victory, who make such costly banquets to celebrate the preparations for war ?", "3560": "LVII.", "3561": "After these amusements were over, Antonius gave to the theatrical company Priene for their dwelling;", "3562": "and sailing to Athens he again gave himself up to pleasure and theatres.", "3563": "Cleopatra, who was jealous of the honours that had been paid to Octavia in the city, for Octavia was very much beloved by the Athenians, attempted to gain the popular favour by many acts of liberality.", "3564": "The Athenians after voting to her honorable distinctions, sent a deputation to her residence to carry the record of the vote, and Antonius was one of them, as being an Athenian citizen;", "3565": "and coming before her he went through an harangue on behalf of the city.", "3566": "He sent persons to Rome to eject Octavia from his house;", "3567": "and it is said that when she left it, she took all the children of Antonius with her except the eldest of the children by Fulvia, for he was with his father, and that she wept and lamented that she too would be considered one of the causes of the war.", "3568": "And the Romans pitied not her, but they pitied Antonius, and those chiefly who had seen Cleopatra, a woman who had not the advantage over Octavia either in beauty or in youth.", "3569": "LVIII.", "3570": "Cæsar was alarmed when he heard of the rapidity and the greatness of the preparation- of Antonius, lest he should be compelled to come to a decisive battle during that summer.", "3571": "For he was deficient in many things, and the exaction of taxes vexed people;", "3572": "for the free men, being compelled to contribute a fourth† of their income, and the class of freedmen to contribute an eighth part of their property, cried out against Cæsar, and tumults arising from these causes prevailed over all Italy.", "3573": "Ac­ cordingly the delay in the war is reckoned among the greatest faults of Antonius;", "3574": "for it gave time to Caesar to make preparation, and it put an end to the disturbances among the people;", "3575": "for while the money was being exacted from them they were irritated, but when it had been exacted and they had paid it they remained quiet.", "3576": "‡ Titius and Plancus, friends of Antonius and men of consular rank, being insulted by Cleopatra, for they made the most opposition to her joining the expedition, escaped to Cæsar, and they gave him information about the will of Antonius, as they were acquainted with the contents of it.", "3577": "The will was placed with the Vestal Virgins,§ and when Caesar asked for it, they would not give it to him, but they told him, if he wished to have it, to come and take it himself.", "3578": "And he did go and take it;", "3579": "and first of all he read it over by himself, and marked certain passages which famished ready matter of accusation;", "3580": "in the next place he assembled the Senate and read the will, to the dissatisfaction of the greater part;", "3581": "for they considered it to be altogether unusual and a hard matter for a man to- be called to account in his lifetime for what he wished to be done after his death.", "3582": "Cæsar dwelt most on that part of the will which related to the interment;", "3583": "for Antonius directed that his body, even if he should die in Rome, should be carried in procession through the Forum and sent to Alexandria to Cleopatra.", "3584": "Calvisius, an intimate friend of Cæsar, brought forward also these charges against An­ tonius in reference to Cleopatra:", "3585": "that he had given her the libraries.", "3586": "from Pergamum, in which there were two hundred thousand single books;", "3587": "and that at an entertain­ ment in the presence ot many people he stood up and rubbed her feett in compliance with a certain arrangement and agreement;", "3588": "and that he allowed the Ephesians in his presence to salute Cleopatra as mistress;", "3589": "and that fre­ quently when he was administering justice to tetrarchs

the Romans, said that Cleopatra was being carried in a litter through the Forum, and that Antonius when he saw her, sprung up and left the judgment-seat and accompanied her hanging on the litter.", "3591": "LIX.", "3592": "In most of these matters Calvisius§ was supposed to be lying.", "3593": "But the friends of Antonius going about in Rome entreated the people for his sake, and they sent Geminius, one of their body, to entreat Antonius not to be regardless about being deprived of his authority by a vote and declared an enemy of the Romans.", "3594": "Geminius having sailed to Greece became suspected by Cleopatra of acting on the behalf of Octavia, and, though he was continually ridi­ culed at supper and insulted by having unsuitable places at the feast assigned to him, he submitted to this and waited for an opportunity of an interview ;", "3595": "and when he was told at supper to say what he had come about, he replied that all his communication was to be made when he was sober, except one thing, which he knew whether he was sober or drunk ;", "3596": "and it was this, that all would be well if Cleopatra would go off to Egypt.", "3597": "Antonius was irritated at this, but Cleopatra said, \" You have done well, Geminius, in having confessed the truth without tor­ tures.\"", "3598": "After a few days accordingly Geminius made his escape to Rome.", "3599": "The flatterers of Cleopatra drove away also many of the other friends of Antonius, who could not endure their excesses over wine and their coarse beha­ viour ;", "3600": "and among these were Marcus Silanus and Dellius the historian.", "3601": "Dellius says that he was also afraid of some design from Cleopatra, of which he had been informed by Glaucus the physician.", "3602": "He had offended Cleopatra at supper by saying that they had to drink vinegar, while Sarmentus* at Rome was drinking Falernian.", "3603": "Now Sar­ mentus was a youth, one of Cæsar's favourites, such as the Romans

Antonius had the part from Cyrene to Ethiopia.", "3630": "LXII.", "3631": "Antonius was so mere an appendage to Cleopatra that though he had a great superiority in land forces, he wished the decision of the affair to depend on the navy, to please Cleopatra :", "3632": "and this, though he saw that through want of a crew, men were being seized by the trierarchs out of Greece, which had indeed suffered much, travellers, ass-drivers, reapers, youths, and that even by these means the ships were not manned, but the greater part were de­ ficient and were ill manoeuvred.", "3633": "Cæsar's navy consisted of ships not built to a great height nor yet for the purpose of making a show, but adapted for easy and quick move­ ment and well manned;", "3634": "and he kept his fleet together in Tarentum and Brundusium, and sent to Antonius to ask him not to waste the time, but to come with his forces, and that he would provide his armament with naval stations free from all hindrance, and harbours, and that he would retreat with his land forces a day's journey for a horseman from the sea, until Antonius had safely landed and en­ camped.", "3635": "Antonius replied in like strain to this bragging language by challenging Cæsar to single combat, though he was older than Cæsar ;", "3636": "and if Cæsar declined this, he pro. posed that they should decide the matter with theii armies at Pharsalus, as Caesar and Pompeius had done before.", "3637": "While Antonius was taking his station near Actium,* where Nicopolis is now built, Caesar contrived to cross the Ionian sea and to get possession of a place in Epirus, called Torune;", "3638": "and as the friends of Antonius were uneasy, because their land force had not yet come up, Cleopatra, jesting, said, What is the harm if Caesar is sitting by a torune ? \" *LXIII.", "3639": "At daybreak the advance of the enemy's fleet alarmed Antonius, lest they should seize the ships which were without crews, and accordingly he armed the rowers and placed them on the decks to make a show, and raising the ships' oars and making them ready for plying, he kept his ships on each side in the channel near Actium, prow to prow, as if they were fit to be put in motion and prepared to fight.", "3640": "Cæsar, being frustrated by this man­ œuvre, retired.", "3641": "Antonius also by some well contrived works shut in the water and deprived his enemies of it;", "3642": "and the surrounding spots had only little water, and that was bad.", "3643": "He behaved with magnanimity to Domitius also, and contrary to the judgment of Cleopatra.", "3644": "Domitius, who was already suffering from fever, got into a small boat and went over to Cæsar, on which Antonius, though much annoyed, sent him all his baggage together with his friends and slaves.", "3645": "Domitius indeed, as if he were repent­ ing after the discovery of his faithlessness and treachery, died immediately.", "3646": "There were also defections among the kings, for Amyntas and Deiotarus went over to Cæsar.", "3647": "Now as the navy was in all things unlucky and always too late to give any help, Antonius was again compelled to turn his thoughts to his land forces.", "3648": "Canidius also, who commanded the land forces, changed his opinion at the sight of the danger, and he advised Antonius to send Cleopatra away, and to retreat to Thrace or Macedonia, and then to decide the matter by a battle.", "3649": "For Dicomes, the king of the Getæ, promised to help him with a large force;", "3650": "and Canidius urged that there would be no dis­ grace, if they should give up the sea to Cæsar, who had been disciplined in the Sicilian war, but it would be a strange thing if Antonius, who was excellently versed in military operations, should not avail himself of his strength and his resources of so many heavy-armed soldiers, and should instead thereof distribute his troops among vessels and fritter them away.", "3651": "Notwithstanding this the advice of Cleopatra prevailed that the war should be decided by a naval battle, though she was already contemplating flight and making arrangements for her own position, not with a view to contribute to the victory, but to have the best place to retreat from if their cause should be ruined.", "3652": "Now there were long lines which extended from the camp to the naval station, and Antonius was accustomed to pass without suspecting any danger;", "3653": "and as a slave of Cæsar told him that it would be possible to seize Antonius as he went down through the lines, Cæsar sent men to lie in ambush for him.", "3654": "They came so near accomplishing their purpose as this, that by rising up too soon they seized the man who was advancing in front of Antonius;", "3655": "and Antonius escaped with difficulty by running.", "3656": "LXIV.", "3657": "When it had been resolved to make a sea fight, Antonius burned all the Egyptian ships except sixty;", "3658": "but he manned the best and largest, from three to ten banks of oars, with twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers and two thousand bowmen.", "3659": "Hereupon it is said that one of the centurions, who had already fought many battles for Antonius and was covered with wounds, wept as Antonius was passing by, and said;", "3660": "\"Imperator, why do you distrust these wounds or this sword and rest your hopes in miserable logs of wood ?", "3661": "Let Egyptians and Phœnicians fight on sea, but give us land, on which we are accustomed to stand and to die or to vanquish our enemies.\"", "3662": "Without making any reply, but merely by a motion of his hand and the expression of his countenance encouraging the man to be of good cheer, Antonius passed by, without however having any good hopes himself, inasmuch as when the masters of the vessels were desirous to leave the sails behind, he ordered them to be put on board and taken with them, observing that not a single fugitive of the enemy should be allowed to escape.", "3663": "LXV.*", "3664": "Now on that day and the three following days the sea was agitated by a strong wind which prevented an engagement, but on the fifth, there being no wind and the sea being quite calm, they came to an engagement.", "3665": "Antonius and Publicola commanded the right wing, and Coelius the left;", "3666": "and in the centre were Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius.", "3667": "Cæsar placed Agrippa on the left, and reserved the right wing for himself.", "3668": "Canidius drew up the army of Antonius, and Taurus that of Caesar on the shore, and remained without moving.", "3669": "As to the two commanders-in-chief, Antonius visited all his vessels in a row-boat and exhorted his soldiers to trust to the weight of their ships and to fight as if they were on land, without changing their position, and he urged the masters of the ships to receive the shock of the enemy with their vessels as if they were quietly at anchor, and to avoid the difficult spots about the entrance of the bay:", "3670": "and Cæsar, it is said, while it was still dark, left his tent, and as he was going round to the ships, he met a man driving an ass, who being asked his name and knowing Caesar, replied, “ My name is Goodluck, and my ass's name is Victor.\"", "3671": "For this reason when Cæsar afterwards ornamented the place with the beaks of ships, he set up a bronze figure of an ass and a man.", "3672": "After observing the arrangement of the other part of his fleet, he went in a boat to the right wing and was surprised to see the enemy resting quietly in the straits;", "3673": "for the vessels had the appearance of being moored at their anchors;", "3674": "and as he was for a long time convinced of this, he kept his own ships at the distance of eight stadia from the enemy.", "3675": "It was now the sixth hour, and a wind beginning to rise from the sea, the soldiers of Antonius were impatient at the delay, and, trusting to the height and magnitude of their ships as making them un­ assailable, they put the left wing in motion.", "3676": "Cæsar, do­ lighted to see this, ordered his right wing to row back­ wards with the design of drawing the enemy still further out of the gulf and the straits, and by surrounding them with his own light vessels to come to close quarters with the enemy's ships, which, owing to their size and the insufficiency of their crews, were cumbersome and slow.", "3677": "LXVI.", "3678": "Though the two fleets were beginning to come together, they did not drive the ships against, nor strive to crush one another, for the ships of Antonius, owing to their weight, were unable to move forwards with any force, which mainly gives effect to the blows of the beaks, and those of Cæsar not only avoided meeting front to front the strong and rough brass work of the enemy, but did not even venture to strike against them on the flank.", "3679": "For the beaks would easily have been broken off by coming in contact with the hulls- of the enemy's vessels, which were protected by large square pieces of timber fastened to one another with iron.", "3680": "The battle therefore was like a land fight, or, to speak more exactly, like the assailing of a fortress;", "3681": "for three and four of Caesar's ships at the same time were engaged about one of the ships of Antonius, and the men fought with light shields and spears and poles and fiery missiles ;", "3682": "the soldiers of Antonius assailed them also with catapults from wooden towers.", "3683": "While Agrippa was extending the left wing with a view to surround the enemy, Publicola, being compelled to advance to meet him, was separated from the centre, which fell into confusion, and was also closely engaged with Arruntius.", "3684": "While the sea fight was still undecided and equally favourable to both sides, all at once the sixty ships of Cleopatra were seen raising their sails for the purpose of making off, and flying through the centre of the combatants;", "3685": "for they were stationed behind the large vessels and they caused confusion by making their way through them.", "3686": "The enemy looked on with wonder, seeing them take advantage of the wind and shape their course towards the Pelopon­ nesus.", "3687": "On this occasion Antonius clearly showed that he was not governed by the considerations that befit either a commander or a man, or even by his own judgment, but, as some one observed in jest, that the soul of the lover lives in another person's body, so was he dragged along by the woman as if he had grown to her and moved to­ gether with her.", "3688": "For no sooner did he see her ship sail­ ing away, than, forgetting everything, and deserting and skulking away from those who were fighting and dying in his cause, he got into a five-oared galley with only Alexas the Syrian and Skellius to attend him, and followed after her who had already ruined him and was destined to complete his ruin.", "3689": "LXVII.", "3690": "Cleopatra, having recognised the vessel of Antonius, raised a signal;", "3691": "and Antonius accordingly, com­ ing up to her and being taken into her ship, neither saw Cleopatra nor was seen by her, but advancing close to the prow he sat down by himself in silence holding his head with both his hands.", "3692": "In the meantime there were seen Liburnian ships.", "3693": "from Cæsar's fleet in pursuit;", "3694": "but Antonius, by ordering his men to turn his vessel's head towards them, kept them all in check, except the ship of Eurykles, the Lacedæmonian, who proudly pressed on, brandishing a spear on the deck, as if to hurl it at Antonius.", "3695": "Standing on the prow of his vessel Antonius asked who it was that was pursuing Antonius ?", "3696": "The reply was, “ I am Eurykles, the son of Lachares, and by the help of Cæsar's fortune I am avenging my father's death.\"", "3697": "Now Lachares had been beheaded by Antonius in consequence of being involved in a charge of robbery.", "3698": "However Eurykles did not fall upon the ship of Antonius, but he dashed against the other of the admiral-ships (for there were two) with the brazen beak, and made it spin round, and as the ship fell off from its course he took it, and also another ship which contained costly vessels for table use.", "3699": "When this assailant had retired, Antonius, again settling down in the same posture, remained without moving, and, after spending three days at the prow by himself, either because of his passion or that he was ashamed to see Cleopatra, he put in at Tænarus.†", "3700": "Here the women who were in attendance on Cleopatra first of all brought them to speak to one another, and next they persuaded them to sup and sleep together.", "3701": "And already not a few of the transport ships and some of their friends after the defeat began to collect around them;", "3702": "and they brought intelligence of the destruction of the navy, but they supposed that the army still kept together.", "3703": "Antonius sent messengers to Canidius with orders for him to retreat quickly through Macedonia with his army into Asia;", "3704": "and as it was his intention to cross over from Tænarus to Libya, he selected one of the store-ships which conveyed much money and many royal utensils in silver and in gold of great value, and gave them to his friends, telling them to divide the things among them and to look after their safety.", "3705": "As they refused and wept, he comforted them with much affection and kindness, and by his entreaties induced them to depart;", "3706": "and he wrote to Theophilus, his steward in Corinth, to provide for the safety of the men and to conceal them until they should be able to make their peace with Caesar.", "3707": "This Theophilus was the father of Hipparchus, who had the greatest influence with Antonius, and was the first of his freedmen who went over to Cæsar, and he afterwards lived in Corinth.", "3708": "LXVIII.", "3709": "Such was the condition of affairs with Anto­ nius.", "3710": "At Actium the naval force, after resisting Cæsar a long time and being very greatly damaged by the heavy sea that set against them ahead, hardly gave up the contest at the tenth hour.", "3711": "The dead were said not to be more than five thousand, but there were taken three hundred ships, as Cæsar has recorded.", "3712": "There were not many who knew that Antonius had fled, and those who heard of it could not at first believe that he had gone and left them, when he had nineteen legions of unvanquished soldiers and twelve thousand horsemen;", "3713": "as if he had not often expe­ rienced fortune both ways, and were not exercised in the reverses of innumerable contests and wars.", "3714": "The soldiers longed and expected to see him, hoping that he would soon show himself from some quarter or other;", "3715": "and they dis­ played so much fidelity and courage that, even when his flight was well known, they kept together seven days and paid no regard to Cæsar's messages to them.", "3716": "But at last, when their general Canidius had stolen away by night and left the camp, being now deserted of all and betrayed by their commanders, they went over to the conqueror.", "3717": "Upon this Caesar* sailed to Athens, and having come to terms with the Greeks, he distributed the grain that remained over after the war among the cities, which were in a wretched condition and stripped of money, slaves and beasts of burden.", "3718": "Now my great-grandfather Nikarchus used to relate that all the citizens * were compelled to carry down on their shoulders a certain quantity of wheat to the sea at Antikyra, and that their speed was quickened by the whip;", "3719": "they had carried, he said, one supply in this manner, and had just measured out another and were about to set out, when news came that Antonius was defeated, and this saved the city;", "3720": "for the agents and soldiers of Antonius immediately fled, and they divided the corn among them­ selves.", "3721": "LXIX.", "3722": "When Antonius had reached the coast of Libya, and had sent Cleopatra forwards to Egypt from Paræto­ nium,t he had his fill of solitude, wandering and rambling about with two friends, one a Greek, Aristokrates, a rhetori­ cian, and the other a Roman, Lucilius,‡ about whom I have said elsewhere that at Philippi, in order that Brutus might escape, he had surrendered to the pursuers, pretending that he was Brutus, and his life being spared by Antonius on that account, he remained faithful to him and firm to the last critical times.", "3723": "When the general§ to whom he had intrusted the troops in Libya had caused their defection, Antonius made an effort to kill himself, but he was pre­ vented by his friends and conveyed to Alexandria, where he found Cleopatra contemplating a hazardous and great undertaking.", "3724": "The isthmus which separates the Red Sea from the sea of Eygpt* and is considered to be the boundary between Asia and Libya, in the part where it is most contracted by the sea, and the width is least, is about three hundred stadia across;",

to settle beyond the limits of Egypt and to escape from slavery and war.", "3726": "But as the Arabs of Petrat burnt the first ships which were drawn up, and Antonius thought that the army at Actium still kept together, Cleopatra desisted from her design and guarded the approaches to Eygpt.", "3727": "Antonius now leaving the city and the company of his friends, built for himself a dwelling in the sea, near the Pharos, ‡ by throwing forward a mole into the water;", "3728": "and here he lived a fugitive from men, and he said that he was content with Timon's life and admired it, considering himself in like plight with Timon;", "3729": "for he too had been wronged by his friends and had experienced their ingratitude, and that therefore he distrusted and disliked all men.", "3730": "LXX.",

instruments of Cleopatra against Antonius, and had over­ thrown all the reflections which rose in his mind about Octavia, had been sent to King Herodes to keep him from changing;", "3769": "and having stayed there and betrayed Antonius, be had the impudence to go into the presence of Cæsar, relying on Herodes.", "3770": "But Herodes helped him not, but being forthwith confined and carried in chains to his own country, he was put to death there by order of Cæsar.", "3771": "Such was the penalty for his infidelity that Alexas paid to Antonius in his lifetime.", "3772": "LXXIII.", "3773": "Caesar would not listen to what was said on behalf of Antonius;", "3774": "but as to Cleopatra, he replied that she should not fail to obtain anything that was reasonable if she would kill Antonius or drive him away.", "3775": "He also sent with the ambassadors of Antonius and Cleopatra one Thyrsus,t a freedman of his, a man not devoid of judgment, nor, as coming from a young general, one who would fail in persuasive address to a haughty woman who was wonder­ fully proud of her beauty.", "3776": "This man, having longer inter­ views with Cleopatra than the rest, and being specially honoured, caused Antonius to have suspicions, and he seized and whipped him;", "3777": "and he then sent him back to Cæsar with a letter to the effect that Thyrsus, by giving himself airs and by his insolent behaviour, had irritated him, who was easily irritated by reason of his misfortunes. \"", "3778": "But you,\" he said, \" if you do not like the thing, have my freedman Hipparchus.", "3779": "Hang him up and whip him, that we may be on equal terms.”", "3780": "Upon this Cleopatra, with the view of doing away with his cause of complaint and suspicions, paid more than usual court to Antonius:",

were invited to the feast came poor and went away rich.", "3782": "Agrippa* in the meantime called Cæsar back, frequently writing to him from Rome, and urging that affairs there required his presence.", "3783": "LXXIV.", "3784": "Accordingly for the time the war was sus­ pended ;", "3785": "but when the winter was over, Cæsar advanced through Syria and his generals through Libya.",

put to death;", "3788": "and as she had a tomb and a monument constructed of unusual beauty and height, which she had built close to the temple of Isis, she collected there the most precious of the royal treasures, gold, silver, emeralds, pearls, ebony, ivory, and cinnamon, and also a great quantity of fire-wood and tow;", "3789": "so that Cæsar, being afraid about the money, lest Cleopatra becoming desperate should destroy and burn the wealth, kept continually forwarding to her hopes of friendly treatment while he was advancing with his army against the city.", "3790": "When Cæsar had taken his position near the hippodrome, Antonius sallied forth and fought gallantly, and he put Cæsar's cavalry to flight and pursued them to the camp.", "3791": "Elated with his victory, he entered the palace and embraced Cleopatra in his armour, and presented to her one of the soldiers who had fought most bravely.", "3792": "Cleopatra gave the soldier as a re­ ward of his courage a golden breastplate and a helmet.", "3793": "The man took them, and in the night deserted to Caesar.", "3794": "LXXV.", "3795": "Again, Antonius sent to Cæsar and challenged him to single combat.", "3796": "Caesar replied that Antonius had many ways of dying, on which Antonius, reflecting that there was no better mode of death for him than in battle, determined to try a land battle and a naval battle at the same time.", "3797": "And at supper, it is said, he bade the slaves to pour out and feast him cheerfully, for it was uncertain whether they would do that on the morrow or would be serving other masters, while he should lie a corpse and should be a nothing.", "3798": "Seeing that his friends shed tears at his words, he said that he would not lead them out to a battle from which he would seek for himself a glorious death rather than safety and victory.", "3799": "During this night, it is said, about the middle thereof, while the city was quiet and depressed through fear and expectation of the future, all at once certain harmonious sounds from all kinds of instruments were heard, and shouts of a crowd with Evoes* and satyric leapings, as if some company of revellers not without noise were going out of the city;", "3800": "and the course of the procession seemed to be through the middle of the city to the gate leading outwards in the direction of the enemy, and at this point the tumult made its way out, being loudest there.", "3801": "And those who reflected on the sign were of opinion that the god to whom An­ tonius all along most likened himself and most claimed kinship with was deserting him.", "3802": "LXXVI.†", "3803": "At daybreak Antonius posted his troops on the hillu in front of the city, and watched his ships, which were put in motion and advancing against those of the enemy;", "3804": "and as he expected to see something great done by them, he remained quiet.", "3805": "But when the men of Antonius came near, they saluted with their oars Cæsar's men, and as they returned the salute, the men of Antonius changed sides, and the fleet becoming one by the junction of all the ships, sailed with the vessels' heads turned against the city.", "3806": "As soon as Antonius saw this, he was deserted by the cavalry, who changed sides, and being defeated with his infantry he retired into the city, crying out that he was betrayed by Cleopatra to those with whom he was warring on her account.", "3807": "Cleopatra, fearing his anger and despair, fled to the tomb and let down the folding doors which were strengthened with bars and bolts;", "3808": "and she sent persons to Antonius to inform him that she was dead.", "3809": "Antonius, believing the intelligence, said to himself, “ Why dost thou still delay, Antonius ?", "3810": "fortune has taken away the sole re­ maining excuse for clinging to life.\"", "3811": "He then entered his chamber, and loosing his body armour and taking it in pieces, he said:", "3812": "\" Cleopatra, I am not grieved at being de­ prived of thee, for I shall soon come to the same place with thee;", "3813": "but I am grieved that I, such an Imperator, am shown to be inferior to a woman in courage.\"", "3814": "Now Antonius had a faithful slave named Eros, whom he had long before ex­ horted, if the necessity should arise, to kill him ;", "3815": "and he now claimed the performance of the promise.", "3816": "Eros drew his sword and held it out as if he were going to strike his master, but he turned away his face and killed himself.", "3817": "As Eros fell at his master's feet Antonius said, \" Well done, Eros,

immediately mortal;", "3820": "and accordingly, as the flow of blood ceased when he lay down, he came to himself and re­ quested the bystanders to finish him.", "3821": "But they fled from the chamber

alive, he eagerly commanded his slaves to take him up, and he was carried in their arms to the doors of the chamber.", "3824": "Cleo­ patra did not open the doors, but she appeared at a window, from which she let down cords and ropes ;", "3825": "and when the slaves below had fastened Antonius to them, she drew him up with the aid of the two women whom alone she had admitted into the tomb with her.", "3826": "Those who were present say that there never was a more piteous sight;", "3827": "for stained with blood and struggling with death he was hauled up, stretching out his hands to her, while he was suspended in the air.", "3828": "For the labour was not light for women, and Cleopatra with difficulty, holding with her hands and straining the muscles of her face, pulled up the rope, while those who were below encouraged her and shared in her agony.", "3829": "When she had thus got him in and laid him down, she rent her garments over him, and beating her breasts and scratching them with her hands, and wiping the blood off him with her face, she called him master and husband and Imperator;", "3830": "and she almost forgot her own misfor­ tunes through pity for his.", "3831": "Antonius, stopping her lamentations, asked for wine to drink, whether it was that he was thirsty or that he expected to be released more speedily.", "3832": "When he had drunk it, he advised her, if it could be done with decency, to look after the preservation of her own interests, and to trust to Procleius* most of the companions of Cæsar;", "3833": "and not to lament him for his last re­ verses, but to think him happy for the good things that he had obtained, having become the most illustrious of men and had the greatest power, and now not ignobly a Roman by a Roman vanquished.",

his dagger and concealing it, secretly made his way from the palace, and running to Cæsar, was the first to report the death of Antonius, and he showed the blood-stained dagger.", "3837": "When Cæsar heard the news, he retired within his tent and wept for a man who had been related to him by marriage, and his colleague in command, and his com­ panion in many struggles and affairs.", "3838": "He then took the letters that had passed between him and Antonius, and calling his friends, read them, in order to show in what a reasonable and fair tone he had written himself, and how arrogant and insolent Antonius had always been in his answers.", "3839": "Upon this he sent Procleius with orders, if pos­ sible, above all things to secure Cleopatra alive;", "3840": "for he was afraid about the money, and he thought it a great thing for the glory of his triumph to lead her in the pro­ cession.", "3841": "However Cleopatra would not put herself in the hands of Procleius;", "3842": "but they talked together while he was standing on the outside close to the building near a door on a level with the ground, which was firmly secured, but allowed a passage for the voice.", "3843": "In their conversation Cleopatra entreated that her children might have the kingdom, and Procleius bade her be of good cheer and trust to Cæsar in all things.", "3844": "LXXIX.", "3845": "After Procleius had inspected the place and reported to Cæsar, Gallus* was sent to have another inter­ view with her;", "3846": "and having come to the door he purposely prolonged the conversation.", "3847": "In the meantime Procleius applied a ladder and got through the window by which the women took in Antonius ;", "3848": "and he immediately went down with two slaves to the door at which Cleopatra stood with her attention directed to Gallus.", "3849": "One of the women who were shut up with Cleopatra called out, \" Wretched Cleopatra, you are taken alive,\" on which she turned round, and seeing Procleius, attempted to stab her­ self, for she happened to have by her side a dagger such as robbers wear:", "3850": "but Procleius, quickly running up to her and holding her with both his hands, said, \"You wrong yourself, Cleopatra, and Cæsar too by attempting to deprive him of the opportunity of a noble display of magnanimity and to fix on the mildest of commanders the stigma of faithlessness and implacability.", "3851": "At the same time he took away her dagger and shook her dress to see if she concealed any poison.", "3852": "There was also sent from Cæsar one of his freedmen, Epaphroditus,

friend Areius.", "3856": "Such honour Areius obtained from Cæsar, and he got the pardon of many others;", "3857": "and among them was Philostratus,t a man of all sophists the most competent to speak

she wished.", "3875": "In consequence of so much grief and pain, for her breasts were inflamed by the blows that she had inflicted and were sore, and a fever coming on, she gladly availed herself of this pretext for abstaining from food and with the design of releasing herself from life without hindrance.", "3876": "There was a physician with whom she was familiar, Olympus, to whom she told the truth, and she had him for her adviser and assistant in accomplishing her death, as Olympus said in a history of these transactions which he published.", "3877": "Cæsar suspecting her design, plied her with threats and alarms about her children, by which Cleopatra was thrown down as by engines of war, and she gave up her body to be treated and nourished as it was wished.", "3878": "LXXXIII.",

her, she began to touch upon a kind of justification, and endeavoured to turn all that had happened upon necessity and fear of Antonius ;", "3885": "but as Cæsar on each point met her with an answer, being confuted, she all at once changed her manner to move him by pity and by prayers, as a person would do who clung most closely to life.", "3886": "Finally she handed to him a list of all the treasures that she had;", "3887": "and when Seleukus, one of her stewards, declared that she was hiding and secreting some things, she sprang up and laying hold of his hair, belaboured him with many

a golden dis­ taff and irritated it till the reptile sprang upon her arm and clung to it.", "3924": "But the real truth nobody knows;", "3925": "for it was also said that she carried poison about her in a hollow comb, which she concealed in her hair;", "3926": "however, no spots broke out on her body, nor any other sign of poison.", "3927": "Nor yet was the reptile seen within the palace;",

one, and she had reigned as queen two-and-twenty years, and governed together with Antonius more than fourteen.", "3935": "Antonius, according to some, was six years, according to others, three years

very near subverting the supremacy of Rome, being the fifth from Antonius in the order of succession.", "3954": "I. Since, then, great changes of fortune took place in each of their lives, let us first consider their power and renown.", "3955": "The position of Demetrius was inherited and already made for him, as Antigonus was the most powerful of the successors of Alexander, and, before Demetrius came of age, had overrun and conquered the greater part of Asia:", "3956": "while Antonius, whose father, though an excellent man, was no soldier, and left him no renown, yet dared to seize upon the empire of Caesar, with which he was in no way connected, and constituted himself the heir of what Cæsar had won by the sword.", "3957": "Starting as a mere private perso n, he raised himself to such a height of power as to be able to divide the world into two, and to select and obtain the fairer half for his own, while, without his being even present, his lieutenants and agents inflicted several defeats upon the Parthians, and conquered all the nations of Asia as far as the Caspian Sea.", "3958": "Even that for which he is especially reproached proves the greatness of his power.", "3959": "Demetrius's father was well pleased at getting Phila, the daughter of Antipater, as a wife for his son, in spite of the disparity of their ages, because he regarded her as his son's superior;", "3960": "while it was thought to be a disgrace for Antonius to ally himself with Cleopatra, a woman who excelled in power and renown all the Kings of her age, except Arsakes himself.", "3961": "Antonius had made himself so great that men thought him entitled to more even than he himself desired.", "3962": "II.", "3963": "Demetrius, however, cannot be blamed for attempt­ ing to make himself king over a people accustomed to servitude, while it appeared harsh and tyrannical for Antonius to try to enslave the people of Rome just after they had been set free from the rule of Cæsar:", "3964": "and the greatest of his exploits, the war against Brutus and Cassius, was waged with the intention of depriving his countrymen of their liberty.", "3965": "Demetrius, before he became involved in difficulties, used always to act as a liberator towards Greece, and to drive out the foreign garrisons from her cities, and did not act like Antonius, who boasted that he had slain the would-be liberators of Rome in Macedonia.", "3966": "And though Antonius is especially commended for his magni­ ficent generosity, yet Demetrius so far surpassed him as to bestow more upon his enemies than Antonius would upon his friends.", "3967": "It is true that Antonius gained great credit for having caused Brutus to be honourably buried;", "3968": "but Demetrius buried all his enemy's slain, gave money and presents to his prisoners, and sent them back to Ptolemy.", "3969": "III.", "3970": "Both were arrogant when in prosperity, and set no bounds to their luxury and pleasures.", "3971": "Yet it cannot be said that Demetrius was ever so immersed in enjoyments as to let slip the time for action, but he only dedicated the superfluity of his leisure to enjoyment, and used his Lamia, like the mythical nightmare, only when he was half asleep or at play.", "3972": "When he was preparing for war, no ivy wreathed his spear, no perfume scented his helmet, nor did he go forth from his bed-chamber to battle covered with finery, but, as Euripides says, he laid the Bacchic wand aside, and served the unhallowed god of war, and, indeed, never suffered any reverse through his own care­ lessness or love of pleasure.", "3973": "But just as in pictures we often see Omphale stealing the club and stripping off the lion's skin from Herakles, so Cleopatra frequently would disarm Antonius and turn his mind to pleasure, persuading him to give up mighty enterprises and even necessary campaigns to wander and sport with her on the shores of Canopus and beside the tomb of Osiris.", "3974": "At last, like Paris, he fled from battle to nestle on her breast, though Paris only took refuge in his chamber after he had been de­ feated in battle, while Antonius, by his pursuit of Cleopatra, gave up his chance of victory.", "3975": "IV.", "3976": "Moreover, in marrying several wives, Demetriua did not break through any custom, for he only did what had been usual for the kings of Macedonia since the days of Philip and Alexander, and what was done by Lysimachus and Ptolemy in his own time ;", "3977": "and he showed due respect to all his wives;", "3978": "while Antonius, in the first place, married two wives at the same time, which no Roman had ever dared to do before, and then drove away his own countrywoman and his legitimate wife to please a foreigner, and one to whom he was not legally married.", "3979": "Yet with all his excesses Antonius was never led by his vices into such sacrilegious impiety as is re­ corded of Demetrius.", "3980": "We are told that no dogs are allowed to enter the Acropolis,* because these animals copulate more openly than any others;", "3981": "but Demetrius consorted with harlots in the very temple of the virgin goddess, and debauched many of the Athenian citizens, while, although one would have imagined that a man of such a temperament would be especially averse to cruelty, Demetrius must be charged with this in allowing, or rather compelling, the most beautiful and modest of the Athenians to suffer death in order to avoid outrage.", "3982": "To sum up, the vices of Anto­ nius were ruinous to himself, while those of Demetrius were ruinous to others.", "3983": "V.", "3984": "Yet Demetrius always behaved well to his parents, whereas Antonius allowed his mother's brother to perish in order that he might compass the death of Cicero, which was of itself so odious a crime that we should scarcely think Antonius justified if by Cicero's death he had rAved his uncle's life.", "3985": "With regard to the perjuries and breaking of their words which they both committed, the one in seizing Artabazus, and the other in murdering Alexander, Antonius has a satisfactory defence;", "3986": "for he himself was first deserted and betrayed by Artabazus in Media:", "3987": "while many writers say that Demetrius himself invented false pretexts for his treatment of Alexander, and accused a man whom he had wronged with a design on his life, instead of defending himself against one who was already his enemy.", "3988": "Again, the exploits of Demetrius were all accomplished by himself in person;", "3989": "while, on the other hand, Antonius won some of his most important battles by his lieutenants, without himself being presentVI.", "3990": "The ruin of both was due to themselves, though in a different manner, for the Macedonians deserted from Demetrius, while Antonious deserted his own troops when they were risking their lives in his defence ;", "3991": "so that we must blame the former for having rendered his army so hostile to him, and the latter for betraying so much loyalty and devotion.", "3992": "In their manner of death neither can be praised, but that of Demetrius seems the less creditable of the two, for he endured to be taken prisoner, and when in confine­ ment willingly spent three years in drinking and gluttony, like a wild beast that has been tamed;", "3993": "while Antonius, though he killed himself like a coward, and in a piteous and dishonourable fashion, nevertheless died before ho fell into the hands of his enemy.", "3994": "I.", "3995": "We are told by the poet Simonides, Sossius Senecio, thai the Trojans bore no malice against the Corinthians for joining the rest of the Greeks in the siege of Troy, because Glaukus, who was himself of Corinthian extraction, fought heartily on their side.", "3996": "In the same manner we may expect that neither Greeks nor Romans will be able to blame the doctrines of the academy, as each nation derives equal credit from their practice in this book of mine, which contains the lives of Brutus and Dion, of whom the latter was Plato's intimate friend, while the former was educated by his writings:", "3997": "so that they were both, as it were, sent forth from the same school to contend for the greatest prizes.", "3998": "It is not surprising, therefore, that there should be a great similarity between their respective achievements, or that they should have proved the truth of that maxim of their teacher, that nothing great or noble can be effected in politics except when a wise and just man is possessed of absolute power combined with good fortune.", "3999": "Just as Hippomachus the gymnastic trainer used to declare that he could always tell by their carriage those who had been his pupils, even though he only saw them from a distance when they were carrying meat home for their dinner, so we may imagine that philosophy accompanies those who have been brought up in its precepts in every action of their lives, adding a happy grace and fitness to all that they do.", "4000": "II.", "4001": "Their lives resemble one another even more in their misfortunes than in the objects at which they aimed.", "4002": "Both of them perished by an untimely fate, unable, with all their mighty efforts, to accomplish the object which they had in view.", "4003": "The most remarkable point of all is that they both received a supernatural warning of their death by the appearance to them of an evil spirit in a dream.", "4004": "Yet it is a common argument with those who deny the truth of such matters that no man of sense ever could see a ghost or spirit but that it is only children and women and men who are wandering in their mind through sick­ ness, who through disorder of the brain or distemperatnre of the body are subject to these vain and ominous fancies, which really arise from the evil spirit of superstition within themselves.", "4005": "If, however, Dion and Brutus, both of whom were serious and philosophic men, not at all liable to be mistaken or easy to be deceived about such matters, did really experience a supernatural visitation so distinctly that they told other persons about it, I do not know whether we may not be obliged to adopt that strangest of all the theories of the ancients that evil and malignant spirits feel a spite against good men, and try to oppose their actions, throwing confusion and terror in their way in order to shake them in their allegiance to virtue;", "4006": "because they fear lest if they passed their lives entirely pure and without spot of sin, they might after death obtain a higher place than themselves.", "4007": "This, however, I must reserve for discussion in another place;", "4008": "and now, in this my twelfth book of parallel lives, I will first proceed to deal with the elder man of the two.", "4009": "III.", "4010": "Dionysius the elder, as soon as he had raised himself to the throne, married the daughter of Hermo­ krates of Syracuse.", "4011": "However, as his power was not yet firmly established, the people of Syracuse rose in revolt, and committed such shocking outrages upon the person of Dionysius's wife, that she voluntarily put herself to death.", "4012": "Dionysius, after recovering and confirming his power, now married two wives at the same time, one of whom was a Lokrian, named Doris, and the other a native of Syracuse, named Aristomache, the daughter of Hipparinus, one of the first men in Syracuse, who had acted as colleague with Dionysius himself when he was appointed to the command of the army with unlimited powers.", "4013": "It is said that he married them both upon the same day, and that no man knew which he visited first;", "4014": "and of the remainder of his life he spent an equal share of his time with each.", "4015": "as he always supped in company with both of them, and spent the night with each in turn.", "4016": "The populace of Syracuse would fain have hoped that their countrywoman would be preferred to the stranger;", "4017": "but it was the stranger who first bore a son and heir to Dionysius, to counterbalance her foreign parentage;", "4018": "while Aristomache remained childless for a long time, although Dionysius was anxious to have a family by her, and even put to death the mother of his Lokrian wife on a charge of having bewitched her.", "4019": "IV.", "4020": "Dion was the brother of Aristomache, and at first was treated with respect for the sake of his sister, but afterwards, when he had given proofs of his ability, he gained the favour of the despot by his own good qualities.", "4021": "Besides many other privileges, Dionysius ordered his treasurers to give Dion anything that he might ask for, letting him know on the same day what they had given him.", "4022": "He was naturally of a high minded and manly disposition, and he was greatly encouraged in the path of virtue by the providential accident of Plato's visit to Sicily.", "4023": "This never could have been calculated upon according to human ideas of probability;", "4024": "but it seems as though some divinity, who had long been meditating how to put liberty within the reach of the Syracusans and to free them from despotism, must have brought Plato from Italy to Syracuse, and caused Dion to become his disciple.", "4025": "Dion at this time was very young, but was by far the most apt of Plato's scholars, and the readiest to follow out his master's instructions in virtue.", "4026": "This we learn from Plato's own account of him, and from the circumstances of the case.", "4027": "Brought up as Dion had been in the humble position of a subject under a despotic ruler, his life had been full of sudden alarms and violent alternations of fortune;", "4028": "yet, though he was at this time accustomed to live in a state of parvenu splendour, and to regard pleasure and power as the only objects of desire, he, as soon as he had become acquainted with philosophic reason­ ing and exhortation to virtue, became passionately inter­ ested in it.", "4029": "With the guileless innocence of youth he imagined that the discourses which he had heard would produce an equally deep impression upon the mind of Dionysius, and took considerable pains to bring Dionysius to meet Plato and listen to his arguments.", "4030": "V.", "4031": "When the meeting took place, Plato chose for his subject human virtue, and discussed more particularly the virtue of manly courage, proving that despots are the most cowardly of men.", "4032": "From this he went on to speak of justice, and as he pointed out that the life of the just is happy, and that of the unjust miserable, Dionysius, who considered the lecture as a reproach to himself, was much exasperated, especially when he observed how all the audience admired Plato and were en­ chanted by his rhetoric.", "4033": "At last in a rage he asked him why he had come to Sicily:", "4034": "and when Plato answered that he had come in order to find a good man, Dionysius caught up his words, and said, “ You seem hitherto not to have found one.", "4035": "\"Dion and his friends imagined that this outburst marked the end of Dionysius's indignation;", "4036": "and as Plato was now anxious to leave Sicily they obtained a passage for him on board of a trireme which was about to convey home Pollis, the Lacedæmonian envoy.", "4037": "Dionysius however secretly besought Pollis to put Plato to death during the voyage, or at any rate to sell him for a slave, because, he said, Plato, according to his own showing, would be none the worse off for being a slave, but would be just as happy, provided that he was just.", "4038": "In consequence of this we are told that Pollis took Plato to Ægina and there sold him, because the people of Ægina were at that time at war with the Athenians, and had passed a decree that any Athenian found in Ægina should be sold for a slave.-", "4039": "Yet Dion was no less honoured and trusted by Dionysius in con­ sequence of this, but was entrusted with the management of the most important negotiations, and was himself sent as ambassador to Carthage, in which capacity he gained great credit.", "4040": "Indeed he was almost the only person whom Dionysius allowed freely to speak his mind, as is proved by the reproof which he gave Dionysius about Gelon.", "4041": "It appears that Dionysius was sneering at Gelon and his kingdom, and saying that he was the laughing-stock of Sicily.", "4042": "All the other courtiers pretended to approve of this jest, but Dion harshly answered, \" Yet you have been allowed to become our despot because of the good example set by Gelon;", "4043": "but your example will not encourage any state to imitate us.\"", "4044": "In truth Gelon's conduct as an absolute monarch seems to have been just as admirable as that of Dionysius was detestable.", "4045": "VI. Dionysius had three children by his Lokrian wife, and four by Aristomache.", "4046": "Of his two daughters, Sophrosyne married her half-brother, and Arete married Thearides, the brother of Dionysius, but on the death of Thearides Dion took Arete, who was his own niece, for his wife.", "4047": "In Dionysius's last illness, when his life was despaired of, Dion wished to ask him what was to become of the children of Aristomache, but the physicians, who wished to pay their court to the heir to the throne, would not allow Dion an opportunity of doing so.", "4048": "Timæus even states that when Dionysius asked for a sleeping draught they gave him one which rendered him completely in.", "4049": "sensible, so that he passed from sleep into death.", "4050": "However, as soon as the young Dionysius assembled his friends in council, Dion made such an admirable speech upon the political situation that all the others appeared by his side to be mere children in intellect, and their words seemed to be those of slaves and grovelling flatterers of the despot when compared with his bold and fearless utterances.", "4051": "He impressed upon their minds the greatness of the danger by which they were menaced by Carthage, and promised that if Dionysius wished for peace he himself would at once set sail for Africa and obtain the best terms he could;", "4052": "or that, if he preferred to fight, he would place at his disposal a force of fifty triremes, which he would maintain at his own expense.", "4053": "VII.", "4054": "Dionysius greatly admired his magnanimity and approved of his zeal;", "4055": "but the others, who thought that they were eclipsed by Dion, and were jealous of his power, at once set to work to effect his ruin, and lost no opportunity of exasperating the young despot against him by pointing out that he was plotting to obtain the supreme throne by means of the fleet, and that his object in making the offer of the ships was to place all real power in the hands of the children of Aristomache.", "4056": "Their hate and jealousy of Dion was chiefly owing to the proud reserve of his life, so different to their own:", "4057": "for they at once began to court the friendship of their young and ill-trained monarch by offering him all kinds of flatteries and pleasures, endea­ vouring to amuse his leisure by vagrant amours, drinking parties, and the like dissolute pastimes, which blunted the excessive sharpness of his tyranny, and made his subjects regard it as milder and less ferocious than before, although the alteration was due only to the laziness and not to the real goodness of their ruler.", "4058": "By slow degrees the extra­ vagance and licentious life of the young monarch relaxed and broke those \"chains of adamant\" by which the elder Dionysius boasted that he had secured his power.", "4059": "We are told that he once continued drinking for ninety days in succession, and that during the whole of this time his court was a place which no respectable person could enter, and where no business could be transacted, as it was a con­ stant scene of singing, jesting, dancing, drunkenness and debauchery.", "4060": "VIII.", "4061": "As may easily be imagined, Dion soon lost the favour of the monarch, as he never relaxed the austerity of his life.", "4062": "For this reason the calumnies of infamous men were more easily believed by Dionysius, when they attacked the virtues of Dion, calling his pride arrogance, and his boldness of speech churlishness.", "4063": "When he gave good advice he was thought to reproach them, and because he refused to join in their excesses, he seemed to despise them.", "4064": "Indeed, his disposition was naturally inclined to haughtiness, and his manners harsh and forbidding.", "4065": "It was not only to a young man whose ears were accustomed to batteries that he appeared so ungracious and harsh- tempered, but even those who were sincerely attached to him, and who admired the noble simplicity of his character, used to blame his discourtesy and rudeness towards those with whom he was brought in contact upon political busi­ ness.", "4066": "Indeed, not long after this, Plato, as if prophetically, wrote to him, warning him against a stubborn and arro­ gant temper, the consort of a lonely life.", "4067": "Yet, even at that time, though Dion was regarded as the most able man in the state, and was thought to be the only person who could save the kingdom from the dangers by which it was menaced, he knew well that his honourable and powerful position was not due to any love which the monarch bore him, but merely to the fact that he could not do without him.", "4068": "IX.", "4069": "As Dion imagined that this must be caused by Dionysius's want of education, he endeavoured to interest him in literature, and to form his character by the study of philosophy and science.", "4070": "Indeed Dionysius was far from being a stupid ruler, but his father, fearing that if he were educated, and frequented the society of intellectual men, he would certainly plot against him and seize his throne, used to keep him shut up at home, where, through want of companionship and ignorance, he was forced, we are told, to amuse himself by making little waggons and lamps, and wooden chairs and tables;", "4071": "for the elder Dio­ nysius was so distrustful and suspicious of all men, and was driven by his fears to take such precautions against assassination, that he would not even allow his hair to be cut with a barber's tools, but a workman used to come and singe his hair with a live coal.", "4072": "Neither his brother nor his son was allowed to enter his house in their ordinary dress, but were obliged to take off their clothes and put on others, so that they might be seen naked by the guard.", "4073": "Once when his brother Leptines, describing the situation of some place, took a spear from one of the life-guards and with it drew a map upon the floor, Dionysius was furiously angry with him, and put to death the man who gave him the spear.", "4074": "He used to say that he suspected all his friends, because he knew that they were sensible men, who would prefer to be despots themselves rather than live under the rule of a despot.", "4075": "He put to death one Marsyas, whom he had him­ self promoted to a responsible post, because he dreamed that he was killing him;", "4076": "for Dionysius argued that his dream must have been suggested by some thoughts or talk in his waking hours.", "4077": "To such a condition of terror and misery was he reduced by his cowardice, although he was angry with Plato for not declaring him to be the bravest of men.X.", "4078": "Dion, perceiving, as has been said before, that the character of the young Dionysius had been ruined by his want of education, begged him to educate himself, to offer all possible inducements to the first of philosophers to visit Sicily, and when he came, to place himself in his hands, in order that his character might be exalted by the contemplation of virtue, and formed upon the noblest of models, which alone can produce order out of chaos;", "4079": "by which means he would not only gain great happiness for himself, but would bestow great happiness upon the citizens by his mild and just paternal rule, thus becoming a true king instead of a despot.", "4080": "He pointed out that the \" adamantine chains ” by which Dionysius's father boasted that his dominion was secured, were not terror and force, the numbers of his ships of war, or the thousands of his barbarian mercenaries, but rather the goodwill, loyalty, and gratitude engendered by virtue and justice, which, though softer than those rough defences, would never­ theless establish his rule far more securely than they.", "4081": "Besides these considerations he urged that it was a sorry thing, and showed a want of proper ambition for a ruler to be splendidly dressed and luxuriously lodged, but yet to be no more intellectual in his conversa­ tion and arguments than any ordinary man, and to neglect to adorn the palace of his soul as became a king.", "4082": "XI.", "4083": "As Dion frequently urged these considerations, and quoted several of Plato's discourses, Dionysius became passionately desirous of seeing and conversing with Plato.", "4084": "Many letters were at once sent to Athens by Dionysius, while Plato also received many injunctions from Dion and from several of the Pythagorean philoso­ phers in Italy, bidding him go to Syracuse, undertake the guidance of the mind of this young and powerful ruler, and fill it with serious thoughts.", "4085": "Plato obeyed their invitation, chiefly, he tells us, because he feared to appear a mere man of words, unwilling to take in hand any real work, and also because he hoped that if he could purify the mind of the chief, he might through him influence for good the whole of the corrupt people of Sicily.", "4086": "The opponents of Dion, who feared the results of any change in the character of Dionysius, prevailed upon him to recall from exile Philistus, a man of intel­ lectual culture and an experienced courtier, in order to make use of him as a counterpoise to Plato and his philosophy.", "4087": "Indeed, Philistus had zealously assisted in the establishment of the despotism, and for a long time had acted as chief of the garrison of the citadel.", "4088": "There was also a report that he had been the favoured lover of the mother of the elder Dionysius, and that, too, not alto­ gether without the knowledge of the despot;", "4089": "for when Leptines, without telling Dionysius of it, gave Philistus for his wife one of the two daughters which had been born to him by a woman whom he had seduced while she was married to another man, and who afterwards lived with him, Dionysius was very angry, caused the wife of Leptines to be imprisoned in chains, and forced Philistus to leave Sicily and take refuge with some friends of his at Adria, where he is thought to have found leisure to write the greater part of his history;", "4090": "for he never re­ turned to Syracuse during the life of the elder Dionysius, but it was after that prince's death, as has been told, that the opposition to Dion brought him back as being a person more likely to agree with their views and more likely to support the monarchy.", "4091": "XII.", "4092": "Philistus on his return at once became closely connected with the monarchy;", "4093": "while Dion was assailed by misrepresentations and slanders reported by others to the despot, charging him with having discussed the extinction of despotism with Theodotes and Herakleides.", "4094": "Dion appears to have hoped by the influence of Plato to remove from Dionysius all the arbitrary harshness of a despot, and to make him into an orderly constitutional ruler.", "4095": "If he resisted, and refused to be thus softened and refined, Dion had determined to set him aside, and to restore to the Syracusans their free constitution;", "4096": "not that he was an admirer of democracy, but because he thought that at any rate it was better than a despotism for states which were not ruled by a wise and stable oligarchy.", "4097": "XIII.", "4098": "While affairs were in this posture, Plato arrived at Sicily and received a most kindly and magnificent welcome.", "4099": "One of the royal carriages, splendidly equipped, stood ready to receive him as he landed, and Dionysius offered sacrifice.", "4100": "as though some great good fortune had befallen his rule.", "4101": "The sobriety of the royal banquets, the refined tone of the court and the gentle manners of Dio­ nysius himself in transacting business, all inspired the Syracusans with great hope of a change for the better.", "4102": "It became the fashion to take interest in philosophical matters, and it is said that so many began to study geo­ metry that the palace was filled with the dust in which they drew their figures.", "4103": "In a few days' time a hereditary sacrifice was celebrated in the palace;", "4104": "and when the herald, according to custom, prayed that the despotism might remain unshaken for many years, it is said that Dionysius, who stood near him, exclaimed:", "4105": "“ Will you not cease from imprecating curses upon us?\"", "4106": "This greatly grieved the party of Philistus, who feared that Plato's power over Dionysius would become unassailable, if he were allowed time to become intimate with him, if after so short an acquaintance he had already wrought so great a change in the young man's ideas.", "4107": "XIV.", "4108": "They now no longer singly and in secret, but in a body openly assailed Dion, declaring that they could easily see through his motives in bewitching Dionysius with the eloquence of Plato, in order that Dionysius might be induced to voluntarily abdicate his throne, and hand it over to the children of Aristomache, whose uncle Dion was.", "4109": "Some of them even pretended to be angry that, though in former times a great Athenian naval and military force sailed thither and perished before it could effect the conquest of Syracuse, yet now the Athe­ nians should be able, by means of one single sophist, to destroy the throne of Dionysius, and persuade him to desert his ten thousand life-guards, leave his four hundred ships of war, his ten thousand cavalry and many thou­ sands more of infantry soldiers, in order to seek in the Academy for the ineffable good, and find real pleasure in geometry, leaving the pleasures of power, wealth and luxury to be enjoyed by Dion and Dion's nephews.", "4110": "This led at first to Dion's being regarded with suspicion, and then, when Dionysius began to show his dislike openly, he received a letter which Dion had secretly despatched to the Carthaginian commanders, warning them, when they came to treat for peace with Dionysius, not to con­ duct the interview without his being present, as he would see that the whole matter was permanently settled.", "4111": "We are told by Timæus that Dionysius, after reading this letter to Philistus and having taken counsel with him, deceived Dion by making false offers of reconciliation with him.", "4112": "After much friendly talk, he declared that their differences were at an end, and then, leading him alone towards the sea-shore under the walls of the citadel, showed him the letter, and upbraided him with plotting with the Carthaginians against himself.", "4113": "He would not listen to Dion when he tried to excuse himself, but at once placed him on board of a small vessel and ordered the sailors to land him on the coast of Italy.XV.", "4114": "Upon this, as Dionysius appeared to have acted very harshly, the whole palace was plunged in grief by the women, while the city of Syracuse became much ex­ cited, expecting that the exile of Dion and the mistrust with which others regarded the despot would soon lead to some revolution.", "4115": "Dionysius, perceiving and fearing this, encouraged the women and friends of Dion, speaking of Dion as though he were not banished, but had left the country of his own free will, for fear that if he remained at home his quick temper might betray him into some violent collision with himself.", "4116": "He placed two ships at the disposal of Dion's relatives, and bade them embark with as much of his property and servants as they pleased and go to rejoin him in Peloponnesus.", "4117": "Dion's property was very extensive, and his whole household was on a mag­ nificent, almost a royal, scale.", "4118": "Everything was now carried away by his friends, and much more was sent to him by his female relatives and his friends, so that his wealth and magnificence became famous throughout Greece, and the power of the despot became enhanced by the sight of the riches of the exile.", "4119": "XVI.", "4120": "Dionysius at once removed Plato into the citadel, where, under pretence of showing him kindly respect, he was kept in an honourable captivity, in order that he might not sail away with Dion, a witness of his unjust treatment.", "4121": "By degrees, like a wild animal who gradually becomes used to the touch of human beings, so Dionysius accustomed himself to the society and discourses of Plato, and, after the manner of despots, conceived a violent passion for him.", "4122": "He was especially anxious that Plato should return his affection and should approve of his acts, and was even willing to entrust the government and the crown itself to him if he would only not prefer Dion's friendship to his own.", "4123": "This passion of his caused great annoyance to Plato, for like all true lovers he was furiously jealous and had frequent quarrels and reconciliations with him, being very eager to hear his discourses, and engage in the study of philosophy, and yet being influenced by those who advised him to keep away from Plato, as he would be corrupted by his teaching.", "4124": "Meanwhile, as some war broke out, he sent Plato away, promising that in a year's time he would recall Dion.", "4125": "This promise he broke at once, but he remitted to Dion the revenues of his estate, and besought Plato to pardon his breach of faith about the time, because of the war;", "4126": "for, as soon as peace should be made, he promised that he would at once send for Dion.", "4127": "He also asked Plato to beg Dion to remain quiet, and not to engage in any revolutionary schemes, and not to traduce his character to the Greeks.", "4128": "XVII.", "4129": "Plato endeavoured to effect this, and turned Dion's attention to philosophy, and kept him in the Academy.", "4130": "Dion lived at this time in the city of Athens, in the house of Kallippus, one of his friends, though he also.", "4131": "bought an estate in the country for recreation, which, when he subsequently set sail for Sicily, he presented to Speusippus, who, of all the Athenians, was his most intimate friend.", "4132": "This intimacy was brought about by Plato, who hoped that the harshness of Dion's character might be somewhat softened by the society of a well- bred and cheerful man.", "4133": "Such a person as this was Speu­ sippus, whom we find spoken of in Timon's Silli as being \" good at a jest.\"", "4134": "When Plato himself exhibited a chorus of boys, Dion both trained the chorus and defrayed all the expenses, and Plato permitted him to gain this distinction although it was likely to obtain popularity for Dion at his own expense.", "4135": "Dion also visited other cities, where he asso­ ciated with the best and most statesmanlike of the citizens, and attended their solemn festivals, without ever betraying anything repulsive, affected, or imperious in his manner, but acting with manliness and discretion, and discoursing with elegance on philosophy as well as ordinary topics.", "4136": "By this conduct he everywhere gained good opinions, and public honours were decreed to him by various cities, The Lacedæmonians even adopted him as a Spartan, dis­ regarding the anger of Dionysius, though he at the time was zealously assisting them in a war against the Thebans.", "4137": "We are told that once Dion wished to see Ptoiodorus, of Megara, and went to his house.", "4138": "Ptoiodorus, it seems, was a rich and powerful man;", "4139": "and when Dion observed the crowds at his door and the busy throng and saw how hard it was to gain an audience of him, he turned to his friends, who were vexed at this, and said:", "4140": "\"", "4141": "Why should we find fault with this man ?", "4142": "for we our­ selves used to do just the same thing at Syracuse?\"XVIII.", "4143": "As time went on, Dionysius, feeling jealous of Dion, and fearing the popularity which he was obtaining among the Greeks, left off forwarding his revenues to him and confiscated his property.", "4144": "Being desirous of effacing the bad impression which he had made upon all philoso­ phers by his treatment of Plato, he collected round him many men who had a reputation for learning.", "4145": "As he wished to surpass them all in argument, he was forced to make use, often improperly, of what he had very imper­ fectly learned from Plato.", "4146": "He now again began to wish for Plato, and blamed himself for not having made use of him when he was present, and for not having listened to all his noble language.", "4147": "Frantic in his desires, and im­ patient to obtain whatever he wished, as despots are, he at once set his heart upon Plato and tried every means to attract him.", "4148": "He induced Archytas and the other succes­ sors of the original Pythagorean philosophers to invite Plato;", "4149": "for it was by means of Plato that Dionysius had at first become their friend.", "4150": "They sent Archedemus to Plato, and Dionysius also despatched a trireme and several of his friends to entreat Plato to come:", "4151": "while he himself wrote a letter in which he distinctly stated that Dion would never get his rights if Plato refused to come to Sicily, but that if he would, Dion should receive them all.", "4152": "Many letters also reached Dion from his sister and his wife, urging him to beg Plato to accede to the request of Dionysius, and not afford him grounds for ill-treating them.", "4153": "Thus,

to Diony­ sius, and again filled Sicily with great hopes;", "4157": "for all men prayed and were eager that Plato and philosophy should get the better of Philistus and despotism.", "4158": "He was treated with great respect by the ladies,.", "4159": "and received from Dionysius a mark of confidence which was accorded to no one else, in being allowed to come into his presence without his clothes being searched.", "4160": "As Dionysius fre­ quently offered valuable presents to Plato, who never would receive them, Aristippus of Cyrene, who was pre­ sent, observed that Dionysius exercised a very cheap generosity;", "4161": "for he gave small presents to himself and to others who wished for more, and offered great ones to Plato, who would not accept of any.", "4162": "When, however, after the first welcome was over, Plato began to speak of Dion, Dionysius at first put off discussing the subject, and subsequently reproaches and quarrels took place between them, of which no one else was aware, since Dionysius kept them secret, and by showing Plato assiduous atten­ tions and marks of respect tried to win him over from his friendship for Dion.", "4163": "Plato, too, at first would not publish what he knew of the treachery and falsehood of Dionysius, but affected not to perceive it and endured it in silence.", "4164": "While they were on these terms, though they believed that no one knew it, Helikon of Kyzikus, an intimate friend of Plato, foretold an eclipse of the sun;", "4165": "and as it happened according to his prediction, the despot was much impressed, and gave him a talent of silver.", "4166": "Aristippus now in joke said to the other philosophers that he too had a remarkable event to predict;", "4167": "and when they begged him to tell them what it was, he said, “ I predict that before long Plato and Dionysius will become foes.\"", "4168": "At last Dionysius sold Dion's property and kept the money, and even removed Plato from the lodgings in the gardens near his own palace, where he had hitherto dwelt, and quartered him among the mercenary troops, who had long disliked Plato and wished to make away with him, because they believed him to be counselling Dionysius to abdicate and to live without a body-guard.", "4169": "XX.", "4170": "Archytas and his friends, when they heard of the danger to which Plato was exposed, at once sent a thirty-oared vessel with an embassy to Dionysius, demand­ ing Plato from him, and alleging that he had originally come to Syracuse at their request, and that they were re­ sponsible for his safety.", "4171": "Dionysius concealed his dislike of Plato by feasting him and treating him kindly on his departure, but could not help saying to him, \"I suppose, Plato, you will abuse me terribly to your fellow-philoso­ phers,” or something to that effect.", "4172": "At this Plato smiled, and replied, \" I trust that we shall never be so ill off in the Academy for subjects to discuss, as for any one to make mention of you.\"", "4173": "Such, they say, were the terms upon which they parted;", "4174": "though this does not entirely agree with Plato's own account of the matter.", "4175": "XXI.", "4176": "Dion was much angered by these proceedings of Dionysius, and shortly afterwards was converted into an open enemy on hearing of the treatment of his wife, on which subject Plato wrote in enigmas to Dionysius.", "4177": "This happened as follows :", "4178": "-After the expulsion of Dion, Dio­ nysius, when he sent Plato away, bade him secretly make inquiries as to whether there was anything to prevent Dion's wife being bestowed upon another man;", "4179": "for there was a rumour, which may have been true or merely in­ vented by Dion's enemies, that the marriage had been forced upon Dion against his will, and that he and his wife had not lived happily together.", "4180": "Plato, as soon as lie arrived at Athens conversed freely with Dion, and then wrote a letter to the despot, some of which was clearly expressed, but which in one part intimated to him, in a manner which he alone could understand, that the writer had spoken about the matter to Dion, and that he would certainly be furious if Dionysius attempted anything of the kind.", "4181": "At that time, as there were still great hopes of arranging their quarrel, Dionysius did nothing further, but allowed his sister to remain living with her child by Dion.", "4182": "When, however, they became irreconcilable enemies and Plato, after his second visit, was sent away bitterly disliked by Dionysius, he proceeded to give Arete in marriage, sorely against her will, to one of his friends, named Timokrates, not imitating in this respect the gentle conduct of his father;", "4183": "for the elder Dionysius also had for an enemy Polyxenus the husband of his sister Theste.", "4184": "Polyxenus, fearing for his life, escaped from Syracuse and left Sicily.", "4185": "Upon this Dionysius sent for his sister and blamed her for having known of her hus­ band's intention to take flight, and not having told him of it;", "4186": "but she, undismayed, answered him fearlessly, \"Dionysius, do you think me so bad and cowardly a wife that, if I had known of the intention of my husband to flee, I should not have accompanied him ?", "4187": "Indeed, I did not know of it;", "4188": "for it would have been more creditable to me to have been spoken of as the wife of Polyxenus the exile than as the sister of Dionysius the despot.\"", "4189": "It is said that when Theste used this bold language the despot regarded her with admiration, and she was also so much admired by the people of Syracuse for her courage and goodness that after the fall of the dynasty they still con­ tinued to treat her with the honours due to royalty, and, when she died, all the citizens came in procession to her funeral.", "4190": "These circumstances have required a digression which is not without value.", "4191": "XXII.", "4192": "Dion after this at once prepared for war.", "4193": "Plato would take no part in his attempts, both out of respect for Dionysius and because of his own advanced age;", "4194": "but Speusippus and his other companions joined Dion, and encouraged him to set free Sicily, which they said was stretching out its hands to him for help and would eagerly welcome him.", "4195": "It seems, indeed, that when Plato was at Syracuse, Speusippus and his friends, who mixed more with the people, discovered their real feelings.", "4196": "At first they were afraid to speak plainly, fearing that the despot was ex­ perimenting upon them, but at length they took courage.", "4197": "All told the same story, begging and encouraging Dion to come, not with ships of war and horse and foot soldiers, but to embark in an open boat, and lend merely his person and his name to the Sicilians in their struggle against Diony.", "4198": "sius.", "4199": "Encouraged by these reports, which he received from Speusippus and his friends, Dion secretly levled a force of mercenaries, but not in his own name, and without disclosing his intention.", "4200": "Many statesmen and philosophers assisted him, among the later Eudemus of Cyprus, in whose honour, after his death, Aristotle composed his dialogue upon the soul, and Timonides of Leukas.", "4201": "They brought over to him also Miltas of Thessaly, a soothbayer and former student of the Academy.", "4202": "Yet, of all those men who had been banished by the despot, who were not less than a thousand in number, five-and-twenty alone took part in the expedition, and all the rest shrank from doing so.", "4203": "Their starting-point was the island of Zakynthus, where was assembled a force numbering less than eight hundred soldiers, all of whom, however, were men of dis­ tinction who had served in many great campaigns, and were in admirable bodily condition, and such bold and skilful warriors as would be able to excite and inspire with courage the multitude which Dion hoped would rally round him in Sicily.", "4204": "XXIII.", "4205": "These men, when they heard that the expedi­ tion was directed against Sicily and Dionysius, were at first scared and refused to go, declaring that only the frenzy excited by some personal quarrel, or the failure of all reasonable hopes of success, could have led Dion to embark upon such a desperate enterprise, and they were incensed with their own officers and those who had enlisted them for not having at the outset informed them of the object of the war.", "4206": "When, however, Dion addressed them, pointing out the rottenness of the monarchy, and informing them that he was taking them, not so much -as soldiers as in order to use them as leaders for the Syracusans and other peoples of Sicily, who had long been ripe for revolt, and when, after Dion's speech, Alkimenes, one of the expedition, who was one of the most celebrated of the Achaeans both by birth and merit, spoke to the same effect, they consented to go.", "4207": "The time was mid­ summer and the Etesian * winds were blowing over the sea.", "4208": "The moon was at the full.", "4209": "Dion prepared a mag­ nificent sacrifice to Apollo and marched in solemn proces­ sion to the temple with his soldiers, all arrayed in complete armour.", "4210": "After the sacrifice he feasted them in the stadium or race-course of the people of Zakynthus, where they had an opportunity of admiring the splendour of his gold and silver plate, and reflected that a man past middle life, as he was, and possessed of such wealth, would never attempt an extravagant enterprise without reasonable expectation of success, or unless his friends upon the spot had promised to furnish him with abundant resources.", "4211": "XXIV.", "4212": "Just after the libations - and customary prayers, the moon became eclipsed.", "4213": "Dion and his friends saw nothing remarkable in this, as they could calculate the periods of eclipses, and knew how the shadow was produced upon the moon by the interposition of the earth between it and the sun.", "4214": "As, however, the soldiers were alarmed at the portent and required some encouragement, Miltas the soothsayer came into the midst of them and addressed them, bidding them be of good cheer and expect the most complete success;", "4215": "for the gods, he declared, foretold by this sign that something brilliant would be extinguished.", "4216": "Now there was nothing more brilliant than the monarchy of Diunysius, whose light was fated to be quenched by them as soon as they arrived at Sicily.", "4217": "This interpretation Miltas told to them all;", "4218": "but when a swarm of bees was seen to settle on the sterns of the ships, he privately told Dion and his friends that he feared lest this might portend that at first they would be very properous, but that after blooming for a short time their prosperity would wither away.", "4219": "It is said, too, that many ominous signs were vouchsafed by Heaven to Dionysius.", "4220": "An eagle snatched up a spear from one of the life-guards, soared aloft with it, and let it fall into the sea;", "4221": "and one day the sea-water which washes the walls of the citadel became quite sweet and drinkable, so that all men noticed it.", "4222": "Swine also were born without ears, though perfect in all other parts.", "4223": "This was interpreted by the soothsayers to be a sign of insurrection and disobedience, and to mean that the people would no longer hearken to the commands of the despot, while the portent of the sea-water meant that after bitter miserie i sweet and pleasant times were in store for the people of Syracuse.", "4224": "The eagle, they said, is the servant of Zeu , and the spear is the symbol of power and sovereignty ;", "4225":

merchant-ships, which were accompanied by another small vessel and two galleys of thirty oars..", "4228": "Besides the arms carried by the soldiers, Dion took with him two thousan 1 shields, many spears and missiles, and sufficient provision a to supply them during the whole voyage, which was to be performed entirely under canvass and over the ope:", "4229": "i sea, because they feared to approach the land, and had learned that Philistus was cruising off the Iapygian Cape with a squadron to intercept them.", "4230": "Sailing with a light and gentle wind for twelve days, on the thirteenth they reached Pachynus, the southern extremity of Sicily.", "4231": "Here Protus their pilot bade them make haste to disembark, warning them that if they left the land and steered away from the cape, they would be obliged to spend many days and nights at sea during the summer season, when a southerly gale might be expected.", "4232": "Dion, however, feared to disembark so near his foes, and, wishing to land further away, sailed along the coast past Cape Pachynus.", "4233": "Here­ upon a violent northerly wind, accompanied by a high sea, drove the ships away from Sicily, while at the rising of Arcturus a storm of thunder and lightning burst upon them with furious rain.", "4234": "At this the sailors became dis­ mayed, and lost their reckoning, but suddenly found that the ships were being carried by the waves towards the rockiest and most precipitous cliffs of the island Kerkina,* off the coast of Libya.", "4235": "They narrowly escaped being dashed to pieces upon the rocks, but struggled along, keep­ ing themselves off the land with punting-poles,† until at length the storm abated and they learned from a vessel which they fell in with that they were near what are called the “ Heads \" of the Great Syrtis.", "4236": "It now fell calm and they became disheartened and quarrelled with one another;", "4237": "but soon'an off-shore wind sprang up from the south, though they, not expecting a southerly wind, could scarcely believe in the change.", "4238": "The wind gradually increased in force, and they, setting all the sail they were able, and commending themselves in prayer to the gods, crossed the open sea from Libya to Sicily before the wind.", "4239": "They made a quick passage, and on the fifth day came to an anchor at Minoa, a small city in that part of Sicily which -belonged to the Carthaginians.", "4240": "The Carthaginian com­ mander, Synalus, who was a friend of Dion, happened to be present in the town.", "4241": "Not knowing what the expedition was, or that Dion, was with it, he attempted to prevent the soldiers from landing;", "4242": "but they poured out of their ships fully armed, and though in accordance with Dion's order they killed no one, because of his friendship with the Carthaginian leader, yet they routed the Minoans, entered their city with the fugitives, and captured it.", "4243": "When the two chiefs met, they embraced one another, and Dion restored the city to Synalus without doing", "4244": "It any hurt, while Synalus showed hospitality to the soldiers and provided Dion with the supplies which he needed.", "4245": "XXVI.", "4246": "What specially encouraged them was the absence of Dionysius from Syracuse, although they had no hand in bringing it about;", "4247": "for he had just started on a voyage to the coast of Italy with a fleet of eighty ships.", "4248": "Although Dion begged his soldiers to wait and recruit their strength after the hardships of their long sea voyage, they would not remain there, but in their eagerness to seize this favourable opportunity bade Dion lead them to Syracuse.", "4249": "Dion now left behind his surplus arms and baggage at Minoa, and, begging Synalus to send them on to him when he should have need of them, set out on his march to Syracuse.", "4250": "On the road, he was first joined by two hundred horsemen, citizens of Agrigentum, dwelling near Eknomon.", "4251": "After these, some of the people of Gela also joined his army.", "4252": "The news of Dion's march soon reached Syracuse, and Timokrates, the husband of Dion's late wife, the sister of Dionysius, who was left in charge of the garrison, sent a messenger in great haste to Dionysius with a letter telling of Dion's arrival.", "4253": "He himself endeavoured to maintain order and put down all insurrections in the city, for all the people were excited at the news, but remained quiet as yet, through fear and doubt.", "4254": "Meantime a strange mis­ chance betel the bearer of the letter to Dionysius.", "4255": "He crossed the straits to Italy, passed through the city of Rhegium, and as he hurried on towards Kaulonia, where Dionysius was, he fell in with one of his friends, carrying a newly slaughtered victim.", "4256": "He was given a piece of meat by the man, and went on in haste.", "4257": "He walked some part of the night, but being forced by fatigue to take a little sleep, he lay down, just as he was, in a wood by the road­ side.", "4258": "While he slept, a wolf, attracted by the smell, snatched up the meat, which he had tied to his wallet, and ran off with it, carrying away with it the wallet in which the man had placed the letter.", "4259": "When the man woke and discovered his loss, after much vain searching, as he could not find it, he decided not to go to the despot without the letter, but to make off and keep out of the way.", "4260": "XXVII.", "4261": "In consequence of this Dionysius only heard of the war in Sicily much later and from other persons, and meanwhile Dion had been joined on his march by the people of Kamarina, and by a considerable number of the Syracusans who lived in the country.", "4262": "The Leontines and Campanians, who formed the garrison of Epipolæ, in consequence of Dion's sending them a false report that he intended to attack their city first, left Timokrates, and went away thither to defend their own property.", "4263": "When news of this reached Dion, who was encamped near Akræ, he aroused his soldiers while it was yet night and marched to the river Anapus, which is ten stadia distant from the city.", "4264": "There he halted and offered sacrifice beside the river, praying to the rising sun, and at the same time the soothsayers declared that the gods would give him the victory.", "4265": "Observing that Dion wore a garland because he was sacrificing, all those who were present at the sacrifice with one impulse crowned themselves with flowers.", "4266": "No less than five thousand men had joined him on his march.", "4267": "They were badly armed in a make-shift fashion, but their zeal supplied the deficiencies of their equipment, and when Dion led the way they all started at a run, shouting for joy, and encouraging one another to recover their freedom.", "4268": "XXVIII.", "4269": "Of the Syracusans within the walls, the chief men and upper classes in their most splendid raiment met Dion at the gates, while the populace attacked the friends of the despot, and seized upon the spies, a wicked and hateful class of men, who used to live among the people of the city and report their opinions and conversations to the despot.", "4270": "These men were the first to suffer for their crimes, as they were beaten to death by any of the citizens who fell in with them.", "4271": "Timokrates, unable to reach the garrison of the citadel, mounted his horse and rode away from the city, spreading alarm and confusion everywhere as he fled by exaggerating the numbers of Dion's army, that he might not be thought to have surrendered the city through fear to a small force.", "4272": "Meanwhile Dion could already be seen plainly, as he marched first of all his men, clad in splendid armour.", "4273": "On one side of him was his brother Megakles, and on the other the Athenian Kallippus, both crowned with garlands.", "4274": "Next marched a hundred of the mercenary soldiers, as a body-guard for Dion, while the rest of the men were led on by their officers in battle array.", "4275": "The entire procession was looked upon and welcomed as though it were sacred by the citizens of Syracuse, who, after forty-two years of tyranny, saw liberty and a popular constitution restored to their city.", "4276": "XXIX.", "4277": "When Dion had entered by the Temenitid* gate, he caused his trumpet to sound to obtain silence;", "4278": "and then a herald made proclamation that Dion and Me­ gakles were come to put down the monarchy, and that they set free from the despot both the Syracusans and the other Sicilian Greeks.", "4279": "As Dion wished to address the people in person, he pro­ ceeded through Achradina, while the Syracusans placed animals for sacrifice, tables and bowls of wine on each side of the street,† and each, as Dion passed them, strewed flowers in his path and addressed prayers to him as if to a god.", "4280": "In front of the citadel, with its Pentapyla, or Five Gates, stood a sundial, a conspicuous and lofty work, erected by Dionysius.", "4281": "Dion mounted upon this, and addressed the citizens, encouraging them to hold fast the freedom which they had obtained.", "4282": "The people, in joy and.", "4283": "gratitude to them, elected them both generals, with un­ limited powers, and at their earnest request chose twenty more as their colleagues, half of whom were taken from the exiles who had returned with Dion.", "4284": "The prophets considered it to be an excellent omen that Dion, while addressing the people, should have trodden under his feet the building which the despot had reared in his pride;", "4285": "but they augured ill from his having been chosen general while standing upon a sundial, lest his fortunes should soon experience some revolution.", "4286": "After this he captured Epipolæ, released the citizens who were imprisoned there and cut off the citadel by a palisade. ‡", "4287": "On the seventh day after this, Dionysius returned to the citadel by sea, and waggons arrived bringing to Dion the arms and armour which he had left with Synalus.", "4288": "These he distributed among the citizens, and of the others, each man equipped himself as well as he was able, and eagerly offered his services as a soldier.", "4289": "XXX.", "4290": "Dionysius at first sent ambassadors privately to Dion to endeavour to corrupt him.", "4291": "Afterwards, as Dion bade him speak openly to the people of Syracuse, who were now free, Dionysins through his ambassadors made them attractive offers of moderate taxation and moderate mili­ tary service, subject to their own vote of consent.-", "4292": "Thase proposals were scornfully rejected by the Syracusans.", "4293": "Dion told the ambassadors that he and his party could have no dealings with Dionysius unless he abdicated;", "4294": "but that if he did so, he himself, remembering their relation­ ship, would answer for his personal safety, and obtain as good terms for him as could be reasonably expected.", "4295": "These conditions were approved by Dionysius, who again sent ambassadors to demand that some of the Syracusans should come to the citadel and arrange the terms of the surrender upon a basis of mutual concessions.", "4296": "Com­ missioners, chosen by Dion, were at once sent to him, and a report spread from the citadel that Dionysius intended to abdicate and to make himself more popular even than Dion.", "4297": "However, the negotiations were all a trick of the despot to take the Syracusans at a disadvantage.", "4298": "He imprisoned the commissioners, and at daybreak, having excited his mercenary troops with wine, sent them at a run to attack the Syracusan wall across the isthmus.", "4299": "This attack was unexpected, and the foreign troops boldly and with loud shouts began to destroy the works and to attack the Syracusans.", "4300": "No one could withstand their onset except the mercenaries of Dion, who were the first to hear the noise of the conflict and to rush to the spot.", "4301": "But not even these men could perceive what was to be done or obey their orders, mixed up as they were with noisy crowds of panic-stricken Syracusan fugitives, before Dion, findii g that no one heeded his words, and wishing to show by his actions what ought to be done, was the first man to attack the foreigners.", "4302": "Round him a fierce and terrible battle took place, as he was recognised as well by the enemy as by his friends, and all ran towards him with shouts.", "4303": "He was, indeed, somewhat advanced in years to engage in such a furious combat, but yet stoutly and bravely withstood and repulsed all who attacked him.", "4304": "He received a wound in the hand from a spear, and had to rely upon his breastplate for protection against showers of darts and blows in close combat, for his shield was pierced through by many spears and lances.", "4305": "When these were broken he fell to the ground, but was snatched away by his soldiers.", "4306": "He appointed Timonides to take his place, and himself rode through the city on horseback, rallied the Syracusan fugitives, brought out the garrison of mercen­ aries from Achradina, and led these fresh and confident troops against the wearied foreigners, who had already begun to despair of victory.", "4307": "They had imagined that by their first attack they would be able to overrun the whole city, but having unexpectedly fallen in with men who could deal hard blows they began to retire towards the citadel.", "4308": "As they gave way the Greeks pressed upon them still more, until at length they were driven in confusion into the citadel, after killing seventy-four of Dion's party, and losing many of their own men.XXXI.", "4309": "After this glorious victory the Syracusans pre­ sented the mercenaries with a hundred minæ, and the mercenaries presented Dion with a golden crown.", "4310": "Heralds from Dionysius now came from the citadel bring­ ing letters to Dion from his female relatives.", "4311": "One of these bore the superscription “ From Hipparinus to his father for this was the name of Dion's son, although Timæus says that he was named Aretæus after his mother Arete.", "4312": "But I imagine we ought rather to believe Timonides in such matters as these, since he was a friend and comrade of Dion.", "4313": "The other letters, those from the women, which were full of piteous supplications, were read aloud to the Syracusans, but they were unwilling that the letter from the child should be opened before them.", "4314": "In spite of their opposition, Dion opened it and read it aloud.", "4315": "It was from Dionysius himself, addressed nominally to Dion, but really to the people of Syracuse, and though in it Dionysius seemed to appeal to Dion and to plead his own cause with him, yet in truth it was concocted with a view to render­ ing him suspected by the people ;", "4316": "for it contained allusions to his former zeal on behalf of the monarchy, and also threatened him through the persons of those dearest to him, his sister, his child and his wife.", "4317": "There were in the letter also pitiful entreaties, and what especially moved him to anger, supplications to him not to destroy the monarchy and set free a people which hated him and would turn and rend him, but to become despot himself, and thus to save his relatives and friends.", "4318": "XXXII.", "4319": "When these letters were read to them, the Syracusans, instead of admiring Dion for his magnani­ mity in adhering to the cause of honour and right, in spite of such touching appeals as these, they rather began to suspect him and to fear him, because he had such powerful reasons for sparing the despot, and they began to look around them for some other leader.", "4320": "They became particularly excited on hearing that Herakleides sailed into the harbour.", "4321": "This Herakleides was a Syra­ cusan exile, a military man who had gained a great repu­ tation by.", "4322": "the commands which he had held in the service of Dionysius and his father, but of an unsettled disposition, fickle and least of all to be relied upon when associated with a colleague in any command of dignity and honour.", "4323": "This man had quarrelled with Dion in Peloponnesus, and determined to make an expedition of his own to attack Dionysius.", "4324": "He now arrived at Syracuse with seven triremes and three other vessels,.", "4325": "and found Dionysius blockaded in his citadel and the people of Syracuse in an excited con­ dition.", "4326": "He at once received the popular favour, being naturally plausible and well able to impose upon a people who were fond of flattery.", "4327": "He was the more easily ena­ bled to do this, as the Syracusans were already disgusted with the haughty demeanour of Dion, which they consi­ dered to be offensive and unfit for a statesman, being themselves grown insubordinate and insolent after their victory and requiring a demagogue even before they had become a democracy.", "4328": "XXXIII.", "4329": "Their first act was to assemble of their own accord and elect Herakleides as admiral.", "4330": "When, however, Dion came forward and complained that the appointment of Herakleides was a revocation of the powers granted to himself, since he would no longer be general with un­ limited powers, if another commanded by sea, the Syra­ cusans, much against their will, annulled the election.", "4331": "After this Dion sent for Herakleides privately and, after bitterly reproaching him with his want of honour and right feeling in raising disputes about precedence during so momentous and dangerous a crisis, again assembled the people, appointed Herakleides admiral and prevailed upon the citizens to grant him a body-guard such as that by which he himself was attended.", "4332": "Herakleides now in words and in manner acknowledged Dion as his supe­ rior, obeyed his orders with humility, and owned that he owed him a debt of gratitude;", "4333": "but in secret he encou­ raged the people to revolt against him, stirred up tumults and brought Dion into a most difficult position;", "4334": "for if he were to permit Dionysius to retire from the citadel under a flag of truce, he feared that he should be reproached with sparing the despot and saving him from the fate he deserved, while, if he did not push the siege through a wish not to drive him to extremities, he would appear to be purposely protracting the war in order that he might the longer remain in power and have the people under his orders.", "4335": "XXXIV.", "4336": "There was one Sosis, a man who by villainy and audacity had gained a certain reputation at Syracuse, where the citizens thought that his licence in speech must be prompted by an excessive love of freedom.", "4337": "This man began to intrigue against Dion, and first of all rose in the assembly and violently abused the Syracusana for not perceiving that they had got a sober and vigilant despot instead of a drunken and imbecile one.", "4338": "After this, having avowed himself Dion's open enemy, he withdrew from the market-place and next day was seen running naked through the city with his face and head covered with blood, as though he were fleeing from some pursuers.", "4339": "Rushing into the market-place in this condition, he said that his life had been at tempted by Dion's mercenaries, and showed his wounded head to the people.", "4340": "He at once gained an audience of sympathisers, who became furious with Dion, and declared that he was acting shamefully and despotically in restraining the freedom of speech of the citizens by threats and murders.", "4341": "However, though a disorderly assembly took place, Dion was able to speak in his own defence, pointing out that a brother of Sosis was one of the guards of Dionysius, and that this man must have persuaded him to rebel and throw the city into confusion, since Dionysius could have no hope of safety except in the dissensions of the besiegers.", "4342": "At the same time the physicians examined the wound of Sosis, and found that it was the result of a superficial scratch rather than of a downward cut;", "4343": "for wounds by swordstrokes are deepest in the middle, because of the weight of the blow, while this wound of Sosis was shallow throughout all its length and had several beginnings, as probably he had been forced by the pain to leave off cutting his head and then had begun again.", "4344": "Some of the more respectable citizens also came to the assembly with a razor, and said that while they were walking they met Sosis covered with blood, saying that he was fleeing from Dion's mercenaries and had just been wounded by them.", "4345": "They at once pro­ ceeded to look for them, and found no man, but saw the razor hidden under a hollow stone at the place from which Sosis had been seen coming out.", "4346": "XXXV.", "4347": "Matters now began to look ill for Sosis;", "4348": "and when his slaves, after torture, declared that he left the house while it was yet night carrying a razor, Dion's accusers withdrew their charges against him, and the people became reconciled with Dion and condemned Sosis to death.", "4349": "Nevertheless, they viewed the mercenaries with suspicion, especially after the great battles which took place at sea, when Philistus came from Iapygla with many triremes to rescue Dionysius, upon which they imagined that the mercenaries, being heavy-infantry soldiers, would be of no further use in the war, and would soon become their enemies, as they were all seafaring people, whose strength lay in their ships.", "4350": "They were further excited by their success in a sea-fight, in which they defeated Philistus, and treated him with the utmost barbarity.", "4351": "Ephorus states that Philistus killed himself as soon as his ship was captured, but Timonides, who was present with Dion throughout the whole of these events, in a letter which he wrote to the philospher, Speusippus, informs him that Philistus was taken alive from his ship which ran ashore;", "4352": "and that the Syracusans first stripped him of his corslet and displayed him naked, jeering at him, he being then an old man;", "4353": "and that after this they cut off his head and gave up the body to the boys of the town, bidding them drag it through Achradina, and cast it into the stone quarries.", "4354": "Timæus declares that Philistus was treated with even greater indignity, his dead body being dragged by the boys through the city by the lame leg amidst the insults of all the people of Syracuse, who were pleased to see this treatment inflicted on the man who had told Dionysius that far from requiring a swift horse to escape from his throne, he ought to remain until he was dragged from it by the leg.", "4355": "Philistus, however, gave this advice to Dionysius, not as having been said by himself, but by some one else.", "4356": "XXXVI.", "4357": "Philistus doubtless laid himself open to blame by his zealous adherence to the cause of the monarchy, but Timæus takes advantage of this to satisfy his own spite by abusing him.", "4358": "It might, perhaps, be pardoned if those who had been wronged by him were so transported by rage as even to insult his senseless corpse;", "4359": "but a historian, writing an account of his actions in a later age, without having been in any way personally injured by him, ought to be restrained by feelings of honour and decency from taunting him with his misfortunes, which, indeed, might equally have befallen the best of men Neither does Ephorus show a sound judgment in praising Philistus, for, in spite of his skill in inventing good motives for evil conduct and actions, and the care with which his words are chosen, he cannot, with all his art, gloss over the fact that Philistus was devotedly attached to the cause of despotism, and that he, more than any one else, was dazzled and attracted by wealth, power, luxury and marriages with the daughters of absolute princes.", "4360": "A historian would show better taste than either of these by neither praising Philistus for his conduct nor reproaching him with his misfortunes.", "4361": "XXXVII.", "4362": "After the death of Philistus, Dionysius sent to Dion offering to deliver up to him the citadel, the arms which it contained, the mercenary troops and five months pay for them, and demanding to be allowed to retire un­ molested to Italy and live there, and also to receive the revenues of a large and fertile tract belonging to Syracuse called Gyarta, which extended from the sea-side to the interior of the island.", "4363": "Dion would not receive the embassy, but bade Dionysius address himself to the people of Syracuse;", "4364": "and they, hoping to take Dionysius alive, drove away his ambassadors.", "4365": "Dionysius now handed over the citadel to Apollokrates, his eldest son, and himself placed what persons and property he chiefly valued on board ship, waited for a fair wind, and then sailed away, eluding the vigilance of the admiral Herakleides.", "4366": "Herakleides was fiercely reproached by the citizens for his neglect, but suborned one of the popular speakers to make proposals to the people for a division of lands, point­ ing out that equality is the source of freedom, and that poverty reduces men to slavery.", "4367": "Herakleides spoke on the same side, openly opposed Dion, who led the opposite faction, and prevailed upon the Syracusans to agree to this proposal, and further to refuse to pay the mercenary troops and to rid themselves of the haughty arrogance of Dion by electing new generals.", "4368": "Thus, like a man who attempts to rise and walk when weakened by a long ill­ ness, the Syracusans, after ridding themselves of their des­ potism, at once tried to adopt the institutions of free peoples, and both failed in their undertakings and dis­ liked Dion, because he, like a careful physician, wished to impose a strict and temperate regimen upon them.", "4369": "XXXVIII.", "4370": "When they assembled to choose their new commanders the time was about midsummer, and ominous thunderstorms and portents took place for fifteen days in succession, dispersing the people and preventing their election of any other generals.", "4371": "When the popular leaders, by waiting and watching, had obtained a fair still day for the election of chief magistrates, a draught ox, who was quite tame and accustomed to crowds, but who was en­ raged with his driver, broke from his yoke and ran towards the theatre.", "4372": "He scattered the people in the greatest con­ fusion and panic, and ran on prancing and causing dis­ order through all that part of the city which afterwards fell into the hands of the enemy.", "4373": "Nevertheless, the Syra- CUBans disregarded this omen, and elected five-and-twenty generals, one of whom was Herakleides.", "4374": "They also made secret overtures to Dion's mercenaries, inviting them to desert, and offering them equal rights with the other citizens.", "4375": "They, however, would not listen to these pro­ posals, but faithfully and promptly got under arms, formed column with Dion in their midst, and began to march out of the city, without harming any one, but bitterly re­ proaching all whom they met with their ingratitude and wickedness.", "4376": "But the Syracusans, who despised them for their small numbers and for not having been the first to attack, had now collected in crowds, far outnumbering the mercenaries, and set upon them, expecting that in a street- fight they would easily be able to overpower them and to kill them all.", "4377": "XXXIX.", "4378": "In this terrible dilemma, as he was forced either to fight against his fellow-countrymen or to perish with his mercenaries, Dion stretched out his hands towards the Syracusans and implored them to desist, and pointed to the citadel, full of armed enemies, who were watching them from the battlements.", "4379": "As, however, the excited mob could not be turned from its purpose, for the speeches of the demagogues stirred up the people as the wind stirs up the waves of the sea, Dion ordered his troops not to charge them, but to march forward with a shout and martial clash of arms.", "4380": "At this none of the Syracusans stood their ground, but ran away along the streets un­ pursued;", "4381": "for Dion at once wheeled round his troops and marched away to Leontini.", "4382": "The new chiefs of the Syra­ cusans, ridiculed by the women, and wishing to wipe out their disgrace, now again got the citizens under arms and pursued Dion.", "4383": "They came up with him as he was crossing a stream, and rode up to his troops in skirmishing order.", "4384": "When, however, they perceived that Dion was no longer willing to deal gently and paternally with their follies, but that he angrily formed his troops in line and ordered them to attack, they fled more disgracefully than before back to their city, without losing many of their number.", "4385": "XL.", "4386": "The people of Leontini received Dion with especial honours, provided his troops with pay, and made them free of the city.", "4387": "They also sent ambassadors to the Syra­ cusans, calling upon them to do the soldiers justice;", "4388": "to which they replied by sending ambassadors to prefer charges against Dion.", "4389": "When, however, all the allies held a meeting at Leontini and discussed the matter, the Syracusans were held to be in fault.", "4390": "But the Syracusans refused to accept this decision, as they were now full of insolent importance, having no one to rule them, but being led by generals who were the merest slaves of the people.", "4391": "XLI.", "4392": "After this a fleet of triremes sent by Dionysius arrived at the city, under the command of Nypsius, a Neapolitan, with supplies of corn and money for the be­ sieged.", "4393": "In a sea-fight which took place the Syracusans were victorious, and took four of the ships, but were so elated by their victory, and, having none to rule them, celebrated their success with such reckless excesses of drinking and feasting, that while they imagined they had taken the citadel they really lost the city as well;", "4394": "for Nypsius, observing that discipline was everywhere at an end, as the populace were engaged in drinking to the sound of music from daylight until late at night, and that the generals were delighted at the festivity and were ---in­ willing to summon the drunken men to their duty, seized his opportunity and attacked the Syracusan wall of in­ vestment.", "4395": "His attack succeeded;", "4396": "he broke through the works, and at once let loose his foreign mercenaries, bidding them deal as they pleased with all whom they met.", "4397": "The Syracusans, though they soon learned their misfor­ tune, yet were slow to assemble, being taken by surprise;", "4398": "( for the city was being sacked, the men slaughtered, the walls thrown down and the women and children being forced weeping into the citadel, while the generals gave up all for lost, and could make no use of the citizens, who were everywhere confusedly mixed up with the enemy.", "4399": "XLII.", "4400": "While the city was in this condition, and the danger began to menace Achradina also, all men thought of him who was their last and only hope, but no one spoke of Dion, as they were all ashamed of the folly and in­ gratitude with which they had treated him.", "4401": "Sheer neces­ sity, however, forced some of the auxiliary troops and the knights* to cry out that they must send for Dion and his Peloponnesians from Leontini.", "4402": "As soon as any were found bold enough to raise this cry, the Syracusans shouted aloud, and rejoiced with tears, for they prayed that Dion would come, they longed to see him, and they remembered his courage and strength in time of danger, in which he not only remained calm and unmoved, but gave them confidence by his demeanour and caused them fearlessly and bravely to attack their enemies.", "4403": "They therefore at once sent off to him Archonides and Telesides, as repre­ sentatives of the allies, and Hellanikus, with four others, of the knights.", "4404": "These men rode at full gallop to Leontini, arriving there late in the afternoon.", "4405": "When they dis­ mounted, the first person they met was Dion, and with tears in their eyes they told him of the misfortunes which had befallen the Syracusans.", "4406": "Soon some of the citizens of Leontini fell in with them, and many of the Peloponnesians gathered round Dion, suspecting from the earnest and supplicatory tones and gestures of the ambassadors that something important had happened.", "4407": "Dion at once led the way to the public assembly, where all the people soon met together.", "4408": "Archonides and Hellanikus in a few words informed them of the great misfortune which had befallen the Syracusans, and besought the stranger mercenaries to help them and Lot to bear malice for the treatment which they had received, since the Syracusans had been more terribly punished for their misconduct than even the soldiers could have wished them to be.", "4409": "XLIII.", "4410": "After they had ceased speaking, there was a great silence;", "4411": "and when Dion rose and began to speak, tears choked his utterance.", "4412": "The Peloponnesians en­ couraged him, and showed sympathy with him, and at length he mastered his emotion and said :", "4413": "“Men of Pelo­ ponnesus and Allies, I have assembled you here to de­ liberate about your own affairs.", "4414": "As for myself, I cannot with honour deliberate while Syracuse is being destroyed, but if I cannot save my country, I will share her ruin and make her flames my own funeral pyre.", "4415": "As for you, if you can bring yourselves even now, after all that has passed, to help us, the most ill-advised and the most ill-fated of men, restore again by your own means alone the city of Syracuse.", "4416": "But if you hate the Syracusans and reject their appeal, then may you be rewarded by heaven for your former brave conduct and loyalty to me, and may you remember Dion, who would not desert you when you were wronged, and would not afterwards desert his fellow- countrymen when they were in trouble.\"", "4417": "While Dion was still speaking, the Peloponnesians leaped up with a shout, bidding him lead them as quickly as possible to the rescue, and the ambassadors from Syracuse embraced him, calling upon heavan to bless both him and the troops.", "4418": "When order was restored, Dion immediately began to prepare for the march, and ordered his men to go and eat their dinners at once, and then to assemble under arms in that very place;", "4419": "for he intended to march to Syracuse by night.", "4420": "XLIV.", "4421": "Meanwhile at Syracuse the generals of Dionysius worked great ruin in the city while it was day, but when darkness came on retired into the citadel, having lost but few men.", "4422": "The popular leaders now took courage, and, expecting that the enemy would attempt nothing further, again called upon the people to have nothing to do with Dion, and, if he came with his foreign troops, not to admit him into the city and own themselves inferior to his men in courage, but to reconquer their city and their liberty by their own exertions.", "4423": "More embassies were now sent to Dion, from the generals dissuading him from coming, and from the knights and leading citizens entreating him to come quickly.", "4424": "This caused him to march more slowly, yet with greater determination.", "4425": "When day broke, the party opposed to Dion occupied the gates, in order to shut him out of the city, while Nypsius a second time led out the mercenaries from the citadel, in greater numbers and far more confident than before.", "4426": "He at once levelled to the ground the whole of the works by which the citadel was cut off from the main land, and overran and pillaged the city.", "4427": "No longer men alone, but even women and children were slaughtered, and property of every kind mercilessly destroyed;", "4428": "for Dionysius, who now despaired of ultimate success, and bitterly hated the Syracusans, wished only, as it were, to bury the monarchy in the ruins of the city.", "4429": "In order to effect their purpose before Dion could come tc the rescue, the soldiers destroyed the houses in the quickest way by setting them on fire, using torches for those near at hand, and shooting fiery arrows to those at a distance.", "4430": "As the Syracusans fled from their burning dwellings, some were caught and butchered in the streets, while others who took refuge in the houses perished in the flames, as now a large number of houses were burning, and kept falling upon the passers by.", "4431": "XLV.", "4432": "This misfortune more than anything else caused all to be unanimous in opening the gates to Dion.", "4433": "He had been marching slowly, as he heard that the enemy were shut up in the citadel;", "4434": "but as the day went on, at first some of the knights rode up to him and told him of the second occupation of the city;", "4435": "and afterwards some even of the opposite faction arrived and begged him to hasten his march.", "4436": "As the danger became more pressing, Hera­ kleides sent first his brother, and afterwards his uncle Theodotus, to beseech Dion to assist them, and to tell him that no one any longer could offer any resistance, that Herakleides himself was wounded, and that the whole city was within a little of being totally ruined and burned.", "4437": "When these messages reached Dion he was still sixty stadia distant from the gates of Syracuse.", "4438": "He explained to his troops the danger the city was in, spoke some words of encouragement to them, and then led them on, no longer at a walk, but at a run, while messenger after messenger continued to meet them and urge them to haste.", "4439": "At the head of his mercenaries, who displayed extraordinary speed and spirit, Dion made his way through the gates of Syracuse to the place called Hekatompedon.", "4440": "He at once sent his light-armed troops to attack the enemy, and to encourage the Syracusans by their presence, while he himself formed his own heavy infantry, and those of the citizens who rallied round him in separate columns under several commanders, in order to create greater terror by attacking the enemy at many points at once.", "4441": "XLVI.", "4442": "When, after making these preparations, and offering prayer to the gods, he was beheld leading his troops through the city to attack the enemy, the Syracusans raised a shout of joy, with a confused murmur of prayers, entreaties and congratulations, addressing Dion as their saviour and their tutelary god, and calling the foreign soldiers their brethren and fellow-citizens.", "4443": "All of them, even the most selfish and cowardly, now appeared to hold Dion's life dearer than his own or that of his fellow-citizens, as they saw him lead the way to danger through blood and fire, and over the corpses which lay in heaps in the streets.", "4444": "The enemy, too, presented a formidable appearance, for they were exasperated to fury, and had established themselves in a strong position, hard even to approach, amidst the ruins of the rampart by which the citadel had been cut off from the town ;", "4445": "while the progress of the mercenary troops was rendered difficult and dangerous by the flames of the burning houses by which they were surrounded.", "4446": "They were forced to leap over heaps of blazing beams, and to run from under great masses of falling ruins, struggling forwards through thick smoke and choking dust, and yet striving to keep their ranks unbroken.", "4447": "When at length they reached the enemy, only a few could fight on either side, because of the narrowness of the path, but the Syracusans, pushing confidently forward with loud shouts, forced the troops of Nypsius to give way.", "4448": "Most of them escaped into the citadel, which was close at hand :", "4449": "but all the stragglers who were left outside, were pursued and put to death by the Peloponnesians.", "4450": "The Syracusans could not spare any time to enjoy their victory and to congratulate one another after such great successes, but betook themselves at once to extinguishing their burning houses, and with great exertions put out the fire during the night.", "4451": "XLVII.", "4452": "As soon as day broke, all the popular leaders, conscious of their guilt, left the city, with the exception of Herakleides and Theodotus, who went of their own accord and delivered themselves up to Dion, admitting that they had done wrong, and begging that he would treat them better than they had treated him.", "4453": "They pointed out, also, how much he would enhance the lustre of his other incomparable virtues by showing himself superior even in the matter of temper to those by whom he had been wronged, who now came before him admitting that in their rivalry with him they had been overcome by his virtue.", "4454": "When Herakleides and his companion thus threw themselves upon the mercy of Dion, his friends advised him not to spare such envious and malignant wretches, but to deliver up Herakleides to his soldiers, and thus to put an end to mob rule, an evil quite as pestilent as despotism itself.", "4455": "Dion, however, calmed their anger, observing that other generals spent most of their time in practising war and the use of arms;", "4456": "but that he, during his long sojourn in the Academy, had learned to subdue his passions, and to show himself superior to jealousy of his rivals.", "4457": "True greatness of mind, he said, could be better shown by forgiving those by whom one has been wronged, than by doing good to one's friends and bene­ factors ;", "4458": "and he desired not so much to excel Herakleides in power and generalship, as in clemency and justice, the only qualities which are truly good:", "4459": "for our successes in War, even if won by ourselves alone, yet can only be won by the aid of Fortune.", "4460": "“If,\" he continued, \" Herakleides be jealous, treacherous and base, that is no reason for Dion to stain his glory by yielding to his anger;", "4461": "for though to revenge a wrong is held to be less culpable than to commit one, yet both alike spring from the weakness of human nature:", "4462": "while even though a man be wicked, yet he is seldom so hopelessly depraved as not to be touched by one who repeatedly returns good for evil.\"", "4463": "XLVIIL After expressing himself thus, Dion released Herakleides.", "4464": "He next turned his attention to the fortifi­ cation by which the citadel was cut off, and ordered each Syracusan to cut a stake and bring it to the spot.", "4465": "He allowed the citizens to rest during the night, but kept his mercenary soldiers at work, and by the next morning had completed the palisade, so that both the enemy and his own countrymen were astonished at the speed with which he had accomplished so great a work.", "4466": "He now buried the corpses of those citizens who had fallen in the battle, ransomed the prisoners, who amounted to no less than two thousand, and summoned an assembly, in which Herakleides proposed that Dion should be appointed absolute commander by land and by sea.", "4467": "All the better citizens approved of this, and wished it to be put to the vote, but it was thrown out by the interference of the mob of sailors and people of the lower classes, who were sorry that Herakleides had lost his post as admiral, and who thought that, although he might be worthless in all other respects, he was at any rate more of a friend to the people than Dion, and more easily managed by them.", "4468": "Dion con­ ceded so much to them as to give Herakleides command of the fleet, but vexed them much by opposing their plans for a redistribution of land and houses, and by declaring void all that they had decided upon this subject.", "4469": "In con­ sequence of this Herakleides, who at once entered upon his office of admiral, sailed to Messenia, and there by his harangues excited the sailors and soldiers under his command to mutiny against Dion, who, he declared, intended to make himself despot of Syracuse;", "4470": "while he, in the meanwhile, entered upon negotiations with Dionysius by means of the Spartan Pharax.", "4471": "When this was dis­ covered by the Syracusan nobility, a violent quarrel arose in his camp, which led to the people of Syracuse being reduced to great want and scarcity, so that Dion was at his wit's end, and was bitterly reproached by his friends for having placed such an unmanageable and villainous rival as Herakleides in possession of power which he used against his benefactor.", "4472": "XLIX.", "4473": "Pharax was now encamped at Neapolis, in the territory of Agrigentum, and Dion, who led out the Syracusans to oppose him, wished to defer an engagement;", "4474": "but Herakleides and the sailors overwhelmed him with their clamour, saying that he did not wish to bring the war to an end by a battle, but to keep it constantly going on in order that he might remain the longer in command.", "4475": "He therefore fought and was beaten.", "4476": "The defeat was not a disastrous one, but was due more to the confusion pro­ duced by the quarrels of his own men than to the enemy.", "4477": "Dion therefore prepared to renew the engagement, drew out his men in battle array, and addressed them in en­ couraging terms.", "4478": "Towards evening, however, he heard that Herakleides had weighed anchor and sailed away to Syracuse with the fleet, with the intention of seizing the city and shutting its gates against Dion and the army.", "4479": "Dion at once took the strongest and bravest men with him, and rode all night, reaching the gates of Syracuse about the third hour of the next day, after a journey of seven hundred stadia.", "4480": "Herakleides, who in spite of the exer­ tions of his fleet was beaten in the race, was at a loss what to do, and sailed away aimlessly.", "4481": "He chanced to fall in with the Spartan Gæsylus, who informed him that he was coming from Lacedæmon to take command of the Sicilian Greeks, as Gylippus had done in former times.", "4482": "Hera­ kleides was delighted at having met this man, and displayed him to his troops, boasting that he had found a counterpoise to the power of Dion.", "4483": "He at once sent a herald to Syracuse, and ordered the citizens to receive the Spartan as their ruler.", "4484": "When Dion answered that the Syracusans had rulers enough, and that in case they should require a Spartan to command them, he himself was a Spartan by adoption, Gæsylus gave up all claims to com­ mand, but went to Dion and reconciled Herakleides to him, making Herakleides swear the greatest oaths and give the strongest pledges for his future good behaviour, while Gæsylus himself swore that he would avenge Dion and punish Herakleides in case the latter should misconduct himself.", "4485": "L.", "4486": "After this the Syracusans disbanded their navy, which was quite useless;", "4487": "besides being very expensive to the crews, and giving opportunities for the formation of plots against the government;", "4488": "but they continued the siege of the citadel, and thoroughly completed the wall across the isthmus.", "4489": "As no assistance arrived for the besieged, while their provisions began to fail, and their troops became inclined to mutiny, the son of Dionysius despaired of success, arranged terms of capitulation with Dion, handed over the citadel to him together with all the arms and other war material which it contained, and himself, taking his mother and sisters and their property on board of five triremes, sailed away to his father.", "4490": "Dion permitted him to leave in safety, and his departure was witnessed by every one of the Syracusans, who even called upon the names of those who were absent, and were unable to see this day when the sun rose upon a free Syracuse.", "4491": "Indeed the downfall of Dionysius is one of the most remarkable instances of the vicissitudes of fortune known in history;", "4492": "and what then must we suppose was the joy and pride of the Syracusans, when they reflected that with such slender means they had overthrown the most powerful dynasty at that time existing in the world ?", "4493": "LI.", "4494": "After Apollokrates had sailed away and Dion had entered the citadel, the women could endure no longer to wait indoors till he came to them, but ran to the gates, Aristomache leading Dion's son, and Arete following behind her in tears, and at a loss to know how she should greet her husband after she had been married to an­ other.", "4495": "After Dion had embraced his sister and his child, Aristomache led Arete forward, and said, “Dion, we were unhappy while you were an exile;", "4496": "but now that you have returned and conquered you have taken away our reproach from all but Arete here, whom I have had the misery to see forced to accept another husband while you were yet alive.", "4497": "Now, therefore, since fortune has placed us in your power, how do you propose to settle this difficulty ?", "4498": "Is she to embrace you as her uncle or as her husband also ? \"", "4499": "Dion shed tears at these words of Aristomache, and affectionately embraced his wife.", "4500": "He placed his son in her hands, and bade her go to his own house, where he himself also continued to live;", "4501": "for he delivered up the citadel to the people of Syracuse.", "4502": "LII.", "4503": "After he had thus accomplished his enterprise, he reaped no advantage from his success, except that he con­ ferred favours on his friends and rewarded his allies;", "4504": "while he bestowed upon his own companions, both Syra.", "4505": "cusan and Peloponnesian, such signal marks of his grati­ tude that his generosity even outran his means.", "4506": "He himself continued to live simply and frugally, while not only Sicily and Carthage, but all Greece viewed with admiration the manner in which he bore his prosperity, considering his achievements to be the greatest, and himself to be the most splendid instance of successful daring known to that age.", "4507": "He remained as modest in his dress, his household, and his table, as though he were still the guest of Plato in the Academy, and not living among mercenary soldiers, who recompense themselves for the hardships and dangers of their lives by daily indul­ gence in sensual pleasures.", "4508": "Plato wrote a letter to him, in which he informed him that the eyes of all the world were fixed upon him;", "4509": "but Plato probably only alluded to one place in one city, namely the Academy, and meant that the critics and judges of Dion therein assembled did not admire his exertions or his victory, but only considered whether he bore himself discreetly and modestly in his success, and showed moderation now that he was all-powerful, Dion made a point of maintaining the same haughty de­ meanour in society, and of treating the people with the same severity as before, although the times demanded that he should unbend, and though Plato, as we have said before, wrote to him bidding him remember that an arrogant temper is the consort of a lonely life.", "4510": "However, Dion appears to have been naturally inclined to harshness, and besides was desirous of reforming the manners of the Syracusans, who were excessively licentious and corrupt.", "4511": "LIII.", "4512": "Now Herakleides again opposed him.", "4513": "When Dion sent for him to attend at the council, he refused to come, declaring that he was a mere private man, and would go only to the public assembly with the other citizens.", "4514": "Next he reproached Dion for not having de­ molished the citadel, for having restrained the people when they wished to break open the tomb of Dionysius (the elder) and cast out his body, and for having insulted his own fellow-countrymen by sending to Corinth for coun­ sellors and colleagues.", "4515": "Indeed, Dion had sent to Corinth for some commissioners from that city, hoping that their presence would assist him in effecting the reforms which he meditated.", "4516": "Like Plato, he regarded a pure democracy as not being a government at all, but rather a warehouse of all forms of government:", "4517": "and his intention was to establish a constitution, somewhat on the Lacedæmonian or Cretan model, by a judicious combination of monarchy and oligarchy:", "4518": "and he saw that the government of Corinth was more of an oligarchy than a democracy, and that few important measures were submitted to the people.", "4519": "As Dion expected that Herakleides would most vehemently oppose these projects, and was moreover a turbulent, fickle, and facetious personage, he gave him up to those who had long before desired to kill him, but whom he had formerly restrained from doing so.", "4520": "These men broke into the house of Herakleides and killed him.", "4521": "The Syracusans were deeply grieved at his death;", "4522": "yet, as Dion gave him a splendid funeral, followed the corpse at the head of his army, and afterwards made a speech to the people, they forgave him, reflecting that their city could never have obtained rest while Dion and Herakleides were both engaged in political life.", "4523": "LIV.", "4524": "One of Dion's companions was an Athenian named Kallippus, who, we are told by Plato, became intimate with him, not because of his learning, but because he happened to have initiated Dion into some religious mysteries.", "4525": "This man took part in Dion's expedition, and received especial honours, being the first of all Dion's comrades who marched into Syracuse with him, wearing a garland on his head, and he had always distinguished himself in the combats which took place since that time.", "4526": "Now, seeing that the noblest and best of Dion's friends had fallen in the war, and that by the death of Herakleides the Syracusan people were deprived of their leader, while he had greater influence than any one else with Dion's mercenary soldiers, Kallippus conceived a scheme of detest­ able villainy.", "4527": "No doubt he hoped to obtain the whole of Sicily as his reward for murdering Dion, though some writers state that he received a bribe of twenty talents from Dion's personal enemies.", "4528": "He now drew several of the mercenary soldiers into a conspiracy against Dion, conducting his plot in a most ingenious and treacherous manner.", "4529": "He was in the habit of informing Dion of any treasonable speeches, whether true or invented by himself, which he said that he had heard from the mercenary troops, and by this means gained such entire confidence with him, that he was able to hold secret meetings and plot against Dion with whichever of the soldiers he pleased, having Dion's express command to do so, in order that none of the disaffected party might escape his notice.", "4530": "By this means Kallippus was easily enabled to find out all the worst and most discontented of the mercenaries, and to organise a conspiracy amongst them;", "4531": "while, if any man refused to listen to his proposals and denounced him to Dion, he took no heed of it and showed no anger, believing that Kallippus was merely carrying out his own instructions.", "4532": "LV.", "4533": "When the plot was formed, Dion beheld a great and portentous vision.", "4534": "Late in the evening he was sitting alone in the hall * of his house, plunged in thought.", "4535": "Sud­ denly he heard a noise on the other side of the court, and, looking up, as it was not quite dark, saw a tall woman, with the face and dress of a Fury as represented upon the stage, sweeping the house with a kind of broom.", "4536": "He was terribly startled, and became so much alarmed that he sent for his friends, described the vision to them, and be­ sought them to remain with him during the night, as he was beside himself with fright, and dreaded lest if he were alone the apparition might return.", "4537": "This, however, did not take place.", "4538": "A few days after this his son, now almost grown up, took offence at some trifling affront, and destroyed himself by throwing himself headlong from the roof of the house.", "4539": "LVI.", "4540": "While Dion was thus alarmed and distressed, Kal­ lippus all the more eagerly carried out his plot.", "4541": "He spread a rumour among the Syracusans that Dion, being childless, had determined to recall Apollokrates, the son of Diony­ sins, and to make him his heir, since he was his wife'is nephew, and his sister's grandson.", "4542": "By this time Dion and the women of his household began to entertain some suspicion of the plot, and information of it reached them from all quarters.", "4543": "Dion, however, grieved at the murder of Herakleides, as though that crime had stained his glory, had become low-spirited and miserable, and frequently said that he was willing to die, and would let any man cut his throat, if he were obliged to live amidst constant precautions against his friends as well as his enemies.", "4544": "Kallippus, who perceived that the women had discovered the whole plot, came to them in great alarm, denying that he bad any share in it, shedding tears, and offering to give any pledge of his loyalty which they chose to ask for.", "4545": "They demanded that he should swear the great oath, which is as follows :", "4546": "-The person who is about to swear enters the precinct of the temple of Demeter and Perse­ phone, and after certain religious ceremonies puts on the purple robe of the goddess Persephone, and swears, hold­ ing a lighted torch in his hand.", "4547": "All this was done by Kallippus, and after swearing the oath he was impious enough to wait for the festival of the goddess whose name he had taken in vain, and to commit the murder on the day which was specially dedicated to her, although, perhaps, he thought nothing about the profanation of that particu­ lar day, but considered that it would be wickedness enough to murder the man whom he had himself initiated into the mysteries, on whatever day he might do it.", "4548": "LVII.", "4549": "Many were now in the plot;", "4550": "and when Dion was sitting with his friends in a room furnished with several couches, some of the conspirators surrounded the house, while others stood at the doors and windows.", "4551": "Those who intended to do the deed were Zakynthians, and entered the house in their tunics, without swords.", "4552": "Those who remained outside made fast the doors, while those within rushed upon Dion, and endeavoured to strangle him.", "4553": "As, however, they could not accomplish this, they asked for a sword;", "4554": "but no one ventured to open the doors, because within the house were many of Dion's friends, but as each of these imagined that, if he gave up Dion, he himself might get away safe, no one would help him.", "4555": "After some delay, a Syracusan, named Lykon, handed a dagger through a window to the Zakynthians, with which, as if sacrificing a victim, they cut the throat of Dion, who bad long before been overpowered and had given himself up for lost.", "4556": "His sister and his wife, who was pregnant, were at once cast into prison, where the unhappy woman was delivered of a male child.", "4557": "The women prevailed upon the keepers of the prison to spare the child's life, and obtained their request the more readily because Kallippus was already in difficulties.", "4558": "LVIII.", "4559": "After Kallippus had murdered Dion, he at once became a person of importance, and had the entire govern­ ment of Syracuse in his hands.", "4560": "He even sent despatches to Athens, a city which, next to the gods, he ought espe­ cially to have dreaded, after having brought such pollu­ tion and sacrilege upon himself.", "4561": "However, the saying appears to be true, that that city produces both the best of good and the worst of wicked men, just as the territory of Athens produces both the sweetest honey and the most poisonous hemlock.", "4562": "Kallippus did not long survive to mock the justice of heaven, lest the gods might have been thought to disregard a man who, by such a crime, had obtained so great wealth and power;", "4563": "but he soon paid the penalty of his wickedness.", "4564": "He set out to capture Katana, and in doing so lost Syracuse;", "4565": "upon which he is said to have remarked, that he had lost a city and gained a cheese-scraper.", "4566": "In an attack upon Messenia he lost most of his soldiers, among whom were the murderers of Dion.", "4567": "As no city in Sicily would receive him, but all hated him and attacked him, he proceeded to Rhegium, where, as ho was quite ruined and could no longer maintain his mercenary soldiers, he was murdered by Leptines and Polyperchon, who chanced to use the self-same dagger with which Dion is said to have been slain.", "4568": "It was recog­ nised by being very short, after the Laconian fashion, and by its workmanship, for it was admirably carved with figures in high relief.", "4569": "Such was the retribution which betel Kallippus;", "4570": "while Aristomache and Arete, when they were released from prison, fell into the power of Hiketes, a Syracusan, who had been one of Dion's friends, and who treated them at first loyally and honourably, but after­ wards, at the instigation of some of the enemies of Dion, sent them on board of a ship, on the pretext of sending them to Peloponnesus, and gave orders to the people of the ship to put them to death and throw their bodies into the sea.", "4571": "They, however, are said to have thrown them alive into the sea, and the child with them.", "4572": "This man also paid a fitting penalty for his crimes, for he was taken and put to death by Timoleon, and the Syracusans put to death his two daughters to avenge the murder of Dion.", "4573": "All of this I have already described at length in the Life of Timoleon.", "4574": "I.", "4575": "The ancestor of Marcus Brutus was Junius Brutus,* whose statue of bronze the Romans of old set up in the Capitol, in the midst of the kings, with a drawn sword in his hand, thereby signifying that it was he who completely accomplished the putting down of the Tarquinii.", "4576": "Now that Brutus, like swords forged of cold iron, having a temper naturally hard and not softened by education, was carried on even to slaying of his sons through his passion against the tyrants:", "4577": "but this Brutus, about whom I am now writing, having tempered his natural disposition with discipline and philosophical training and roused his earnest and mild character by impulse to action, is considered to have been most aptly fashioned to virtue, so that even those who were his enemies on account of the conspiracy against Cæsar, attributed to Brutus whatever of good the act brought with it, and the worst of what happened they imputed to Cassius, who was a kinsman and friend of Brutus, but in his disposition not so simple and pure.", "4578": "His mother Servilia t traced her descent from Ala Servilius,* who when Mallius Spurius was contriving to establish a tyranny and was stirring up the people, put a dagger under his arm, and going into the Forum and taking his stand close to the man, as if he were going to have something to do with him and to address him, struck him as he bent forwards and killed him.", "4579": "Now this is agreed on;", "4580": "but those who showed hatred and enmity towards Brutus on account of Caesar's death, say that on the father's side he was not descended from the expeller of the Tarquinii, for that Brutus after putting his sons to death left no descendants, but this Brutus was a plebeian, the son of one Brutus who was a bailiff, † and had only recently attained to a magistracy.", "4581": "Poseidonius the philosopher says that the sons of Brutus, who had arrived at man's estate, were put to death as the story is told, but there was left a third, an infant, from whom the race of Brutus descended;", "4582": "and that some of the illustrious men of his time who be­ longed to the family showed a personal resemblance to the statue of Brutus.", "4583": "So much about this.", "4584": "II.", "4585": "Servilia the mother of Brutus was a sister of Cato the philosopher, whom most of all the Romans this Brutus took for his model, Cato being his uncle and afterwards his father-in-law.", "4586": "As to the Greek philosophers, there was not one, so to say, whom he did not hear or to whom he was averse, but he devoted himself especially to those of Plato's school The Academy ‡ called the Now and the Middle he was not much disposed to, and he attached himself to the Old, and continued to be an admirer of Antiochus § of Ascalon;", "4587": "but for his friend and companion he chose Antiochus's brother Aristus, a man who in his manner of discourse was inferior to many philosophers, but in well­ regulated habits and mildness a rival to the first.", "4588": "Empylus,∥ whom both Brutus in his letters and his friends often mentioned as being in intimacy with him, was a rhetorician and left a small work, though not a mean one, on the assassination of Cæsar, which is inscribed Brutus.", "4589": "In the Latin language Brutus was sufficiently trained for oratory * and the contests of the forum;", "4590": "but in the

considered past belief.", "4721": "XIII.", "4722": "Brutus having now the first men in Rome, both for spirit and family and virtues, dependent upon himself, and having a view of the whole danger, in his public demeanour endeavoured to restrain within himself and to keep his designs under strict control;", "4723": "but at home and by night he was no longer the same man, for sometimes care roused him involuntarily from his sleep, and at other times he was sunk in thought and brooding over the difficulties;", "4724": "and it did not escape his wife, who was resting with him, that he was full of unusual trouble, and was revolving in himself some design hard to carry and difficult to unravel.", "4725": "Now Porcia,† as it has been said, was the daughter of Cato, and Brutus, who was her cousin, had married her, not in her virgin state, but he took her after the death of her husband, while she was still a young woman, and had one little child by her husband, and the child's name was Bibulus;", "4726": "and there is extant a small book of memoirs of Brutus, written by Bibulus.", "4727": "Porcia, who was a philoso­ pher and loved her husband, and was full of spirit and good sense, did not attempt to question her husband about his secrets before she had made trial of herself in manner following.", "4728": "She took a knife, such as barbers pare the nails with, and putting all her attendants out of the cham­ ber, she inflicted a deep wound in her thigh, so that there was a large flow of blood, and, shortly after, violent pains and shivering fever came upon her in consequence of the wound.", "4729": "Brutus being agonised and full of trouble, Porcia spoke to him thus in the acme of her pain:", "4730": "\" I, Brutus, Cato's daughter, was given unto thy house, not like women who serve as concubines, to share thy bed and board only, but to be a partner in thy happiness, and a partner in thy sorrows.", "4731": "Now, with respect to thy marriage, everything is blameless on thy part;", "4732": "but as to me, what evidence is there, or what affection, if I must neither share with thee a secret sorrow nor a care which demands confidence ?", "4733": "I know that a woman's nature is considered too weak to carry a secret, but, Brutus, there is a certain power to­ wards making moral character in a good nurture and honest conversation;", "4734": "and I am Cato's daughter and also Brutus' wife, whereon hitherto I had less relied, but now I know that I am also invincible to pain.\"", "4735": "Thus saying, she showed him the wound, and told him of the trial she had made of herself.", "4736": "Struck with astonishment and stretch­ ing forth his hands, Brutus prayed that the gods would permit him to succeed in the enterprise and to show himself a husband worthy of Porcia.", "4737": "He then consoled his wife.", "4738": "XIV.", "4739": "When notice had been given of a meeting of the Senate, at which Cæsar was expected to be present, they resolved to make the attempt, for they would be then collected without raising any suspicion, and they would have together all the men of highest character and rank, who would be ready as soon as a great act was accom­ plished, forthwith to seize their freedom.", "4740": "The circum­ stance of the place, too, was considered to be a token from heaven and in their favour.", "4741": "For it was a portico, one belonging to the theatre,.", "4742": "with an exhedra, in which there was a statue of Pompeius, which the city erected at the time when Pompeius adorned that sito with porticoes and the theatre.", "4743": "Hither then the Senate was summoned about the middle of the month of March;", "4744": "the Romans call the day the Ides;", "4745": "so that some dæmon seemed to be bringing the man to the vengeance of Pompeius.", "4746": "When the day came, Brutus put a dagger under his vest, without any one being privy to it except his wife, and went forth;", "4747": "the rest assembled at the house of Cassius, to conduct down to the Forum Cassius' son, who was going to assume the toga called virilis.", "4748": "From thence they all hurried to the portico of Pompeius, where they waited in expectation of Caesaris coming immediately to the Senate.", "4749": "Herein most of all would one have admired the impassiveness of the men and their presence of mind before the danger, if he had known what was going to take place — in that, being compelled by their duties of prætor to attend to the con­ cerns of many persons, they not only listened patiently to those who came before them and had matter in dispute, like men who have plenty of leisure, but they also gave to each their decision in exact form and with judgment, carefully attending to the business.", "4750": "And when one person, who was unwilling to submit to the decision, was appeal­ ing to Caesar, and calling out loud and protesting, Brutus, looking on the bystanders, said:", "4751": "\" Caesar does not hinder me from acting according to the laws, and he will not hinder me.\"XV.", "4752": "And yet many things chanced to fall out to cause them perplexity;", "4753": "first and chief, that Cæsar tarried while the day was getting on, and as the victims were not propitious, was kept at home by his wife, and was hindered by the priests from going abroad.", "4754": "In the next place, a person came up to Casca, who was one of the conspirators, and taking his hand said, \" Casca, you have concealed the secret from us, but Brutus has disclosed all to me.\"", "4755": "Casca was startled at this, whereon the other smiled and said, \"", "4756": "How have you grown so rich all at once as to become a candidate for the ædileship ? \"", "4757": "So near did Casca come to betraying the secret, being deceived by the ambiguity of the man's words.", "4758": "A senator also, Popilius Lænas,* saluted Brutus and Cassius in a more lively way than usual, and whispering in a low tone, \" You have my wishes, \" he said, \" for success in what you design, and I urge you not to tarry, for the matter is no secret.\"", "4759": "Saying this he withdrew, putting them in great suspicion of the intended deed being known.", "4760": "In the meantime one came running from the house of Brutus and told him that his wife was dying.", "4761": "For Porcia, who was beside herself through thinking of what was going to be done, and unable to bear the weight of her anxiety, could scarce keep herself within doors, and at every noise and shout, like those possessed with bacchio frenzy, she would spring forth and question every one who came in from the Forum, what Brutus was doing, and was continually sending others out.", "4762": "At length, as the time began to be protracted, her bodily strength no longer held out, but she fainted and swooned away, her mind wandering by reason of her perplexity;", "4763": "and she could not reach her apartment before faintness and in­ describable alarm seized her, where she was sitting in the midst of her attendants, and her colour changed and her voice was completely choked.", "4764": "Her maids at this sight shrieked aloud, and as the neighbours quickly ran to the door, a report went forth and was given out abroad, that she was dead.", "4765": "However she quickly recovered and was herself again, and her women took care of her.", "4766": "Brutus was troubled, as was natural, by this report coming upon him;", "4767": "yet he did not desert the public interest, nor allow himself to be carried away by his feelings to his own domestic affairs.", "4768": "XVI.", "4769": "And now it was told that Cæsar was approaching, borne in a litter.", "4770": "For he had determined, in consequence of being dispirited by the sacrifices, to ratify nothing of importance at that time, but to put things off on the pretext of illness.", "4771": "When he had stepped out of the litter, Popilius Lænas hurried up to him, he who had a little before wished Brutus good luck and success, and he talked some time with Cæsar who was standing there and listen­ ing.", "4772": "The conspirators (for so we may call them) not hearing what he said, but conjecturing from their own suspicions that the conversation was a discovery of the plot, sunk in their spirits and looked at one another, by their countenances declaring to one another that they ought not to wait to be scized, but forthwith to die by their own hands.", "4773": "Cassius and some others had already laid their hands on the hilts of their daggers under their garments and were drawing them out, when Brutus observing in the attitude of Lænas the earnestness of a man who was asking a favour and not preferring an accusation, said nothing, because somany persons not of their party were mingled with them, but he encouraged Cassius by the cheering expression of his countenance.", "4774": "And soon after Lænas kissed Cæsar's right hand and withdrew, by which it was plain that he had :", "4775": "spoken with Cæsar about himself and some of his own concerns.", "4776": "XVII.*", "4777": "The Senate having advanced to the exhedra, the conspirators surrounded Cæsar's chair, as if they designed to have a conference with him.", "4778": "And it is said that Cassius, turning his face to the statue of Pompeius, invoked him as if he could hear;", "4779": "and Trebonius having engaged Antonius in conversation at the door kept him out.", "4780": "As Cæsar entered, the Senate stood up, and as soon as he sat down, the conspirators in a body surrounded him, putting forward Tillius Cimber, one of their number, to supplicate for his brother who was an exile;", "4781": "and they all joined in the sup­ plication, laying hold of Cæsar's hands, and they kissed his breast and head.", "4782": "Caesar at first repulsed their in treaties, and then, as they did not intermit, he made a sudden attempt to rise up, on which Tillius, with both his hands, pulled Cæsar's garment down from the shoulders, and Casca first of all (for he stood behind him) drew his sword and drove it into Cæsar's body near the shoulders, but to no great depth.", "4783": "Caesar, laying hold of the handle, cried out aloud in the Roman language, \" Villain Casca, what are you doing !\" and Casca, addressing his brother in Greek, urged him to come to his aid.", "4784": "Cæsar being now assaulted by many, looked around with the intention of forcing his way through them, but when ho saw Brutus drawing his sword against him, he let loose his hold of Casca's hand, and wrapping his head in his garment he offered his body to the blows.", "4785": "The conspirators, who were all mingled in confusion, and using their numerous swords against Cæsar, wounded one another, so that even Brutus received a blow on the hand while he was taking part in the slaughter;", "4786": "and they were all drenched with blood.", "4787": "XVIII.", "4788": "Cæsar having been thus killed, Brutus advanced into the midst wishing to speak, and he attempted to detain the Senate by encouraging them ;", "4789": "but the senators, through fear, fled in disorder, and there was shoving and confusion about the door, though no one pursued or pressed upon them.", "4790": "For it had been firmly resolved to kill no other than Cæsar, but to invite all to freedom.", "4791": "Now the rest, when they were deliberating about the deed, were of opinion that they should kill Antonius at the same time with Cæsar, as he was a man who aspired to monarchical power and was a violent man, and had got strength by his intercourse and familiarity with the army;", "4792": "and chiefly that to his natural haughtiness and daring temper he had added the dignity of the consulship, being then Cæsar's colleague.", "4793": "But Brutus opposed the design, first relying on grounds of justice, and next suggesting hopes of a change.", "4794": "For he did not despair that Antonius, a man of generous nature, a lover of honourable distinctions and fond of fame, when Cæsar was put out of the way, would join his country in seizing hold of freedom, and be led on by them through emulation to what was good.", "4795": "In this way Brutus saved Antonius;", "4796": "but in the then alarm Antonius changed his dress for plebeian attire and fled.", "4797": "Brutus and his partisans went to the Capitol, their hands stained with blood, and displaying their bare swords called the citizens to liberty.", "4798": "Now, at first, there were shouts, and the people running this way and that, as chance would have it, after the murder, increased the confusion;", "4799": "but as there was no more slaughter and no plundering of the things exposed for sale, both the senators and many of the plebeians took heart and went up to the conspirators to the Capitol.", "4800": "The multitude being assembled, Brutus spoke in a way to please the people and suitable to the cir­ cumstances ;", "4801": "and as the people commended him and called out for them to come down, the conspirators confidently descended to the Forum, the rest following with one an.", "4802": "other;", "4803": "but many of the persons of distinction putting Bru­ tus in the midst, of them, conducted him with great show from the Capitol, and placed him on the Rostra.", "4804": "At the eight of this the many, though a mingled body and pre­ pared to raise a tumult, were afraid, and they awaited the result in order and silence.", "4805": "When Brutus came forward they all listened to what he said ;", "4806": "but that the deed was not agreeable to all, they made evident when Cinna began to speak and to bring charges against Cæsar, by breaking out in passion and abusing Cinna, so that the conspirators returned to the Capitol.", "4807": "Brutus, fearing to be blockaded, then sent away the chief persons of those who had gone up with him, not thinking it right that, as they had no share in the blame, they should sustain a share in the danger.", "4808": "XIX.", "4809": "However, on the following day when the Senate met in the temple of Earth, and Antonius and Plancus * and Cicero had spoken about an amnesty and concord, it was resolved that the conspirators should not only have impu­ nity, but that the consuls should also propose a measure for conferring honours on them.", "4810": "They voted these things, and then separated.", "4811": "After Antonius had sent his son to the Capitol as a hostage, Brutus and the conspirators came down, and there were salutations and pressing of hands among all of them together.", "4812": "Antonius received Cassius and feasted him, and Lepidus entertained Brutus ;", "4813": "and the rest were entertained by others according to the intimacy or friendship that existed between them.", "4814": "At daybreak the senators met again, and in the first place they conferred honours on Antonius for having stopped the beginning of civil wars;", "4815": "in the second place, thanks were given to Brutus and his friends who were present, and finally distri­ butions of provinces.", "4816": "For to Brutus they decreed Crete, and to Cassius Libya, and to Trebonius Asia, and to Cimber Bithynia, and to the other Brutus Gallia on the Eridanus.", "4817": "XX.", "4818": "After this a discussion arising about the will of Cæsar and his interment, and Antonius demanding that the will should be read, and that the body should be carried forth not secretly nor without due honours, so that this, too, might not irritate the people, Cassius violently opposed it, but Brutus gave way, wherein he was considered to have made a second mistake.", "4819": "For in sparing Antonius he incurred the imputation of strengthening against the conspirators a dangerous and irresistible enemy ;", "4820": "and as to the matter of the interment, in allowing it to take place in the way in which Antonius demanded, he was considered to have altogether made a mistake.", "4821": "For in the first place there being given by the will to every Roman seventy-five drachmæ,* and to the people there being left the gardens beyond the river, where the temple of Fortuna now is, a wonderful degree of affection and regret for Cæsar seized the citizens:", "4822": "in the second place, when the body had been carried into the Forum, and Antonius according to custom had pronounced a funeral oration in honour of Cæsar, see­ ing that the masses were stirred by his speech, he changed their feeling into compassion, and taking the blood- stained vest of Cæsar he unfolded it and showed the rents and the number of the wounds.", "4823": "Upon this there was no longer any order kept;", "4824": "but some called out to kill the murderers, and others, as before in the case of Clodius t the demagogue, tearing up the benches and tables from the workshops and bringing them together made a very large pile;", "4825": "and placing the corpse upon it in the midst of many temples and asyla and holy places burnt it.", "4826": "When the fire blazed forth, men from various quarters, approaching and plucking out half-burnt pieces of wood, ran about to the houses of Cæsar's assassins, intending to fire them.", "4827": "But they were already well prepared and repelled the danger.", "4828": "Now there was one Cinna,t a man given to poetry, who was under no imputation in the matter, and had even been a friend of Cæsar.", "4829": "He dreamed in a dream that he was invited by Cæsar to supper and he refused;", "4830": "but Caesar urged and forced him, and at last, laying hold of his hand, led him to a vast and gloomy place, he following the while unwilling and alarmed.", "4831": "After having this vision, it hap­ pened that he had a fever in the night.", "4832": "Nevertheless, in the morning, when Cæsar's body was being carried forth he felt ashamed not to be present, and went out to the abble, who were now in a ferocious mood.", "4833": "Being seen and supposed to be not the Cinna that he was, but the Cinna who had lately reviled Cæsar before the assembly, he was torn in pieces.", "4834": "XXI.", "4835": "It was mainly through fear on account of this unlucky affair, next after the change in Antonius, that Brutus and his partisans left the city.", "4836": "They stayed in Antium * at first, with the design of returning to Rome when the popular fury should have passed its height and worn itself out.", "4837": "And this they expected to take place as a matter of course among numbers which were subject to unsteady and rapid movements, and because they had the Senate in their favour, who without taking any notice of those that had torn Cinna to pieces, sought out and seized those who had attacked the houses of the conspirators.", "4838": "The people, too, already annoyed at Antonius being nearly established in monarchical power, longed for Brutus, and it was expected that he would, in person, superintend the spectacles t which as prefer it was his duty to exhibit.", "4839": "But when Brutus heard that many of those who had served under Cæsar and received lands and cities from him, were forming designs against him, and were dropping into the city a few at a time, he did not venture to go, and the people saw the spectacles, which, though Brutus was absent, were furnished without any thrift and in a profuse style.", "4840": "For he had purchased a great number of wild beasts, and he gave orders that none should be sold or left, but that all should be killed;", "4841": "and he himself went down to Neapolis and engaged most of the actors.", "4842": "With respect to a certain Canutius who was much in favour on the theatre, he wrote to his friends that they should get him on the stage by persuasion, for it was not fit that any Greek should be forced.", "4843": "He also wrote to Cicero and urged him by all means to be present at the spectacles.", "4844": "XXII.", "4845": "While affairs were in this state, another change was brought about by the arrival of the young Cæsar.*", "4846": "He was the son of Cæsar's niece, but by Cæsar's testament he was left his son and heir:", "4847": "and he was staying at Apollonia when Cæsar was killed, being engaged with philosophical studies and waiting for Cæsar, who had resolved to march forthwith against the Parthians.", "4848": "As soon as he heard of Cæsar's death he came to Rome, and by assuming Cæsar's name as a mode of beginning to get the popular favour, and by paying among the citizens the money that was left them, he made a strong party against Antonius, and by distribu­ ting money he got together and assembled many of those who had served under Cæsar.", "4849": "Now when Cicero took the side of Cæsar through hatred of Antonius, Brutus t rebuked him strongly in his letters, saying that Cicero did not dis­ like a master, but feared a master who hated him, and that his policy was to choose a mild servitude, as he showed by writing and saying, “How good Caesar is !\"", "4850": "But our fathers, he said, did not endure even mild masters.", "4851": "He said that for his part at this crisis he had neither quite resolved to fight nor to remain quiet, but he was resolved on one thing only, not to be a slave;", "4852": "but he wondered at Cicero, that he was afraid of a civil war and one attended with danger, and was not afraid of a base and inglorious peace, and that he asked as a reward for ejecting Antonius from the tyranny, to be allowed to make Caesar a tyrant.", "4853": "XXIII.", "4854": "Now in his first letters Brutus thus expressed himself;", "4855": "but when people were separating themselves, some on the side of Cæsar and some on the side of Antonius, and the armies being venal were selling them­ selves as it were by auction to the highest bidder, Brutus, altogether despairing of affairs, resolved to leave Italy, and he went by land through Lucania to Velia * to the sea.", "4856": "From this place Porcia, intending to turn back to Rome, endeavoured to conceal her excessive emotion, but a paint­ ing made her betray herself though she was a noble- spirited woman.", "4857": "It was a subject from Grecian story, Hector accompanied by Andromache,t who was receiving her infant son from Hector and looking upon him.", "4858": "The sight of the picture, in which her own feelings were portrayed, melted Porcia to tears, and she went to it many times in the day and wept.", "4859": "Acilius, one of the friends of Brutus, having pronounced the words of Andromache to Hector :", "4860": "- Hector, thou art to me father and mother dear, And brother too, and husband in thy bloom:", "4861": "\" Brutus, smiling, said, “But it is not for me to say to Porcia as Hector said :", "4862": "“‘The loom and distaff, and command the maids;", "4863": "' for owing to the natural weakness of her body she is unable to perform noble deeds equally with us, but in her mind she nobly dares as we do in defence of our country.\"", "4864": "This is recorded by Bibulus, the son of Porcia.", "4865": "XXIV.", "4866": "Having set out thence Brutus sailed towards Athens.‡", "4867": "The people received him gladly with expres­ sions of good wishes and public honours, and he lodged with a friend.", "4868": "As he attended the discourses of Theomnestus the Academic, and Cratippus * the Peri­ patetic, and associated with those philosophers, it Was supposed that he was altogether inactive and was un­ bending himself.", "4869": "But he was busied about preparations for war, when no one suspected it;", "4870": "for he sent Herostratus into Macedonia with the view of gaining over those who were with the armies there, and he attached to himself and kept with him the young men from Rome who were residing at Athens for the sake of their studies.", "4871": "Among them was also a son of Cicero whom Brutus particularly commends, and says, that whether he is waking or sleep­ ing, he admires him for his noble disposition and hatred of tyrants.", "4872": "Having now begun openly to attend to affairs, and hearing that Roman vessels full of money were sailing over from Asia, with a commander on board who was an honest man and an acquaintance of his, he met him near Carystus and having fallen in with him and persuaded him and obtained a surrender of the vessels, he prepared for a magnificent entertainment, for it was the birth-day of Brutus.", "4873": "When they had come to drinking and were pouring out wine with wishes for the success of Brutus and the liberty of the Romans, Brutus, wishing to encourage them still more, asked for a larger cup, and taking it up, without anything moving thereto, he uttered the following verse:", "4874": "“Me evil fate and Leto's son t have slain.\"", "4875": "In addition to this they report that when he went out to fight the last battle at Philippi, Apollo was the word that he gave to his soldiers.", "4876": "Accordingly they consider that the utterance of that verse was a sign of what was to befall him.", "4877": "XXV.", "4878": "After this Antistius gave Brutus fifty ten thousands out of the money which he was taking to Italy ;", "4879": "and all the soldiers of Pompeius who were still rambling about Thessaly gladly flocked to Brutus;", "4880": "and he took five hundred horsemen from Cinna who was conducting them into Asia to Dolabella.*", "4881": "He then sailed against Demetrias t and got possession of a large quantity of arms, which were going to be carried away to Antonius, and had been made at the command of the elder Cæsar for the Parthian war.", "4882": "Hortensius,t the governor, also surrendered Macedonia to him, and the kings and rulers all around began to side with him and to come over;", "4883": "but in the meantime news arrived that Caius, the brother of Antonius, had crossed over from Italy and was marching straight against the troops which Gabinius § had under him in Epidamnus and Apollonia.", "4884": "Brutus, intending to anticipate and prevent him, immediately put in motion those who were with him, and marched through a difficult country in the midst of a snow-storm ;", "4885": "and he was far in advance of those who con­ veyed the provisions.", "4886": "As he came near Epidamnus, he began to suffer from bulimy || through exhaustion and cold.", "4887": "This malady chiefly attacks both beasts and men when they are worn out and in the midst of the snow, whether it is that the heat owing to the refrigeration and condens­ ation, when everything is internally compressed, consumes the nourishment all at once, or that a sharp and subtle breath arising from the snow penetrating through, cut, the body and destroys the warmth which is dispersed out­ wards from it.", "4888": "For it seems that heat causes sweats through meeting with the cold and being quenched about the surface;", "4889":

refuge to their enemies, and approaching the gates they asked bread of the watch, who hearing of the mishap of Brutus came and brought to eat and to drink.", "4892": "In return for which, when Brutus got possession of the city, he not only treated them kindly, but also all the rest for their sake.", "4893": "Caius Antonius now came up to Apollonia and summoned the soldiers who were there;",

lost three cohorts, which were cut to pieces by Brutus on the march;", "4896": "and in the next place, attempting to force the posts about By bits, which were already occupied, he came to a battle with Cicero and was defeated;", "4897": "fur Brutus employed Cicero in command and gained many successes through him.", "4898": "Brutus himself came upon Caius, who was in marshy ground and far separated from the rest of his troops, but he would not let his lien make an attack, and he threw his cavalry around him with orders to spare the men, saying that in a short time they would be theirs;", "4899": "which in fact happened, for they surrendered themselves and their general, so that there was now a large force with Brutus.", "4900": "Now Brutus treated Caius respectfully for some time and did not deprive him of the insignia of his office, though, as they say, many persons, and Cicero among the rest, wrote to him from Rome and urged him to do it.", "4901": "But as Caius began to have secret conferences with the officers and attempted to excite a mutiny, he had him put in a ship and guarded.", "4902": "The soldiers who had been corrupted fled to Apollonia and invited Brutus

Antonius, whom he had driven out of Italy, and he was now formidable, and was seeking for the consulship contrary to law, and maintaining large armies of which the State had no need.", "4907": "But when Cæsar saw that the Senate was displeased at this, and was looking abroad towards Brutus and decreeing provinces * for him and confirming them, he became alarmed.", "4908": "And he sent to Antonius and invited him to friendship, and placing his troops around the city he got the consul­ ship, being yet hardly a young man, but in his twentieth year, as he said in his Memoirs.", "4909": "He immediately instituted a pr< secution on a charge of murder against Brutus and his partisans, for having put to death without trial the first man in the state who was filling the highest offices

his friend, and the other both a friend and kinsman.", "4917": "This was the reason why Antonius, when he afterwards took Hortensius at Philippi, put him to death on the tomb of his brother.", "4918": "Brutus says that he felt more shame at the cause of Cicero'is death than sympathy at his misfortune, and that he blamed his friends in Rome, for they were slain more through their own fault than that of the tyrants, and that they submitted to see and to witness what it should have been intolerable for them even to hear.", "4919": "Brutus having taken his army over to Asia, which was now a considerable force, set about fitting out a naval force in Bithynia* and in the neighbourhood of Cyzicus;", "4920": "and himself moving about with his troops settled the cities and had interviews with the rulers;", "4921": "and he sent to Cassius t into Syria to recall him from Egypt;", "4922": "for he said that it was not to get dominion, but to deliver their country that they were rambling about and collecting a force with which they would put down the tyrants;", "4923": "that they ought therefore, remembering and keeping in mind this purpose, not to hold themselves far from Italy, but to hasten thither and to aid the citizens.", "4924": "Cassius obeyed, and Brutus met him on his return;", "4925": "and they fell in with one another near Smyrna, for the first time since they had separated in Peiraeus and set out, the one for Syria, the other for Macedonia.", "4926": "They had accordingly great pleasure and confidence owing to the force which each had.", "4927": "For they had hurried from Italy like the most despicable fugitives, without money and without arms, without a single ship, a single soldier, or a city, and yet after no very long interval they had come together with ships and troops and horses and money, able to struggle for the supremacy of the Romans.", "4928": "XXIX.", "4929": "Now Cassius was desirous to have and to allow an equal share of honour, but Brutus herein anticipated him by generally going to Cassius who, in age, was his superior, and in body was not able to sustain equal toil.", "4930": "The opinion was that Cassius was skilled in military matters, but was violent in passion and governed mainly by fear, while towards his intimates he was too much inclined to use ridicule and was too fond of jesting.", "4931": "As to Brutus, they say that he was esteemed by the many for his virtues, but loved by his friends, admired by the nobles, and not hated even by his enemies, because the man was extraordinarily mild and high-minded and un­ moved by anger, pleasure or love of aggrandisement, and kept his judgment upright and unbending in tt e main­ tenance of honour and justice.", "4932": "That which got him most good-will and reputation was the faith which men had in his motives.", "4933": "For neither that great Pompeius, if he had put down Cæsar, was confidently expected to give up his power to the laws, but to retain affairs in his hands, pacifying the people with the name of consulship and dictatorship or some other title with more pleasing name;", "4934": "and this Cassius, who was a violent and passionate man and was often carried away from justice in quest of gain, more than any one else they thought would carry on war, and ramble about and expose himself to danger for the purpose of getting power for himself, not liberty for the citizens.", "4935": "For as to the men of still earlier times, the Cinnas and Marii and Carbos, they viewed their country as a prize and booty for competition, and all but in express words fought to get a tyranny.", "4936": "But as to Brutus, they say that not even his enemies imputed to him such a change in his purpose, but that many persons had heard Antonius say, he thought Brutus was the only person who conspired against Cæsar because of being moved by the splendour and apparent noble nature of the deed, and that the rest combined against the man because they hated and envied him.", "4937": "Accordingly it appears from what Brutus says that he trusted not so much in his power as in his virtues.", "4938": "He wrote to Atticus when he was just approach­ ing the danger, that his affairs were in the best plight as to fortune, for that he should either get the victory and tree the Roman people, or should die and be released from slavery;", "4939": "and though everything else was safe and secure for them, one thing was uncertain, whether they should live and be free or die.", "4940": "He says that Marcus Antonius was paying a just penalty for his folly, for while he might have been numbered with the Bruti and Cassii and Catos, he made himself an appendage to Octavius, and if he should not be defeated with him, he would shortly after have to fight against him.", "4941": "Now he seems, in say­ ing this, to have well divined what was to happen.", "4942": "XXX.", "4943": "While they were then in Smyrna, Brutus claimed a share of the money which Cassius had collected to a great amount, for Brutus alleged that he had expended all his own resources in building so great a fleet with which they would command all the internal sea.*", "4944": "But the friends of Cassius were not for lettinghim give up the money, saying, “What you save by economy and get with odium, it in not fair that he should take and apply to gaining popular­ ity and gratifying the soldiers.\"", "4945": "However, Cassius gave him a third part of all.", "4946": "Separating again to their several undertakings, Cassius, after taking Rhodes, did not conduct himself with moderation, but made this answer at his en­ trance to those who addressed him as king and lord :", "4947": "“I am neither king nor lord, but the executioner and punisher of lord and king.\"", "4948": "Brutus demanded of the Lycians money and men.", "4949": "When Naucrates the demagogue persuaded the cities to revolt, and the people occupied certain heights to prevent Brutus from passing, in the first place he sent cavalry against them when they were eating, who killed six hundred of them;", "4950": "and in the next place taking posses­ sion of the posts and forts, he released all the people with­ out ransom with the view of gaining over the nation by kindness.", "4951": "But the people were obstinate, being enraged at what they had suffered, and despising his moderation and humanity, till at last Brutus drove into Xanthus t the most warlike of the Lycians, and blockaded them there.", "4952": "Some of them attempted to escape by swimming under the river which flowed by the city:", "4953": "but they were caught by nets which were sunk in the channel to the bottom, and the tops of the nets had bells attached to them which gave a signal as soon as any one was caught.", "4954": "The Xanthians, making a sally by night, threw fire on certain engines;", "4955": "and when they were driven back into the town by the Romans who perceived them, and a strong wind began to blow against the battlements the flame which was laying hold of the adjoining houses, Brutus, who feared for the city, ordered his soldiers to help to extinguish the fire.", "4956": "XXXI.", "4957": "But the Lycians were all at once seized with a horrible impulse to despair surpassing all description, which might be best likened to a passion for death;", "4958": "for with their wives and children, both freemen and slaves, and people of every age, they threw missiles from the walls upon the enemy who were assisting to quench the flames, and carrying reeds and wood and everything combustible, they drew the fire to the city, offering to it all kinds of mate­ rial and in every way exciting and feeding it.", "4959": "As the flames rushed onwards and engirdling the city blazed forth with violence, Brutus, in great affliction at what was going on, rode round the walls, being eager to save the people, and stretching out his hands to the Xanthians he prayed them to spare themselves and save the city;", "4960": "and yet no one regarded him, but in every way they sought to destroy themselves;", "4961": "and not only men and women, but even the little children;", "4962": "with cries and shouts, some leaped into the fire and others broke their necks from the walls, and others presented their throats to their fathers' knives, baring them and bidding them strike.", "4963": "After the city was destroyed, there was found a woman suspended by a rope, with a dead child hung to her neck, and firing the house with a lighted torch.", "4964": "This tragical sight Brutus could not endure to see, and he wept at hearing of it;", "4965": "and he proclaimed that a reward should be given to every soldier who could save a Lycian.", "4966": "They say that there were only one hundred and fifty who did not escape being saved.", "4967": "Now the Xanthians after a long interval, as if they were reproducing a fated period of destruction, renewed the fortune of their an­ cestors in their desperation;", "4968": "for their ancestors in like manner in the time of the Persians burnt their city and destroyed themselves.", "4969": "XXXII.", "4970": "Brutus seeing that the city of Patara was pre­ paring to resist him was unwilling to attack it, and was perplexed because he feared the same desperation;", "4971": "and as he had their women captive, he let them go without ransom.", "4972": "These women, who were the wives and daughters of distinguished men, reported of Brutus that he was a most moderate and just man, and they persuaded the citizens to yield and to surrender the city.", "4973": "Upon this all the rest of the Lycians surrendered and gave themselves up to him, and they found him to be honourable and merciful beyond their expectation;", "4974": "for while Cassius about the same time compelled all the Rhodians to bring in the gold and silver which was their private property, and a sum of eight thousand talents was thus collected, and mulcted the commonwealth of the city in five hundred talents besides, Brutus only demanded of the Lycians a hundred and fifty talents, and without doing them any other wrong set out for Ionia.", "4975": "XXXIII.", "4976": "Now Brutus did many deeds worthy of remem­ brance both in rewarding and punishing according to desert;", "4977": "but that with which he himself was most pleased and the best of the Romans, I will relate.", "4978": "When Pompeius Magnus landed in Egypt at Pelusium, what time he fled after being completely defeated by Cæsar, the guardians of the king, who was still a youth, being in counsel with their friends, were not inclined the same way in their opinions.", "4979": "Some were for receiving and others for driving the man from Egypt.", "4980": "But one Theodotus * of Chios, who was hired to teach the king rhetoric, and was then thought worthy of a place in the council for want of better men, attempted to show that both were in error, those who advised to receive and those who advised to send away Pompeius, for there was one thing in the present circum stances that was useful, and that was to receive him and put him to death.", "4981": "And he added, at the end of his speech, that a corpse does not bite.", "4982": "The council assented to his opinion, and Pompeius Magnus fell, an instance of things passing belief and expectation, and the result of the rhetorical skill and eloquence of Theodotus, as the sophist himself used to say boastingly.", "4983": "When Cæsar arrived shortly after, some of them paid the penalty of their guilt and perished miserably ;", "4984": "and Theodotus, who borrowed from fortune a short period for an inglorious and poor and rambling life, did not escape Brutus when he came into Asia, but he was carried before him and punished, and thus he gained a greater name by his death than by his life.", "4985": "XXXIV.", "4986": "Brutus invited Cassius to Sardis* and met him with his friends on his approach ;", "4987": "and the whole force under arms saluted both of them as Imperatores.", "4988": "Now as it is wont to happen in the midst of great affairs, and among many friends and commanders, causes of difference had arisen between Brutus and Cassius, and suspicions;", "4989": "and before they did anything else, immediately on their arrival at Sardis they entered into a room by themselves and closed the door, and no one being present they began with blaming one another, and then fell to proofs and charges.", "4990": "From this they came to tears and passionate expressions without restraint, so that their friends, wonder­ ing at the roughness and violence of their anger, feared lest something should happen;", "4991": "but it was forbidden to approach them.", "4992": "But Marcus Favonius, who had been a lover of Cato, and was a philosopher not so much from reason as a certain impulse and mad passion, went in to them though the slaves attempted to hinder him.", "4993": "But it was a hard thing to check Favonius when he had put himself in motion towards any object, for he was im petuous in all things and impatient.", "4994": "He made no account of being a Roman senator, but by his cynical freedom of speech he often took away the harshness and unseasonable­ ness of his behaviour, the hearers receiving all as jest.", "4995": "On this occasion forcing his way against those who tried to stop him, he entered, and with mock solemnity uttered the words which Homer * has made Nestor use :", "4996": "\"", "4997": "Obey:", "4998": "ye both are younger far than I,\" and what follows.",

the time.", "5001": "Cassius gave an entertain­ ment to which Brutus invited his friends.!", "5002": "As they were just reclining, Favonius came from the bath;", "5003": "and, on Brutus declaring that he came without invitation and bidding him withdraw to the highest couch,‡ he forced his way to the central couch and reclined there;", "5004": "and they made merry over the banquet, and the mirth was not without its zest nor unseasoned with philosophy.", "5005": "XXXV.", "5006": "On the following day Lucius Pella, § a Roman who had been prætor and trusted by Brutus, was charged by the people of Sardis with taking money unlawfully, and he was publicly condemned and declared infamous by Brutus.", "5007": "This affai r gave Cassius no small pain.", "5008": "For a few days before, two of his friends who were convicted of the same offence, he privately admonished and publicly ac­ quitted, and he still continued to employ them.", "5009": "Accordingly he blamed Brutus as being too strict an observer of law and justice at a time which required politic conduct and con­ dilatory measutcs.", "5010": "But Brutus told him to remember the Ides of March on which they killed Caesar, who was not himself oppressing and plundering everybody, but sup­ ported others who did it, so that if there was any specious pretext for overlooking justice, it would have been better to bear with Cæsar's friends than to allow their own friends to do wrong.", "5011": "For they, he said,.", "5012": "have the imputation of cowardice, but we of injustice, and that too joined to danger and toil.", "5013": "Such were the principles of Brutus.", "5014": "XXXVI.†", "5015": "When they were going to cross over from Asia, it is said that Brutus had a great sign.", "5016": "The man was naturally wakeful, and by discipline and temperance he contracted his sleep into a small space of time, never reposing in the daytime, and by night only so long as he was unable to do anything or to speak to any one because people were resting.", "5017": "But at that time when the war was on foot, having on his hands the general management of everything, and his thoughts being on the stretch with regard to the future, when he had taken a short repose after eating, he employed the rest of the night on affairs of urgency.", "5018": "And when he had finished and arranged everything that was necessary about such matters, he would read a book till the third watch, at which time the centurions and tribunes were used to come to him.", "5019": "Being then about to convey his army over from Asia, it happened to be dead of night and the lamp in his tent was not very bright;", "5020": "and the whole camp was in deep silence.", "5021": "As Brutus was considering and reflecting with himself, he thought that he heard some one come in, and looking towards the entrance he saw a terrible and strange vision of a huge and frightful figure standing by him in silence.", "5022": "He had the courage to ask, \" What man or god art thou, or with what purpose dost thou come to us ? \"", "5023": "The phantom replied to him, \" I am thy evil daemon, Brutus, and thou shalt see me at Philippic And Brutus without being dis­ turbed, said, \" I shall see.", "5024": "\"XXXVII.‡", "5025": "When the phantom disappeared, Brutus called the slaves, and as they said that they had neither heard any voice nor seen anything, Brutus still kept awake;", "5026": "and at daybreak he betook himself to Cassius and told him his vision.", "5027": "Cassius, who followed the doctrines of Epicurus, and was accustomed to dispute about them with Brutus, said, “Our opinion, Brutus, is this, that we do not in fact feel all things nor see them, but perception is a certain flexible and deceitful thing, and the intellect is still quicker to move and change it, without there being any real thing, into all forms.", "5028": "For the fashioning of the form is like unto wax, and as the soul of man possesses both the thing to be fashioned and that which fashions, being the same, it has of itself the power of most easily varying itself and assum­ ing different forms.", "5029": "And this is shown by the changes of our dreams in sleep, which changes the phantastic power undergoes, from slight causes assuming every kind of effect and image.", "5030": "It is the nature of the phantastic power to be always in motion, and motion is to it a certain phantasy or perception.", "5031": "In you the body being troubled naturally excites and perverts the mind.", "5032": "But it is neither probable that there are daemons, nor that, if there are, they have the form of men or the voice, or that their power reaches to us;", "5033": "and indeed I wish it were so, that we might not put trust only in arms and horses and so many ships, but also in the help of the gods being the leaders in most upright and noble undertakings.\"", "5034": "By such arguments as these Cassius attempted to calm Brutus.", "5035": "When the soldiers were embarking, two eagles descended on the first standards and were carried along with them, and accompanied the soldiers, who fed them, as far as Philippi.", "5036": "And there, one day before the battle, they flew away.", "5037": "XXXVIII.", "5038": "Now Brutus had subjected to him most of the nations that lay in his way:", "5039": "and if any city or ruler had been passed by, they then brought over all in their progress as far as the sea opposite to Thasos.", "5040": "In those parts Norbanus * and his troops happened to be encamped in the Straits and about Symbolum;", "5041": "but Brutus and Cassius getting round them compelled them to withdraw and desert the posts.", "5042": "They also came very near taking his force, Cæsar staying behind on account of illness;", "5043": "and

opposite to Brutus:", "5045": "Antonius took his station opposite to Cassius.", "5046": "The plain which lay between the armies, the Romans called the Campi Philippi ;", "5047": "and it was on this occasion that the largest Roman armies were matched against one another.", "5048": "Now in numbers they were not a little inferior to those of Caesar, but in show and splendour of arms the forces of Brutus outshone the enemy.", "5049": "For most of their armour was of gold, and silver had been unsparingly supplied, though in other respects Brutus accustomed his officers to a simple and severe habit.", "5050": "But he thought that the wealth which they had in their hands and about their bodies, would give courage to the more ambitious of honour and would make those who were fond of gain still more courageous, as if the weapons which they held were their property.", "5051": "XXXIX.", "5052": "Now Cæsar made a lustration * within his lines, and distributed among the soldiers a small allowance of grain and five drachmae apiece for the sacrifice;", "5053": "but Brutus, who considered this either as proof of Cæsar's poverty or his meanness, first of all performed a lustration for the army under the open sky, according to the custom, and then distributed a number of victims for every cohort, and fifty drachmae to each man, by which he had the advantage over the enemy in the good-will and zeal of his troops.", "5054": "Notwithstanding this a bad omen, as Cassius considered it, happened during the lustration;", "5055": "for the lictor brought him his crown reversed.", "5056": "It is said that on a former occasion, also during a certain spectacle and procession, a golden Victory belonging to Cassius, which was being carried, fell down owing to the bearer slipping.", "5057": "Besides this many birds of prey daily appeared in the camp and swarms of bees were seen collecting about a certain spot within the lines, which the diviners enclosed in order to get rid of the superstitious fear which was gradually withdrawing even Cassius himself from the principles of Epicurus, and had completely cowed the soldiers.", "5058": "Owing to this, Cassius was not eager that the matter should be decided at present by a battle, and he was of opinion that they should protract the war, being strong in resources, but in amount of arms and men inferior to the enemy.", "5059": "But Brutus even before this was eager to settle the matter by the speediest hazard, and thus either to recover freedom for his country, or to relieve from their sufferings all the people who were oppressed by cost and military service and requisitions.", "5060": "And now seeing that his cavalry was successful and victorious in the skirmishes and encounters of posts, his spirit was raised:", "5061": "and some desertions to the enemy which took place and imputations and suspicions against others caused many of the friends of Cassius in the council to go over to the opinion of Brutus.",

after a year, he replied, If in nothing else, I shall live longer.", "5064": "Cassius was vexed at this, and Atillius gave no small offence to the rest.", "5065": "Accord­ ingly it was resolved to fight on the next day.", "5066": "XL.

of Cassius the signal for the contest, a purple vest, and they met between the two camps, and Cassius said:", "5072": "\" Brutus, I hope we may be victorious and live together happily all the rest of our lives;", "5073": "but as the chief of human events are the most uncertain, and if the battle results contrary to our expectation, it will not be easy for us to see one another, what do you intend with respect to flight or death ?\"", "5074": "Brutus replied, \"", "5075": "When I was a young man, Cassius, and inexperienced in affairs, I know not how it happened that I neglected a weighty matter in philosophy.", "5076": "I blamed Cato for killing himself, considering that it was not right nor befitting a man to withdraw himself from his daemon, and not to await what happens without fear, but to skulk away.", "5077": "But now I am of a different mind in the circumstances, and if the deity shall not determine in our favour, I do not want to try other hopes and means, but I will withdraw content with fortune, that on the Ides of March I gave to my country my life and have lived another life for her sake free and glorious.\"", "5078": "Whereat Cassius smiled and, embracing Brutus,

presence of their friends.", "5081": "Brutus asked Cassius to allow him to command the right wing, which was supposed to be more appro­ priate for Cassius on account of his experience and his age.", "5082": "But Cassius granted even this, and he commanded Messala with the bravest of the legions to be posted on the right.", "5083": "Brutus immediately led forth the cavalry equipped in splendid style, and he brought up the infantry with equal expedition.", "5084": "XLI.", "5085": "The soldiers of Antonius happened to be driving trenches from the marshes, around which they were en­ camped, into the plain and cutting off the approaches of Cassius to the sea.", "5086": "Caesar was on the watch, not being present himself by reason of sickness, but his troops were there, which, however, did not expect that the enemy would fight, but would merely make sallies against the works and disturb the diggers with light missiles and shouts;", "5087": "and as they were paying no attention to those who were opposed to them, they were surprised at the shouts about the trenches, which were indistinct and loud.", "5088": "In the meantime billets came from Brutus to the officers in which the word was written, and as he was advancing on horseback before the legions and encouraging them, a few had time to hear the word as it was passed along, but the greater part without waiting, with one impulse and shout rushed against the enemy.", "5089": "Some irregularity arose in the lines and some separation of them through this disorder, and the legion of Messala first and those which were close upon it outflanked Cæsar's left;", "5090": "and having slightly touched the soldiers on the extreme left and killed no great number, but completely outflanking them, fell on the camp.", "5091": "Caesar, as he says in his Memoirs, inasmuch as one of his friends, Artorius Marcus,* had seen a vision in his sleep which bade Cæsar get out of the way and leave the camp, bad just before been conveyed out of it, and he was supposed to have lost his life ;", "5092": "for the enemy pierced his empty litter with javelins and spears.", "5093": "And there was a slaughter in the camp of those who were captured, and two thousand Lacedæmonians, who had lately come as allies, were cut to pieces with them.", "5094": "XLII.", "5095": "They who had not surrounded the soldiers of Caesar, but had engaged with those in front, easily put to flight the enemy who were in confusion, and destroyed at close quarters three legions, and they rushed into the camp with the fugitives, carried along by the impetuosity of success and having Brutus with them;", "5096": "but what the victors did not see, that the critical time showed to the vanquished.", "5097": "For pushing forward to the parts of the opposite line which were exposed and broken where the right wing was drawn off in the pursuit, they did not force the centre but were engaged in a violent struggle;", "5098": "but they put to flight the left, which was in disorder and ignorant of what had happened, and pursuing it to the camp they plundered it, neither of the Imperatores being with them.", "5099": "For Antonius, as they say, having at the beginning avoided the attack, retreated to the marsh, and Cæsar could no­ where be seen, as he had fled from the camp;", "5100": "but some showed their bloody swords to Brutus supposing they had killed him, and describing his appearance and age.", "5101": "And now the centre had repelled their opponents with great slaughter;", "5102": "and Brutus thought that he was completely victorious as Cassius thought that he was defeated.", "5103": "And this was the only thing which ruined their cause, that Brutus did not aid Cassius because he thought that he was victorious, and that Cassius did not wait for Brutus be­ cause he thought that he had perished;", "5104": "for Messala con­ siders it a proof of victory that Brutus had taken three eagles and many standards from the enemy, and the enemy had taken nothing.", "5105": "Brutus now retreating after he had destroyed Cæsar's camp, was surprised not to see the tent of Cassius standing out conspicuous, as usual, nor the rest in their place, for most of the tents had immediately been thrown down and torn in pieces by the enemy when they broke in.", "5106": "But those who thought they could see better than their comrades said to Brutus that they saw many helmets glittering and many silver shields moving about in the camp of Cassius, and they said it did not appear to them that it was either the number or the armour of those were left to guard the camp, but yet there did not appear to be in that direction a number of corpses such as might be expected if so many legions had been defeated.", "5107": "This was the first thing that gave Brutus an idea of the misfortune ;", "5108": "and leaving a guard in the camp of the enemy he recalled the pursuers and got them together to aid Cassius.", "5109": "XLIII.", "5110": "And it had fared thus with him.", "5111": "He was neither pleased at seeing the first onset of the soldiers of Brutus without signal and order, nor was he pleased that when they were victorious they rushed straight to plunder and profit, taking no pains to get round and encircle the enemy.", "5112": "Cassius, conducting his operations rather with delay and waste of time than with vigour and judgment, was surrounded by the right wing of the enemy;", "5113": "and when he saw that, as soon as the cavalry broke away in flight to the sea, the infantry also were giving way, lie endeavoured to stop and recall them.", "5114": "He also seized the standard from one of the standard-bearers who was flying, and fixed it in the ground before his feet, though even those who were placed about his person no longer remained with any spirit.", "5115": "In these circumstances, being pressed, ho retreated with a few men to a hill which had a view to­ wards the plain.", "5116": "He saw nothing in the plain, or with difficulty the plunder of the camp, for he was weak of vision;", "5117": "but the horsemen around him saw many approach­ ing whom Brutus sent.", "5118": "Cassius conjectured that they were enemies and were in pursuit of him;", "5119": "yet he sent Titinius, one of those who were with him, to see.", "5120": "The horsemen did not fail to observe him approaching, and when they saw a man who was a friend, and faithful to Cassius, they shouted for joy, and some of his friends leap­ ing down from their horses embraced him and took his hand, and the rest riding round him with joyful shouts and clatter by their unmeasured rejoicing produced the greatest misfortune.", "5121": "For Cassius was quite sure that Titinius was caught by the enemy.", "5122": "With these words, “Through love of life have I waited to see a friend seized by the enemy,\" he retired into an empty tent dragging after him one of his freed men, Pindarus, whom, in the un­ fortunate affair of Crassus, he had prepared for this ex­ tremity.", "5123": "Cassius escaped the Parthians, but now drawing his cloak over his head and baring his neck he presented it to be cut asunder;",

of the fate of the general and of his error, he drew his sword and with much upbraiding of himself for his tardiness killed him­ self.", "5128": "XLIV.", "5129": "Brutus, who was acquainted with the defeat of Cassius, was now approaching, and he heard of his death when he was near the camp.", "5130": "After lamenting over the body and calling Cassius the last of the Romans, as if he considered that such a spirit could never again be produced in Rome, he wrapped up the corpse and sent it to Thasos, that no disorder might be produced by its being interred there.", "5131": "He summoned the soldiers together and consoled them ;", "5132": "and seeing that they were deprived of all necessaries he promised them two thousand drachmae apiece in place of what they had lost.", "5133": "The soldiers were encouraged by his words and admired the magnitude of his present;", "5134": "and they accompanied him with shouts as he went away, mag­ nifying him as the only one of the four Imperatores who was un vanquished in battle.", "5135": "And the result proved that he had good reason for trusting to success in the battle;", "5136": "for with a few legions he put to flight all those who opposed him.", "5137": "But if he had employed all his forces in the battle, and the greater part had not passed by the enemy and fallen on the enemy's baggage, it is probable that he would have left no part of the enemy's force un­ vanquished.", "5138": "XLV.", "5139": "There fell on the side of Brutus eight thousand, with the slaves who were with them in the army, whom Brutus called Briges;", "5140": "* and of the enemy Messala says that he thinks more than twice the number fell.", "5141": "For this reason the enemy was the more dispirited, till a slave of Cassius, named Demetrius, came to Antonius as soon as it was evening, having taken the cloaks from the corpse, and the sword;", "5142": "and when these were brought, they were so much encouraged that at daybreak they led forth their force prepared for battle.", "5143": "But as both his armies were in an unsettled and dangerous state (for his own army being full of captives required careful watching, and the army of Cassius was troubled at the loss of their general, and they felt somewhat of envy and dislike in consequence of their defeat towards the army that had been victorious), Brutus resolved to put his troops under arms, but he would not fight.", "5144": "Of the captives, he ordered the slaves to be killed, as they were moving about among the soldiers in a suspicious way;", "5145": "but of the freemen he released some, saying that they had rather been made captives by the enemy, and were captives and slaves there, but with him were free men and citizens;", "5146": "and when he saw that his friends and the officers were ill-disposed towards them, he saved them by concealing them and sending them away.", "5147": "There were a certain Volumnius,* a mime, and Saculio, a jester, among the prisoners, whom Brutus cared not for, and his friends bringing these to him accused them of not abstaining even now from speaking and jeering to insult them.", "5148": "Brutus was silent, being occupied with other thoughts, but Messala Corvinus was of opinion that they should be flogged in a tent, and given up naked to the generals of the enemy, that they might know what kind of drinking companions and intimates they wanted in their campaigns.", "5149": "Some of those who were present laughed;", "5150": "but Publius Casca, who had struck Cæsar first, said, \" We offer no fit sacrifice to Cassius who is dead, by making merry and jesting;", "5151": "but you, Brutus,” he said, \" will show what remembrance you have of the general either by punishing or protecting those who will mock and revile him.\"", "5152": "Upon this Brutus, greatly angered, said, \" Why then do you ask me, Casca, and why don't you do what you like ? \"", "5153": "This answer of Brutus they considered as an assent to the punishment of the unhappy men, whom they led away and put to death.", "5154": "XL VI.", "5155": "After this Brutus gave the soldiers their present, and blaming them mildly for not having waited for the word, and having fallen on the enemy somewhat disorderly without waiting for the order, he promised them if they were victorious to give up to them for plunder and profit two cities, Thessalonica * and Lacedaemon.", "5156": "This is the only thing in the life of Brutus which he is charged with that admits of no defence, though Antonius and Caesar paid to their soldiers a much more terrible price as the reward of their victories, for they drove the old settlers out of nearly the whole of Italy, that their soldiers might have land and cities to which they had no claim.", "5157": "But with Antonius and Cæsar dominion and power was the end which they proposed to themselves in the war, while Brutus, owing to his reputation for virtue, was not allowed by the many either to conquer or to save his life otherwise than by honourable and just means;", "5158": "and especially now that Cassius was dead, who had the imputation of urging Brutus on to some of his more violent acts.", "5159": "But as at sea when the helm is broken, they attempt to nail on other pieces of wood, and to fit them, not skilfully indeed, but as well as they can under circumstances, fighting against the necessity, so Brutus with so great a force around him, and in so hazardous a state of affairs, having no commander of equal weight with himself, was compelled to employ those who were with him, and to do and say many things accord ing to their pleasure.", "5160": "And he judged it fit to do whatever he thought would improve the disposition of the soldiers of Cassius, for they were difficult to manage :", "5161": "in the camp being unruly for want of discipline, and towards the enemy having a feeling of cowardice by reason of their defeat.", "5162": "XLVII.", "5163": "Affairs were no better with Caesar and Antonius, for they were scantily supplied with provisions, and owing to the camp being pitched in a hollow, they expected a bad winter.", "5164": "For being among marshes and the autumnal rains coming on after the battle, they had their tents filled with mud and with water which froze immediately through the cold.", "5165": "While they were in this condition, news arrived of the misfortune that had befallen their forces at sea.", "5166": "For the ships of Brutus * fell upon them, and destroyed a large force that was coming to Cæsar from Italy, and only a very few of the men escaped, who were compelled by famine to eat the sails and ropes.", "5167": "On hearing this news they were eager to settle the matter by a battle before Brutus was aware of the great good fortune that had come to him;", "5168": "for it happened that in the same day the battle by land and the battle by sea were determined.", "5169": "But by some chance rather than through the fault of the commanders of the fleet, Brutus was ignorant of the success, though twenty days had elapsed.", "5170": "For otherwise he would not have gone out to a second battle when he was provided with all necessaries for his army for a long time and was posted in a good position, wherein he could have maintained his army in the winter free from all suffering and safe against the attacks of the enemy, and by being master of the sea, and having defeated by land the troops opposed to him, was in high hopes and spirits.", "5171": "But affairs, as it appears, being no longer governable by a number, and requiring a monarchy, the deity wishing to lead away and to remove the only person who stood in the way of him who was able to govern, cut off the news of that good fortune, though it came exceeding near to being communicated to Brutus.", "5172": "For the day before that on which he was going to fight, and late in the day, there came one Clodius, a deserter from the enemy, who reported, that Cæsar was eager to come to a decisive contest because he had heard of the destruction of his armament.", "5173": "The man got no credit for his report nor did he come into the presence of Brutus, being altogether despised as one who had heard no well-founded news, or reported falsehood to get favour.", "5174": "XLVIII.", "5175": "In that night it is said that the phantom again appeared to Brutus, and displaying the same appear­ ance said nothing and went away.", "5176": "But Publius Volum­ nius,* a philosopher and one who accompanied Brutus in his campaign from the first, says that this was not the sign;", "5177": "but he says that the first eagle was covered with bees, and from the arm of one of the centurions an oil of roses spontaneously burst out, and though they often rubbed it off and wiped it away, it was all to no use.", "5178": "Further, before the battle, two eagles met and fought in the space between the armies, and a silence past belief filled the plain while all were looking on, but at last the eagle which was on the side of Brutus gave way and fled.", "5179": "The Ethiopian became notorious, he who met the eagle-bearer as soon as the gate was opened, and was cut down with their swords by the soldiers, who considered it a bad omen.", "5180": "XLIX.", "5181": "After Brutus had made the line advance, and had placed it in front of the enemy, he paused some time, for suspicions reached him and information against certain persons while he was inspecting the army;", "5182": "and he observed that the cavalry were not very eager to begin the battle, but were still waiting for the infantry to commence the attack.", "5183": "All of a sudden, a man of military skill, who had been particularly distinguished for his courage, rode past Brutus himself and passed over to the enemy :", "5184": "his name was Camulatus.", "5185": "Brutus was greatly pained at seeing this, and partly through passion, partly through fear of greater change and treachery, he forthwith led his men against the enemy, the sun now going down to the ninth hour.", "5186": "Brutus had the advantage with his own troops, and he pushed on, pressing upon the left wing of the enemy which gave way, and the cavalry supported him by charging together with the infantry the disordered ranks;", "5187": "but the other wing, which the commanders extended for fear of being surrounded, was inferior in numbers, and was drawn out in the centre, and thus becoming weak, did not resist the enemy, but fled first.", "5188": "The enemy, having broken this wing, immediately surrounded Brutus, who displayed all the virtues of a general and a soldier, both in his personal exertions, and his prudent measures in the midst of danger to secure victory;", "5189": "but he was damaged by that circumstance whereby he gained advantage in the former battle.", "5190": "For in that battle the part of the enemy which was defeated had perished;", "5191": "but few perished of the troops of Cassius, though they were put to flight, and those who escaped being very timid through their former defeat, filled the chief part of the army with despondency and confusion.", "5192": "On this occasion also, Marcus the son of Cato,* fighting among the noblest and bravest of the youth, though hard pressed, did not yield nor flee, but laying about him and calling out who he was, and his father's name, he fell on a heap of the enemy's slain.", "5193": "There fell, too, the bravest of the men, exposing themselves in defence of Brutus.L.", "5194": "Among the intimates of Brutus was one Lucilius,t a good man.", "5195": "Observing that some barbarian horsemen in their pursuit paid no regal d to the rest, but rode at full speed after Brutus, he resolved at his own risk to stop them.",

barbarians delighted at their success, and considering that they had surprising good luck, conducted the man, and as it was now growing dark, sent forward some of their number as messengers to Antonius.", "5198": "Antonius, much pleased, went to meet those who were conducting Lucilius;", "5199": "and those who heard that Brutus was being brought alive flocked together, some pitying him for his ill fortune, and others thinking it unworthy of his fame to let himself be taken by barbarians through love of life.", "5200": "When they were near, Antonius stopped, being doubtful how he should receive Brutus, but Lucilius, approaching with a cheerful countenance, said, \" Antonius, no enemy has taken Marcus Brutus, nor will:", "5201": "may fortune never have such a victory over virtue.",

severe, for what I have done.\"", "5204": "When Lucilius had said this, and all were in amaze, Antonius, looking on those who conducted Lucilius, said, “ I suppose, fellow soldiers, you are vexed at your mistake, and think that you have been grossly tricked.", "5205": "But be assured that you have taken a better prey than that which you were in search of.", "5206": "For while you were seeking for an enemy, you have brought us a friend ;", "5207": "for as to Brutus, I know not by the gods, what I should have done with him if he were alive, but such men as this, I pray that I may have as friends rather than as enemies.\"", "5208": "Saying this he embraced Lucilius and for the time placed him with one of his friends, but he afterwards employed him, and found him in everything faithful and true.", "5209": "LI.", "5210": "Brutus, having crossed a certain stream, the banks of which were lined with wood and steep, just when it began to be dark, did not advance far, but seating himself in a hollow spot where there was a large rock spread out, with a few of his officers and friends about him, first looked up to the heavens which were full of stars, and uttered two verses, one of which

Brutus conjectured that no great number of his men had fallen, Statyllius* undertook to make his way secretly through the enemy, for it was not possible in any other way, and to inspect the camp, and after raising a fire- signal, if he should find all safe there, to come back to him.", "5221": "The fire-signal was raised, for Statyllius got to the camp, but as a long time elapsed and he did not

\" Certainly we must fly, yet not with the feet, but with the hands.\"", "5227": "Offering his right hand to each with a cheerful countenance, he said that he felt great pleasure, that no one of his friends had deceived him, but he blamed fortune with respect to his country;", "5228": "as for himself, he considered that he was happier than the conquerors, in that not yesterday nor yet recently, but even now he left behind him a reputa­ tion for virtue, which those would not leave behind who gained the victory by arms or by money, nor would they make people think that unjust and vile men who had de­ stroyed just and upright men did not rule unmeritedly.", "5229": "After entreating and urging them to save themselves, he retired a little farther with two or three, among whom was Strato who had become intimate with him from being his instructor in rhetoric.", "5230": "Putting Stiato close to him, and pressing the bare sword with both hands on the handle, he fell upon it and died.",

men's lives, it is especially to be noticed, that each of them started from small beginnings, and yet raised himself to the highest position in the state;", "5244": "and this fact is peculiarly honourable to Dion.", "5245": "Brutus owed much of his success to the help of Caseins, who, though less trustworthy than Brutus in matters of virtue and honour, gave equal proofs of courage, skill, and energy in war, while some writers go so far as to give him the entire credit of the plot against Cæsar, and say that Brutus had no share in it.", "5246": "Dion on the other hand was obliged to provide himself with friends and fellow conspirators, no less than with arms, ships, and soldiers.", "5247": "Furthermore, Dion did not, like Brutus, gain wealth and power by the revolution and war which he began, but even gave his own money to support the war, and spent the property on which he might have lived comfortably in exile in order to make his countrymen free.", "5248": "We must remember, also, that Brutus and Cassius could not have remained quiet after they left Rome, for they had been condemned to death, and were being pursued, so that they were forced to fight in their own defence.", "5249": "When they risked their lives in battle it was for themselves that they did so more than for their countrymen, whereas Dion lived in exile more happily than the despot who banished him, and nevertheless exposed himself to so terrible a hazard in order to set Sicily free.", "5250": "II.", "5251": "Yet it was not the same thing to free the Syracusana from Dionysius and to rid the Romans of Cæsar.", "5252": "Dionysius never denied that he was a despot, and had inflicted countless miseries upon Sicily:", "5253": "while the government of Cæsar, though its creation gave great offence, yet when it had been accepted and had overcome all opposition seemed to be a despotism merely in name, for Cæsar did nothing cruel or arbitrary, and rather appeared to have been sent by heaven like a physician, to establish an absolute mon­ archy in as mild a form as possible, at a time when that remedy was necessary for Rome.", "5254": "In consequence of this the people of Rome were grieved at the death of Cæsar, and showed themselves harsh and inexorable to his mur­ derers;", "5255": "while the severest charges which were brought against Dion by his countrymen were that he had allowed Dionysius to escape from Syracuse, and that he had not destroyed the tomb of the former despot.", "5256": "III.", "5257": "In actual warfare Dion proved himself a faultless general, as he succeeded brilliantly in every enterprise planned by himself, and was able to remedy the failures caused by the misconduct of others ;", "5258": "while Brutus seems not to have been wise in engaging in the last decisive battle, and when it was lost did not attempt to retrieve his fortunes, but gave himself up to despair, showing even less confidence than Pompeius.", "5259": "Yet, his position was far from hopeless, for he still retained a large part of his army, and a fleet which gave him entire command of the sea.", "5260": "Again,", "5261": "Dion cannot be accused of any crime like that which is the greatest blot upon the character of Brutus, who after his life had been saved by Cæsar's goodness, and he had been allowed to save as many as he pleased of his fellow captives, after also he had been regarded by Cæsar as his friend, and had been promoted by Cæsar above many others, murdered his benefactor.", "5262": "On the contrary, Dion was the relative and friend of Dionysius, and assisted him in maintaining his government, and it was not until he was expelled from his country, his wife wronged, and his property confiscated, that he openly began a most just and lawful war against the despot.", "5263": "Is there not, however, another view of this question?", "5264": "That hatred of despotism and wrong which is so highly honoured, was possessed by Brutus pure and unalloyed by personal motives, for he had no private grudge against Cæsar, and yet risked his life on behalf of the liberty of the people :", "5265": "while Dion would never have made war against Dionysius, if he had not been wronged by him.", "5266": "This we learn distinctly from PJato's letters, which prove that Dion did not begin his revolt until he was banished by Dionysius, after which he deposed the tyrant.", "5267": "A common object made Brutus become the friend of Pompeius, who was Cæsar's enemy both personally and politically, for Brutus made men his friends or his enemies solely according to what he thought right:", "5268": "while Dion assisted Dionysius much while he was on friendly terms with him, and only made war against him out of anger at his loyalty being suspected.", "5269": "For this reason many even of his own friends believed that after removing Dionysius from the throne he intended to succeed him, and to reign though under some title more plausible than that of despot;", "5270": "while even the enemies of Brutus admitted that he alone of all the conspirators against Cæsar kept one object con­ sistently in view, which was to restore to the Romans their ancient constitution.", "5271": "IV.", "5272": "Apart from these considerations the struggle against Dionysius was different from that against Cæsar.", "5273": "Diony­ sius was despised even by his own associates for wasting all his time with drink, dice, and women ;", "5274": "whereas it shows a certain magnanimity, and a spirit undismayed by any danger, to have conceived the idea of dethroning Caesar, and not to have been overawed by the wisdom, power, and good fortune of a man whose very name made the kings of Parthia and India uneasy in their sleep.", "5275": "As soon as Dion appeared in bicily, thousands joined him to attack Diony­ sins, while the power of Cæsar's name even after his death rallied his friends, and enabled a helpless child to become at once the first of the Romans by assuming it, as though it were a talisman to protect him against the might and hatred of Antonius.", "5276": "If it be said that Dion only drove out Diony­ sius after many fierce battles, whereas Brutus stabbed Cæsar when he was naked and unguarded, yet it was in itself a brilliant piece of generalship to have attacked so powerful a man when he was naked and unguarded:", "5277": "for he did not attack him on a sudden impulse, or alone, or even with a few associates;", "5278": "but the plot had been laid long before, and many were concerned in it, yet none be­ trayed him.", "5279": "Either lie chose only the bravest men, or else the mere fact of their having been chosen and trusted by Brutus made them brave.", "5280": "Dion on the other hand trusted worthless men;", "5281": "and this is discreditable to his judgment, for they must either have been villains when he chose them for his followers, or else they must have been originally good, and have become worse during their connection with him.", "5282": "Plato indeed blames him for choosing such men for his friends, and at last he was murdered by them.", "5283": "V.", "5284": "No one avenged

his enemy within their walls.", "5288": "They at first, as may be imagined, denied the charge, and looked at one another, not knowing to whom he alluded.", "5289": "Augustus now turned round towards the statue, and, knitting his brows, asked, \" Is not this my enemy who stands here ? \"", "5290": "At this the magistrates were even more abashed, and re­ mained silent.", "5291": "Augustus, however,

is absurd, since, if he could have obtained it from no other source, his mother was always ready to supply him, and used to give as much as he wanted from her own income.", "5324": "His wealth also is proved by the large mercenary force which, we learn from Xenophon, was enlisted by his friends and guests in many different places:", "5325": "for he never collected it together, as he wished to conceal his preparations, but he kept many persons in different places who recruited soldiers for him on various pretexts.", "5326": "His mother, who was present at court, lulled the king's suspicions, and Cyrus himself constantly wrote to him in dutiful terms, asking him to grant certain matters, and bringing accu­ sations against Tissaphernes, as though it was Tissaphernes of whom he were jealous and with whom he had a quarrel.", "5327": "There was also a certain slowness in the disposition of the king, which was mistaken by the people for good nature.", "5328": "At the beginning of his reign, he seemed inclined to rival the gentleness of his namesake, as he made himself pleasant to all whom he met, distributed honours and favours even beyond men's deserts, took no delight in in­ sulting and torturing evil-doers, and showed himself as affable and courteous to those from whom he received favours as he was to those upon whom he bestowed them.", "5329": "No present was so trifling that he did not receive it gladly, but even when a man named Onisus brought him a pome­ granate of unusual size, he said, \" By Mithras, if this man were given the charge of a small city he would soon make it great!\"V. When during one of his journeys all men were bringing him presents, a labouring man, not finding any­ thing else to give, ran to the river, took up some of the water in his two hands and offered it to him.", "5330": "Artaxerxes was pleased with the man, and sent him a gold drinking­ cup and a thousand darics.", "5331": "When Eukleidas the Lace­ dæmonian had spoken his mind very freely to him, he bade his general say to him, “ You may say what you please, but I may both say and do what I please.\"", "5332": "Once when they were hunting, Teribazus pointed out to him that his coat was torn.", "5333": "Artaxerxes asked what was to be done, to which Teribazus answered, “ Put on another coat, and give this one to me.\"", "5334": "He replied, \"I will give it to you, Teribazus, but I forbid you to wear it.\"", "5335": "Teribazus, however, who was a loyal subject, but careless and flighty, immediately put on the coat, and ornamented himself with women's nooklaces belonging to the king, so that all men were disgusted with him, for it was not lawful to do so.", "5336": "The king, however, laughed, and said, \" I allow you to wear the jewelry as a woman, and the coat as a fool.\"", "5337": "Though no one eats at the same table with the king of Persia except his mother, who sits above him, or his wedded wife, who sits below him, Artaxerxes invited his younger brothers also, Ostanes and Oxathres, to sit at the same table.", "5338": "One of the sights which especially delighted the Persians was the carriage in which Statira, the wife of Artaxerxes, drove, with the curtains drawn back, for the queen allowed the people to greet her and approach her, and was much beloved by them in consequence.", "5339": "VI.", "5340": "However, all turbulent and unsettled spirits thought that the empire required Cyrus at its head, since he was a brilliant and warlike prince, a staunch friend to his comrades, and a man of intellect and ambition, capable of wielding the enormous power of Persia.", "5341": "Cyrus, when he began the war, relied upon the attachment of the people of the interior of Asia as much as he did upon that of his own followers;", "5342": "and he wrote to the Lacedæmonians, begging them to help him and to send soldiers to him, declaring that if the soldiers came to him on foot, he would give them horses, and if they came on horseback, he would give them carriages and pairs, that if they possessed fields, he would give them villages, and if they possessed villages he would give them cities;", "5343": "and that his soldiers' pay should be given them by measure, instead of being counted out to them.", "5344": "At the same time he boasted loudly about himself, averring that he had'a greater heart than his brother, was a better philosopher, and was a more learned Magian, and also that he could drink and carry more wine than his brother, who, he declared, was so lazy and cowardly that he would not even mount a horse when hunting, or a throne in time of peril.", "5345": "The Lacedæmonians now sent a skytale* to Klearchus, bidding him obey the bidding of Cyrus in all things.", "5346": "Cyrus marched against the King of Persia with a large force and nearly thirteen thousand Greek mercenary troops, whom he had engaged upon various pretences.", "5347": "His treason was not long un­ discovered, for Tissaphernes went in person to tell the king of it, upon which there was a terrible scene of dis­ order in the palace, since Parysatis was blamed as being the chief instigator of the war, and her friends were all v lowed with suspicion as traitors.", "5348": "Parysatis was especially enraged by the reproaches of Statira, who asked her loudly, \"Where now are the pledges you gave us?", "5349": "What has come of the entreaties by which you begged off Cyrus when he plotted against his brother's life, now that you have plunged us into war and misery ? \"", "5350": "In consequence of these reproaches Parysatis conceived a vehement hatred for Statira, and being of a fierce passionate unforgiving temper, she plotted her destruction.", "5351": "Deinon states that she effected her purpose during the war, but Ktesias says that she did the deed afterwards, and I shall adopt his account of the matter, for it is not probable that he, who was an eye-witness of these events, did not know the order in which they took place, or that in his history he should have had any reason for misrepresenting them, although he often departs from the exact truth with a view to dramatic effect.", "5352": "VII.", "5353": "As Cyrus marched onwards, many rumours and ] eports were brought to him, that the king had determined not to fight at once, and was not anxious to meet him in battle, but that he intended to remain in Persia until his forces had assembled there from all parts of the empire.", "5354": "Indeed, although he had dug a trench across the plain ten fathoms wide, as many deep, and four hundred stadia long, yet he remained quiet and permitted Cyrus to cross it, and to march close to Babylon itself.", "5355": "Teribazus, we are told, was the first who ventured to tell the king that he ought not to avoid a battle, and retreat from Media and from Babylon, and even from Susa itself into Persia, when he possessed an army many times as great as that of the enemy, and numberless satraps and generals who were better generals and better soldiers than Cyrus.", "5356": "Upon hearing this advice, the king determined to fight as soon as possible.", "5357": "At first his sudden appearance with a splendidly equipped force of nine hundred thousand men caused great surprise and confusion among the rebels, who had gained such confidence that they were marching without their arms ;", "5358": "and it was not without much shouting and disorder that Cyrus was able to rally them and place them in array.", "5359": "The king moved forward slowly and in silence, so that the Greeks were filled with admiration at the discipline of his army, for they had expected that in such a host there would be disorderly shouts and irregularity and intervals in the line-", "5360": "The strongest of the scythed chariots were judiciously posted by Artaxerxes in front of his line, in order that before the two armies engaged hand to hand they might break the enemy's ranks by the force of their charge.", "5361": "VIII.", "5362": "The battle- has been described by many writers, and as Xenophon's narrative is so clear that the reader seems almost to be present, and to see the different events in the act of taking place, it would be folly for me to do more than to mention some important particulars which he has omitted.", "5363": "The place where the two armies met is called Kunaxa, and is five hundred stadia distant from Babylon.", "5364": "Before the battle Klearchus is said to have advised Cyrus to post himself behind the ranks of the soldiers, and not to risk his life ;", "5365": "to which Cyrus replied “", "5366": "What say you, Klearchus?", "5367": "Just when I am striving to win a kingdom, do you bid me prove myself unworthy of one ?\"", "5368": "In the action itself, though Cyrus made a great mistake in plung­ ing so rashly into the midst of the enemy without re­ garding the risk that he ran, yet Klearchus was quite as much, if not more to blame for not arraying his Greeks opposite to the Persian king, and for resting his right wing upon the river for fear he should be surrounded.", "5369": "If he valued safety more than anything else, and cared only to avoid the slightest risk of loss, he had better have stayed at home;", "5370": "but after he had marched ten thousand stadia from the sea, under no compulsion, but solely in order to place Cyrus upon the throne of Persia, then to be solicitous, not for a post where he might win the victory for his chief and paymaster, but merely for one where he might fight without exposing himself, was to act like a man who, on the first appearance of danger, abandons the whole enter­ prise and gives up the object for which the expedition was made.", "5371": "It is abundantly clear from what took place, that if the Greeks had charged the troops who defended the king'is person, they would have met with no resistance, and if these men had been routed, and the king slain or forced to take flight, Cyrus's victory would at once have placed him on the throne.", "5372": "It was, therefore, the over­ caution of Klearchus more than the rashness of Cyrus which really caused the death of the latter and the ruin of his cause;", "5373": "for the Persian King himself could not, if he had wished, have placed the Greeks in a position where they could do him less harm, for they were so far away from him and his main body that he did not even perceive that they had routed their antagonists, and Cyrus was slain before Klearchus could reap any advantage from his victory.", "5374": "Yet Cyrus knew what was best, for he ordered Klearchus to post his men in the centre;", "5375": "but Klearchus, saying that he would manage as well as he could, ruined everything.", "5376": "IX.", "5377": "The Greeks put the Persians to flight with the greatest ease, and pursued them for a long distance.", "5378": "Cyrus, as he rode forward, mounted upon a spirited, but hard-mouthed and unmanageable horse, which, we learn from Ktesias was named Pasakas, was met by Artagerses, the leader of the Kadousians, who shouted loudly, saying, “ Most wicked and foolish of men, who hast disgraced the name of Cyrus, erst the noblest in Persia, and bringest thy base Greeks on a base errand, to plunder the good things of the Persians, and to slay thy brother and thy lord, who hath ten thousand times ten thousand slaves, each one better than thou art.", "5379": "Soon shalt thou find out the truth of this;", "5380": "for before thou seest the king's face thou shalt lose thine own head.\"", "5381": "Saying thus, he hurled his javelin against Cyrua, but his breastplate resisted the blow, and Cyrus was not wounded, although he reeled in his saddle from the violence of the stroke.", "5382": "As Artagerses wheeled round his horse, Cyrus struck him with a javelin, driving the point through his throat, beside the collar-bone.", "5383": "That Artagerses was slain by Cyrus nearly all historians agree, but as to the death of Cyrus himself, since Xenophon has described it very shortly, as he was not an eye-witness of it, we may as well give the accounts of it which Deinon and which Ktesias have written.", "5384": "X.", "5385": "Deinon says that when Artagerses fell, Cyrus charged violently among the troops round the king, and wounded the king's horse.", "5386": "Artaxerxes was thrown from his horse, but Teribazus quickly mounted him upon another horse, saying, \" My king, remember this day, for you ought not to forget it.\"", "5387": "Artaxerxes, he states, was again thrown from his horse by the vehement onset of Cyrus, and again mounted.", "5388": "At the third charge the king who was violently enraged, and cried out to those around him that it was better to die than be treated thus, rode straight against Cyrus, who rashly and heedlessly exposed himself to the missiles of his enemies, The king hurled a dart at Cyrus, and so did all his followers.", "5389": "Cyrus fell, struck, some say by the king himself, but according to others he was slain by a Carian soldier, on whom the king afterwards, as a reward for this feat of arms, bestowed the honour of marching at the head of the army, carrying a golden cock upon a spear.", "5390": "Indeed the Persians call the Carinis themselves cocks, because of the plumes with which they ornament their helmets.", "5391": "XI.", "5392": "The story of Ktesias, reduced to a succinct form, is as follows:", "5393": "—Cyrus, after slaying Artagerses, rode towards the king himself, and the king rode towards him, both of them in silence.", "5394": "Ariæus, the friend of Cyrus, struck the king first but did not wound him.", "5395": "The king hurled his spear and missed Cyrus, but struck Satiphernes, a man of noble birth and a trusted friend of Cyrus, and slew him.", "5396": "Cyrus hurled his javelin at the king, drove it through his breastplate, making a wound in his breast two fingers’ breadths deep, and cast him from his horse.", "5397": "Upon this there was much disorder, and many took to flight.", "5398": "The king rose, and with a few followers, among whom was Ktesias, took refuge on a hill hard by.", "5399": "Meanwhile Cyrus was carried by his horse a long distance forward into the midst of his enemies, and, as it was now growing dark, he was not recognised by his foes, and was being sought for in vain by his friends.", "5400": "Excited by his victory, and full of spirit and pride, he rode about through the ranks, crying, \" Out of my way, wretches.\"", "5401": "As Cyrus shouted these words in Persian, some made way for him, but the tiara fell from his head, and a young man named Mithridates, not know­ ing who he was, hurled a javelin and struck him on the temple near the eye.", "5402": "The wound bled profusely, and Cyrus became dizzy and faint, so that he fell from his horse.", "5403": "The horse rushed away from him and was lost, but the servant of the man who struck Cyrus took up his saddle-cloth, which fell from his horse, and which was drenched with blood.", "5404": "When Cyrus began to recover from the effects of this blow, some few of his eunuchs tried to mount him upon another horse and get him safe away from the field.", "5405": "As, however, he could not mount, he proposed to walk, and the eunuchs supported him as he went, faint and weak in his body, but still imagining himself to be the victor as he heard the fugitives calling Cyrus their king and begging him for mercy.", "5406": "At this time certain men of Kaunus, of mean and low condition, who followed the king's army to perform menial services, happened to join the party with Cyrus, supposing them to be friends.", "5407": "When, however, they managed to distinguish that the surcoats which they wore over their armour were purple, while all the king's soldiers wore white ones, they per­ ceived that they were enemies.", "5408": "One of them ventured to strike Cyrus from behind with a spear, not knowing who he was.", "5409": "The javelin struck Cyrus behind the knee, cutting the vein there, and in his fall he also struck his wounded temple against a stone, and so died.", "5410": "This is the story of Ktesias, in which he seems, as it were, to hack poor Cyrus to death with a blunt sword.", "5411": "XII.", "5412": "When Cyrus was dead it happened that Artasyras, who was called the king's eye,* rode past.",

you not see that it is Cyrus, who is dead ? \"", "5415": "Artasyras was aston­ ished at this news, bade the eunuch be of good courage and guard the body, and himself rode in haste to Artaxerxes, who had given up all hope of success, and was in great bodily suffering from his wound and from thirst.", "5416": "Artasyras, with great delight, told him that he had seen Cyrus lying dead.", "5417": "On hearing this Artaxerxes at first wished to go to see it himself, and bade Artasyras lead him to the spot;", "5418": "but as there was much talk and fear of the Greeks, who were said to be advancing and carrying all before them;", "5419": "he decided to send a party to view the body;", "5420": "and thirty men went carrying torches.", "5421": "Meanwhile, as the king him­ self was almost dying of thirst the eunuch Satibarzanes went in search of drink for him ;", "5422": "for there was no water in the place where he was, nor indeed anywhere near the army.", "5423": "After much trouble the eunuch at length fell in with one of the low Kaunian camp followers, who had about four pints of putrid water in a skin, which he took from the man and carried it to the king.", "5424": "When the king had drunk it all, he asked him if he was not disgusted with the water;", "5425": "and the king swore by the gods that he never had drank either wine or the purest of water with such pleasure.",

began to assemble round him, and descended from the hill amidst the glare of many torches.", "5430": "When he reached the body, the head and right hand were cut off, in accordance with some Persian custom.", "5431": "He ordered the head to be brought to him, took hold of it by the long thick hair, and showed it to those who were still wavering or fleeing.", "5432": "They all were filled with amazement, and did homage to him, so that he soon collected a force of seventy thousand men, accompanied by whom he re-entered his camp.", "5433": "He had left it in the morning, according to Ktesias, with an army of four hundred thousand men;", "5434": "though Deinon and Xeno­ phon both estimate the forces actually engaged at a higher figure.", "5435": "Etesias states that the number of the dead was returned to Artaxerxes as nine thousand, but that he himself thought that the corpses which he saw lying on the field must amount to more than twenty thousand.", "5436": "This point admits of discussion;", "5437": "but Ktesias tells an obvious untruth when he says that he was sent on an embassy to the Greeks, together with Phalinus of Zakyn­ thus, and some other persons.", "5438":

presents to Artagerses, the son of the man who had been slain by Cyrus, and handsomely rewarded Ktesias and the rest of his companions.", "5442": "He sought out the Kaunian from whom he had received the water-skin, who was a poor and humble man, and made him rich and honoured.", "5443": "He also took pains to appoint suitable punishments to those who had misconducted themselves.", "5444": "One Arbakes, a Mede, deserted to Cyrus during the battle, and when Cyrus fell again returned to his allegiance.", "5445": "Artaxerxes, perceiving that he had done so not from treachery but from sheer cowardice, ordered him to carry a naked courtesan about the market-place upon his shoulders for the whole of one day.", "5446": "Another deserter, who besides changing sides falsely boasted that he had slain two of the enemy, was condemned by the king to have his tongue pierced with three needles.", "5447": "As Artaxerxes believed, and wished all men to think that he had himself slain Cyrus, he sent presents to Mithridates, who was the first man that wounded Cyrus, and bade those who carried the presents say, \"The king honours you with these presents, because you found Cyrus's saddle-cloth and brought it to him.\"", "5448": "And when the Carian, who had struck Cyrus under the knee, demanded a present, he bade those who carried the presents say, “ The king gives you these for having been

again overruled by Statira, and put them all to death except Menon.", "5520": "It was in consequence of this, according to Ktesias, that Parysatis began to plot against Statira,and devised the plan for poisoning her, though it seems very unlikely that it was only for the sake of Klear­ chus that she dared to do such wickedness as to murder the lawful wife of her king, who was the mother of the heirs to the throne.", "5521": "But clearly all this was written merely for dramatic effect, to do honour to the memory of Klearchus.", "5522": "Ktesias writes, too, that when the generals were put to death the remains of the others were thrown away to be devoured by the dogs and fowls of the air;", "5523": "but that a violent storm of wind heaped much earth over the body of Klear­ chus, and that from some dates which were scattered around there soon sprung up a fair and shady grove above the place where he lay, so that the king sorely repented of what he had done, thinking that in Klearchus he had slain one who was a favourite of the gods.", "5524": "XIX.", "5525": "Parysatis, who had long been jealous of Statira and hated her, and who saw that her own power depended merely on the respect with which she was regarded by the king, who loved and trusted Statira, now determined to destroy her, though at the most terrible risk to herself.", "5526": "She had a faithful maid-servant, named Gigis, who was high in her favour, whom Demon accuses of having assisted to administer the poison, though Ktesias says that she was only privy to the plot, and that against her will.", "5527": "Ktesias says that the man who procured the poison was named Belitaris, but Demon calls him Melantas.", "5528": "Now the two queens, leaving off their former hatred and suspicion, began again to visit one another and to dine together, but yet mistrusted each other so much that they only ate the same food from the same dishes.", "5529": "There is in Persia a small bird, which has no excrements, but all its entrails are filled with solid fat;", "5530": "it is supposed that it feeds upon air and dew;", "5531": "the name of it is rhyntakes.", "5532": "Ktesias states that Parysatis cut this bird in two with a small knife, one side of which was smeared over with the poison.", "5533": "As she cut it, she wiped the poison off the blade on to one piece of the bird, which she gave to Statira, while she ate the untouched portion herself.", "5534": "Deinon, however, says that it was not Parysatis, but Melantas, who cut off the poisoned part of the meat and gave it to Statira.", "5535": "As Statira perished in dreadful agonies and convulsions, she herself perceived that she had been poisoned, and directed the suspicions of the king against his mother, knowing, as ho did, her fierce and rancorous disposition.", "5536": "He at once began to search for the author of the crime, seized all his mother's servants and the attendants at her table, and put them to the torture, except Gigis, whom Parysatis kept for a long time at home with herself, and refused to deliver up, though afterwards, when Gigis begged to be sent tc her own home, the king heard of it, laid an ambuscade, caught her, and condemned her to death.", "5537": "Poisoners are put to death in Persia in the following manner:", "5538": "their heads are placed upon a flat stone, and are then beaten with another stone until the face and skull is crushed.", "5539": "Gigis perished in this manner;", "5540": "but Artaxerxes said and did nothing to Parysatis, except that he sent her to Babylon, at her own request, saying that he himself should not see Babylon as long as she lived.", "5541": "Such were the domestic troubles of Artaxerxes.XX.", "5542": "Though the king was as anxious to get the Greek troops, who accompanied Cyrus, into his power as he had been to conquer Cyrus himself and to save his throne, yet he could not do so :", "5543": "for though they had lost their leader, Cyrus, and all their generals, yet they got away safe after having penetrated almost as far as the king's palace itself, proving clearly to the world that the Persian empire, in spite of all its gold and luxury and beautiful women, was mere empty bombast without any real strength.", "5544": "Upon this all Greece took courage and despised the Asiatics, while the Lacedæmonians felt that it would be a disgrace to them not to set free the enslaved Greeks of Asia Minor, and put a stop to the insolence of the Persians.", "5545": "Their army was at first commanded by Thimbron, and afterwards by Derkyllidas, but as neither of these effected anything of importance, they entrusted the conduct of the war to their king Agesilaus.", "5546": "He crossed over to Asia with the fleet, and at once began to act with vigour.", "5547": "He gained much glory, defeated Tissaphernes, and set free the Greek cities from the Persians.", "5548": "Artaxerxes, upon this, having carefully considered how it would be best for him to contend with the Greeks, sent Timokrates of Rhodes into Greece with a large sum of money, and ordered him to corrupt the most important persons in each city by offering bribes to them, and to stir up the Greeks to make war against Lacedæmon.", "5549": "Timokrates did so, and as the greatest states formed a league, and Peloponnesus was in great confusion, the goverment ordered Agesilaus to return from Asia.", "5550": "On his departure on this occasion he is said to have remarked to his friends that he was being-driven out of Asia by the King of Persia with thirty thousand archers;",

his admiral in conjunction with Pharnaba­ zus.", "5554": "Konon, after the battle of Ægospotami, had retired to Cyprus, where he remained, not so much in order to ensure his own safety as to watch for a favourable oppor­ tunity, as one waits for the turn of the tide.", "5555": "Observing that while he possessed skill without power, the King of Persia possessed power without an able man to direct it, he wrote a letter to the king expressing these ideas.", "5556": "Ho ordered the man who carried the letter to make it reach the king, if possible, by the hands of Zeno the Cretan, 01 of Polykritus of Mende.", "5557": "Of these men, Zeno was a dancer, and Polykritus a physician.", "5558": "If these men should be absent he ordered the man to give the letter to Ktesias the physician.", "5559": "It is said that Ktesias received the letter and that he added to what Konon had writen a paragraph bidding the king send Ktesias to him, as he would be a useful person to superintend naval operations.", "5560": "Ktesias, however, says that the king of his own accord appointed him to this service.", "5561": "Artaxerxes, now, by means of Pharnabazus and Konon, gained the sea-fight of Knidos, deprived the Lacedæmonians of the empire of the sea, and established so great an ascendancy over the Greeks that he was able to conclude with them the celebrated peace which was known as the peace of Antalkidas.", "5562": "This Antalkidas was a Spartan, the son of Leon ;", "5563": "and he being entirely in the interests of the King of Persia, prevailed upon the Lacedæmonians to allow him to possess all the Greek cities in Asia, and all the islands off the coast, as his subjects and tributaries, as the result of the peace, if that can be called a peace, which was really an insult and betrayal of Greece to the enemy;", "5564": "for no war could have ended more disgracefully for the vanquished.", "5565": "XXII.", "5566": "It follows from this that Artaxerxes, who, we learn from Deinon, always disliked all other Spartans, and thought them the most insolent of mankind, when he visited Persia, showed especial favour to Antalkidas.", "5567": "Once, after dinner, he took a garland of flowers, dipped it in the most valuable perfume, and sent it to Antalkidas.", "5568": "All men wondered at this mark of favour;", "5569": "but, it appears, Antalkidas was just the man to receive such presents, and to be corrupted by the luxury of the Persians, as he did not scruple to disgrace the memory of Leonidas and Kali­ kratidas by his conduct among them.", "5570": "When some one said to Agesilaus, “ Alas for Hellas, when the Lacedæ­ monians are Medising.\"", "5571": "Agesilans answered \"", "5572": "Is it not rather the Medes that are Laconising.”", "5573": "Yet the clever­ ness of this retort did not take away the disgrace of the transaction, for, though the Lacedæmonians lost their empire at the battle of Leuktra by their bad generalship, yet the glory of Sparta was lost before, by that shameful treaty.", "5574": "While Sparta was the leading state in Greece, Artaxerxes made Antalkidas his guest, and spoke of him as his friend;", "5575": "but when after the defeat at Leuktra the Lacedæmonians were humbled to the dust, and were in such distress for money that they sent Agesilaus to Egypt to serve for hire, Antalkidas again came to the court of Artaxerxes to beg him to help the Lacedæmonians.", "5576": "But Artaxerxes treated him with such neglect, and so con­ temptuously refused his request, that Antalkidas, on his return, jeered at by his enemies, and afraid moreover of the anger of the Ephors, starved himself to death.", "5577": "There went also to the King of Persia Ismenias of Thebes, and Pelopidas who had just won the battle of Leuktra.", "5578": "Pelop­ idas would not disgrace himself by any show of servility;", "5579": "but Ismenias, when ordered to do reverence to the king, dropped his ring, and then stooped to pick it up, so that he appeared to bow to the earth before him.", "5580": "Artaxerxes was so much pleased with Timagoras of Athens, who gave some secret intelligence in a letter which he sent by a secretary named Beluris, that he gave him a thousand darics, and, as he was in weak health and required milk sent eighty milch cows to accompany him.", "5581": "He also sent him a bed with bed-clothes and attendants to make it, as though Greeks did not know how, and bearers to carry him in a litter down to the sea-coast, on account of his indisposition.", "5582": "When he was at court, also, the king sent him a magnificent banquet, so that the king's brother, Ostanes, said to him, \" Timagoras, remember this table;", "5583": "for it is not for slight services that it is so splendidly set out.\"",

in consequence of an intrigue of Parysatis;", "5589": "for Artaxerxes did not long continue angry with his mother, but became reconciled with her, and sent for her to his court, as he felt that her understanding and spirit would help him to govern, while there remained no further causes of variance between them.", "5590": "Henceforth she en­ deavoured in everything to please the king, and gained great influence with him by never opposing any of his wishes.", "5591": "She now perceived that he was violently enamoured of one of his own daughters, named Atossa, but that, chiefly on his mother's account, he concealed his love and restrained himself, though some historians state that he had already had some secret commerce with the girl.", "5592": "When Parysatis suspected this, she caressed the girl more than ever, and was continually praising her beauty and good qualities to the king, saying that she was a noble lady and fit to be a queen.", "5593": "At last she persuaded him into marrying the girl and proclaiming her as his lawful wife, disregarding the opinions and customs of the Greeks, and declaring that he himself was a law to the Persians and able to decide for himself

shall shortly afterwards make mention.", "5595": "Atossa lived with her father as his wife, and was so much beloved by him, that when leprosy broke out over her body he was not at all disgusted with her, but prayed for her to Hera alone of all the goddesses, prostrating himself in her temple and grasping the earth with his hands, while he ordered his satraps and friends to send so many presents to the goddess, that all the space between the palace and the temple, a distance of sixteen stadia (two English miles was filled with gold and silver, and horses, and purple dyed stuffs.", "5596":

her, \" Do you not see that this is the only ladylike and respectable one of them all.\"", "5636": "After this he became much attached to her, loved her above all other women, and used to call her “

time he was honoured as one of the greatest men in the kingdom, and then swaggered insufferably, while when he was disgraced and reduced to poverty he could not bear his reverse of fortune with a good grace, but became insolent and offensive.", "5653": "XXVIII.", "5654": "It may be imagined that the company of Teribazus was to Darius as fuel to fire, for Teribazus was constantly repeating to him that it was of no use for him to wear his tiara upright if he did not mean to advance his own interests, and that he was a fool if he imagined that he could inherit the crown without a struggle when his brother was bringing female influence to bear to secure his own succession, and when his father was in such a vacillating and uncertain frame of mind.", "5655": "He who could break the laws of the

honourable and influential men.", "5704": "But as soon as a settled form of government began to be established, Timokleides died, and Abantidas, the son of Paseas, in order to obtain the supreme power for himself, assassinated Kleinias, and either banished or put to death all his i elatives and friends.", "5705": "He endeavoured to kill Kleinias's son, Aratus, who was left an orphan at the age of seven;", "5706": "however, during the confusion which prevailed in the house, the child wandered out into the city, and, terrified and help­ less, made his way unnoticed into the house of Soso, Aban­ tidas's sister, whose husband was Prophantus, the brother of Kleinias.", "5707": "She was naturally a high-souled lady, and thought also that the child must have been directed by heaven to take refuge in her house.", "5708": "She hid him from his enemies, and that night sent him away to Argos.", "5709": "III.", "5710": "This adventurous escape from so terrible a danger produced in the mind of Aratus the fiercest hatred of all despots.", "5711": "He was brought up by his father's friends at Argos in a manner becoming his birth, and as lie grew up tall and strong, he devoted himself to gymnastic exercises in the palæstra, and even gained a crown for success in the pentathlum.", "5712": "We can trace the effects of this training in his statues, which represent an intellectual and com­ manding countenance, and also the effects of the liberal diet and work- with the spade practised by the pro­ fessional athlete.", "5713": "For this reason he paid less attention to oratory than became a public man;", "5714": "yet he was a better speaker than some suppose, which is proved by the study of his hastily and plainly-written memoirs.", "5715": "As time went on, Deinias and Aristotle the logician formed a plot against Abantidas, who was accustomed to come and spend his leisure time in the open market-place with them, listening to their discourse and arguing with them.", "5716": "They drew him into a discussion and assassinated him.", "5717": "He was succeeded by his father, Pascas, who was soon treacherously slain by Nikokles, who now declared himself despot of Sikyon.", "5718": "We are told that this man was singularly like Periander, the son of Kypselus, just as the Persian Orontes bore a striking resemblance to Alkmæon, the son of Amphiaraus, and a certain young Spartan so closely resembled Hector, that he was trampled to death by the multitudes who came to see him and satisfy their curiosity.", "5719": "IV.", "5720": "Nikokles reigned four months, during which time he did the city much hurt, and very nearly lost it to the Ætolians, who had formed a plot to surprise it.", "5721": "Aratus was now nearly grown up, and possessed great influence, both on account of his noble birth, and because he was already well known to be possessed of an enterprising spirit, combined with a prudence beyond his years.", "5722": "In consequence of this, all the other Sikyonian exiles looked upon him as their leader, and Nikokles himself regarded him with apprehension, and quietly took precautions against him, never supposing that he would attempt so audacious an enterprise as he did, but thinking ho would probably make overtures to some of the successors of Alexander, who had been guests * and friends of his father.", "5723": "Indeed, Aratus did attempt to obtain assistance from some of them;", "5724": "but since Antigonus, though he promised his aid, temporised and hesitated to act, and his hopes from Egypt and Ptolemy were too remote, he determined to overthrow the despot alone.", "5725": "V.", "5726": "The first persons to whom he communicated his design were Anstomachus and Ekdelus, of whom the former was an exile from Sikyon, while Ekdelus was an Arcadian of Megalopolis, a man of culture as well as of action, who had been an intimate friend of Arkesilaus, the Academic philosopher at Athens.", "5727": "As both those men readily accepted his proposals, Aratus began to discuss the project with the other exiles.", "5728": "Some few felt ashamed to abandon all hope of restoration to their country, and joined Aratus, but most of them tried to hinder him from making the attempt, alleging that his daring was the result of inexperience.", "5729": "While Aratus was meditating whether he could not seize some strong place within the territory of Sikyon, and make it the base of his operations against the despot, there came to Argos a certain Sikyonian who had escaped from prison.", "5730": "This man was the brother of Xeno­ kles, one of the exiles;", "5731": "and when brought to Aratus by his brother, told him that the city wall, at the place where he himself climbed over it and made his escape, was very nearly level with the ground on the inside, as it was built up against high and rocky ground, while on the outside it was not so high as to be beyond the reach of scaling-ladders.", "5732": "Aratus, when he heard this, sent Xenokles with two of his own servants, named Seuthas and Technon, to reconnoitre the spot, for he was determined, if possible, to risk every­ thing by one sudden and secret assault, rather than openly to engage in what might prove a long and tedious war, waged, as it would be by a private man against the des­ potic ruler of a state.", "5733": "Xenokles, on his return, reported that he had measured the height of the walls, and that the ground presented no difficulties for their attempt, but he said that it would be difficult to reach the place unob­ served, because of the dogs of a gardener who dwelt near, which, though small, were peculiarly ferocious and savage.", "5734": "Upon hearing this, Aratus at once began to prepare for the attempt.", "5735": "VI.", "5736": "The use of arms was, at that period, familiar to all men, because of the constant marauding incursions which each state continually made upon the territory of its neigh­ bours.", "5737": "The scaling-ladders were made openly by Euph­ ranor the carpenter, one of the exiles, whose trade enabled him to construct them without exciting suspicion.", "5738": "The Argive friends of Aratus each contributed ten men from their own households;", "5739": "while he himself was able to pam thirty slaves of his own.", "5740": "He also hired from Xeno­ krilus, the well-known captain of robbers, a small band of soldiers, who were told that the object of the incursion into the Sikyonian territory was to carry off some horses belonging to King Antigonus.", "5741": "Most of the band were ordered to make their way in scattered parties to the tower of Polygnotus, and there to wait for their leaders.", "5742": "Kaphi­ sias, in light marching order, with four others, was sent on in advance, with instructions to present himself at the house of the gardener about nightfall.", "5743": "Under the pretext of being wayfaring men seeking for hospitality, they were to obtain lodgings there for the night, and secure both the man and his dogs, for unless this was done it would be impossible to reach the walls.", "5744": "The scaling-ladders, which were made to take to pieces, were packed in chests, covered over, and sent forward in waggons.", "5745": "Meanwhile, as several spies sent by Nikokles had appeared in Argos, who were said to be quietly watching the movements of Aratus, he rose at daybreak, and spent the day in the open market- place, conversing with his friends.", "5746": "Towards evening he anointed himself in the palæstra, and then went home, taking with him several of the companions with whom he was accustomed to drink and amuse himself.", "5747": "Soon after this his servants were seen crossing the market-place, one carrying garlands, another buying torches, and another bargaining with the female musicians who were wont to attend at banquets.", "5748": "The spies, seeing all these prepara­ tions, were deceived and laughingly said to one another, “ Surely there is nothing more cowardly than a tyrant, if Nikokles, with such a city and armed force at his disposal, really fears this youth, who wastes the income on which he has to subsist in exile, on amusements and on wine parties before it is even dark.\"", "5749": "VII.", "5750": "Thus the spies were thrown off their guard;", "5751": "but Aratus, immediately after supper, sallied forth, met his men at the tower of Polygnotus, and led them to Nemea where he explained, to most of them for the first time, what he was about to attempt.", "5752": "After promising them rewards in case of success, and addressing to them a few words of encouragement, he gave Propitious Apollo as the watch­ word, and proceeded towards the city, regulating his march according to the moon, so that he was able to make use of its light to march by, and when it was setting arrived at the garden outside the walls.", "5753": "Here Kaphisias met him, with the news that he had not been able to secure the dogs, which had run away, but that he that locked up the gardener in his house.", "5754": "On hearing this most of the conspirators became disheartened, and de­ manded to be led back again;", "5755": "but Aratus pacified them by promising that, if the dogs attacked them and gave the alarm, he would give up the attempt.", "5756": "lie now sent for­ ward a party with the scaling-ladders, under the command of Ekdelus and Mnesitheus, and himself proceeded at a leisurely pace.", "5757": "The dogs at once set upon the party under Ekdelus, and kept up a continuous barking;", "5758": "nevertheless they reached the wall and placed the ladders against it un­ disturbed.", "5759": "While the foremost were mounting, the officer who was being relieved by the morning guard passed that way carrying a bell, and there was a great flashing of lights and trampling of marching soldiers.", "5760": "The con­ spirators remained where they were, crouching upon their ladders, and without difficulty escaped the notice of this patrol, but they were terribly near being discovered by a second body of guards marching in the opposite direction.", "5761": "As soon as this also had passed by without noticing them, the leaders, Mnesitheus and Ekdelus, at once mounted upon the walls, secured the passage along the walls both on the right and on the left, and despatched Teohnon to Aratus, bidding him hasten to the spot.", "5762": "VIII.", "5763": "At no great distance from the garden there stood a tower upon the walls, in which a great hound was kept for a watch.", "5764": "This hound had not noticed the approach of the escalading party, either because he was dull of hearing, or because he was tired with exercise the day before.", "5765": "When, however, the gardener's little dogs roused him by their clamour at the foot of the wall, he at first set up a low growling, and then, as the party drew nearer, began to bark furiously.", "5766": "He made so much noise that the sentry on the next tower called out in a loud voice to the huntsman in charge of the dog, asking him at what the hound was barking so savagely, and whether any­ thing was wrong.", "5767": "The huntsman replied from his tower that all was well, only that the hound had been disturbed by the lights of the patrol and the sound of their bell.", "5768": "This gave great encouragement to Aratus's party, who imagined that tha huntsman spoke thus because he had seen them and wished to screen .them from observation and assist their plot, and that many others in the city might be willing to do the same.", "5769": "Yet, the scaling of the walls was a long and dangerous operation, as the ladders were too weak to bear the weight of more than one man mounting slowly at a time, yet time pressed, for the cocks had already begun to crow, and soon the country people might be expected to arrive, bringing their wares to market.", "5770": "So, now, Aratus, himself hastily mounted, after forty of his men had reached the top, and while the remainder were still mounting, he marched straight to the despot's house, and the guard-room in which his mercenary troops passed the night.", "5771": "By a sudden assault he took them all prisoners without killing one of them, and at once sent messengers to summon his own friends from their houses.", "5772": "Day was breaking while they assembled, and soon the theatre was filled with an excited crowd with­ out any distinct idea of what was happening, until a herald came forward and announced to the people that Aratus, the son of Kleinias, invited his fellow-citizens to regain their liberty.", "5773": "IX.", "5774": "The people now, at last, believed that their long­ looked-for deliverers had indeed come, and rushed in a body to set fire to the despot's house.", "5775": "The burning house made such a prodigious blaze that it was seen as far as Corinth, where the citizens were so much astonished, that they were within a little of setting out to rescue Sikyon from the flames.", "5776": "Nikokles himself escaped by a subter­ ranean passage, and got clear away from the city, and his soldiers, with the assistance of the citizens, put out the fire and plundered his house.", "5777": "Aratus did not attempt to stop this proceeding, and distributed the remainder of the despot's treasure among the citizens.", "5778": "No one was killed or wounded, either of the attacking or defending party, but by good fortune this great exploit was accom­ plished without spilling a drop of blood.", "5779": "Aratus now restored the citizens whom Nikokles had banished, who were eighty in number, and also those who had been driven into exile by his predecessors, who amounted to no less than five hundred.", "5780": "These latter had been forced to wander from place to place for a period of nearly fifty years.", "5781": "They now returned, very poor for the most part, and at once laid claim to the property which had once been theirs.", "5782": "Their attempts to gain possession of their houses and lands caused the greatest disquietude to Aratus, who saw the city plotted against from without, and viewed with dislike by Antigonus on account of its free constitution, while within it was full of faction and disturbance.", "5783": "Under these circumstances he did what he thought was best, by making the city a member of the Achaean league:", "5784": "and the people of Sikyon, Dorians as they were, willingly adopted the name and entered into the confederacy of the Achæans, who at that time were neither famous nor powerful.", "5785": "Most of them dwelt in small towns, and their territory was both confined and unpro­ ductive, while the sea-shore, near which they lived, was without harbours, and for the most part exposed to a terrible surf.", "5786": "Yet these men, more than any others, proved that Greeks are invincible wherever they are col­ lected into regularly organised communities, and with a capable general to lead them.", "5787": "They were but an insigni­ ficant fraction of the mighty Greece of former times, and had not altogether the strength of one single considerable city;", "5788": "yet, by wise counsel and agreement among them­ selves, and by following and obeying their greatest man, instead of being jealous of his power, they not only pre­ served their own liberties, although surrounded by so many powerful cities and despots, but were constantly able to assist the rest of the Greeks in recovering and defending their freedom.", "5789": "X.", "5790": "Aratus was by nature a politician, and was of a mag­ nanimous disposition, more careful of the interests of the state than of his own.", "5791": "He regarded all despots with a peculiarly rancorous hatred, but in respect to other per­ sons, made his personal likes and dislikes subordinate to the good of his country.", "5792": "For this reason his zeal for his friends does not appear to have been so remarkable as his mild and forgiving treatment of his enemies;", "5793": "for he regu­ lated his private feelings entirely by considerations of public expediency.", "5794": "He loved to form alliances between states, to connect cities into confederations, and to teach the leaders and the people alike to act together with unanimity.", "5795": "Singularly timid and faint-hearted in open war and in battles fought by daylight, he nevertheless was most dexterous at planning surprises, winning cities, and overthrowing despots.", "5796": "For this reason he often succeeded in his rashest enterprises, and often, through excessive caution, failed when success would have been comparatively easy.", "5797": "Some wild animals see best in the dark, and are nearly blind during the daytime, because the moist nature of their eyes cannot endure the dry and searching rays of the sun;", "5798": "and so, too, it appears that some men lose their courage and are easily disconcerted when they are fighting openly in broad daylight, but yet recover all their bravery as soon as they engage in secret stratagems and midnight surprises.", "5799": "These anomalies must be attributed to a want of philosophic reflection in noble minds, which effect great things naturally, and without acting by rule or method, just as we see good fruit produced by wild and uncul­ tivated trees.", "5800": "I will now proceed to prove this by examples.", "5801": "XI.", "5802": "Aratus, after he had joined himself and his native city to the Achæan league, served in the cavalry force, and made himself generally beloved by the ready obedience which he showed to his commanders;", "5803": "for he, although he had rendered the league such important services in putting his own illustrious name and the power of the city of Sikyon at its disposal, yet, as if he were a mere private man, obeyed whoever might be in command, even though he were a citizen of Dyme, or of Tritæa, or even some more insignificant city.", "5804": "Aratus was now presented with the sum of five-and-twenty talents by the king.-", "5805": "This he received, but spent it all on relieving his destitute fellow- countrymen, and in ransoming them from slavery.", "5806": "XII.", "5807": "As the returned exiles could not be withheld from attacking those whom they found in possession of their property, and by doing so seemed likely to bring the state to ruin, Aratus, thinking that nothing but the kindness of Ptolemy could save his country, started upon a voyage to Egypt, to beg the king to furnish him with a sum of money, by means of which he might persuade the oon­ tending parties to come to an amicable agreement.", "5808": "He started from the port of Mothone, and sailed beyond Cape Millea, meaning to cross directly over the sea to Egypt.", "5809": "However, the sea was very rough, and the wind contrary, which caused the captain of the ship to bear up, and run along the coast until, with great difficulty, he reached Adria,* which was an enemy's country, for it was in the possession of Antigonus, who had placed a Macedonian garrison in it.", "5810": "Aratus contrived to keep out of the way of the garrison, and, leaving the ship, proceeded a long way inland, accompanied by one single friend, named Timanthes.", "5811": "They concealed themselves in a thick wood, and passed the night as best they could.", "5812": "Shortly after­ wards the Macedonian officer in charge appeared, and en­ deavoured to find Aratus, but was put off the scent by the slaves of Aratus, who had been instructed to say that their master, as soon as he left them, had sailed in another vessel bound to Eubœa.", "5813": "However, the Macedonian de­ clared the cargo, the vessel, and the slaves to be a lawful prize, as being enemy's property, and detained them as such.", "5814": "A few days after this, when Aratus was almost at his wit's end, by good fortune a Roman ship touched at the place where he was spending his time in looking out for means of escape by sea, and in trying to conceal himself from his enemies on land.", "5815": "The ship was bound for Syria, but Aratus would not sail in it until he had persuaded the captain to land him in Karia.", "5816": "On his voyage thither he again encountered great dangers:", "5817": "but at length he suo­ ceeded in obtaining a passage from Karia to Egypt, where he was warmly received by the king, who had always had a favourable opinion of him, and who had lately received from him many drawings and paintings by Greek artists.", "5818": "Aratus, who had considerable taste in these matters, con­ stantly purchased and collected the works of the most skilful and famous painters, especially those of Pamphilus and Melanthus, and used to send them as presents to King Ptolemy.", "5819": "XIII.", "5820": "At that time the Sikyonian school of painting was still celebrated throughout Greece, and was thought more than any other to have preserved the purity of the ancient style.", "5821": "Even the great Apelles, when already famous, had come to Sikyon and paid a talent for some lessons from the masters there, although by doing so be hoped to increase his reputation rather than to improve his art.", "5822": "When Aratus set the city free, he at once destroyed all the portraits - of the despots, except that of Aristratus, who flourished in the time of Philip, t about which he hesitated for a long time;", "5823": "for the picture in which Aristratus was represented standing beside the chariot which won him a prize in the games, was the joint work of all the pupils of Melanthus, and we are told by Polemon the geographer, that some parts of it were painted by Apelles himself.", "5824": "The execution was so admirable that Aratus for a moment relented, but soon afterwards his fierce hatred of all the despots made him order it to be destroyed.", "5825": "However, Nealkes the painter, who was a friend of Aratus, interceded for the picture with tears, and as he could not move Aratus, at last said, \" We ought to make war against despots themselves, but not against their surroundings.", "5826": "Let us leave the chariot and the figure of Victory, and I will deliver up Aristratus to you, by wiping him out of the picture.\"", "5827": "Aratus allowed Nealkes to do this, and he effaced the figure of Aristratus, and painted a palm tree in its place, without venturing to add any­ thing else.", "5828": "It is said that after destroying the figure of Aristratus, the painter forgot his feet, and that they were still to be seen under the chariot.", "5829": "By presents of such paintings as these Aratus had already disposed Ptolemy to regard him with favour;", "5830": "and when they met, Arabia so charmed the king by his conversation that he received from him a present of one hundred and fifty talents for the use of his native city.", "5831": "Aratus carried forty talents home with him at once to Peloponnesus, and afterwards received the rest of the sum in instalments from the king.", "5832": "XIV.", "5833": "It was a truly great action for Aratus to bestow so much money upon his fellow-countrymen, especially at a time when for much smaller sums the kings were usually able to bribe the other chiefs and popular leaders to betray their native cities and sacrifice their constitutional liberties;", "5834": "but it was even more admirable that by means of this money he reconciled the rich and the poor, and saved the state from all the danger of revolution, while his own conduct was marked by the greatest moderation in spite of his enormous power.", "5835": "When he was appointed as sole arbitrator with unlimited authority, to decide upon the claims of the exiled families to their inheritances, he refused to act alone, and associated fifteen of the other citizens with himself, with whose help, after much labour and difficulty, he restored peace and union amongst his country­ men.", "5836": "For these services the state bestowed upon him fitting honours, but in addition to these the exiles gave him a special mark of their regard by erecting a brazen statue, upon which was inscribed the following verses :", "5837": "­ \"For wisdom, valour, and great deeds in war Thy fame, Aratus, has been noised afar.", "5838": "We, that unhappy exiles were of late, Brought home by thee, this statute dedicate", "5839": "To all the gods who helped thee to restore Peace and goodwill amongst us as before.\"XV.", "5840": "By this important measure Aratus so thoroughly earned the gratitude of his countrymen as to be placed above the reach of party jealousy;", "5841": "but King Antigonus was much displeased at his success, and with the object either of making him his friend, or of causing him to be distrusted by Ptolemy, bestowed upon him several marks of favour, and when sacrificing to the gods at Corinth even sent some of the meat of the victim to Sikyon as a present for him.", "5842": "At dinner that evening he said aloud in the hearing of many guests:", "5843": "“ I thought this young Sikyoniau was merely a well-bred and patriotic youth ;", "5844": "but it seems that he is a very shrewd judge of the lives and politics of us kings.", "5845": "At first he used to despise me, and looked beyond me to Egypt, because he had heard so much about the elephants and fleets of Ptolemy, and about the splendour of nis court, but now that he has been admitted behind the scenes there and has discovered it to be all empty show and parade, he has thrown himself into my arms without reserve", "5846": "So now I receive the youth into my own service, and shall employ him in all my affairs;", "5847": "and I beg you all to treat him as a friend. \"", "5848": "All those who were jealous of Aratus and who wished him ill, as soon as they heard these words, vied with one another in sending letters to Ptolemy, full of abuse of Aratus, until at length Ptolemy himself wrote to Aratus and reproached him for his disloyalty.", "5849": "So much jealousy and ill-feeling does the friendship of kings produce among those who most eagerly struggle to gain it.", "5850": "XVI.", "5851": "Aratus, who was now for the first time elected general of the Achæans, invaded and plundered the countries of Kalydonia and Lokris on the other side of the Corinthian gulf, but though he marched with ten thousand men to help the Bœotians he came too late to take part in the battle, in which they were defeated near Chæronea by the Ætolians.", "5852": "In this battle a thousand Bœotians perished, amongst whom was Aboeokritus the Boeotarch himself.", "5853": "Next year Aratus was again chosen general, and began to arrange his plot for the capture of the Akrocorinthus, or citadel of Corinth.", "5854": "He made this attempt not to benefit the Achæans, or his own city of Sikyon, but solely with the object of driving out the Macedonian garrison, which was established there as the common despot over all Greece.", "5855": "The Athenian Chares, after gaining some success in battle over the generals of the King of Persia, sent home a des­ patch to the Athenian people in which he declared that he had W'on the sister victory to that of Marathon :", "5856": "and this exploit of Aratus may be most truly described as sister to those of Pelopidas the Theban and of Thrasybulus the Athenian, in which they each killed the despots of their respective cities;", "5857": "except that this assault was not delivered against Greeks, but against a foreign and alien sovereignty.", "5858": "Now the isthmus, which bars out the two seas, connects together the two parts of our continent;", "5859": "but the Acro­ corinthus, which is a lofty mountain placed in the middle of Greece, if it be held by an armed force, cuts off the land beyond the isthmus from all intercourse with the rest of Greece, whether for warlike or commercial purposes, and places the whole country at the mercy of the commander of its garrison;", "5860": "so that the younger Philip was not in jest but in earnest when he called the city of Corinth the “ key of Greece.", "5861": "\"XVII.", "5862": "The possession of this place was always coveted by all princes and rulers, but the desire of Antigonus for it became a frantic passion, and his whole thoughts were occupied with plots to obtain it by stratagem, since it was hopeless to attempt to take it by force.", "5863": "After the death of Alexander,* who originally held it, and who, it is said, was poisoned by Antigonus, his wife Nikæa succeeded to his kingdom, and held the Acrocorinthus.", "5864": "Antigonus now at once sent his son Demetrius to her, and by holding out the dazzling prospect of a royal alliance and a handsome young husband to a woman somewhat past her prime, made a conquest of her by means of his son, whom he em­ ployed without scruple to tempt his victim.", "5865": "As, however, she would not give up the citadel, but kept it strongly guarded, Antigonus pretended to be indifferent to it, and prepared a wedding feast in Corinth, spending the whole day in attendance at spectacles and in wine-drinking, as if he had entirely given himself up to pleasure and enjoy­ ment.", "5866": "When the time drew near for the attempt, he him­ self accompanied Nikæa to the theatre to hear Amœbeus sing.", "5867": "They were carried together in royal state in a splendidly ornamented litter, and she was delighted at the respect which he showed her, and was as far as possible from guessing his real purpose.", "5868": "When they arrived at the point where the road turned off towards the citadel, he begged her to proceed alone to the theatre, and without troubling himself further about Amœbeus or the marriage, ran up to the Acrocorinthus faster than one would have expected in a man of his age.", "5869": "Finding the gate shut, he knocked at it with his stick, bidding the garrison open it;", "5870": "and they, astounded at his audacity, threw it open.", "5871": "When he had thus obtained possession of the place he could no longer restrain himself, but although he was now an old man, and had experienced great vicissitudes of fortune, he drank wine and jumped for joy in the streets, and swaggered riotously across the market-place, crowned with flowers, and accompanied by singing-girls, greeting and shaking hands with every one whom he met.", "5872": "So true it is that unexpected joy disturbs the right balance of the mind more than either grief or terror.", "5873": "XVIII.", "5874": "Now Antigonus, having, as above related, gained possession of the Acrocorinthus, entrusted the place to some of his most faithful officers, among whom was Persæus the philosopher.", "5875": "Aratus, during the life of Alexander, had begun to form a plan for surprising the citadel, but desisted from his plot when Alexander became an ally of the Achæans.", "5876": "He now began to form fresh schemes, in the following manner:", "5877": "-There were in Corinth four brothers, Syrians by birth, one of whom, named Dickies, was serving in the garrison, and quartered in the citadel.", "5878": "The other three, having robbed the king's treasury, came to Sikyon to dispose of the plunder to a banker named Ægias, who was well known to Aratus from having had dealings with him.", "5879": "They disposed of a considerable part of their plunder at first, and afterwards, one of them, named Erginus, came quietly over from time to time with the remainder.", "5880": "In this way he became intimate with Ægias, and, being led on by him to talk about the citadel, said that when going up the hill to visit his brother, he had noticed a narrow path on one side, which led to the lowest part of the wall of the fortress.", "5881": "On hearing this, Ægias laughingly said to him, “My good sir, why do you rob the king's treasury to gain such pitiful sums of money, when you might gain great riches in a single hour ?", "5882": "Do you not know that burglary and treachery are alike punished with death?\"", "5883": "Erginus smiled at this, and agreed to sound his brother Diokles upon this point;", "5884": "for he could not, he said, place much confidence in the other two.", "5885": "In a few days he returned, undertook to lead Aratus to i part of the wall which was not more than fifteen feet high, and arranged that both he and his brother Dickies would do all in their power to assist him.", "5886": "XIX.", "5887": "Aratus promised that he would give them sixty talents if successful, and that, in case of failure, if he and they survived, he would give each of them a house and a talent.", "5888": "As the money had to be deposited with Ægias for the satisfaction of Erginus, Aratus, who did not pos­ sess the sum necessary, and who did not wish to lead others to suspect his design by borrowing, took the greater part of his own plate and his wife's jewels, and pledged them with Ægias for the money.", "5889": "Indeed, he was of so lofty a soul, and so passionately desirous of glory, that although he knew that Phokion and Epameinondas had gained the reputation of being the most just and noble of the Greeks, by refusing large bribes and not sacrificing honour to money, he preferred to expend his fortune secretly in enterprises in which he alone risked his life on behalf of the many, who did not even know what he was doing.", "5890": "Who, even in our own day, could refrain from admiring and longing to share the fortunes of a man who bought for himself so great a danger at so high a price, and who pawned the most valuable of his possessions in order that he might make his way into the fortress of his enemies by night and fight for his life there, gaining by his deposit the hope of glory, but nothing else ?", "5891": "XX.", "5892": "The plot, dangerous enough in itself, was rendered even more so at its very outset by a blunder.", "5893": "Technon, the servant of Aratus, was sent to examine the wall together with Diokles.", "5894": "He had never before met Dickies, but imagining that he knew his appearance from Erginus's description of him as a man with close curly hair, a dark complexion, and no beard, went to the rendezvous, and waited outside the city, near the place called Omnis, for Erginus, who was to meet him there with his brother Dickies.", "5895": "In the meantime the brother of Erginus and Dickies, named Dionysius, who was not in the plot, and knew nothing of what was going on, happened to come up.", "5896": "He was very like Diokles, and Technon, influenced by the likeness, inquired of him if he were in any way connected with Erginus.", "5897": "As he answered that he was his brother, Technon was quite certain that he was addressing Diokles;", "5898": "and without asking his name or waiting for any further proof of identity he gave him his hand, spoke of the compact with Erginus, and asked him questions about it.", "5899": "He cleverly encouraged Technon in his error, agreed to every­ thing that he said, and, turning round, walked with him towards the city without exciting his suspicions.", "5900": "When he was close to the gate, and had all but inveigled Technon through it, it chanced that Erginus met them.", "5901": "Perceiving the trick which his brother had played, and the danger in which Technon was placed, he warned him by a sign to make his escape, and both of them, running away at full speed, got safe back to Aratus.", "5902": "Yet he did not despair, but at once sent Erginus to take some money to Dionysius, and to beg him to hold his tongue.", "5903": "Erginus accomplished his commission, and brought Dionysius back with him to Aratus.", "5904": "When he arrived there they would not let him go again, but kept him a close prisoner, while they them­ selves prepared to make the attempt.", "5905": "XXI.", "5906": "When all was ready, Aratus ordered the greater part of his force to pass the night under arms, and himself with a chosen body of four hundred men, few of whom were in the secret, proceeded towards the gates of Corinth, near the temple of Hera.", "5907": "The time was the height of summer.", "5908": "The moon was at the full, and as the night was clear and cloudless, they began to fear that the light gleaming from their arms would betray them to the sentinels.", "5909": "However, when the leading men were near to the wall a log came up from the sea, and enveloped the whole city and its neighbourhood.", "5910": "Now, the men all sat down and took off their shoes;", "5911": "for men who mount ladders with naked feet make very little noise and are not so liable to slip.", "5912": "Meanwhile Erginus, with seven youths dressed as wayfaring men, made his way up to the gate un­ suspected.", "5913": "They killed the keeper of the gate, and the guard :", "5914": "while at the same time the scaling-ladders were placed against the walls.", "5915": "Aratus hastily crossed the walls with a hundred men.", "5916": "Bidding the remainder follow as fast as they could, he ordered the ladders to be drawn up, and, followed by his hundred men, ran through the town to the citadel, overjoyed at having got so far without raising an alarm, and already certain of success.", "5917": "While they were still some distance off, they met a patrol of four men carrying a light.", "5918": "These men could not see them because they were in the shadow of the moon, but the four men were clearly visible as they marched straight towards them.", "5919": "Aratus now drew his force a little aside among some ruins and low walls, so as to form an am bush, and set upon the men.", "5920": "Three were killed on the spot, but the fourth, though wounded in the head by a blow from a sword, ran away shouting that the enemy were within the walls.", "5921": "Soon after this trumpets were sounded, the whole city was disturbed, and all the streets became thronged with men running to and fro, while many lights appeared, some in the lower town, and some in the citadel above, and a confused murmur of voices was heard on every Bide.", "5922": "XXII.", "5923": "While this was going on, Aratus persevered in his march, and was toiling laboriously up the cliff.", "5924": "At first he proceeded slowly and with difficulty, without making any real progress, because he had entirely missed the path, which wound about under the shadow of the precipitous rocks by many turnings and windings up to the citadel.", "5925": "At this moment it is said that the moon shone through the clouds and threw her light upon the most difficult part of the ascent in a wonderful manner, until Aratus reached the part of the wall of the citadel which he wished to attack.", "5926": "When he was there, she again concealed and shaded her rays behind a barrier of clouds.", "5927": "While this was being done, the three hundred men of Aratus’s force, who had been left outside the gate near the temple of Hera, when they made their way into the city, which was now full of confusion and lights, were not able to find the same path which had been followed by the others, or any trace of the way by which they had gone, and so in a body crouched down in a dark corner in the shade of a cliff, and waited there in great anxiety and alarm:", "5928": "for now the party led by Aratus was being shot at by the garrison of the citadel, and was fighting with them hand to hand, and the shouts of the battle could be plainly heard below, though the echoes of the mountains made it impossible to tell from what quarter the noise proceeded.", "5929": "While they were at a to-is to know which way to turn, Archelaus, the leader of the Macedonian toop, marched out with a large force, with loud shouts and trumpets sounding, to attack the party under Aratus, and marched past where the three hundred lay as it were in ambush.", "5930": "They rushed out, charged the Macedonians, killed the first of them, and drove Archelaus and the remainder before them panic-stricken, until they dispersed themselves about the city.", "5931": "No sooner had this victory been won, than Erginus arrived from the citadel, announcing that Aratus was engaged with the enemy, who were offering a stubborn resistance, that a great battle was going on at the wall itself, and that immediate assistance was required.", "5932": "They at once bade him lead them, and mounted the hill, shouting to their friends to let them know who they were, and to encourage them.", "5933": "The full moon, too, as it shone upon their arms, made their numbers appear greater to the enemy on account of the length of the path, and the midnight echoes made their shouts appear to come from a much larger party of men.", "5934": "At last they joined their friends above, and by a united effort drove out the enemy, won the heights, and gained possession of the citadel just as day was dawning.", "5935": "Soon the sun r, so upon their victory, and the remainder of Aratus's force from Sikyon came up, and was welcomed by the Corinthians, who opened their gates to them, and assisted them to capture the soldiers of the Macedonian garrison.", "5936": "XXIII.", "5937": "When all appeared to be safe, Aratus descended from the citadel to the theatre, where an enormous mul­ titude of persons was collected, eager to see him and to hear the bpeech which he was about to address to the Corinthians.", "5938": "He placed a guard of Achæans on each side of the stage, and himself appeared in the middle, still wearing his corslet, and pale with the labours of a sleepless night, so that the triumph and delight which he felt were weighed down by sheer bodily lassitude.", "5939": "His appearance was greeted with enthusiastic applause, and, shifting hia spear into his right hand, and slightly leaning his body against it, he stood for a long time silent, receiving the plaudits and shouts of those who praised his courage and congratulated him on his good fortune.", "5940": "When they had ceased and resumed their seats, he drew himself up and made them a speech worthy of the occasion, on behalf of the Achæan league, in which he prevailed upon the Corinthians to join the league, and gave up to them the keys of their gates which now came into their posses­ sion for the first time since the days of king Philip.", "5941": "He dismissed Archelaus, who had been taken prisoner, but put Theophrastus to death because he refused to leave his post.", "5942": "Pergæus, when the citadel was taken, escaped to Kenchreæ.", "5943": "Afterwards it is said that in philosophic con­ versation, when some one said that he thought that the philosopher was the only true general, he answered, \"By heaven, this once used to please me more than any other of Zeno's aphorisms, but I have changed my mind since the refutation of it which I received from a young man of Sikyon.”", "5944": "This anecdote of Persæus is related by most historians.", "5945": "XXIV.", "5946": "Aratus now at once made himself master of the temple of Hera, and of Lechæum, where he seized a fleet of five-and-twenty ships belonging to King Antigonus, and sold five hundred horses and four hundred Syrians whom he found there.", "5947": "The Achæans now garrisoned the citadel of Corinth with a force of four hundred heavy-armed soldiers, and with a pack of fifty hounds and as many huntsmen, who were all kept in the citadel.", "5948": "-The Romans in their admiration of Philopœmen used to call him the last of the Greeks, as though no great actions were performed in Greece after his time:", "5949": "but I should be inclined to say that this was both the last and the most remarkable of all the great achievements of the Greeks, for both in the daring with which it was accomplished, and the good fortune with which it was attended, it will bear comparison with the noblest of deeds, as was at once proved by its results.", "5950": "Megara revolted from Antigonus and joined Aratus, Troezene and Epidaurus became members of the Achæan league, and Aratus made his first campaign by an expedition into Attica, in the course of which he cro sed into Salamis and laid it waste, being able to make what use he pleased of the power of the Achæan league, now that it was no longer, as it were, locked up in Peloponnesus.", "5951": "He sent back all the freemen whom he captured to Athens without ransom, hoping to rouse them to revolt against the Macedonians.", "5952": "He also brought Ptolemy into alliance with the Achæan league, and constituted him commander-in-chief of their forces by land and by sea.", "5953": "His influence with the Achæans was so great, that, since it was illegal to elect him as their chief every year, they elected him every other year, while practically they followed his advice in all their transao­ tions ;", "5954": "for they saw that he preferred neither wealth, nor fame, nor the friendship of kings, nor the advantage of his own native country to the furtherance of the prosperity of the Achæans.", "5955": "He conceived that cities which by themselves were weak might obtain safety by means of one another, bound together by their common interest, and that just as the various parts of the human body live and move when connected with one another, but waste away and perish when cut asunder, so cities are ruined by isolation, and prosper by confederation, when they form parts of one great body, and adopt a common line of policy.", "5956": "XXV.", "5957": "Observing that the most famous of the neigh­ bouring cities were independent, he became grieved that the Argives lived under the rule of a despot, and began to plot the destruction of Aristomachus, their ruler;", "5958": "wishing also to bestow its freedom upon the city to which he owed his education, and to gain it over to the Achæan league.", "5959": "Men were found who dared to make the attempt, chief among whom were AEschylus and Charimenes the sooth­ sayer, but they had no swords, because the despot had prohibited the possession of arms to the citizens under severe penalties.", "5960": "However, Aratus prepared at Corinth a number of small daggers, which he caused to be sewn up in pack-saddles.", "5961": "He then placed the saddles on pack­ horses and sent them to Argos, laden with ordinary merchandise.", "5962": "But Charimenes the soothsayer took another person into the ploit, which so enraged AEschylus and his party that they determined to act alone, and would have nothing more to do with Charimenes.", "5963": "In anger at this treatment he betrayed his comrades just as they were on the point of attacking the despot, yet most of them had time to make their way out of the market-place and escape to Corinth.", "5964": "Shortly afterwards Aristomachus was assassinated by his own servants, and was immediately succeeded by Aria­ tippus, a more cruel tyrant than himself.", "5965": "Aratus upon hearing of this at once made a hurried march to Argos at the head of as many Achæans as he could collect, hoping to find the city ready to join him.", "5966": "As, however, most of the Argives were now accustomed to the loss of their liberty, and no one answered his appeal, he retired, having done no more than expose the Achæans to the charge of making a warlike invasion in time of peace.", "5967": "For this they were tried before the Mantineans as judges, and, as Aratus did not appear, Aristippus, who was prosecutor, won his cause and got a fine of thirty minæ laid upon the Achæans.", "5968": "As he both hated and feared Aratus himself, he now, with the connivance of King Antigonus, endeavoured to have him assassinated;", "5969": "and they soon had their emissaries everywhere, watching their opportunity.", "5970": "There is, however, no such certain safeguard for a ruler as the love of his people;", "5971": "for when both the masses and the leading men have learned not to fear their chief, but to fear for him, he sees with many eyes, hears with many ears, and soon gains intelli­ gence of any conspiracies.", "5972": "And in this place I wish to stop my narrative for a moment, and describe the mode of life which Aristippus was compelled to lead in consequence of being a despot, and possessing that position of absolute ruler which men are wont so greatly to admire and envy.", "5973": "XXVI.", "5974": "Aristippus had Antigonus for his ally, kept a large force on foot for his own protection, and left none of his enemies alive in the city of Argos.", "5975": "He used to make bis oody-guard and household troops encamp in the porticoes outside his palace, and always, after supper, sent all his servants out of the room, locked the door himself, and betook himself with his mistress to a little upper chamber which was reached by a trapdoor, upon which he placed his bed and slept, as one may expect, a disturbed and frightened sleep.", "5976": "His mistress's mother used to take away the ladder by which they mounted, and lock it up in another room.", "5977": "At daybreak she used to bring it back again, and call down this glorious monarch, who came out like a snake out of his den.", "5978": "Aratus, who dressed in the plainest of clothes, and was the declared enemy of despots wherever they were to be found, gained for himself a lasting command, not by force of arms, but by legal means by his own courage, and has left a posterity which even at the present day enjoys the greatest honour in Greece;", "5979": "whereas of all those men who seized strongholds, kept body-guards, and protected their fives with arms and gates and trapdoor,,;", "5980": ", few escaped being knocked on the head like hares, and no one has left either a palace, or a family, or a monument to do honour to his memory.", "5981": "XXVII.", "5982": "Aratus made many attempts, both by intrigues and open violence, to overthrow Aristippus, and take Argos.", "5983": "Once he succeeded in placing scaling-ladders against the walls, ascended them recklessly with a few followers, and killed the soldiers who came from within the city to oppose him.", "5984": "Afterwards, when day was breaking and the troops of the despot were attacking him on all sides, the people of Argos, just as if they were sitting as judges at the Nemean games, and the battle was not being fought on behalf of their liberty, sat by with the utmost calmness, like impartial spectators.", "5985": "Aratus fought bravely, and though wounded in the thigh by a spear, yet succeeded in effecting a lodgement in the city and in spite of the attacks of the enemy held his ground until nightfall.", "5986": "If he could have found strength to remain and fight during the night also, he would not have failed in his attempt;", "5987": "for the despot was already making preparations for flight and had sent on much of his pro­ perty to the sea-coast:", "5988": "but as no one brought news of this to Aratus, and water failed him, while his wound incapaci­ tated him for any personal exertions, he drew off his forces.", "5989": "XXVIII.", "5990": "He now gave up this method of attack, and openly invaded the Argive country with an army and laid it waste.", "5991": "At the river Chares he fought a desperate battle with Aristippus, and was thought to have given up the contest too soon, and lost the victory;", "5992": "for when the other part of his army had decidedly won the day and forced their way a long distance forward, he himself, not so much overpowered by the forces opposed to him as hope­ less of success and fearing disaster, lost his presence of mind, and led his men back into their camp.", "5993": "When the others returned from their victorious charge, and com­ plained bitterly that, after having routed the enemy, and slain many more men than they themselves had lost, Aratus had allowed the vanquished to erect a trophy, he was stung to the quick, decided to fight rather than to allow the trophy to be erected, and after an interval of one day again led out his forces.", "5994": "When, however, he learned that the troops of the despot had been largely reinforced, and were full of confidence, he did not venture to risk a battle, but made a truce for the recovery of the dead, and retired.", "5995": "Yet he continued to repair this fault by his diplomatic skill and persuasive powers, for he won over the city of Kleonae to the Achæan league, and held the Nemean festival at Kleonae, declaring it to be the privilege of its citizens to do so by right of descent.", "5996": "The Argives also celebrated the festival, and on this occasion for the first time the right of safe­ conduct of the competitors was violated, for the Achæans seized and sold for slaves all who passed through their territory on their return from the games at Argos.", "5997": "So stem and inexorable was Aratus in his hatred of despots.", "5998": "XXIX.", "5999": "Shortly after this, hearing that Aristippus was meditating an attack upon Kleonae, but feared him, because he was living at Corinth, he ordered an army to be mustered.", "6000": "Bidding his men collect provisions for several days, he marched as far as Kenchreae, hoping to draw out Aristippus to attack Kleonae during his absence, as indeed happened.", "6001": "Aristippus at once came from Argos with his entire force;", "6002": "but Aratus meanwhile returned by night to Corinth from Kenchreae, and, having placed guards upon all the roads, led the Achæans by so swift, well-managed, and orderly a march, that while it was still dark he not only reached Kleonae, but drew up his men in order of battle before Aristippus discovered their presence.", "6003": "At daybreak the city gates were thrown open, and charging with loud shouts to the sound of the trumpet, he at once routed the enemy, and pursued in the direction in which he thought Aristippus most probably was fleeing, the country being full of ways to escape pursuit.", "6004": "The chase was kept up as far as Mykenae, where the despot was overtaken and slain by a Cretan named Tragiskus, according to the historian Deinias.", "6005": "With him fell more than fifteen hundred of his men.", "6006": "Yet, Aratus, after gaining such a brilliant success without losing one of his own soldiers, did not take Argos or restore it to liberty, as Agias and Aristomachus the younger marched into the town with some Macedonian troops and seized the government.", "6007": "However, by this action, Aratus pretty well silenced the illnatured joke, which had been made about himself, and the stories, invented by the courtiers of despots;", "6008": "for they described the general of the Achaeans as being subject to violent internal disorders during a battle, and said that as soon as the trumpeter appeared he became faint and dizzy, and that, after having arrayed his forces, given the word, and inquired of his lieutenants and officers whether they had any further need of his presence, when the die was finally cast, he used to retire and await the result at a distance.", "6009": "These stories had such an extensive currency, that even philosophers in their studies when discussing whether violent beating of the heart, changing of colour, and the like in time of danger be a mark of cowardice or of distemperature and of a cold habit of body, always mention Aratus as being a good general, but always being affected in this manner when in battle.", "6010": "XXX.", "6011": "When he had slain Aristippus, he at once began to plot against Lydiades of Megalopolis, who had made himself despot of his native city.", "6012": "Lydiades was naturally of a noble and ambitious nature, and had not, like so many despots, been led to commit the crime of enslaving his fel­ low-citizens by any selfish desire of money or of pleasure;", "6013": "but when a young man he had become inflamed with a desire of distinguishing himself, and listening to all the vain and untrue talk about despotic power being so fine and happy a thing, he, like a high-spirited youth, made himself despot, and soon became overwhelmed with the cares of state.", "6014": "As he now both envied the happiness of Aratus and feared the results of his plots, he adopted a new and most glorious course, which was first to set him­ self free from hatred and terror and soldiers and life-guards, and next to become the benefactor of his country.", "6015": "He seat fur Aratus, gave up his rule, and united the city to the Achæan league.", "6016": "The Achaeans admired his conduct in this matter so much that they elected him general.", "6017": "He now at once began to strive to outdo Aratus in glory, and en­ gaged in many unnecessary enterprises, one of which was a campaign against the Lacedæmonians.", "6018": "Aratus opposed him, and was therefore thought to be jealous of him ;", "6019": "yet Lydiades was a second time elected general, in spite of the open opposition of Aratus, who used all his influence on behalf of another candidate.", "6020": "Aratus himself, as has been said, was general every other year.", "6021": "Lydiades continued in the full tide of success and was elected general alter­ nately with Aratus up to his third year of office;", "6022": "but as he made no secret of his hatred for Aratus, and often attacked him in the public assembly of the Achaeans, they cast him off and would not listen to him, thinking that his good qualities were but counterfeit when compared with the genuine virtues of Aratus.", "6023": "Just as Æsop tells us in his fables that when the cuckoo asked the little birds why they fled from him, they answered that some day he would be a hawk, so it seems that, even after he had given up his despotism, some blighting suspicion always clung to the character of Lydiades.XXXI.", "6024": "Aratus gained great glory also in the Ætolian war, because when the Achaeans were eager to join battle with the Ætolians on the Megarian frontier, and Agis the King of Lacedæmon had arived with a large force and urged the Achaeans to fight, he opposed it, and in spite of being reproached, abused, and jeered at as a coward, refused to be led astray by any high-flown ideas of honour from the course which he had decided upon as the best, made way for the enemy, and without striking a blow permitted them to cross Geranea and pass into Pelopon­ nesus.", "6025": "When, however, they marched by him and suddenly seized Pellene, he was no longer the same man.", "6026": "He would not wait until his entire force was assembled, but with what troops he had with him at once marched against the enemy, who, after their victory, were easily conquered on account of their want of discipline and licentiousness.", "6027": "As soon as they made their way into the city of Pellene, the soldiers dispersed themselves among the various houses, driving each other out of them and fighting one another for the plunder, while the chiefs and generals were occupied in carrying off the wives and daughters of the citizens.", "6028": "They took off their own helmets and placed them on the heads of these women, in order that no one else might take them, but that the owner of each one might be known by the helmet which she wore.", "6029": "While they were thus engaged the news suddenly came that Aratus was about to attack.", "6030": "A panic took place, as one might readily expect with such want of discipline, and before all of them heard of the danger, the foremost, meeting the Achæans near the gates and suburbs of the city, lost heart and fled away at once, and in their frantic haste threw into disorder those who were forming to come to their support.", "6031": "XXXII.", "6032": "During this tumult one of the captive women, the daughter of an eminent citizen named Epigethus, who herself was remarkably tall and handsome, happened to be sitting in the temple of Artemis, where she had been stationed by the commander of a picked company of soldiers, who had placed upon her head his own helmet with its triple plume.", "6033": "She, hearing the disturbance, suddenly ran out, and as she stood at the door of the temple, looking down upon the combatants, with the triple­ plumed helmet upon her head, she appeared even to her own countrymen to be something more glorious than a mere mortal, while the enemy, who imagined that they beheld an apparition, were struck with terror and affright, so that none of them attempted to offer any resistance.", "6034": "The people of Pellene themselves say that the wooden statue of the goddess is never touched except when it is carried out by the priestess, and that then no one dares to look upon it, but all turn their faces away ;", "6035": "for the sight of it is not only fearful and terrible for mankind, but it even makes the trees barren and blights the crops through which it is carried.", "6036": "This it was, they say, which the priestess carried out of the temple on this occasion, and by continually turning the face of the figure towards the Ætolians, made them frantic and took away their reason.", "6037": "Aratus, however, in his memoirs makes no mention of anything of the kind, but says that he routed the Ætolians, broke into city together with the fugitives, and killed seven hundred of them.", "6038": "The exploit became cele­ brated as one of his most glorious actions, and the artist Timanthes has painted an admirable picture of the battle.", "6039": "XXXIII.", "6040": "However, as many nations and princes were combining together against the Achæans, Aratus at once made peace with the Ætolians, and with the assistance of Pantaloon, the most powerful man in Ætolia, even made an alliance between that country and the Achæans.", "6041": "He was anxious to set free the Athenians, and was severely re­ proached by the Achæans because, during a cessation of arms, when they had made a truce with the Macedonians, he attempted to seize Peiræus.", "6042": "In the memoirs which he has left Aratus denies this, and throws the blame of it upon Erginus, with whose aid he seized the citadel of Corinth.", "6043": "This man, he says, attacked Peiræus on his own respon­ sibility, and when the scaling-ladder broke and he was forced to fly, frequently called on Aratus by name as though he were present, and by this artifice deceived the enemy and escaped.", "6044": "This justification does not, however, seem a very credible one.", "6045": "There was no probability that Erginus, a private man and a Syrian, should have ever thought of such an enterprise, if he had not been urged to it by Aratus, who must have supplied him with the necessary forces and pointed out the proper opportunity for the attack.", "6046": "And Aratus himself proves this to be true by having not merely twice or thrice, but frequently, like a rejected lover, made attempts upon Peiræus, and not being disconcerted by his failures, but ever gathering fresh hopes by observing how nearly he had succeeded.", "6047": "On one of these occasions he sprained his leg in a hasty retreat across the Thriasian plain.", "6048": "Several incisions had to be made to cure it, and he was obliged for a long time to be carried in a litter when conducting his campaigns.", "6049": "XXXIV.", "6050": "When Antigonus died and Demetrius* suc­ ceeded to the throne, Aratus was more eager than ever to gain over Athens, and began to treat the Macedonians with contempt.", "6051": "When he was defeated in a battle which he fought against Bithys, a general of Demetrius, and many rumours were current that he had been taken prisoner or had been slain, Diogenes.", "6052": "the commander of the garrison of Peiræus, sent a letter to Corinth bidding the Achæans leave that city now that Aratus was dead.", "6053": "When this letter arrived Aratus himself was present in Corinth, and the messengers of Diogenes had to return after having afforded him much amusement.", "6054": "The King of Macedonia also sent a ship, on board of which Aratus was to be brought back to him in chains.", "6055": "But the Athenians, outdoing themselves in levity and servility to the Ma­ cedonians, crowned themselves with garlands when they heard the news of his death.", "6056": "Enraged at this Aratus at once invaded their country, and marched as far as the Academy, but there he suffered his anger to be appeased, and did no damage.", "6057": "The Athenians did, nevertheless, ap­ preciate his courage, for when on the death of Demetrius, they attempted to regain their freedom, they invited him to assist them.", "6058": "Although Aratus was not at that time general of the Achaeans, and was confined to his bed with a long illness, yet he responded to this appeal by proceed­ ing to Athens in a litter, and prevailed upon Diogenes, the chief of the garrison, to surrender Peiræus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium to the Athenians for the sum of one hundred and fifty talents, twenty of which he himself contri­ buted.", "6059": "The states of Ægina and Hermione now joined the Achæan league, and the greater part of Arcadia contributed to it;", "6060": "for the Macedonians were engaged in wars with their neighbours, and the Achæans, with the help of their allies, the Ætolians, now gained a large accession of force.", "6061": "XXXV.", "6062": "Aratus was still true to his original principles, and, grieving at the spectacle of a despotism established in the neighbouring state of Argos, sent to Aristomachus, and endeavoured to persuade him to give up his authority, bring the city over to the Achæan league, and imitate Lydiades by becoming the glorious and respected general of so great a people rather than remain exposed to constant danger as the hated despot of one city.", "6063": "Aristo­ machus acceded to these proposals of Aratus, but asked him for the sum of fifty talents, for the payment of the mercenaries whom he was to disband.", "6064": "While the money was being procured, Lydiades, who was still in office as general, and wished to gain the credit of this negotiation for himself, told Aristomachus that Aratus was really the bitter and implacable foe of all despots, persuaded him to intrust the management of the affair to himself, and introduced Aristomachus to the Achæan assembly.", "6065": "On this occasion the Achæan representatives gave Aratus a notable proof of their love and confidence in him;", "6066": "for when he indignantly opposed the proposition they drove away Aristomachus;", "6067": "and yet, when Aratus had become his friend and again brought forward the matter, they readily accepted his proposal, admitted the cities of Argos and Phlius into the league, and the following year elected Aristomachus general.", "6068": "Aristomachus, finding himself cordially received by the Achæans, and wishing to invade Laconia, sent for Aratus from Athens.", "6069": "Aratus replied by a letter in which he dissuaded him from making this campaign, being unwilling to involve the Achæans in hostilities with Kleomenes, who was a bold general and had already gained surprising successes.", "6070": "As, however, Aristomachus was determined to begin the war, Aratus returned, and made the campaign with him.", "6071": "When near Pallantium they met Kleomenes, and Aratus was reproached by Lydiades for restraining Aristomachus from joining battle.", "6072": "The year after, Lydiades stood against Aratus as a candidate for the office of general, when Aratus was chosen general for the twelfth time.", "6073": "XXXVI.", "6074": "During this term of office Aratus was defeated by Kleomenes near Mount Lykaeum, and took to flight.", "6075": "He lost his way during the night, and was supposed to have fallen.", "6076": "The same rumours now again ran through Greece about him;", "6077": "but he got safely away, and having rallied his men was not satisfied with retiring home un­ molested, but making an admirable use of his opportunity, as no one expected an attack, he suddenly fell upon the Mantineans, who were the allies of Kleomenes.", "6078": "He took the city, placed a garrison in it, and insisted on the resi­ dent foreigners being admitted to the franchise, thus alone gaining for the Achæans after a defeat, a success which they could hardly have obtained by a victory.", "6079": "When the Lacedæmonians marched against Megalopolis, Aratus came to the assistance of that city.", "6080": "He would not fight with Kleomenes, though the latter endeavoured to entice him into a battle, but he kept back the men of Megalopolis who were eager to fight;", "6081": "for he was at no time well-fitted for the direction of pitched battles, and on this occasion was inferior in numbers, besides being opposed to a young and daring antagonist, while he himself was past the prime of life, and inclined to fail in spirit.", "6082": "He thought, too, that while it was right for Kleomenes to gain glory by daring, it was best for him to be careful to keep the glory which he had already obtained.", "6083": "XXXVII.", "6084": "Though the light-armed troops ran out to meet the Spartans, drove them back to their camp, and even fought round their tents, yet Aratus would not move on with the heavy-armed force, but halted them behind a water-course which he forbade them to cross.", "6085": "Lydiades, irritated at this, reproached Aratus, called upon the cavalry to follow him and reinforce the victorious light troops, and not to lose the victory or desert him when he was fighting for his country.", "6086": "Many brave men joined him, and with them he charged the right wing of the enemy, overthrew them, and pursued with reckless ardour until he became entangled in difficult ground, full of fruit trees and wide ditches, where he was attacked by Kleomenes, and fell fighting bravely in the noblest of causes, at the very gates of his native city.", "6087": "His companions fled back to the main body, where they disordered the ranks of the hoplites, and brought about the defeat of the entire army.", "6088": "Aratus was greatly blamed, because he was thought to have left Lydiades to perish.", "6089": "The Achæans angrily retired to Ægium, and forced him to accompany them.", "6090": "There they held a meeting, at which it was decided that he should not be supplied with any money nor any mercenary troops maintained for him, but that if he wished to go to war he must furnish them for himself.", "6091": "XXXVIII.", "6092": "After being thus disgraced, Aratus deter­ mined at once to give up the seals * and lay down his office of general, but after consideration he put up with the affront led out the army of the Achaeans, and fought a battle with Megistonous, the step-father of Kleomenes, in which he was victorious, slew three hundred of the enemy, and took prisoner Megistonous himself.", "6093": "He had hitherto been always elected general every other year, but now, when the time for his election came round, he refused to take the office, although pressed to do so, and Timotheus was chosen general.", "6094": "It was thought that his anger with the people was merely a pretext for his refusal, and that the real reason was the perilous situation of the Achæan league;", "6095": "for Kleo­ menes no longer operated against it by slow degrees as before, when he was embarrassed by the other Spartan magistrates, but now that he had put the Ephors to death, redistributed the land, and admitted many of the resi.", "6096": "dent aliens to the franchise, he found himself an irrespon-", "6097": "Bible ruler at the head of a large force, with which he at once assailed the Achæans, demanding himself to be acknow­ ledged as their chief.", "6098": "For this reason Aratus has been blamed for having like a pilot during a terrible storm and tempest yielded up the helm to another when it was his duty to stand by it, even against the will of the people, and save the commonwealth;", "6099": "or, if he despaired of the Achæans being able to resist, he ought to have made terms with Kleomenes and not to have allowed Peloponnesus to fall back into the hands of the uncivilised Macedonians and be occupied by their troops, and to have garrisoned the citadel of Corinth with Illyrian and Gaulish soldiers, thus inviting into the cities, under the name of allies, those very men whom he had passed his life in out-manoeuvring and over-reaching, and whom in his memoirs he speaks of with such hatred.", "6100": "Even if Kleomenes were, as some might call him, a despot and a law-breaker, yet Sparta was his native country, and the Herakleidæ were his ancestors, and surely any man who respected Greek nobility of birth would have chosen the least illustrious of such a family for his chief rather than the greatest man in all Macedonia.", "6101": "Moreover, Kleomenes, when he asked the Achæans to appoint him as their ruler, promised that in return for that title he would do great things for them by land and sea, whereas Antigonus, when offered the title of supreme ruler by land and sea, would not accept it until he received the citadel of Corinth as a bribe, exactly like the huntsman in Æsop's fable;", "6102": "for he would not mount upon the backs of the Achæans, though they begged him to do so, and offered themselves to him by embassies and decrees, before, by means of his garrison in Corinth and the hostages which he received, he had, as it were, placed a bit in their mouths.", "6103": "Aratus makes a laboured defence of his conduct, pleading the necessities of his situation.", "6104": "Yet Polybius tells us that long before any such necessities existed, Aratus had felt alarm at the daring spirit of Kleomenes, and had not only been carrying on secret negotiations with Antigonus, but even had urged the people of Megalopolis to propose to the Achaeans that Antigonus should be invited to assist them.", "6105": "It was the people of Megalopolis who were the great­ est sufferers by the war, as Kleomenes constantly ravaged their territories.", "6106": "The historian Phylarchus gives a similar account of the transaction, though we could hardly receive his narrative with confidence if it were not supported by the testimony of Polybius ;", "6107": "for he is so enthusiastic an ad­ mirer of the character of Kleomenes that in his history he writes as though he were pleading his cause in a court of justice, and continually disparages Aratus, and, vindicates Kleomenes.", "6108": "XXXIX.", "6109": "The Achæans now lost Mantinea, which was recaptured by Kleomenes, and they were so dispirited by a great defeat, which they sustained near Hekatombaeon, as to send at once to Kleomenes, inviting him to come to Argos and assume the supreme command.", "6110": "Aratus, as soon has he learned that Kleomenes had set out, and was march­ ing past Lerna at the head of his army, became alarmed, and sent an embassy to him, begging him, to come to the Achæans as to friends and allies, with only three hundred men, and offering hostages to him, if he suspected them of treachery.", "6111": "Kleomenes regarded this message as a mockery and an insult to himself.", "6112": "He immediatly retired, after writing a letter to the Achæans in which he brought many grave charges against Aratus.", "6113": "Aratus, in turn, wrote several letters to them assailing Kleomenes ;", "6114": "and they abused one another so outrageously as not even to spare the reputation of each other's wives.", "6115": "After this, Kleomenes sent a herald to declare war against the Achæans, and very nearly succeeded in making himself master of Sikyon by the treachery of some of its citizens.", "6116": "Failing in this, he turned aside, attacked Pellene drove out the commander, and took the city.", "6117": "Shortly afterwards he took Phenes and Penteleum.", "6118": "Upon this the Argives at once joined him, and the citizen of Phlius admitted a Spartan garrison:", "6119": "so that the Achæans seemed to be in danger of losing all their conquests, and Aratus became seriously alarmed at the disturbed condition of the Peloponnesus, for he saw that in every quarter cities, encouraged by revolutionary agitators, were preparing to throw off their allegiance to the league.", "6120": "XL..", "6121": "None were quiet or satisfied with things as they were, but many citizens of Corinth and of Sikyon itself openly corresponded with Kleomenes, and expressed the disaffection which they had long felt to the league, and their wish to obtain the supreme power for themselves.", "6122": "In dealing with these persons, Aratus took the law into his own hands and put to death all Sikyonians whom he found corrupted ;", "6123": "but when he attempted to seek out and punish the Corinthian conspirators, he enraged the popu­ lace which already was disaffected, and weary of the Achaean domination.", "6124": "The people ran together to the temple of Apollo, and sent for Aratus, being determined either to kill him or take him prisoner, before they proceeded openly to revolt from the league.", "6125": "Aratus appeared before them, leading his horse, without betraying any suspicion or alarm, and when many of them leaped up and showered abusive language upon him, he, with an admirable com­ posure of countenance and manner, quietly bade them be seated, and not stand up talking loudly and confusedly but let in also those who were outside the gates.", "6126": "While speaking thus he retired at a foot's pace, as though he were looking for some one to take care of his horse.", "6127": "By this means he got away from them and proceeded on his way, talking unconcernedly to all the Corinthians whom he met, whom he bade go to the temple of Apollo, until he came near to the citadel.", "6128": "Here he sprang upon his horse'a back, gave orders to Kleopater, the commander of the garrison, to hold the place stoutly, and rode away to Sikyon, followed by only thirty soldiers, as the rest had all remained behind and dispersed.", "6129": "After a short time the Corinthians discovered that he had taken to flight, and pursued, but as they could not overtake him, they sent to Kleomenes and delivered up their city to him.", "6130": "Yet Kleomenes considered that he had lost more by the escape of Aratus than he had gained by the ac­ quisition of Corinth.", "6131": "Kleomenes was at once joined by the inhabitants of the seaside district known as Akte, who surrendered their cities to him, and with their assistance he completely invested the citadel of Corinth with a rampart and palisade.", "6132": "XLI.", "6133": "Aratus was joined at Sikyon by the representatives of most of the cities of the Achaean league.", "6134": "An assembly was held, at which he was elected general, with unlimited powers.", "6135": "He now surrounded himself with a body-guard selected from among his fellow-citizens.", "6136": "Aratus had conducted the affairs of the league for thirty-three years, during which he had made himself the first man in Greece, both in power and in renown, though now he was utterly ruined and cast down, forced to cling to his native city as his only chance of safety amidst the general wreck of his fortunes.", "6137": "For the Ætolians refused to help him when he implored their aid, and Eurykleides and Mikion held back the Athenians from offering any assistance, though they were eager to do so out of regard for Aratus.", "6138": "Aratus had a house at Corinth and some property, which Kleomenes refused to touch, or to let any one else meddle with, but sent for Aratus's friends and those whom he had left in charge of his property, and bade them keep everything in good order, as they would have to answer to Aratus for their conduct.", "6139": "Kleomenes also sent Tripylus and his uncle Megistonous to Aratus to negotiate with him, promising him among many other advantages a yearly pension of twelve talents, thus over-bidding Ptolemy by one half:", "6140": "for Ptolemy paid Aratus six talents a year.", "6141": "Kleomenes proposed that he himself should receive the title of chief of the Achaeans, and that the citadel of Corinth should be garrisoned partly by Achæans and partly by Spartan troops.", "6142": "To this Aratus answered that he was not able to direct events, but rather was directed by them.", "6143": "As this language proved that he had no intention of negotiating seriously, Kleomenes at once invaded the territory of Sikyon, ravaged the country, and encamped for three months before the walls of the city.", "6144": "Aratus remained quiet within the walls, but began to consider whether it would be necessary for him to obtain the assistance of Antigonus by surrendering the citadel of Corinth to him:", "6145": "for his help was not to be had on any other terms.", "6146": "XLII.", "6147": "The Achæans now assembled at Ægium and in­ vited Aratus thither.", "6148": "The journey was a dangerous one for him to make, at a time when Kleomenes was encamped outside the city of Sikyon;", "6149": "and his fellow-countrymen endeavoured to keep him back by entreaties and even by threatening that, when the enemy was so close, they would not permit him to leave the city;", "6150": "while the women and children hung upon him weeping, as though he were the common father and preserver of them all.", "6151": "However, after addressing a few words of encouragement to them he rode away towards the sea, accompanied by ten of his friends and by his son, who was now grown up.", "6152": "At the beach they embarked on board of some vessels which were riding at anchor, and proceeded by sea to the assembly at Ægium, at which it was decreed that Antigonus should be invited to aid them, and that the citadel of Corinth should be handed over to him.", "6153": "Aratus even sent his son to Antigonus among the other hostages.", "6154": "The Corinthians, disgusted with these proceedings, now confiscated his property, and presented his house to Kleomenes.", "6155": "XLIII.", "6156": "Antigonus now approached with his army, which was composed of twenty thousand Macedonian foot soldiers, with thirteen hundred cavalry.", "6157": "Aratus, with the chief officers of the Achæan league, proceeded by sea to Pegæ to meet him, thus avoiding the enemy, although he had no great confidence in Antigonus, and distrusted the Macedonians.", "6158": "He felt that he owed his own greatness to the injuries which he had done them, and that his first rise as a politician was due to his hatred of the old An­ tigonus.", "6159": "Yet, driven by inexorable necessity, and by the exigencies of the times, to which men in authority are really slaves, he took this desperate course.", "6160": "Antigonus, as soon as he learned that Aratus was ap­ proaching, met him, and welcomed his companions in a friendly manner, but showed him especial honour at their first meeting, and as he found upon trial that Aratus was a worthy and sensible maIls he contracted closer relations with him than those of mere business.", "6161": "Indeed, Aratus was not only useful to Antigonus for the management of great political negotiations, but when the king was at leisure, proved a more agreeable companion to him than any one else.", "6162": "Antigonus, young as he was, perceived that Aratus was not spoiled by royal favour, and soon preferred him not only above all other Achæans, but even beyond his own Macedonian courtiers.", "6163": "Thus was the sign which the god had given him in the sacrifice brought to pass :", "6164": "for it is said that a short time before this, Aratus was offering sacrifice and that there appeared in the liver of the victim two gall bladders enclosed in one caul.", "6165": "The soothsayer explained this to portend that Aratus would shortly form an intimate friendship with his greatest enemy.", "6166": "At the time he disregarded this saying, for he was always more inclined to follow the dictates of common sense than to be guided by prophecies and portents.", "6167": "Afterwards, however, as the war proceeded successfully, Antigonus made a great feast at Corinth to which he invited many guests.", "6168": "Among these was Aratus, whom he placed next to himself.", "6169": "Presently he sent for a wrapper, and asked Aratus if he also did not feel chilly.", "6170": "Aratus answered that he was very cold, and Antic-onus then bade him come closer to himself, so that the servants who brought the wrapper enveloped them both in it.", "6171": "Then Aratus, remembering the portent, burst out laughing, and told the king about the sacrifice and the prophecy.", "6172": "This, however, happened after the times of which I am writing.", "6173": "XLIV.", "6174": "At Pegæ Aratus and Antigonus each plighted their faith to the other, and then at once marched against the enemy.", "6175": "Before Corinth several battles took place, for Kleomenes was securely entrenched there, and the Corinthians vigorously assisted him.", "6176": "But now one Aristoteles of Argos, a friend of Aratus, sent secretly to him to say that he could cause that city to revolt from Kleomenes, if Aratus would appear before it with some Macedonian soldiers.", "6177": "Aratus laid the matter before Antigonus, and hurriedly crossed over to Epidaurus by sea with a force of fifteen hundred men.", "6178": "The Argives rose in revolt before his arrival, attacked the troops of Kleomenes, and drove them to take refuge in the citadel;", "6179": "and Kleomenes, hearing of this, and fearing that if the enemy made themselves masters of Argos they might cut off his retreat, abandoned Corinth and marched by night to help the garrison of Argos.", "6180": "He arrived there before Aratus, and won a partial success, but soon afterwards, as Aratus was marching to attack him, and King Anti­ gonus was coming on behind Aratus, he retired to Mantinea.", "6181": "Upon this all the cities of Peloponnesus again joined the Achæans, and Antigonus received the citadel of Corinth.", "6182": "The people of Argos now elected Aratus their commander-in-chief, and he persuaded them to make a present to Antigonus of all the property of their late despots and of all traitors.", "6183": "Aristomachus was put to the torture at Cenchreae and then drowned in the sea, a proceeding which brought great discredit upon Aratus for having allowed a man of considerable merit, with whom he had formerly been intimately connected, and whom he had persuaded to abdicate his throne and bring over Argos to the league, to be put to death in this cruel and illegal manner.", "6184": "XLV.", "6185": "By this time also many other charges were brought against Aratus by the other cities, as, for instance, that the league had given Corinth to Antigonus just as if it were some obscure village, and that it had permitted him to sack Orchomenus and place in it a Macedonian garrison ;", "6186": "that it had passed a decree, that no letter or embassy should be sent to any other king if Antigonus did not approve of it;", "6187": "that they were forced to maintain and pay the Macedonians, and that they celebrated religious services, processions, and games in honour of Antigonus, in which the fellow-citizens of Aratus took the lead, and invited him into their city where he was the guest of Aratus.", "6188": "All blamed Aratus foi this, not considering that he had given over the reins tc Antigonus, and was now compelled to follow his lead, having no longer anything except his tongue which he could call his own, and not daring to use even that with entire freedom.", "6189": "It was clear that much of what was being done distressed Aratus, as for instance the affair of the statues ;", "6190": "for Antigonus restored the statues of the despots at Argos which had been thrown down, and threw down all the statues of the captors of the citadel of Corinth, except only that of Aratus himself :", "6191": "and that, too, although Aratus begged him earnestly to spare those of the others.", "6192": "At Mantinea, too, the behaviour of the Achæans was repugnant to Hellenic patriotism, for having by the help of Antigonus captured that city, they put to death all the leading men, and of the rest they sold some and sent others to Macedonia loaded with fetters, while they made slaves of the women and children.", "6193": "Of the proceeds of the sale they divided one-third among themselves, and gave two-thirds to the Macedonians.", "6194": "Yet this can be justified by the law of revenge ;", "6195": "for though it is a shocking thing to deal so cruelly with men of one's own nation, through anger, still, in great political crises, revenge is sweet and not bitter, and in the words of Simouides, soothes and relieves the angry spirit.", "6196": "But what happened afterwards cannot be thought honourable to Aratus, nor can it be attributed to political exigencies :", "6197": "for when the city was presented by Antigonus to the Achæans, and they decided upon colonising it, Aratus being chosen as its founder, and being at the time general of the Achæans, decreed that it should no longer be called Mantinea, but Antigoneia, which remains its Dame to this day.", "6198": "Thus, by his means, the lovely Mantinea, as Homer calls it,. was wiped out of the map of Greece, and there remains in its stead a city whose name recalls its destroyer and the murderer of its citizens.", "6199": "XLVI.", "6200": "Subsequently to this, Kleomenes was defeated in a great battle at Sellasia, left Sparta and sailed to Egypt.", "6201": "Antigonus, after showing every kindness to Aratus, re­ turned to Macedonia, where, as he already was suffering from the illness which caused his death, he sent the heir to his kingdom, Philip, who was now a mere lad, into Peloponnesus, advising him to pay the greatest attentions to Aratus, and through him to negotiate with the cities, and make the acquaintance of the Achæans.", "6202": "Aratus welcomed Philip, and so treated him that he returned to Macedonia full of good will towards himself, and full of generous feelings and impulses towards the Greeks.", "6203": "XLVII.", "6204": "When Antigonus died, the Ætolians, who regarded the Achæans with contempt because of their cowardice (for indeed they had become accustomed to be protected by others, and trusting, entirely to the Mace­ donian arms, had fallen into a condition of complete in­ dolence and want of discipline), began to interfere in the politics of the Peloponnesus.", "6205": "During their invasion they incidentally plundered the territory of Patræ and Dyme, and then marched into the country of Messenia and began to lay it waste.", "6206": "Aratus, distressed at this, and seeing that Timoxenus, the general of the Achæans, was acting slowly and without spirit because his year of office had almost expired, anticipated his own election as general by five days, in order to assist the Messenians.", "6207": "He assembled an Achæan army :", "6208": "but the men were without military training and were destitute of warlike spirit.", "6209": "This army was defeated in a battle near Kaphyæ, and Aratus, who was reproached with having been too rash a general, now fell into the opposite extreme, and showed such apathy as often to refuse to seize opportunities for attack which were offered by the Ætolians, and to permit them to riot through Peloponnesus with every kind of wanton insult.", "6210": "Now, a second time, the Achaeans stretched forth their hands towards Macedonia and brought Philip to interfere in the affairs of Greece.", "6211": "They were the more willing to take this step because they knew the regard which Philip felt for Aratus, and the trust which he placed in him, and they hoped that they should find him gentle and manageable in all respects.", "6212": "XLVIII.", "6213": "At first the king, influenced by the slanders of Apelles, Megaleas, and some other of his courtiers against Aratus encouraged those of the opposite faction, and eagerly pressed for the election of Eperatus as general of the league.", "6214": "However, as he was utterly despised by the Achaeans, and as nothing useful could be effected while Aratus was out of office, Philip perceived that he had made a complete mistake.", "6215": "He now came entirely over to the side of Aratus, and acted entirely at his dictation.", "6216": "As he was now gaining both renown and power, he attached himself more and more to Aratus, imagining that it was by his means that he gained his successes.", "6217": "Indeed it began to be thought that Aratus was able to school kings as well as he could free cities ;", "6218": "for the impress of his character was to be traced in every one of Philip's acts.", "6219": "Thus the lenity with which the young prince treated the Lacedæmonians after they had offended him, his per­ sonal interviews with the Cretans, by means of which he gained possession of the whole island in a few days, and his brilliantly successful campaign against the Ætolians, all gained for Aratus the credit of giving good advice, and for Philip that of knowing how to follow it:", "6220": "All this made Philip's courtiers more and more jealous of Aratus.", "6221": "As they could effect nothing against him by secret intrigues, they proceeded to open abuse, and assailed him at wine­ parties with the most scurrilous impertinence, and once when he was retiring to his tent after dinner they even sent a shower of stones after him.", "6222": "Philip was very in­ dignant at these proceedings, and at once imposed upon them a fine of twenty talents.", "6223": "Afterwards, as they were embroiling and troubling his affairs by their intrigues, he had them all put to death.", "6224": "XLIX.", "6225": "Now that Philip was borne along upon the full tide of success, he developed many vehement lusts, and the natural wickedness of his nature broke through all the artificial restraints by which it had been hitherto held in check, and gradually revealed him in his true colours.", "6226": "His first act was to seduce the wife of the younger Aratus.", "6227": "This intrigue he earned on for a long time unsuspected, as he lived in their house and was treated as an honoured guest.", "6228": "Next, he began to treat the Greeks in a much harsher fashion, and evidently intended to rid himself of Aratus.", "6229": "His conduct at Messene first gave rise to this suspicion.", "6230": "The Messenians revolted, and Aratus marched to attack them, but Philip reached Messene one day before him, and when he entered the city stirred up the passions of the citizens by asking the aristocracy of the Messenians in private whether they had no laws to keep down the po­ pulace, and then again in private inquiring of the leaders of the people whether they had no hands wherewith to quell despots.", "6231": "After this the chief men took heart and fell upon the popular leaders, but they, with the assist­ ance of the people, killed all the magistrates and nearly two hundred of the other leading citizens.", "6232": "L. After Philip had thus wickedly exasperated the Messenians against one another, Aratus arrived.", "6233": "He made no secret of his distress at what had happened, and did not restrain his son when he bitterly reproached and abused Philip.", "6234": "The young man was thought to have been Philip's lover;", "6235": "and he now told Philip that after such deeds he did not any longer think him handsome, but hideous.", "6236": "Philip made no answer, although he was thought likely to do so, as he often had burst into a fury when thus spoken to, but, just as though he had patiently endured the reproof and was really of a moderate and statesmanlike disposition, he took the elder Aratus by the hand, led him out of the theatre, and proceeded with him as far as the summit of Ithome, to

"6237": "After mounting the hill and offering sacrifice, when the soothsayer brought him the entrails of the ox, he, taking them into his own hands, kept show­ ing them first to Aratus and then to Demetrius of Pharos, alternately placing them before each, and asking what they thought was the meaning of the entrails, that he would keep possession of the citadel, or that he would restore it to the Messenians.", "6238": "At this Demetrius laughed and said, \" If you have the soul of a soothsayer, you will give up the place;", "6239": "but if you have that of a king, you will clutch the ox by both horns,\" alluding to Peloponnesus, which, if he held the citadels of Messene and of Corinth, would be quite tame and at his mercy.", "6240": "Aratus remained silent for a long while, but when Philip begged him to say what he thought, he answered, “ My king, there are many high mountains in Crete, and there are many strong positions in Bœotia and Phokis.", "6241": "I believe too, that there are many places of surprising strength in Acarnania, both on the sea coast and inland, yet you have not taken any of these, and nevertheless the people of those countries willingly execute your commands.", "6242": "Brigands cling to high cliffs and haunt precipitous places, but kings find nothing so secure as loyalty and goodwill.", "6243": "This it is that opened to you the Cretan ses, and the Peloponnesus.", "6244": "By these arts you, young as you are, have made yourself the master of the one, and the leader of the other.\"", "6245": "While Aratus was yet speaking Philip gave back the entrails to the soothsayer, and, taking Aratus by the hand, said,“ Come now, let us go back again,\" having been, as it were, overruled by him into letting the city remain free.", "6246": "LI.", "6247": "Aratus now began to withdraw himself from the court, and by degrees to break off his intimacy with Philip, When Philip conveyed his army across the Corinthian gulf into Epirus,* and desired Aratus to make the campaign with him, Aratus refused and remained at home, fearing that he might share the disgrace of Philip's operations.", "6248": "Philip, after his fleet had been ignominiously destroyed by the Romans, and his whole enterprise had failed,t returned to Peloponnesus, and, as he did not succeed in a second attempt to outwit the Messenians and to gain possession of their citadel, he threw off the mask and openly wronged them by ravaging their territory.", "6249": "Aratus now became quite estranged from him, and was misrepresented to him.", "6250": "He had by this time learned the domestic dishonour which he had sustained from Philip, and grieved over it, though he kept it secret from his son ;", "6251": "for when he had discovered it, he was power­ less to avenge it.", "6252": "Indeed Philip's character seems to have undergone a very great and remarkable change, as from a mild ruler and a modest youth he grew into a profligate man and an atrocious tyrant.", "6253": "This change was not due to any alteration of his real nature, but to the fact that he could now with impunity indulge the vices which fear had hitherto forced him to conceal.", "6254": "LII.", "6255": "His treatment of Aratus showed that he had always regarded him with a mixture of respect and fear ;", "6256": "for though he desired to make away with him, and con­ sidered that during Aratus's life-time he should not even be a free man, much less a despot or king, yet he would not openly attack him, but bade Taurion, one of his generals and friends, to do this secretly, by poison if pos­ sible, during his own absence.", "6257": "This man gained the con­ fidence of Aratus, and administered drugs to him, whose action was not quick and sudden, but which produced slight heats in the body and a chronic cough, and so gradually undermined his strength.", "6258": "He did not, how­ ever, do this without being discovered by Aratus;", "6259": "but he, as he could gain nothing by convicting him, continued to enduie his malady just as if it were some ordinary disorder.", "6260": "Only once when he spat blood, and one of his friends who was in the same room noticed it and expressed his concern, Aratus said, “ This, Kephalon, is the return I get for my friendship for the king.\"", "6261": "LIII.", "6262": "Thus died Aratus at Ægium, when holding the office of general of the league for the seventeenth time.", "6263": "The Achæans wished his funeral to take place in that city, and to raise a suitable monument over so great a man ;", "6264": "but the people of Sikyon regarded it as a national misfortune that he should not be buried in their city, and prevailed upon the Achæans to deliver up the body to them.", "6265": "As there was a law which was regarded with superstitious reverence, forbidding any one to be interred within the walls of Sikyon, they sent ambassadors to Delphi to consult the oracle.", "6266": "The Pythia returned the following

thy Aratus' grave.", "6270": "\"When this response was brought back all the Achæans were delighted, and the Sikyonians in particular, turning their mourning into joy, put on white robes, crowned themselves with garlands, and removed the body of Aratus from Ægium to Sikyon in festal procession with songs and dances.", "6271": "They chose a conspicuous spot, and interred him in it with as much reverence as though he were the founder and saviour of their city.", "6272": "The place is called the Arateum to the present day, and on the day upon which he freed the city from its despot, which is the fifth day of the month Daisius, or Anthesterion in the Athenian calendar, a sacrifice, called the thanksgiving for safety, is offered, and also on the day of the month on which Aratus was born.", "6273": "The former sacrifice used to be conducted by the priest of Zeus the Saviour, and the latter by the priest of Aratus, who wore a headband, not all white, but mixed with purple.", "6274": "Songs used to be chanted to the music of the harp by the actors, called the servants of Dionysius, and the president of the gymnasiums took part in the procession, leading the boys and young men, after whom followed the council of the city, crowned with flowers, and any of the citizens who wished to do so.", "6275": "Some traces of these pro­ ceedings still survive, as religous ceremonies;",

life and character of the elder Aratus.", "6279": "As for his son, Philip, who was naturally a villain, and whose disposition combined insolence with cruelty, administered drugs to him, which were not deadly, but which deprived him of his reason;", "6280": "so that he conceived a passion for monstrous lusts and shameful debaucheries, by which he was soon so worn out that, although he was in the flower of his age, death appeared to him to be a release from sufferings rather than a misfortune.", "6281": "Yet Zeus, the patron of hospitality and of friendship, exacted a notable penalty from Philip for his wickedness, and pursued him throughout his life :", "6282": "for he was utterly defeated by the Romans, and forced to sur­ render at discretion to them.", "6283": "He lost all his empire, was obliged to deliver up all his fleet, except five ships, had to pay a thousand talents and give up his own SOIl as a hostage, and then only was allowed, by the pity of his conquerors to keep Macedonia itself and its dependencies.", "6284": "As he always put to death all the loading men of his kingdom, and all his nearest relations, he inspired the whole country with terror and hatred.", "6285": "Amidst all his miseries he had one piece of good fortune, in having a son of remarkable promise, and him he put to death out of jealousy and envy at the honours which were paid him by the Romans.", "6286": "He left his kingdom to his other son Perseus, who was said not to be legitimate, but to be the son of a sempstress named Gnathæna.", "6287": "Over him Paulus Æmilius

the com­ mand of the army in Macedonia, and found that the soldiers did nothing but talk and meddle, as though each man were a general, gave them orders to keep their hands ready and their swords sharp, and leave the rest to him.", "6294": "And Plato likewise, seeing that a good general is useless without a disciplined and united army, thought that soldiers should be mild and gentle, as well as spirited and energetic, because those who know how to obey require a noble nature and a philosophic tiaining as much as those who know how to command.", "6295": "The events which took place at Rome after Nero's death prove most conclusively that nothing is more terrible than a military force which is guided only by its own blind and ignorant impulses.", "6296": "Demades, when he saw the disorderly and senseless move­ ments of the Macedonian army after the death of Alex­ ander, compared it to the Cyclops after he had been blinded;", "6297": "but the state of the Roman Empire resembled the fabled rebellion of the Titans, as it was torn asunder into several portions, which afterwards fought with one another, not so much because of the ambition of those who were proclaimed emperors,

after reigning in Tbessaly for ten months, Dionysius, sneering at the shortness of his reign, called him a mere tragedy king;", "6299": "but the palace of the Cæsars in a shorter time than this saw four emperors, for the soldiers brought one in and drove another out, as if they were actors on a stage.", "6300": "The only consolation which the unhappy Romans enjoyed was that the authors of their miseries required no avenger to destroy them, for they fell by one another's hands, and first of all, and most justly, perished the man who had seduced the army into expecting such great things from a

legionary soldiers serving in the provinces twelve hundred and fifty drachmas ;", "6305": "a sum which it would have been impossible to collect without inflicting ten thousand­ fold more misery on mankind than Nero himself had done.", "6306": "This offer at once caused the downfall of Nero, and soon afterwards that of Galba;", "6307": "for the soldiery deserted Nero in hopes of receiving the money, and murdered Galba because they did not receive it.", "6308": "After this they sought so eagerly for some one who would give them as much, that before they obtained the hoped-for bribe, their

with Catulus,* who, though he shrank from taking any active part in politics, was yet one of the most virtuous and eminent men of the time.", "6314": "Galba was likewise related to Livia, the wife of Augustus, and by her influence he had been raised from the post which he held in the palace to the office of consul.", "6315": "He is said to have ably commanded the army in Germany, and to have gained especial praise by his conduct as pro-consul in Libya.", "6316": "But when he became emperor, his simple and inexpensive mode of life was thought to be sheer meanness, while his ideas of discipline and sobriety appeared obsolete and ridiculous.", "6317": "Nero, before he had learned to fear the most eminent of the Romans, had appointed Galba to a command in Spain.", "6318": "Indeed, besides the mildness of his character, it was thought that his advanced age was a guarantee against his engaging in any rash enterprise.", "6319": "IV.", "6320": "While Galba was in Spain, the procurators of the emperor treated the provincials with the greatest harsh­ ness and cruelty.", "6321": "Galba could not afford them any assist­ ance, but he made no secret of his sympathy with them and sorrow at their wrongs, and thus afforded them some relief while they were being condemned unjustly and sold into slavery.", "6322": "Many scurrilous songs also were written about Nero and sung and circulated everywhere, and as Galba did not discourage this, and did not share the indigo nation of the procurators, he became even more endeared to the natives, with whom he was already

committed any overt act of rebellion he wrote to Galba, and that Galba neither agreed to his proposals nor yet denounced him, as some other generals did;", "6325": "for many of them sent Vindex's letters to Nero, and as far as they were able ruined his cause.", "6326": "Yet these men afterwards became traitors, and so proved that they could betray themselves as well as Vindex.", "6327": "When, however, Vindex openly raised the standard of revolt, and called upon Galba to accept the offer of em­ pire, and constitute himself the head of a strong body— namely, the troops in Gaul, a hundred thousand armed men, and many times more men capable of bearing arms— Galba called a council of his friends.", "6328": "Some of them advised him to temporise, and watch the progress of events at Rome;", "6329": "but Titus Vinius, the captain of the praetorian cohort, said, “Galba, why do you hesitate?", "6330": "for yon cannot remain quiet, and yet think of remaining faithful to Nero.", "6331": "If Nero is to be your foe, you must not refuse the proffered alliance of Vindex, or else you must at once denounce him and attack him, because he wishes the Romans to have you for their chief rather than Nero for their tyrant.\"V. After this, Galba by an edict appointed a day upon which he would grant manumi-sion to whoever might wish it, and rumour and gossip drew together on that day a great multitude of people eager for revolution.", "6332": "No sooner did Galba appear upon the tribune than all with one voice saluted him as emperor.", "6333": "Galba did not at once accept this title, but spoke in disparagement of Nero, deplored the best citizens of Rome who had been murdered by him, and promised that he would watch over his country to the best of his power, not as Caesar or Emperor, but merely as the general of the Senate and people of Rome.", "6334": "That Vindex acted justly and on due reflection when he offered the empire to Galba, is proved by the conduct of Nero himself ;", "6335": "for though he affected to despise Vindex and to regard Gaul as of no importance, yet as soon as he heard of Galba's rising, which was when he was at breakfast after his bath, he overturned the table.", "6336": "However, as the Senate declared Galba a public enemy, Nero, wishing to show his courage and to jest with his friends, said that this gave him a good pretext for raising the money of which he stood in need ;", "6337": "for when he had conquered the Gauls he would sell their spoils by public auction, and in the meantime he could at once confiscate the estate of Calba, as he had been declared a public enemy.", "6338": "Nero, after this, ordered Galba's property to be sold, and Galba, when he heard of this, ordered all Nero's property in Spain to be put up to auction and found people much more ready to purchase it.", "6339": "VI.", "6340": "Many now revolted from Nero, and all these, as might be expected, declared for Galba, with the exception of Clodius Macer, in Africa, and Virginius Rufus.", "6341": "who commanded the German army in Gaul, who each acted for themselves, though for different reasons.", "6342": "Clodius, who had plundered his province, and put many men to death from cruelty and covetousness, hesitated, because he could neither continue to hold his command nor yet give it up with safety.", "6343": "Virginius on the other hand, who was at the head of the most powerful force in the empire, and who was constantly saluted as emperor by his soldiers and urged to assume the purple, declared that he would neither become emperor himself nor yet allow any one else to do so without the consent of the Senate.", "6344": "Galba was at first much disturbed at this.", "6345": "Soon the two armies of Vindex and Virginius, like horses that have taken the bit between their teeth, fought a severe battle with one another.", "6346": "After two thousand Gauls had fallen, Vindex committed suicide;", "6347": "and a rumour became prevalent that after so signal a victory the whole army would either place Virginius upon the throne, or would return to their allegiance to Nero.", "6348": "Galba, who was now greatly alarmed, wrote to Virginius, begging him to act in concert with him, and preserve the empire and liberty of the Romans.", "6349": "Meanwhile he retired with his friends to Colonia, a city of Spain, where he occupied himself more in repenting of the

his chamber, forced open the door in spite of the resistance of the attendants, made his way in and told him that while Nero was still alive, first the army, and then the people and Senate had declared Galba emperor :", "6353": "and that shortly afterwards a report was spread of Nero's death.", "6354": "The messenger said that he had not believed this rumour, and that he had not left Rome before he had seen the corpse of Nero.", "6355": "This news very greatly raised the credit of Galba, and a multitude of men, whose confidence in him had been restored by this message, flocked to his doors to salute him.", "6356": "Yet the time * in which he received the news seemed incredibly short.", "6357": "But, two days after­ wards Titus Vinius arrived with several other persons, who brought

stroke, attempted to get all departments of the state into his own hands.", "6362": "He pointed out that Galba was an old man who would scarcely live long enough to be carried to Rome in a litter;", "6363": "and indeed Galba was in his seventy-third year.", "6364": "The soldiers in the provinces, be declared, had long been his friends, and they now depended on him alone because of the enormous presents which he offered them, which made them regard him as their benefactor, and Galba as their debtor.", "6365": "Nymphidius now at once ordered his colleague Tigellinus to give up his sword, and entertained all men of consular or praetorian rank at state banquets, although he still invited them in the name of Galba, while he suborned many of the prætorian guard to say that they must petition Galba to appoint Nymphidius as their prefect for life without any colleague.", "6366": "He was urged to even more audacious pretensions by the conduct of the Senate, who added to his fame and power by addressing him as their benefactor, by assembling daily to pay their respects to him, and by requiring him to propose and to ratify every decree :", "6367": "so that in a short time he became an object not only of jealousy but of terror to his supporters.", "6368": "When the consuls chose public messengers to carry the decrees of the Senate to the emperor, and had given them the sealed documents known as diplomas,.", "6369": "at the sight of which the local authorities in all towns assist the bearer on his journey by relays of horses at each stage.", "6370": "Nym­ phidius was much vexed at their not having come to him to affix the seals and to provide messengers from the praetorian guard, and he is even said to have thought of wreaking his displeasure on the consuls;", "6371":

likeness which he bore to the gladiator.", "6380": "However, though he did not deny that Nymphidia was his mother, he nevertheless boasted that the dethronement of Nero was entirely his own work, and, not satisfied with having gained by it both honours and riches, and the embraces of Sporns, the favourite of Nero, whom he had fetched away from the funeral pyre of his late master and now treated as his wife, calling her Poppaea, he was intriguing to gain the throne for himself.", "6381": "He employed several of his friends, among whom were some ladies of rank and senators, to further his interests in Rome, and sent one Gellianus to Spain to watch the proceedings of Galba.X.", "6382": "After Nero's death all went well with Galba, though he still felt uneasy about Virginius Rufus, who had not declared his intentions, and, who, being at the head of a great and warlike army, with the glory of having over­ thrown Vindex and made himself master of a great part of the Roman Empire, was not unlikely to listen to the solicitations of those who wished him to assume the purple, especially as the whole of Gaul was in an excited condition and ready to revolt.", "6383": "No name was greater or more glo­ rious than that of Virginius, who was credited with having saved Rome both from a cruel tyranny and from a war with Gaul.", "6384": "He, however, according to his original inten­

tribunes who attended him in his tent drew his sword, and bade Virginius choose between the steel and the throne.", "6386": "But when Fabius Valens, the commander of one legion, swore allegiance to Galba, and dispatches arrived from Rome containing an account of what the Senate had decreed, Virginius, though not with.", "6387": "out difficulty, prevailed upon his soldiers to salute Galba as emperor;", "6388": "and when Galba sent Hordeonius Flaccus to supersede him, he received him as his successor, delivered up the troops to him, met Galba, who was now on the march for Rome, and joined him without receiving from him any token either of favour or resentment.", "6389": "Galba respected Virginius too much to injure him, and Titus Vinius and Galba's other adherents opposed his advance­ ment out of jealousy, though in truth they only assisted the good genius of Virginius in withdrawing him from the wars and troubles in which all the other commanders were involved, and enabling him to live in peaceful retirement to a good old age.", "6390": "XI.", "6391": "At Narbo, a city of Gaul,.", "6392": "Galba was met by envoys from the Senate, who greeted him and invited him to show himself

things, though Nymphi­ dins had forwarded from Nero's stores sumptuous services of everything necessary for great banquets, and the imperial household servants.", "6394": "By this conduct Galba gained the reputation of being a magnanimous man, above any ideas of vulgar ostentation ;", "6395": "but Vinius presently told him that this noble and patriotic simplicity seemed merely an artifice to gain popularity with the lower classes, and that it was affectation to behave as though he were not worthy of this magnificence.", "6396": "By these arguments Vinius prevailed upon him to use Nero's riches, and not to shrink from an imperial extravagance at his banquets.", "6397": "Indeed the old man seemed as though by degrees he would come to be altogether ruled by Vinius.", "6398": "XII.",

removes these two of his friends from his court.\"", "6413": "As this language was not approved, for indeed it seemed a strange and unheard of proceeding, to lecture an old general upon the choice of his friends, as though he were a young boy just appointed to his first command, Nymphidius tried another course, and attempted to intimidate Galba by writing letters to him, in which he at one time declared that Rome was in an excited and disaffected condition, and at another that Clodius Macer had laid an embargo on the corn-ships in African ports, and that the German legions were rising in revolt, and that he heard much the same news about the troops in Syria and Judæa.", "6414": "As Galba did not pay much attention to his letters or attach much credit to the assertions which they contained, he resolved to make his attempt before Galba's arrival, though Clodius Celsus of Antioch, who was a sensible man and a faithful friend, dissuaded him, saying that he did not believe that there was one single family in Rome that would address Nymphidius as Cæsar.", "6415": "Many, however, scoffed at Galba, and Mithridates of Pontus * in particular, sneering at his bald head and wrinkled face, said that the Romans thought a great deal of Galba, now that he was absent, but that when he came they would think him a disgrace to the age that called him Cæsar.XIV.", "6416": "It was

indeed justified by his crimes;", "6419": "but they could not accuse Galba of having murdered his mother or his wife;", "6420": "nor could they allege that he had ever disgraced the purple by appearing on the stage. \"", "6421": "Yet,\" he continued, “ it was not any of these things that made us desert Nero, but Nymphidius persuaded us into doing so when Nero had already deserted us and fled to Egypt.", "6422": "Shall we then kill G alba as well as Nero?", "6423": "Shall we choose the son of Nymphidia for our emperor, and slay the son of Livia as we slew the son of Agrippina?", "6424": "Or shall we rather punish this fellow for his crimes, and thus prove ourselves the avengers of Nero, and the faithful guards of Galba ?", "6425": "”This speech of the tribune was agreed to by all his soldiers, who proceeded to their comrades, and urged them to remain faithful to Galba, and most of them promised to do so.", "6426": "Soon a shout was raised, either because, according to some writers, Nymphidius believed that the soldiers were already calling for him, or else because he wished to be beforehand with them and fix them while they were wavering and uncertain whom they should follow.", "6427": "Nymphidius came forward in the glare of many torches, carrying in his hand a speech written by Cingonius Varro, which he had learned by heart and intended to address to the soldiers.", "6428": "When, however, he saw that the gates of the camp were closed, and that the walls were covered with armed men, he was alarmed, and, coming up to the gates, asked what they wanted, and by whose orders they were under arms.", "6429": "They all answered with one voice that they looked upon Galba as their emperor.", "6430": "At this Nymphidius went up to them, applauded their reso­ lution, and bade his followers do likewise.", "6431": "The soldiers at the gate let him pass in, with a few others.", "6432": "Pre­ sently a spear was hurled at him, which Septimius caught before him on his shield;", "6433": "but as many now attacked Nym­ phidius with drawn swords, he ran away, was pursued into a soldier's room, and slain tkere.", "6434": "The corpse was dragged into a public place where a railing was put round it, and it was left exposed to public view the next day.", "6435": "XV.", "6436": "When Galba heard how Nymphidius had perished, he ordered such of his accomplices as had not voluntarily made away with themselves to be put to death:", "6437": "among whom were Cingonius Varro who wrote the speech, and Mithridates of Pontus.", "6438": "In this Galba was thought to have shown himself harsh beyond all usage, if not beyond all law, and this execution of men of rank without a trial­ was a most unpopular message.", "6439": "Indeed, all men had expected a very different kind of rule, for they had been deceived, as is usually the case, by the reports spread at the beginning of Galba's reign.", "6440": "They were still further grieved at the fate of Petronius Turpilianus, a man of consular rank and a faithful servant of Nero, whom Galba ordered to destroy himself.", "6441": "In Africa Macer had, it is true, been put to death by Trebonianus, and Fonteius in Germany by Fabius Valens, acting under Galba's orders:", "6442": "vet in both these cases he had the excuse that he feared, them, as they were in open rebellion against him;", "6443": "but there could be no reason for refusing a trial to Turpilianus, an old and helpless man, if the emperor had any intention of carrying out in his acts the moderation of which he spoke in his proclamations.", "6444": "For all this, therefore, Galba was blamed by the Romans.", "6445": "When on his journey he arrived within five-and-twenty stadia (about three English miles) of the city, he met a disorderly mob of sailors * who occupied the entire road.", "6446": "These were the men whom Nero had formed into a legion and treated as soldiers.", "6447": "They now wished to have their appointment confirmed, and pushed forward towards the emperor noisily demand­ ing standards for their legion and quarters to encamp in, crowding round him in such disorder that he could neither be seen nor heard by those citizens who had come out to meet him on his arrival.", "6448": "When he endeavoured to put the matter off, and said that he would give them an answer at another time, they, taking his delay to mean a refusal of their demand, became indignant, and followed him with loud shouts.", "6449": "As some of them drew their swords, Galba ordered his cavalry to charge them.", "6450": "No resistance was offered, but some were cut down in the act of turning to flee, and some while they ran.", "6451": "It was thought to be a very bad omen that Galba should make his entry into the city in the midst of so much blood and slaughter;", "6452": "but all who had before jeered at him as a feeble old man now looked upon him with fear and horror.", "6453": "XVI.", "6454": "In the giving of presents Galba wished to show a marked change from the profuse liberality of Nero:", "6455": "but he seems to have missed his mark, as for example, when Canus, the celebrated flute-player, performed before him at dinner, Galba praised his playing and ordered his purse to be brought.", "6456": "From this he took several gold pieces and gave them to Canus, telling him that the money came from his own pocket, not from the revenues of the state.", "6457": "He also demanded the restitution of the largesses, which Nero had bestowed on his favourite actors and athletes, leaving them only a tenth part.", "6458": "As he could scarcely get any part of the money back from them, for the major part being reckless profligates who lived only for the day'is enjoyment, had spent it all, he began to search out those who had bought anything or received any presents from them, and obliged them to refund.", "6459": "This investigation caused infinite trouble, for it affected so many persons;", "6460": "it covered Galba with disgrace and made Vinius loathed and detested for making the emperor show himself so mean and pettifogging towards his subjects, while he himself used his power recklessly, confiscating and selling every one's property.", "6461": "Hesiod, indeed, bids us drink deep of­ \"", "6462": "The end and the beginning of the cask;", "6463": "\" and Vinius, seeing that Galba was old and feeble took his fill of his fortune, as though it were both beginning and ending.", "6464": "XVII.", "6465": "The old emperor received much wrong, first from the bad arrangements made by Vinius, and also because Vinius blamed or defeated his best intentions.", "6466": "An instance of this was his punishment of Nero's favourites.", "6467": "He did, indeed, put to death many wretches, among whom were Helius, Polykleitus, Petinus, and Patrobius.", "6468": "The people applauded, and cried out as these men were being led through the Forum, that the sight was a fair one and pleasing to the gods, but that both gods and men de­ manded the punishment of Tigellinus, Nero's tutor and instructor in wickedness.", "6469": "That worthy, however, had previously attached Vinius to himself by a most important pledge.-", "6470": "So, they argued, Turpilianus perished though he had committed no crime except that he remained faith­ ful and did not betray a bad master;", "6471": "while the man, who first made Nero unfit to live, and then deserted and betrayed him, was still alive, an evident example that anything could be obtained from Vinius by those who could pay for it.", "6472": "The Roman people, who would have enjoyed no spectacle so much as that of Tigellinus dragged away to execution, and who never ceased to demand his head when they assembled in the theatre or the circus, were astonished at a proclamation in which the emperor, after declaring that Tigellinus was suffering from a wast­ ing disease and could not live long, begged his people not to urge him to disgrace his reign by acts of tyranny and ferocity.", "6473": "In ridicule of the public exasperation Tigellinus offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods for the recovery of his health, and prepared a splendid banquet;", "6474": "while Vinius left the table of the emperor after dinner and led his widowed daughter to the house of Tigellinus in a riotous procession.", "6475": "Tigellinus made her a present of five-and-twenty thousand drachmas, and bade 1 is chief concubine take off the necklace which she wore, which was said to be worth fifteen thousand drach­ mas, and put it round his daughter's neck.", "6476": "XVIII.", "6477": "A fter these outrages Galba received no credit even when he acted mildly, as for instance, when he granted a remission of tribute and the Roman franchise to the Gauls who bad risen in rebellion under Vindex, for it was believed that they had not received these privileges from the kindness of the emperor, but had bought them from Vinius.", "6478": "Thus the people began to dislike the emperor most cordially, but the praetorian guard, who had not received their looked-for donative, still cherished a hope that Galba would give them at least as much money as they had been wont to receive from Nero, if not as much as they had been promised by Nymphidius.", "6479": "When Galba heard of their discontent, he made that remark, so worthy of a great commander, that \" he was wont to enlist his soldiers, not to buy them,\" and this caused the soldiers to hate him bitterly, for they thought that, besides depriving them of what was their due, he was trying to regulate the conduct of future emperors towards them.", "6480": "Yet disaffection at Rome had not hitherto assumed any dis­ tinct form, for the awe inspired by the presence of Galba acted as a kind of check upon revolutionary schemes, and men concealed the dislike with which they regarded him because they did not see any distinct opportunity of effecting a change in the government.", "6481": "But the troops in Germany who had served under Virginius, and who were now commanded by Flaccus,* were elated with pride at the victory which they had won over Vindex, and as they were given nothing, became quite unmanageable by their officers.", "6482": "They paid no attention whatever to Flaccus, who, indeed, besides being quite helpless from his violent attacks of gout, was entirely without military experience.", "6483": "Once when the army was assembled at a public spectacle, and the tribunes and officers offered prayers, as is usual among the Romans, for the prosperity of the emperor Galba, the soldiers broke into loud murmurs of dissent, and then, as their chiefs continued the prayers, shouted aa a response, \" If he be worthy.\"XIX.", "6484": "Very similar reports to these reached Galba con­ cerning the conduct of the legions under the command of Tigellinus.*", "6485": "The emperor, fearing that it was not only his age, but his want of children which brought him into contempt, now determined to adopt some noble youth as his son, and make him heir to the throne.", "6486": "There was one Marcus Otho, a man of illustrious family, and steeped from childhood in luxury and pleasure beyond most Romans of his time.", "6487": "As Homer calls Alexander the “ spouse of fair-haired Helen,\" celebrating him for the beauty of his wife, in default of any noble qualities of his own, so Otho was notorious at Rome in consequence of his marriage with Poppæa, with whom Nero fell in love when she was the wife of Crispinus, and, as he had still some feelings of respect for his own wife, and feared his mother, made use of Otho to obtain her for him.", "6488": "Otho's extravagance made him a friend and companion of Nero, who was amused at being reproached by Otho for mean­ ness and parsimony.", "6489": "It is said that once Nero scented himself with a very costly perfume, and sprinkled a little of it over Otho.", "6490": "On the next day Otho entertained Nero, when suddenly a number of gold and silver pipes squirted out the same perfume over them both as abun­ dantly as if it were water.", "6491": "Otho seduced Poppæa for Nero, and prevailed upon her by holding out hopes of an intrigue with Nero to divorce her husband and marry him.", "6492": "After she became his wife, he did not like to share her favours, but showed great jealousy, at which it is said Poppæa was not offended, for she used sometimes to exclude Nero even when Otho was absent, either because she feared to surfeit him with her society, or according to some writers, because she did not wish to marry the emperor, though she was willing enough to have him for her lover.", "6493": "Otho ran a great risk of losing his life ;", "6494": "and it is strange that Nero, who put to death his own wife and sister for Poppæa's sake, should have spared Otho.XX.", "6495": "But Seneca was Otho's friend, and he persuaded Nero to appoint Otho to the command of the province of Further Lusitania.", "6496": "Otho gained the love and respect of his subjects, although he well knew that his appointment was merely intended as an honourable exile.", "6497": "When Galba revolted, Otho was the first to join him, brought all his silver and gold plate for Galba to coin into money, and presented him with slaves who knew how to wait upon an emperor.", "6498": "In everything he proved his fidelity to Galba, while he showed a rare capacity for business, and on the march to Rome he travelled for days together in the same chariot with Galba.", "6499": "During this journey, while he was so familiar with the emperor, he paid special court to Vinius, both by conversing with him and by giving him presents, and he firmly established his right to the second place in the emperor's favour by always yield­ ing the first to Vinius.", "6500": "He was more successful than Vinius in avoiding unpopularity, for he assisted all petitioners to obtain their demands without taking bribes from them, and showed himself easy of access and affable to all.", "6501": "He took special interest in the common soldiers, and obtained promotion for many of them, sometimes by applying directly to the emperor, at others by means of Vinius, or of the freedmen, Icelus and Asiaticus,* who were the most powerful personages of the court.", "6502": "When­ ever Otho entertained Galba, he always presented each soldier of the guard in attendance on the emperor with a gold piece, and thus corrupted the army and won their affections for himself while he appeared to be doing honour to Galba.", "6503": "XXI.", "6504": "Now, when Galba was deliberating about the choice of a successor, Vinius suggested Otho to him.", "6505": "Vinius did not do Otho even this service gratis, but because he hoped to have him for a son-in-law, for they had made a compact that Vinius's daughter should marry Otho if he were adopted by Galba and declared his successor on the throne.", "6506": "But Galba always preferred the good of the state to his own private advantage, and always looked, not to what was most pleasant for himself, but to what was best for Rome.", "6507": "It seems probable that he would never have chosen Otho even to be heir to his own estate, for he knew well his licentiousness and extrava­ gance and his debts, which amounted to fifty millions.-", "6508": "Wherefore Galba, after having graciously and in silence listened to Vinius, postponed his decision :", "6509": "only he appointed himself consul, and Vinius his colleague, and it was supposed that he would name his successor at the beginning of the new year.", "6510": "The soldiers eagerly hoped that this successor would be Otho.XXII.", "6511": "While Galba was deliberating and hesitating, the German army broke out into open rebellion.", "6512": "All the soldiers alike hated Galba for not having given them their promised donative, and the troops in Germany regarded it as a special insult to themselves, that Virgin­ ius Rufus had been so discourteously deprived of his command, that those Gauls who had fought against them under Vindex had been rewarded, while those who had not joined him were punished, and that Galba should show such gratitude to Vindex and pay him such honour after his death, as though it was Vindex who had made him emperor of the Romans.", "6513": "This kind of language was being openly held in the camp when on the first day of the new year,t which the Romans call the Calends of January, Flaccus assembled the army to renew the customary oath of fidelity to the emperor.", "6514": "The soldiers overthrew and tore down the images of Galba, swore fealty to the Senate and people of Rome, and then dispersed.", "6515": "After this outbreak the officers began to fear anarchy among the soldiers as much as rebellion :", "6516": "and one of them spoke as follows:", "6517": "\" What will become of uas, fellow-soldiers, if we neither remain faithful to our present emperor nor yet create another, as though we had not merely thrown off our allegiance to Galb .", "6518": "but refused to obey any master whatever ?", "6519": "As for Hordeonius Flaccus we must pass him over, for he is merely a feeble shadow of Galba ;", "6520": "but within one day's march of us there is Vitellius, the chief of the army of Lower Germany, whose father was censor and thrice consul, and who can point to the poverty for which some reproach him as a shining proof of honesty and greatness of soul.", "6521": "Come, let us choose this man, and show that we know better than the Iberians or Lusitanians how to elect an emperor.\"", "6522": "While some approved, and some rejected this advice, a standard-bearer stole quietly away and brought the news of it to Vitellius, who was entertaining a large company at supper.", "6523": "Soon the matter became noised abroad throughout the army, and on the following day Fabius Valens, who commanded one legion,* rode over to Vitellius's quarters† with a number of horsemen and saluted him emperor.", "6524": "It is said that on the previous days he had refused the purple, and had shrunk from the burden of empire, but that now, excited by food and wine which he had taken at midday, he came forward and willingly heard himself addressed as Germanicus, though he declined the title of Caesar.", "6525": "The troops under Flaccus now at once forgot their patriotic oaths of fidelity to the Senate, and swore to obey the emperor Vitellius.", "6526": "XXIII.", "6527": "Thus was Vitellius proclaimed emperor in Germany.", "6528": "Galba, when he heard of the rising there, no longer postponed the choice of his successor.", "6529": "He knew that some of his friends desired the election of Otho, and some that of Dolabella;", "6530": "but as he himself approved of neither candidate, he suddenly without any warning sent for Piso, the son of Crassus and Scribonia, who perished under Nero, a young man remarkable for his virtues, and especially for the modesty and austerity of his life.", "6531": "Galba now at once took this youth to the camp of the praetorian guard to declare him Cæsar and heir to the empire, though aa he left the palace he was at once met by evil omens, and when he began to address the soldiers and to read aloud a prepared speech it thundered and lightened so often, and such rain and darkness overshadowed the camp and the city, that it was impossible to doubt that Heaven did not approve of the adoption of Piso, and that no good would come of it.", "6532": "The soldiers were sulky and scowling, as not even on this occasion was any largesse given to them.", "6533": "Piso himself was admired by all who saw him, for as far as they could judge from his voice and manner he was not bewildered by his good fortune, although he was not insensible of it, while Otho's countenance bore manifest tokens of the bitterness of his disappointment, as he thought that Galba's refusal to appoint him after hav­ ing chosen him and all but raised him to the throne was a clear proof of the emperor's dislike and hatred for him.", "6534": "Otho was not without fears for the future, and went away full of hatred for Piso, blaming Galba, and angry with Vinius.", "6535": "The prophets and Chaldæans whom he kept about his person would not permit him to give up his hopes, and especially one Ptolemæus,* who laid great stress upon a prophecy which he had often repeated to him, that Nero would not kill him, but would perish before him, and that he should rule over the Romans;", "6536": "for having proved the one part of his prophecy to be true, this man bade him not despair of the other part also coming to pass, while he was much encouraged by those who came to offer their sympathy, and treated him as an ill-used man:", "6537": "for many of the partizans of Nymphidius and Tigellinus, who had once been in positions of honour, and now had been dis­ missed and were in poverty, attached themselves to him and urged him to revolt.", "6538": "XXIV.", "6539": "Among these were Veturius and Barbius, one of whom was an adjutant, and the other an orderly of the corps of guides t as the Romans call the scouts and messengers of their armies.", "6540": "Together with them a freed­ man of Otho's, named Onomastus, went about from man to man, and by bribes and promises induced them to stand by Otho, which they were willing enough to do, as they were thoroughly disloyal to Galba and only wanted an excuse to desert him.", "6541": "Indeed, a loyal army could not have been corrupted in four days, which was all the interval that elapsed between the adoption of Piso by Galba, and the murder of them both :", "6542": "for they perished on the sixth­ day after, which the Romans call the sixteenth before the Calends of February.", "6543": "Early in the morning of that day Galba was offering sacrifice in the palace, accompanied by many of his friends.", "6544": "The aruspex, Umbricius, as soon as he took the entrails of the victim into his hands and looked at them, said distinctly that they portended great disturb­ ances, and danger to the emperor from a plot at head­ quarters.", "6545": "Thus was Otho all but delivered up to justice by the hand of God :", "6546": "for he stood close behind Galba and heard what Umbricius said as he pointed to the entrails.", "6547": "He was much alarmed, and turned all manner of colours through fear, when his freedman Onomastus came up to him and said that the architect was waiting for him at his house.", "6548": "This was the preconcerted signal of the time when Otho was to meet the soldiers.", "6549": "He, therefore, explaining that he had just bought an old house, and wished to point out its defects to those who had sold it, went away through what is called the house of Tiberius into the Forum, where stands a gilded columnt at which all the public roads in Italy terminate.", "6550": "XXV.", "6551": "Here they say that he was met and saluted as emperor by the first of the conspirators, who were not more than three and twenty in number.", "6552": "Though the luxury and effeminacy in which he lived had not affected his courage, for he was a most daring man, yet now his heart failed him.", "6553": "The others, however, would not let him draw back, but drew their swords and, standing round his litter, ‡ ordered it to proceed, while Otho frequently urged the bearers to go faster, and often muttered to himself, \" I am a lost man;", "6554": "\" for several persons had heard what had passed, and looked on more in wonder than alarm, because of the small number of the conspirators.", "6555": "While he was being thus carried through the Forum, about as many more men joined him, and then others came up by twos and threes.", "6556": "At length they all faced around, and saluted him as Cæsar, brandishing their naked swords, The tribune Martialis, who was on guard at the camp of the prætorians, is said not to have been in the plot, but to have been terrified and bewildered at Otho's sudden appearance, and let him pass in.", "6557": "When he was once within the camp, no one opposed him;", "6558": "for those who did not know what was being done found themselves enclosed in small parties of two or three together by the conspirators, and being thus cut off from one another, followed the party of Otho at first through fear, and soon, when the matter was explained to them, of their own free will.", "6559": "News of the rising was brought to Galba at the palace while the aruspex still held the victim in his hands, so that even those who generally refused to believe in the omens drawn from sacrifices were astonished at the evident, interposition of Heaven.", "6560": "As a crowd of all kinds of persons now ran up from the Forum, Vinius and Laco and a few of the emperor's freedmen stood round him with drawn swords while Piso went forward and addressed the soldiers who were on guard at the palace, and Marius Celsus, a brave man, was sent to assure himself of the fidelity of a corps of Illyrians who were quartered in the Portico of Agrippa.", "6561": "XXVI.", "6562": "Galba wished to go forth, but Vinius dissuaded him, while Celsus and Laco urged him to do so, and abused Vinius roundly.", "6563": "At this time a persistent rumour arose that Otho had been murdered in the camp of the prætorians;", "6564": "and presently one Julius Atticus, one of the chiefs of the emperor'is guards, came up with his sword drawn, shouting that he had slain the enemy of Cæsar.", "6565": "Pushing his way through the bystanders, he showed Galba his sword, which was covered with blood.", "6566": "Galba looked at him, and said, \" Who ordered you to kill him? \"", "6567": "As, however, the man spoke of his loyalty, and the oath of fealty which he had sworn, and as the crowd shouted that he had done well, and clapped their hands, Galba got into his litter with the intention of sacrificing to Jupiter and showing himself to his subjects.", "6568": "Just as he entered the Forum, like a change of wind there came a rumour that Otho was at the head of the soldiers.", "6569": "And now, while in that vast crowd some called to Galba to turn back, and some to go on, some bade him be of good courage and others warned him to beware, and the litter was frequently shaken and swayed to and fro as if it were on a stormy sea, there suddenly appeared a body of horsemen, and then some foot-soldiers, who came through the basilica of Paulus, and loudly shouted to the people to take “that citizen\" away.", "6570": "The populace took to their heels, but did not run away in fear, but posted them­ selves on the tops of the porticoes and on the highest parts of the Forum as though they were spectators at a public show.", "6571": "The civil war was begun by Attilius Vergilio,* who tore down the image of Galba which he carried on his staff, and dashed it upon the ground.", "6572": "Many now hurled their javelins at the litter;", "6573": "and, missing their aim at Galba with these, they drew their swords and rushed upon him.", "6574": "No one remained with him or defended him except one man, the only one of all that vast multitude whom the sun beheld that day acting worthilyof the Roman Empire.", "6575": "This was a centurion named Sempronius Densus, who had never received any especial favour from Galba, but who, prompted merely by his own honour and fidelity, stood firm in front of his litter.", "6576": "Raising the vine stick, which is carried by centurions to correct their men, he shouted aloud and ordered the men who rushed towards him to spare the emperor.", "6577": "After this, as they tried to push past him, he drew his sword and defended the emperor fur a long time, until he was brought to the ground by a blow under the knee,XX VII.", "6578": "Galba's litter was overset near the place called the Lake of Curtius.", "6579": "As he fell to the ground, wearing a corslet,† many ran upon him and stabbed him.", "6580": "He, offering his throat to them, said “ Strike, if this be best for Rome.\"", "6581": "He received many cuts in the legs and arms, but the mortal blow in the throat was given, according to the most common account, by one Camurius, a soldier of the fifteenth legion.", "6582": "Some writers say that his murderer's name was Terentius, some Lecanius, and some Fabius Fabulus, who is said to have cut off his head and carried it away wrapped in his toga, for being bald, it was difficult to hold with the hands.", "6583": "Afterwards, as those who were with him would not allow him to carry it so, but wished him to display his feat of arms, he stuck it on a spear, and ran along like a Bacchanal, brandishing aloft the aged head of one who had been a virtuous emperor, a pontiff, and a consul, often turning himself about and shaking the spear, down which the blood still ran.", "6584": "When the head of Galba was brought to Otho, he said, \" This is nothing, my comrades;", "6585": "show me the head of Piso.\"", "6586": "Before long it was brought to him :", "6587": "for the youth had been wounded and fled, but had been pursued by one Marcus who slew him near the temple of Vesta.", "6588": "Vinius also was killed, though he admitted that he had been a party to the conspiracy against Galba ;", "6589": "for he cried out that \"", "6590": "Otho did not mean

written petitions which they sent to the emperor, all of whom afterwards Vitellius caused to be searched for and put to death.", "6595": "Besides these men, Marius Celsus came to the camp.", "6596": "Many at once accused him of having incited the soldiers to help Galba, and the mob clamoured for his execution.", "6597": "Otho, however, did not wish to kill him;", "6598": "but as he did not dare to directly oppose the soldiers, he said that he would not put him to death in such a hurry, for there wore several questions which he wished to put to him.", "6599": "On this pretence he ordered him

kind of indignity, and at last threw it into the place which is called the Sessorium, where they execute those who are put to death by the emperor's orders.", "6607": "Galba's body was removed by Helvi­ dius Priscus, with the permission of Otho:", "6608": "and during the night it was buried by one Argius,‡ the emperor'a freedman.", "6609": "XXIX.", "6610": "This was the fate of Galba, who was second to few of the Romans in birth or wealth, being almost the first man of his time in both.", "6611": "He lived through the reigns of five emperors and obtained a great reputation, by which more than by any power at his disposal he drove out Nero:", "6612": "for of the many pretenders of that time some were declared by all to be unfit to reign, and some of their own accord withdrew their pretensions;", "6613": "but Galba was offered the throne and accepted it, so that his mere name caused the rising of Vindex, which had been regarded as a mere revolt, to be called a civil war, because an emperor took part in it.", "6614": "As therefore he considered that he had not so much sought for the management of the empire as be had had it pressed upon him, he thought to govern the spoiled children of Nymphidius and Tigellinus after the fashion of Scipio, Fabricius, and Camillus of old.", "6615": "Though his faculties were somewhat impaired by age he proved himself in all military matters a thoroughly capable commander of the old school;", "6616": "but he put himself entirely into the hands of Vinius and Laco, who, just like the greedy crew that had surrounded Nero, sold every­ thing in the state to the highest bidder;", "6617": "so that no one looked back with regret to his reign, though many were grieved at his death.", "6618": "THE young emperor- proceeded at daybreak to the Capitol, and offered sacrifice there.", "6619": "Next, he ordered Marine Celsus to be brought to him, and having embraced him, spoke kindly to him, and invited him to forget the charge which had been made against him rather than to remember his acquittal.", "6620": "Celsus answered with dignity, yet not without appreciation of Otho's kindness, that the crime laid to his charge, being that of fidelity to Galba, to whom he owed nothing, ought of itself to bear witness to his character.", "6621": "By these words both Otho and Celsus were thought to have done themselves equal honour, and were applauded by the soldiers.", "6622": "After this, Otho made a mild and gracious speech to the Senate.", "6623": "He assigned part of the time ap­ pointed for his own consulship to Virginius Rufus, and left in force all the other appointments to consulships which had been made by Nero or Galba.", "6624": "He gratified several persons of advanced age, or eminent in other ways, by appointing them to offices in the priesthood, and restored to those senators who had been banished by Nero, and had returned under Galba, all of their property which had not been sold.", "6625": "In consequence of this, many of the leading men in Rome, who had at first shuddered at Otho's acces­ sion, regarding him as some avenging demon who had suddenly been placed upon the throne, began to look much more hopefully upon a reign by which they them­ selves profited.", "6626": "II.", "6627": "At the same time nothing delighted the common people and reconciled them to Otho so much as his treat­ ment of Tigellinus.", "6628": "This wretch had hitherto escaped notice, for all thoughtful men considered him sufficiently punished already by his fear of the punishment which the people demanded as a debt due to the public, and by the incurable bodily diseases from which he suffered, while they regarded the foul debaucheries which he still even when dying continued to lust after, as a greater misery to him than death itself.", "6629": "Yet many thought it shame that he should still see the light of day, of which he had deprived so many noble spirits.", "6630": "Otho sent a messenger to the country house near Sinuessa, where Tigellinus dwelt, and where several ships were always riding at anchor in case he should wish to flee farther from Rome.", "6631": "Tigellinus at first offered the messenger a vast bribe to allow him to escape;", "6632": "and as the man refused to do so, he gave him the money nevertheless, begged of him to wait until he had shaved, and then, taking up a razor, cut his throat.", "6633": "III.", "6634": "The emperor, though he gratified the people by this well-deserved execution, yet bore no malice against", "6635": "Any one else of his personal enemies.", "6636": "To please the people he at first allowed them to address him at public spectacles as \" Nero \";", "6637": "and he allowed several statues of Nero to be replaced in public.", "6638": "Claudius Rufus states that the diplo­ mas,* or imperial despatches, which were sent to Spain by the hands of public couriers, were inscribed with the name of Nero as well as with that of Otho.", "6639": "However, as he perceived that this practice gave offence to the first and most powerful citizens, he put a stop to it.", "6640": "The soldiers of the praetorian guard were extremely dissatisfied with the moderate manner in which Otho began his reign, and they warned him to be on his guard, and cut off all disaffected persons, either out of a genuine anxiety for his safety, or merely as a pretext for causing disturbances and civil wars.", "6641": "One day Otho sent Crispinus to Ostia to bring back the seventeenth manipulus ‡ from thence.", "6642": "As Crispinus, while it was still dark, began to make prepara­ tions for the journey, and loaded waggons with the men's arms, some of the most daring soldiers openly declared that he had come with disloyal intentions, that the Senate meditated a coup d'etat, and that the arms were meant to be used against Otho, not for him.", "6643": "As many took up this idea and became much excited, some seized on the waggons, others killed Crispinus and their own two centurions who tried to oppose them, and all, in confusion, calling upon one another to come to the rescue of Cæsar, marched to Rome.", "6644": "Hearing that Otho was entertaining eighty of the senators at dinner, they rushed to the palace, exclaiming that now was the time to put to death all the enemies of Cæsar at one stroke.", "6645": "The city was panic-stricken, ex­ pecting at once to be pillaged by the troops;", "6646": "the palace was filled with confusion and alarm, and Otho himself terribly perplexed as to what to do;", "6647": "for while he feared for the safety of his guests, some of whom had brought their wives to the banquet, they mistrusted him, and he saw them watching his every movement in silent terror.", "6648": "He therefore ordered the prefects of the guard to go and pacify the soldiers, while at the same time he dismissed his guests by another door.", "6649": "They were scarcely gone when the soldiers burst tumultuously into the dining-hall, asking what had become of the enemies of Cæsar.", "6650": "Otbo now mounted on a couch and addressed them;", "6651": "and by entreaties, and even by tears, at last prevailed upon them to retire.", "6652": "On the following day, having presented every soldier with twelve hundred and fifty drachmas, he entered the camp, where he praised * their zeal on his behalf, and begged them to join him in punishing a few whose in­ trigues had made both his clemency and their own steady loyalty to be questioned.", "6653": "As all approved, and bade him do so, he, after selecting for punishment two men whose fate no one could regret, left the camp.", "6654": "IV.", "6655": "Some of the soldiers believed that Otho's character was really changed, and admired him for his conduct;", "6656": "while others bethought that he was only courting popularity perforce, because of the war which was impending.", "6657": "It was indeed reported that Vitellius had already assumed the imperial title and authority;", "6658": "and couriers were con.", "6659": "stantly arriving with the news of some fresh accession to his forces, though other messengers came who stated that the troops in Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Mœsia had, with their officers, declared for Otho.", "6660": "Soon also friendly letters reached him from Mucianus and Vespasianus, the former of whom was at the head of a great army in Syria, and the latter in Judæa.", "6661": "Encouraged by these, Otho wrote to Vitellius, bidding him act like a loyal soldier, and pro­ mising that he would bestow on him a great sum of money and a city in which he might dwell in the utmost peace and happiness.", "6662": "Vitellius replied at first with dissimula­ tion, but soon they became irritated, and overwhelmed one another with abuse, which each well deserved, though it was ridiculous for either of them to reproach the other with vices which were common to them both.*", "6663": "Indeed it was hard to say which of them was the more profligate or the more effeminate, which had the least experience of war, or which had been plunged the more deeply in debt by his former poverty.", "6664": "At this time many prodigies t and omens were reported, many of which were vague and could not be traced to any trustworthy source, though all men saw the reins fall from the hands of the figure of Victory in the capitol, who is represented driving a chariot, as though she were no longer able to hold them;", "6665": "and the statue of Caius ‡ Cæsar, which stands upon the island in the Tiber, without any wind or earthquake, was turned round, so as to face east instead of west.", "6666": "This is said to have taken place about the time when Vespasianus openly pretended to the throne.", "6667": "Many also regarded the flooding of the Tiber as an evil omen;", "6668": "for though it was the season of the year at which rivers usually are full of water, yet it never rose so high or did so much damage before;", "6669": "for it laid a great part of the city under water, especially in the corn­ market, and caused great scarcity of provisions for several days.", "6670": "V.", "6671": "About this time news was brought to Rome that Cæcina and Valens, acting as the lieutenants of Vitellius, had seized the parses of the Alps.", "6672": "The prætorians also conceived suspicions of the loyalty of Dolabella,§ a man of patrician family.", "6673": "Whether Otho feared him or some one else is uncertain:", "6674": "however, he assured him of his friendship, and sent him to reside at the city of Aquinum.", "6675": "Otho now selected the officers who were to company him on his campaign.", "6676": "Amongst these was Lucius, the brother of Vitellius, whom he neither promoted nor removed from the rank in the army which he held.", "6677": "He also took especial care of the mother and wife of Vitellius, that they might not have any fear for their own safety.", "6678": "He entrusted the government of Rome to Flavius Sabinus, either because he wished to show his respect for Nero (for Sabinus had been appointed to this post by Nero, and had been deprived of it by Galba), or because by the promotion of Sabinus he declared his good will and confidence in Vespasianus.", "6679": "He himself remained at Brixellum, a city of Italy situated upon the river Padus, and sent on his forces under the command of Marius Celsus, Suetonius Paullinus, and of Gallus and Spurinna, who were all gene­ rals of renown, but who, on account of the want of disci­ pline of their troops, were unable to conduct the campaign according to the plans which they had arranged.", "6680": "Indeed the soldiers of the guard refused to obey any authority except that of the emperor himself, for he alone, they declared, had the right to command them.", "6681": "Nor were the enemy's troops altogether obedient and well-behaved, but the same causes rendered them also swaggering and un­ trustworthy.", "6682": "Yet they possessed experience of actual war, and were accustomed to fatigue;", "6683": "whereas Otho's troops were weak from their life of unwarlike leisure, for they spent most of their time in the theatres and at public shows, or else in their quarters, and affected such a degree of insolence that they refused to perform the necessary labours of a campaign, alleging that to do so was beneath their dignity, not that it was beyond their strength.", "6684": "Spurinna, when he endeavoured to force them to do their duty, came within a very little of losing his life.", "6685": "The soldiers insulted him grossly, and set no bounds to their language, calling him a traitor to Cæsar and the ruin of his cause.", "6686": "Some of them actually got drunk and went to Spurinna's tent at night to demand money for a journey;", "6687": "for they said they must go and impeach him before Cæsar.", "6688": "VI.", "6689": "However, the cause of Otho, and Spurinna with it, received some advantage from the abusive language which these same soldiers met with at Placentia.", "6690": "Here the Vitellians who were besieging the city ridiculed Otho's men whom they saw on the battlements, calling them stay-at­ home soldiers, sword-dancers, and spectators of games, declaring that they had never seen or tasted of real war, but were full of pride at having cut off the head of an unarmed old man, meaning Galba, though they dared not come out and fight like men.", "6691": "The soldiers were so furiously exasperated by these reproaches that they eagerly besought Spurinna to employ them in whatever service he pleased, assuring him that they would not shrink from any toils or dangers.", "6692": "When the enemy furiously assaulted the walls, and brought up many battering engines,.", "6693": "Spurinna's men won the victory, drove back their oppo­ nents with great slaughter, and saved from ruin one of the most famous and prosperous cities of Italy.", "6694": "The generals of Otho were found both by cities and by individuals to be much less offensive to deal with than those of Vitellius.", "6695": "Among the latter was Cæcina, a man who neither spoke nor dressed like a citizen of Rome, but was harsh and overbearing, of great stature, wearing the Gaulish trousers and sleeves, and using signs t even when addressing Roman magistrates.", "6696": "He was accompanied by his wife ‡ who rode with him in a showy dress, escorted by a picked body of cavalry.", "6697": "The other general, Fabius Valens,§ was so avaricious that neither the plunder which he took from the enemy, nor yet the thefts which he committed or the bribes which he received from the allied states could satiate him ;", "6698": "and he was even suspected of having been too late for the first battle of the war because he delayed his march to amass wealth for himself.", "6699": "Others blame Cæcina, because in his haste to win a victory before Valens came up, he, besides other blunders of less consequence, began a battle so unseasonably and conducted it so remissly that he very nearly brought the cause of Vitellius to ruin.", "6700": "VII.", "6701": "After Ceecina's repulse at Placentia he proceeded to Cremona, another large and flourishing city.", "6702": "Mean­ while Annius Gallus, who was on his way to Placentia to reinforce Spurinna, hearing while on the march that the troops at Placentia had been victorious, but that Cremona was in danger, changed the direction of his march towards that place, and encamped close to the enemy.", "6703": "Here Cæcina concealed many foot-soldiers in rough and wooded ground ordering his cavalry to ride forward and, if they fell in with the enemy, to retire little by little so as to draw them into the ambuscade.", "6704": "This plan was betrayed to Celsus by deserters.", "6705": "Celsus attacked them with the best of his cavalry, pursued them with caution, taking care to avoid the ambuscade, and then surrounded the troops in ambush, and threw them into confusion.", "6706": "He now sent for his infantry from the camp:", "6707": "and it was thought that if they had come up promptly after the cavalry, the whole army of Cæcina might have been destroyed;", "6708": "but as it was, Paullinus brought them up slowly and too late, and tarnished his glory as a general by overcaution.", "6709": "The mass of the soldiers charged him with treason, and tried to exasperate Otho against him by boasting that they had won the victory, but that their success was not followed up owing to the cowardice of their generals.", "6710": "Otho, though he did not believe their accusations, yet feared to be thought to disbelieve them.", "6711": "He accordingly sent his brother Titianus to the army, and with him Julius Proculus, the prefect of the prætorians, who virtually had the supreme command, though Titianus was the nominal chief, while Celsus and Paullinus were given the titles of counsellors and friends, but were not allowed the least real power or authority.", "6712": "The enemy also showed want of discipline, especially in the army of Valens.", "6713": "These men, when they heard of the ambuscade and the defeat to which it had led, were greatly enraged at not having been there in time to prevent so great a slaughter of their friends.", "6714": "Valens * was forced to beg for his life;", "6715": "for the soldiers were preparing to stone him.", "6716": "He pacified them with difficulty, and led them to join the forces of Cæcina.", "6717": "VIII.", "6718": "When Otho arrived at the camp at Bedriacum, t which is a village near Cremona, he held a council of war.", "6719": "Proculus and Titianus were of opinon that, as the troops were full of confidence and flushed with victory, it would be best to fight a decisive battle at once, and not blunt their spirit by delay, which would also bring Vitellius down upon them from Gaul.", "6720": "On the other hand Paullinus argued that the enemy had already collected their entire available force, whereas Otho might expect another army as large as his present one to join him from Mcesia and Pannonia, if he would only wait until it suited him to fight, and not play into the hands of the enemy by engaging prematurely.", "6721": "The troops, he said, after being so largely reinforced, would be no less confident than at present, when they are but few ;", "6722": "indeed, they would fight with a great superiority of numbers.", "6723": "Besides this, delay would be all in their favour, as they had abundance of supplies, while the opponents, who were in an enemy's country, would soon be reduced to great straits by the want of pro­ visions.", "6724": "Marius Celsus agreed with the views of Paullinus.", "6725": "Annius Callus was not present at the council, having been disabled by a fall from his horse:", "6726": "but when Otho wrote a letter to him, asking his opinion, he advised the emperor not to be hasty, but to await the arrival of the legions which were already on their way from Moesia.", "6727": "However Otho was not convinced by these arguments, but agreed with those who urged him to fight at once.", "6728": "IX.", "6729": "Many other reasons for this decision are given by various writers, and it is evident that the prætorians, or bodyguard of the emperor, who now for the first time had experience of actual warfare, were eager to return to their old haunts at Rome, and the unwarlike pleasures of the theatre and the circus, and that their eagerness for battle could not be restrained, as they imagined that they would overthrow their antagonists at the first onset.", "6730": "It seems, too, that Otho himself could no longer endure the un­ certainty of his position, for his ignorance of war and his life of enervating luxury had unfitted him for a calm calculation of his chances of success, and, worn out as he was with anxiety, he longed to let the matter be settled whichever way chance might determine, like a man who covers his face through dizziness at looking over a precipice.", "6731": "This is the account which is given by the orator Secundus, who acted as private secretary to Otho.", "6732": "Other * authorities relate that many efforts were made by the soldiers of both armies to combine, and agree to elect an emperor from among their own officers:", "6733": "or, if this proved impossible, to place the election in the hands of the senate.", "6734": "It seems indeed rightly probable, considering the ill-repute of both claimants of the throne, that the more sedate and thought­ ful of the soldiers should have reflected that it would be a horrible and shameful thing that the Romans should be made to suffer for a second time all the miseries which they had once endured in the civil wars of Bulla and of Marius and of Caesar and Pompeius, merely in order to pro­ vide an empire to bear the charges of the gluttony and drunkenness of Vitellius, or of the luxury and profligacy of Otho.", "6735": "It is suspected that Marius Celsus, knowing that this feeling was gaining ground, endeavoured to gain time, hoping that the whole matter might be decided with­ out fighting;", "6736": "and that Otho, fearing this, hurried on an engagement.", "6737": "X.", "6738": "After the council Otho again retired to Brixellum.", "6739": "This was a mistake, not only because the army would have fought with greater zeal and discipline when under the eye of the emperor, but because by taking away the best and most loyal troops, both of cavalry and infantry, to act as his bodyguard, he made his army like a spear which has lost its steel point.", "6740": "At this time a battle took place on the bank of the Padua, across which Cæcina en­ deavoured to throw a bridge, while the Othonians tried to prevent him from doing so.", "6741": "As they did not succeed\" in this, they threw lighted sulphur and pitch into the boats which formed the bridge, and a wind suddenly springing up carried the fire across the stream towards the enemy.", "6742": "At first volumes of smoke, and then a mass of flames burst out, so that the enemy were thrown into confusion and forced to leap from the bridge into the river, upsetting the boats and exposing themselves to the missiles and the ridicule of the enemy.", "6743": "However, the Germans were victorious in a fight with Otho's corps of gladiators for the possession of an island in the river, and slew many of them.", "6744": "XL", "6745": "As, after this, the soldiers in Otho's camp at Bed­ riacum were frantically eager for battle, Proculus led them forward about six miles from that place and en­ camped in such an ignorant and ridiculous fashion that the men suffered from want of water, although it was spring time, and all the surrounding country was full of springs and perennial streams.", "6746": "On the next day he wished to lead them at least twelve miles nearer the enemy, but Suetonius Paullinus would not allow him to do so, think­ ing that the soldiers ought to have some rest, and not first be fatigued with a long march, and then while they were confusedly mixed up with baggage animals and campfollowers, be brought to fight against an enemy who could quietly and deliberately place themselves in order of battle.", "6747": "While the generals were at variance, one of the horsemen called Numidians rode up bearing a letter from Otho, in which he ordered them not to waste any time, but to march against the enemy at once.", "6748": "On receiving this they started.", "6749": "Cæcina, hearing of their march, was much disquieted, abandoned his operations by the river, and proceeded to the camp.", "6750": "Here after Valens had got the men under arms, and had given them the watchword, he sent forward the best of the cavalry while the legions were taking up their respective posi­ tions in the line of battle.", "6751": "XII.", "6752": "For some reason or other the men of Otho's vanguard conceived an idea that the generals of Vitellius intended to desert to their side :", "6753": "and so, when they came near to one another, they saluted the Vitellians and ad­ dressed them as friends and comrades.", "6754": "As the Vitellians made an angry and fierce response, the Othonians were discouraged, while their opponents imagined that they in­ tended to desert.", "6755": "This incident at the first onset caused some confusion among the troops of Otho:", "6756": "and, besides this, everything was in disorder, for the baggage train was entangled among the ranks, and the line was broken in many places by the ditches and trenches with which the ground was intersected, so that the soldiers, in trying to avoid these obstacles, were forced to attack in detail, and in disorganised crowds.", "6757": "Two.", "6758": "legions alone, that named “ Rapax \" on the side of Vitellius, and “ Adjutrix\" on that of Otho, were able to find a level plain, upon which they deployed into a regular line of battle and fought front to front for a long time.", "6759": "Otho's soldiers were active and brave, but had never been in action before, while those of Vitellius had fought many battles, but were somewhat elderly and past their prime.", "6760": "At the first charge the Othonians drove them back, and captured their eagle, killing almost every man in the front rank ;", "6761": "but the Vitellians, filled with shame and rage, charged in their turn, slew Orfidius, the legate in command of the legion, and took many standards.", "6762": "The corps of gladiators, who were supposed to possess both courage and practice in close combat, were attacked by Alphenus Varus with the Batavians, who inhabit an island formed by the river Rhine, and who are the best horsemen in Germany.", "6763": "Few of the gladiators stood to receive their charge, but most of them fled towards the river, where they fell in with other bodies of the enemy, by whom they were en­ tirely cut to pieces.", "6764": "The worst fight of all was made by the Prætorians, who did not even wait until the enemy reached them, but by their panic flight struck terror even into the unbroken troops through whose ranks they fled.", "6765": "Yet many of Otho's troops, after having conquered their immediate opponents, forced their way back through their victorious enemies to their own camp.", "6766": "XIII.", "6767": "Of the generals, neither Proculus nor Paullinus dared to return with their men, but went off another way, fearing the soldiers, who already began to throw the blame of their defeat upon the generals.", "6768": "Annius Gallus assumed the command of the soldiers as they assembled in the town of Bedriacum, and encouraged them by assurances that the battle had been a drawn one, and that in many cases they had beaten the enemy.", "6769": "Marius Celsus called a meet­ ing of the generals, and bade them take measures for the common good.", "6770": "He said that after so great a disaster and so much slaughter of their countrymen not even Otho him­ self, if he were a right-thinking man, would wish to make any further trial of fortune ;", "6771": "since even Cato and Scipio, although they fought in defence of the liberty of Rome, were blamed for having wasted the lives of many brave men in Africa, by not yielding to Cæsar immediately after the battle of Pharsalia.", "6772": "All men, he urged, are equally liable to the caprices of fortune;", "6773": "but they have the advan­ tage, even when defeated, of being able to form wise resolu­ tions.", "6774": "By this reasoning Celsus convinced the generals:", "6775": "and when, on trying the temper of the soldiers, they found them desirous of peace, and Titianus himself bade them begin negotiations for agreement, Celsus and Gallus determined to go and discuss the matter with Cæcina and Valens.", "6776": "On their way they were met by some centurions, who informed them that Vitellius's army was already advancing, and that they had been sent on before by their generals to arrange terms of peace.", "6777": "Celsus spoke with approval of their mission, and bade them return and conduct him to Cæcina.", "6778": "It happened that when they drew near the army, Celsus was like to have lost his life:", "6779": "for the cavalry who formed the advance guard were the same who had been de­ feated in the ambuscade, and when they saw Celsus ap­ proaching, they set up a shout of rage and rode towards him.", "6780": "However the centurions stood before Celsus and kept them back;", "6781": "and as the other officers called to them to spare him Cæcina perceived that some disturbance was taking place and rode up.", "6782": "He quickly repressed the disorderly move­ ment of the cavalry, greeted Celsus affectionately, and proceeded with him to Bedriacum.", "6783": "Meanwhile Titianus had repented of having sent the embassy.", "6784": "He manned the walls of the camp with those soldiers who had recovered their spirits, and was encouraging the rest to fight.", "6785": "How­ ever, when Cæcina rode up and held out his hand no one resisted him, but some of the soldiers greeted his troops from the walls, and others opened the gates, came out and mingled with the new-comers.", "6786": "No violence was done to any one, but they all fraternised and shook each other by the hand, swore fealty to Vitellius and joined his army.", "6787": "XIV.", "6788": "The above is the account which most eye-witnesses give of the battle, though they themselves admit that they do not know all the details of it because of the confusion which prevailed and the irregularity of the ground.", "6789": "Some time afterwards when I was journeying across the battle­ field, Mestrius Florus, a man of consular rank, who had fought under Otho not from choice but from necessity, showed me an ancient temple, and related that after the battle he came there and saw so huge a pile of corpses, that those on the top were level with the pinnacles of the roof.", "6790": "He said that he could not discover himself or learn from any one else the cause of this heap ;", "6791": "for though a greater slaughter of the vanquished is made in civil wars than in any others, because no quarter is given, as no use can be made of prisoners, yet it was hard to imagine how such a mass of carcasses came to be piled together on that spot.", "6792": "XV.", "6793": "Otho, as is usual in such cases, first heard only confused rumours of how the battle went.", "6794": "When how­ ever wounded men came from the scene of action bringing the news of the defeat, not only his friends, as might be expected, bade him keep up his spirits and not despair, but his soldiers were wonderfully affected.", "6795": "None of them left him, or deserted to the enemy, and no one consulted his own safety when his chief despaired of his.", "6796": "All of them alike repaired to his quarters, and called him their emperor.", "6797": "When he came out to them, they fell at his feet and caught hold of his hands with shouts, and prayers, and tears, beseeching him not to desert them, or betray them to the enemy, but to make use of them to fight for him, body and soul, until their last breath.", "6798": "While all besought him thus, one of the common soldiers drew his sword, and crying, “ Cæsar, this is what we are all prepared to do for you,\" stabbed himself.", "6799": "Otho, unmoved by any of these entreaties, gazed round upon them all with a calm and composed countenance, and said:", "6800": "\" My comrades, your noble conduct and your loyal devotion make this a

of the latter in Parthia, I must beg of my readers to believe that in writing upon a subject which has been described by Thucydides with inimitable grace, clearness, and pathos, I have no ambition to imitate Timæus, who, when writing his history, hoped to surpass Thucydides himself in eloquence, and to show that Philistius was but an ignorant bungler, and so plunges into an account of the speeches and battles of his heroes, proving himself not merely one \"", "7": "Who toils on foot afar Behind the Lydian car,\" as Pindar has it, but altogether unfit for the office of historian, and, in the words of Diphilus, \"Dull-witted, with Sicilian fat for brains.\" lie often seeks to shelter himself behind the opinions of Xenarchus, as when he tells us that the Athenians thought it a bad omen that the general whose name was Victory refused to command the expedition to Sicily;", "8": "and when he says that by the mutilation of the Hermæ the gods signified that the Athenians would suffer their chief disasters at the hands of Hermokratcs the son of Hermon;", "9": "or, again, when he observes that Herakles might be expected to take the side of the Syracusans because of Proserpine, the daughter of Demeter, who gave him tho dog Kerberus, and to be angry with the Athenians because they protected the people of Egesta, who were descended from the Trojans, whereas he had been wronged by Laomedon, king of Troy, and had destroyed that city.", "10": "Timæus was probably led to write, this sort of nonsense by the same critical literary spirit which led him to correct the style of Philistius, and to find fault with that of Aristotle and Plato.", "11": "Mv own opinion is that to pay too much attention to mere style and to endeavour to surpass that of other writers, is both trifling and pedantic, while any attempt to reproduce that of the unapproachable masterpieces of antiquity springs from a want of power to appreciate their real value.", "12": "With regard, then, to the actions of Nikias described by Thucydides and Philistius, more especially those which illustrate his true character, having been performed under the stress of terrible disasters, I shall briefly re­ capitulate them, lest I be thought a careless biographer, adding to them whatever scattered notices I have been able to collect from the writings of other historians and from public documents and inscriptions;", "13": "and of these latter I shall quote only those which enable us to judge what manner of man he was.", "14": "II.", "15": "The first thing to be noted in describing Nikias is the saying of Aristotle, that there had been in Athens three citizens of great ability and patriotism, namely, Nikias, the son of Nikeratus, Thucydides, the son of Melesias, and Theramenes, the son of Hagnon;", "16": "though the latter was not equal to the two former, but was re­ proached with being a foreigner from the island of Keos;", "17": "and, also, because he was not a stable politician but always inclined to change sides, he was nicknamed Kothornos, which means a large boot which will fit either leg.", "18": "Of these three statesmen the eldest was Thucydides, who was the leader of the conservative opposition to Perikles;", "19": "while Nikias, who was a younger man, rose to a certain eminence during the life of Perikles, as he acted as his colleague in the command of a military force, and also filled the office of archon.", "20": "On the death of Perikles, Nikias at once became the foremost man in Athens, chiefly by the favour of the rich and noble, who wished to make use of him to check the plebeian insolence of Kleon ;", "21": "yet Nikias had the good-will of the common people, and they were eager to further his interests.", "22": "Kleon, indeed, became very powerful by caressing the people and giving them opportunities for earning money from the State, but in spite of this, many of the lower classes whose favour he especially strove to obtain, became disgusted with his greed and insolence, and preferred to attach themselves to Nikias.", "23": "Indeed, there was nothing harsh or overbearing in the pride of Nikias, which arose chiefly from his fear of being thought to be currying favour with the people.", "24": "By nature he was downhearted and prone to despair, but in war these qualities were concealed by his invariable success in whatever enterprise he undertook;", "25": "while in political life his retiring manner and his dread of the vulgar demagogues, by whom he was easily put out of countenance, added to his popularity;", "26": "for the people fear those who treat them with haughtiness, and favour those who respect and fear them.", "27": "The reason of this is that the greatest honour which the populace can receive from a great man is not to be treated with contempt by him.", "28": "III.", "29": "Perikles, indeed, used to govern Athens by sheer force of character and eloquence, and required no tricks of manner or plausible speeches to gain him credit with the populace;", "30": "but Nikias had no natural gifts of this sort, and owed his position merely to his wealth.", "31": "As ho could not vie with Kleon in the versatile and humorous power of speech by which the latter swayed the Athenian masses, he endeavoured to gain the favour of the people by supplying choruses for the public dramatic performances and instituting athletic sports on a scale of lavish expen­ diture which never before had been equalled by any citizen.", "32": "The statue of Pallas, erected by him in the Acropolis, is standing at this day, although it has lost the gold with which it was formerly adorned, and also the building which supports the choragic tripods in the temple of Dionysus, for he often gained a victory when choragus, and never was vanquished.", "33": "It is said that once during the performance of a play at his expense, a slave of his appeared upon the stage habited as Dionysus;", "34": "a tall and handsome youth, And still beard­ less.", "35": "The Athenians were charmed with his appearance, and applauded for a long time, at the end of which Nikias rose and said that he did not think it right that one whoso body was thus consecrated to a god should be a slave;", "36": "and consequently he gave him his freedom.", "37": "Tradition also tells us how magnificently and decorously ho arranged the procession at Delos.", "38": "In former times the choruses sent by the cities of Ionia to sing to the glory of the god used to sail up to the island in a disorderly fashion, and were at once met by a rude mob, who called upon them to sing, so that they disembarked in a hurry, huddling on their garlands and robes with unseemly haste and confusion.", "39": "Nikias disembarked with his chorus upon the little island of Rhenea close by, with all their vestments and holy things, and then during the night bridged the strait -which is very narrow-with a bridge of boats which he had had made at Athens expressly, which was beautifully ornamented with gilding and rich tapestry.", "40": "Next morning at daybreak, he led the procession to the god over this bridge, with his chorus very richly dressed, and singing as they passed over the strait.", "41": "After the sacrifice, the public games, and the banquet, he set up the brazen palm-tree as an offering to the god, and also set apart an estate which he had bought for ten thousand drachmas, as sacred to the god.", "42": "With the revenues of this land the people of Delos were to offer sacrifice and to provide themselves with a feast, and were to pray the gods to bestow blessings on Nikias.", "43": "All these injunctions to the people of Delos were inscribed upon a pillar which which he left there to guard his bequest.", "44": "The palm-tree was afterwards overturned by a high wind, and in its fall destroyed the great statue which had been set up by the people of Naxos.", "45": "IV.", "46": "These acts of Nikias may have been prompted by ambition and desire for display, but when viewed in con­ nection with his superstitious character they seem moro probably to have been the outcome of his devotional feelings;", "47": "for we are told by Thucydides that he was one who stood greatly in awe of the gods, and was wholly devoted to religion.", "48": "In one of the dialogues of Pasiphon, we read that he offered sacrifice daily, and that he kept a soothsayer in his house, whom he pretended to consult upon affairs of state, but really sought his allvice about his own private concerns, especially about his silver mines.", "49": "He had extensive mines at Laurium, the working of which afforded him very largo profits, but yet was attended with great risks.", "50": "He maintained a largo body of slaves at the works;", "51": "and most of his property consisted of tho silver produced by them.", "52": "For this reason lie was surrounded by hangers-on, and persons who endeavoured to obtain a share of his wealth, and lie gave money to all alike, both to those who might do him harm, and to those who really deserved his liberality, for he gave to bad men through fear, and to good men through good nature.", "53": "Wo may find proof of this in the writings of the comic poets.", "54": "Telekleides, speaking of some informer, says:", "55": "\"Charikles a mina gave him, fearing he might say Charikies himself was born in a suspicious way;", "56": "And Nikias five minas gave.", "57": "Now, what his reasons were I know full well, but will not tell, for he's a trusty fere.\"", "58": "Eupolis, too, in his comedy of Marikas has a scene where an informer meets with a poor man who is no politician, and says:", "59": "\"A. Sny where you last with Nikias did meet.", "60": "D. Never.", "61": "Save once I saw him in the street.", "62": "A. He owns ho saw him.", "63": "Wherefore should he say lie saw him, if he meant not to betray His crimes?", "64": "C. My friends, you all perceive the fact, That Nikias is taken in the act.", "65": "D. Think you, 0 fools, that such a man as he In any wicked act would taken be.\"", "66": "Just so docs Kleon threaten him in Aristophanes's play:", "67": "\"The orators I'll silence, and make Nikias afraid.\"", "68": "Phrynichus, too, sneers at his cowardice and fear of the popular demagogues, when he says :", "69": "..", "70": "An honest citizen indeed he was, And not a coward like to Nikias.\"V. Nikias feared so much to give the mob orators grounds for accusation against him, that he dared not so much as dine with his fellow citizens, and pass his time in their society.", "71": "Nor did he have any leisure at all for such amusements, but when general, he used to spend the whole day in the War Office, and when the Senate met he would be the first to come to the house and the last to leave it.", "72": "When there was no public business to be trans­ acted, he was hard to meet with, as he shut himself up in his house and seldom stirred abroad.", "73": "His friends used to tell those who came to his door that they must pardon him for not receiving them, as he was not at leisure, being engaged on public business of great importance.", "74": "One Hieron, whom he had brought up in his house and educated, assisted him greatly in throwing this air of mystery and haughty exclusiveness over his life.", "75": "This man gave out that he was the son of Dionysius, called Chalkus, whose poems are still extant, and who was the leader of the expedition to Italy to found the city of Thurii.", "76": "Hieron used to keep Nikias suppled with prophetic responses from the soothsayers, and gave oat to the Athe - nians that Nikias was toiling night and day on their behalf, saying that when he was in his bath or at his dinner ho was constantly being interrupted by some important public business or other, so that, said he, \" His night's rest is broken by his labours, and his private affairs are neglected through his devotion to those of the public.", "77": "He has injured his health, and besides losing his fortune, has been deserted by many of his friends on account of his not being able to entertain them and make himself agreeable to them;", "78": "while other men find in politics a means of ob­ taining both friends and fortune, at the expense of the state.\"", "79": "In very truth the life of Nikias was such that he might well apply to himself the words of Agamemnon :", "80": "\"In outward show and stately pomp all others I exceed, And yet the people's underling I am in very deed.\"", "81": "VI.", "82": "Perceiving that the Athenian people were willing enough to make use of the talents of men of ability, and yet ever viewed them with suspicion and checked them when in full career, as we may learn from their condem­ nation of Perikles, their banishment of Damon by ostra­ cism, and their mistrust of Antiphon the Rhamnusian, and especially in their treatment of Paches the conqueror of Lesbos, who while his conduct as general was being enquired into, stabbed himself in the open court—per­ ceiving this, Nikias always avoided, as far as he could, taking the command in any important military expedition.", "83": "Whenever he was employed as general, he acted with extreme caution, and was usually successful.", "84": "He was careful to attribute his success, not to any skill or courage of his own, but to fortune, being willing to lessen his glory to avoid the ill-will of mankind.", "85": "His good fortune was indeed shown in many remarkable instances:", "86": "for example, he never was present at any of the great defeats sustained by the Athenians at that time, as in Thrace they were defeated by the Greeks of Chalkidike, but on that occasion Kalliades and Xenophon were acting as generals, while the defeat in iEtolia took place when Demosthenes was in command, and at Delium, where a thousand men were slain, they were led by Hippokrates.", "87": "For the pestilence Perikles was chiefly blamed, because he shut up the country people in the city, where the change of habits and unusual diet produced disease among them.", "88": "In all these disasters Nikias alone escaped censure:", "89": "while he achieved several military successes, such as the capture of Kythera, an island conveniently situated off the coast of Laconia, and inhabited by settlers from that country.", "90": "He also captured several of the re­ volted cities in Thrace, and induced others to return to their allegiance.", "91": "He shut up the people of Megara in their city, and thereby at once made himself master of the island of Minoa, by means of which he shortly after­ wards captured the port of Nisæa, while he also landed his troops in the Corinthian territory, and beat a Corin­ thian army which marched against him, killing many of them, and amongst others Lykophron their general.", "92": "On this occasion he accidentally neglected to bury the corpses of two of his own men who had fallen.", "93": "As soon as he discovered this omission, he at once halted his army, and sent a herald to the enemy to demand the bodies for burial, notwithstanding that by Greek custom the party which after a battle demand a truce for the burial of the dead, are understood thereby to admit that they have been defeated, and it is not thought right for them to erect a trophy in commemoration of their victory;", "94": "for the victors remain in possession of the field of battle, and of the bodies of the dead, and the vanquished ask for their dead because they are not able to come and take them, Nevertheless, Nikias thought it right to forego all the credit of his victory rather than leave two of his countrymen unburied.", "95": "He also laid waste the seaboard of Laconia, defeated a Lacedæmonian force which opposed him, and took Thyrea, which was garrisoned by Æginetans, whom he brought prisoners to Athens.", "96": "VII.", "97": "Now when Demosthenes threw up a fortification at Pylos, and after the Peloponnesians had attacked him by sea and by land, some four hundred Spartans were left on the island of Sphakteria, the Athenians thought that it was a matter of great importance, as indeed it was, to take them prisoners.", "98": "Yet, as it proved laborious and difficult to blockade them on the island, because the place was desert and waterless, so that provisions had to be brought from a great distance by sea, which was trouble­ some enough in summer, and would be quite impossible in winter, they began to be weary of the enterprise, and were sorry that they had rejected the proposals for peace which had shortly before been made by the Lacedæmo­ nians.", "99": "These proposals were rejected chiefly because Kleon opposed them.", "100": "Kleon's opposition was due to his personal dislike to Nikias;", "101": "and when he saw him enthu­ siastically exerting himself on behalf of the Lacedæ­ monians, he at once took the other side, and persuaded the people to reject the proffered peace.", "102": "Now as the blockade dragged on for a long time, and the Athenians learned to what straits their army was reduced, they became angry with Kleon.", "103": "He threw the blame upon Nikias, asserting that it was through his remissness and want of enterprise that the Spartans still held out, and declaring that, were he himself in chief command they would soon be captured.", "104": "Upon this the Athenians turned round upon him and said, \" Why, then, do not you yourself proceed thither and capture them ?", "105": "\"", "106": "Nikias at once offered to transfer his command to Kleon, and bade him take what troops he thought necessary, and, instead of swaggering at home where there was no danger, go and perform some notable service to the state.", "107": "At first Kleon was confused by this unexpected turn of tho debate, and declined the command ;", "108": "but as tho Athenians insisted upon it, and Nikias urged him to do so, he plucked up spirit, accepted the offico of general, and even went so far as to pledge himself within twenty days either to kill the Spartans on the island or to bring them prisoners to Athens.", "109": "The Athenians were more inclined to laugh at this boast than to believe it;", "110": "for they were well acquainted with the vainglorious character of tho man, and had often amused themselves at his expense.", "111": "It is said that once the public assembly met early and sat for a long time waiting for Kleon, who came at last very late with a garland on his head, and begged them to put off their debate till the next day.", "112": "\" To-day,\" said lie, \"I am not at leisure, as I have just offered a sacrifice, and am about to entertain some strangers at dinner.\"", "113": "The Athenians laughed at his assurance, and broke up the assembly.", "114": "VIII.", "115": "However, on this occasion, by good fortune and good generalship, with the help of Demosthenes, lie brought home prisoners all those Spartans who had not fallen in the battle, within the time which he had ap­ pointed.", "116": "This was a great reproach to Nikias.", "117": "It seemed worse even than losing his shield in battle that he should through sheer cowardice and fear of failure give up his office of general, and give his personal enemy such an opportunity of exalting himself at his expense, depriving himself voluntarily of his honourable charge.", "118": "Aristo­ phanes sneers at him in his play of tlio ' Birds,' where he says:", "119": "\"We must not now, like Nikias, delay, And see the time for action pass away.", "120": "\"And again in tho play of the 'Farmers,' where thii dialogue occurs:", "121": "\" A. I want to till my farm.", "122": "B. And wherefore not A.", "123": "'Tis you Athenians will not Jet me go;", "124": "A thousand drachmas I would give, to be From office in the state for ever free.", "125": "B. Your offer we accept.", "126": "The state will have Two thousand, with what Nikias just gave.", "127": "\"Moreover, Nikias did Athens much harm by permitting Kleon to attain to such a height of power and reputation, which gave him such exaggerated confidence in himself that lie grew quite unmanageable, and caused many terrible disasters, by which Nikias suffered as much as any man.", "128": "Kleon also was the first to break through the decorum observed by former public speakers, by shout­ ing, throwing back his cloak, slapping his thigh, and walking up and down while speaking, which led to the total disregard of decency and good manners among public speakers, and eventually was the ruin of the state.", "129": "IX.", "130": "About this time Alkibiades began to gain credit in Athens as a public speaker, less licentious than Kleon, and like the soil of Egypt described by Homer, which bears ..", "131": "A mingled crop of good and bad alike..", "132": "Thus Alkibiades, with immense powers both for good and evil, produced great changes in the affairs of Athens.", "133": "Nikias, even if he had been freed from the opposition of Kleon, could not now have quietly consolidated the power of the state, for as soon as he had arranged matters in a fair way to produce peace and quiet, Alkibiades, to satisfy his own furious ambition, threw them again into confusion and war.", "134": "This was brought about by the following cir­ cumstances.", "135": "The two chief hindrances to peace were Kleon and Brasidas ;", "136": "as war concealed the baseness of the former, and added to the glory of the latter.", "137": "Kleon was able to commit many crimes undetected, and Brasidas performed many great exploits while the war lasted;", "138": "wherefore, when both of these men fell before the walls of Amphipolis, Nikias, perceiving that the Spartans had long been desirous of peace, and that the Athenians no longer hoped to gain anything by continuing the war, and that both parties were weary of it, began to consider how he might reconcile them, and also pacify all the other states of Greece, so as to establish peace upon a durable and prosperous basis.", "139": "At Athens, the richer classes, the older men, and the country farmers all wished for peace.", "140": "By constantly arguing with the others he gradually made them less eager for war.", "141": "and at length was able to intimate to the Spartans that there were good hopes of coming to terms.", "142": "They willingly believed him because of his high character for probity, and more especially because he had shown great kindness to the Spartan prisoners taken at Pylos.", "143": "A truce for one year had already been arranged between them, and during this they conversed freely with one another, and, enjoying a life of leisure and freedom from the restraints and alarms of war, began to long for an unbroken period of peace, and to sing:", "144": "\"My spear the spider's home shall be,\" remembering with pleasure the proverb that in time of peace men are awakened, not by trumpets, but by crow­ ing cocks.", "145": "They railed at those who said that it was fated that the war should last thrice nine years, and, having thus accustomed themselves to discuss the whole question, they proceeded to make peace, and thought that now they were indeed free from all their troubles.", "146": "The name of Nikias was now in every man's mouth, and ho was called the favourite of heaven, and the man chosen by the gods for his piety to confer the greatest of blessings upon the Greeks.", "147": "For they regarded the peace as the work of Nikias, just as the war had been the work of Perikles.", "148": "The latter, they thought, for no adequate reasons, had involved the Greeks in the greatest miseries, while the former had relieved them of their troubles by persuading them to become friends.", "149": "For this reason this peace is to this day called the peace of Nikias.X.", "150": "The terms of the peace were that each party should restore the cities and territory which it had taken, and that it should be determined by lot which side should restore its conquests first.", "151": "We are told by Theophrastus that Nikias, by means of bribery, arranged that the lot should fall upon the Lacedæmonians to make restitution first.", "152": "When, however, the Corinthians and Boeotians, dissatisfied with the whole transaction, seemed 1 ikely by their complaints and menaces to rekindle the war, Nikias indiced Athens and Sparta to confirm the peace by enter­ ing upon an alliance, which enabled them to deal with the malcontents with more authority, and give them more confidence in one another.", "153": "All these transactions greatly displeased Alkibiades, who was naturally disinclined to peace, and who hated the Lacodæmionians because they paid their court to Nikias and disregarded him.", "154": "For this reason, Alkibiades from the very outset opposed the peace, but ineffectually at first.", "155": "When, however, ho observed that the Lacedæ­ monians were no longer regarded with favour by the Athenians, and were thought to have wronged them by forming an alliance with the Bœotians, and not restoring to Athens up the cities of Panaktus and Amphipolis, lie seized the opportunity of exciting the people by exag­ gerated accounts of the misdeeds of the Lacedæmonians.", "156": "Moreover ho prevailed upon the people of Argos to send ambassadors to Athens to conclude an alliance.", "157": "As, how­ ever, at the same time ambassadors, with full powers to settle all matters in dispute, came from Lacedæmon, and in a preliminary conference with the Senate were thought to have made very reasonable and just proposals, Alki­ biades, fearing that they might create an equally favour­ able impression when they spoke before the popular assembly, deceived them by solemnly declaring with an oath that he would assist them in every way that lie could, provided that they would deny that they came with full powers to decide, saying that by this means alone they would effect their purpose.", "158": "The ambassadors were deceived by his protestations, and, forsaking Nikias, relied entirely upon him.", "159": "Upon this Alkibiades brought them into the public assembly, and there asked them if they came with full powers to treat.", "160": "When they said that they did not, ho unexpectedly turned round upon them, and calling both the Senate and the people to witness their words, urged them to pay no attention to men who were such evident liars, and who said one thing in one assembly and the opposite in another.", "161": "The ambassadors, as Alkibiades expected, were thunderstruck, and Nikias could say nothing on their behalf.", "162": "The people at once called for the ambassadors from Argos to be brought before them, in order to contract an alliance with that city, but an earthquake which was felt at this moment greatly served Nikias's purposo by causing the assembly to break up.", "163": "With great difficulty, when the debate was resumed on the following day, he prevailed upon the people to break off the negotiations with A,- gos, and to send him as ambassador to Sparta, promising that lie would bring matters to a prosperous issue.", "164": "Accordingly he proceeded to Sparta, where ho was treated with great respect as a man of eminence and a friend of tlio Lacedæ­ monians, but could effect nothing because of the prepon­ derance of the party which inclined to the Bœotian alliance.", "165": "lIe was therefore forced to return ingloriously, in great fear of the anger of the Athenians, who had been persuaded by him to deliver up so many and such impor­ tant prisoners to the Lacedæmonians without receiving any equivalent.", "166": "For tho prisoners taken at Pylos were men of the first families in Sparta, and related to the most powerful statesmen there.", "167": "The Athenians, however, did not show their dissatisfaction with Nikias by any harsh measures, but they elected Alkibiades general, and they entered into a treaty of alliance with the Argives.", "168": "and also with the states of Elis and Mantinea, which had revolted from the Lacedæmonians, while they sent out privateers to Pylos to plunder the Lacedæmonian coasts in the neighbourhood of that fortress.", "169": "These measures soon produced a renewal of the war.", "170": "XI.", "171": "As the quarrel between Nikias and Alkibiades had now reached such a pitch, it was decided that the remedy of ostracism must be applied to them.", "172": "By this from time to time the people of Athens were wont to banish for ten years any citizen whoso renown or wealth rendered him dangerous to the state.", "173": "Great excitement was caused by this measure, as one or the other must be utterly ruined by its application.", "174": "The Athenians were disgusted by the licentiousness of Alkibiades, and feared his reckless daring, as has been explained at greater length in his Life, while Nikias was disliked because of his great wealth and his reserved and unpopular mode of life.", "175": "Moreover he had frequently offended the people by acting in direct opposition to their wishes, forcing them in spite of them­ selves to do what was best for them.", "176": "On the one side were arrayed the young mç,,:", "177": "\" r, and those who wished for war, and on the other the older men and the party of peace, who would be sure to vote respectively, one for the banishment of Nikias, the other for that of Alkibiades.", "178": "Now \"", "179": "In revolutions bad men rise to fame, and it appears that the violence of these factions at Athens gave an opportunity for the lowest and basest citizens to gain reputation.", "180": "Amongst these was one Hyperbolus, of the township of Peirithois, a man of no ability or power, but who owed his elevation to sheer audacity, and whose influence was felt to be a disgrace to Athens.", "181": "This man, who never dreamed that ostracism would be applied to him, as the pillory would have been more suitable to his deserts, openly showed his delight at the discord between Nikias and Alkibiades, and excited the people to deal severely with them, because he hoped that if one of them were to be banished, he might succeed to his place, and become a match for the one who was left behind.", "182": "But the parties which supported Nikias and Alkibiades respectively made a secret compact with one another to suppress this villain, and so arranged matters that neither of their leaders, but Hyperbolus himself was banished by ostracism for ten years.", "183": "This transaction delighted and amused the people for the moment, but they were afterwards grieved that they had abused this safeguard of their constitution by applying it to an unworthy object, as there was a kind of dignity about the punishment which they had inflicted.", "184": "Ostracism in the case of men like Thucydides and Aristeides, was a punishment, but when applied to men like Hyperbolus, it became an honour and mark of distinction, as though his crimes had put him on a par with the leading spirits of the age.", "185": "Plato, the comic poet, wrote of him :", "186": "\"Full worthy to be punished though he be, Yet ostracism's not for such as he.", "187": "\"The result was that no one was ever again ostracised at Athens, but Hyperbolus was the last, as Hipparchus of Cholargus, who was some relation to the despot of that name, was the first.", "188": "Thus the ways of fortune are in­ ecrutable, and beyond our finding out.", "189": "If Nikias had aade, gone the trial of ostracism with Alkibiades, ho would either have driven him into banishment, and governed Athens well and wisely during his absence, or he would himself have left the city, and avoided the terrible disaster which ended his life, and would have continued to enjoy the reputation of being an excellent general.", "190": "I am well aware that Theophrastus says that Hyperbolus was ostracised in consequence of a quarrel of Alkibiades with Phæax and not with Nikias;", "191": "but my account agrees with that given by the best historians.", "192": "XII.", "193": "When ambassadors came to Athens from Egesta and Leontini, inviting the Athenians to commence a campaign in Sicily, Nikias opposed the project, but was overruled by Alkibiades and the war party.", "194": "Before the assembly met to discuss the matter, men's heads were com­ pletely turned with vague hopes of conquest, so that the youths in the gymnasia, and the older men in their places of business or of recreation, did nothing but sketch tho outline of the island of Sicily and of the adjacent seas and continents.", "195": "They regarded Sicily not so much as a prize to be won, but as a stepping-stone to greater con­ quests, meaning from it to attack Carthage, and make themselves masters of the Mediterranean sea as far as the Columns of Herakles.", "196": "Public opinion being thus biassed, Nikias could find few to help him in opposing the scheme.", "197": "The rich feared lest they should be thought to wish to avoid the burden of fitting out ships and the other expen­ sive duties which they would be called upon to fulfil, and disappointed him by remaining silent.", "198": "Yet Nikias did not relax his exertions, but even after the Athenian people had given their vote for the war, and had elected him to the chief command, with Alkibiades and Lamachus for his colleagues—even then, on the next meeting of the assembly, he made a solemn appeal to them to desist, and at last accused Alkibiades of involving tho city in a terrible war in a remote country merely to serve his own ambition and rapacity.", "199": "However, he gained nothing by this speech, for the Athenians thought that he would be the best man to command the expedition because of his experience in war, and that his caution would servo as a salutary check upon the rashness of Alkibiades and the easy temper of Lamachus;", "200": "so that, instead of dissuading them his words rather confirmed them in their intention.", "201": "For Demostratus, who of all the popular orators was the most eager promoter of the expedition, rose, and said that he would put an end to these excuses of Nikias :", "202": "and he prevailed upon the people to pass a decree that the generals, both at home and in the field, should be invested with absolute irresponsible power.", "203": "XIII.", "204": "Yet it is said that the expedition met with great opposition from the priests;", "205": "but Alkibiades found certain soothsayers devoted to his own interests, and quoted an ancient oracle which foretold that the Athenians should one day win great glory in Sicily.", "206": "Special messengers also came from the shrine of A minon,* bringing an oracular response to the effect that the Athenians would take all the Syracusans.", "207": "Those oracles which mado against the project, people dared not mention, for fear of saying words of ill-omen.", "208": "Yet even the most obvious portents would not turn them from their purpose, such as the mutilation of all the Hermæ, or statues of Hermes, in Athens, in a single night, except only one, which is called the Hermes of Andokides, which was erected by the tribe Ægeis, and stands before the house in which Andokides lived at that time.", "209": "A man likewise leaped upon the altar of the Twelve Gods, sat astride upon it, and in that posture mutilated himself with a sharp stone.", "210": "At Delphi too there is a golden statue of Pallas Athene standing upon a brazen palm tree, an offering made by the city of Athens from the spoils taken in the Persian war.", "211": "This was for many days pecked at by crows, who at last pecked off and cast upon the ground the golden fruit of the palm tree.", "212": "This was said to be merely a fable invented by the people of Delphi, who were bribed by the Syracusans.", "213": "Another oracle bade the Athenians bring to Athens the priestess of Athena at Klazomenae,and accordingly they sent for her.", "214": "Her name happened to be Hesychia, signifying Repose;", "215": "and this is probably what the oracle meant that the Athenians had better remain quiet.", "216": "The astronomer, Meton, who was appointed to some office in the army, either because of these adverse omens and prophecies, or because he was convinced that the expedition would mis­ carry, pretended to be mad and to set fire to his house.", "217": "Some historians relate that he did not feign madness, but that he burned down his house one night, and next morning appeared in the market-place in a miserable plight, and besought his countrymen that, in considera­ tion of the misfortune which had befallen him, they would allow his son, who was about to sail for Sicily in command of a trireme, to remain at home.", "218": "We are told that Sokrates the philosopher was warned by one of the signs from heaven which he so often received that the expedition would be the ruin of the city.", "219": "And many were filled with consternation at the time fixed for the departure of the armament.", "220": "It was during the celebration of the Adonia.", "221": "or mourning for the death of Adonis, and in all parts of the city were to be seen images of Adonis carried along with funeral rites, and women beating their breasts, so that those who were superstitious enough to notice such matters became alarmed for the fate of the armament, and foretold that it would start forth gloriously, but would wither untimely away.", "222": "XIV.", "223": "The conduct of Nikias in opposing the war when it was being deliberated upon, and his steadfastness of mind in not being dazzled by the hopes which were enter­ tained of its success, or by the splendid position which it offered himself, deserves the utmost praise;", "224": "but when, in spite of his exertions, he could not persuade the people to desist from the war, or to remove him from the office of general, into which he was as it were driven by main force, his excessive caution and slowness became very much out of place.", "225": "His childish regrets, his looking back towards Athens, and his unreasonable delays disheartened his colleagues, and spoiled the effect of the expedition, which ought at once to have proceeded to act with vigour, and put its fortune to the test.", "226": "But although Lamachus begged him to sail at once to Syracuse and fight a battle as near as possible to the city walls, while Alkibiades urged him to detach the other Sicilian states from their alliance with Syracuse, and then attack that place, ho dispirited his men by refusing to adopt either plan, and proposed to sail quietly along the coast, displaying the fleet and army to the Sicilians, and then, after affording some slight assistance to the people of Egesta, to return home to Athens.", "227": "Shortly after this, the Athenians sent for Alkibiades to return home for his trial on a charge of treason, and Nikias, who was nominally Lamachus's col­ league, but really absolute, proceeded to waste time in idle negotiations and languid manoeuvres, until his troops had quite lost the high spirits and hopes with which they had arrived at Sicily;", "228": "while the enemy, who were at first terrified, began to recover their spirits, and despise the Athenians.", "229": "While Alkibiades was still with them they had sailed to Syracuse with sixty ships, and while the rest remained in line of battle outside, ten of these had entered the harbour to reconnoitre.", "230": "These ships, approaching the city, made a proclamation by a herald that they were come to restore the people of Leontini to their city, and they also captured a Syracusan vessel, in which they found tables on which were written the names of all the inhabi­ tants of Syracuse, according to their tribes and houses.", "231": "These tables were kept far away from the city, in the temple of the Olympian Zeus, but at that time the Syra­ cusans had sent for them in order to discover the number of men able to bear arms.", "232": "These tables were now taken by the Athenians, and carried to their general.", "233": "When the soothsayers saw this roll of names, they were much alarmed, fearing that this was the fulfilment of the pro­ phecy that the Athenians should capture all the Syra­ cusan 8.", "234": "However, some declare that the prophecy was really fulfilled when the Athenian Kallippus slew Dion, and captured Syracuse.XV.", "235": "Shortly after this, Alkibiades left Sicily, and the supreme command devolved upon Nikias.", "236": "For Lamachus, though a bravo and honest man, and one who always freely risked his life in battle, was but a plain simple man, and was so excessively poor, that whenever he was appointed general he was forced to ask the Athenians to advance him a small sum of money to provide him with clothes and shoes.", "237": "Now Nikias was excessively haughty, both on account of his great wealth, and his military renown.", "238": "It is said that once when the generals were debating some question together, Nikias bade Sophokles the pcet give his opinion first, because he was the oldest man present, to which Sophokles answered, “I am the oldest, but you are the chief.\"", "239": "Thus when in Sicily he domineered over Lamachus, although the latter was a far abler soldier, and by sailing about the coast at the point furthest removed from the enemy, gave them confi­ dence, which was turned into contempt, when he was repulsed from Hybla, a little fort in the interior.", "240": "At last he returned to Katana, without having effected anything, except the reduction of Hykkara, a town of the aborigines, not of the Greeks, from which it is said the celebrated courtezan Lais, then a very young girl, was carried away captive and sent to Peloponnesus.", "241": "XVI.", "242": "As the summer advanced, and Nikias remained inactive, the Syracusans gained so much confidence that they called upon their generals to lead them to the attack of the Athenian position at Katana, since the Athenians did not dare approach Syracuse;", "243": "while Syracusan horse­ men even went so far as to insult the Athenians in their camp, riding up to ask if they were come to settle as, peaceful citizens in Katana, instead of restoring the Leontines.", "244": "This unexpected humiliation at length forced Nikias to proceed to Syracuse, and he devised a stratagem by which he was able to approach that city and pitch his camp before it unmolested.", "245": "He despatched to Syracuse a citizen of Katana, who informed the Syracusans that if they desired to seize the camp and arms of the Athenians, they would only have to appoint a day and to march in force to Katana.", "246": "Many of the Athenians, he said, spent all their time within the walls of Katana, and it would be easy for the Syracusan party there to close the gates, assail the Athenians within, and set fire to their ships.", "247": "A numerous body of Kataneans, he added, were eager to co-operate in the plan now proposed.", "248": "This was by far the ablest piece of strategy accomplished by Nikias during all the time that he remained in Sicily.", "249": "The Syracusans were induced to march out their entire force, leaving their city with scarcely any defenders.", "250": "Meanwhile, Nikias sailed round from Katana, took posses­ sion of the harbour, and encamped his forces on the main­ land in a position where he could not be attacked by the enemy's cavalry.", "251": "Wheu the Syracusan army returned from Katana, he marched out the Athenians and defeated them, but with little loss on their side, as their cavalry covered their retreat.", "252": "Nikias now broke down the bridges over the river Anapus, which gave occasion to Hermokrates to say, when he was making a speech to encourage the Syracusans, that it was a ridiculous thing for Nikias to try to avoid fighting, as though it were not for the express purpose of fighting that he had been sent thither.", "253": "But in spite of all that Hermokrates could say, the Syracusans were very much cast down and disheartened.", "254": "Instead of the fifteen generals who usually commanded their troops they chose three, upon whom they conferred absolute powers, and swore a solemn oath that they would leave them unfettered in the exorcise of those powers.", "255": "The Athenians were very anxious to occupy the temple of Olympian Zeus, which was near their camp, and full of offerings of gold and silver.", "256": "Nikias, however, purposely delayed the attack until a force was sent from Syracuse to defend the temple.", "257": "He thought that if the soldiers did succeed in plundering it, the state would be none the better for it, and he himself would have to bear all the blame of sacrilege.", "258": "Nikias made no use of his boasted victory, and after a short time drew off his forces to Naxos, where he passed the winter, expending an enormous sum of money for the maintenance of so largo a force, and effecting little or nothing except the reduction of a few disorderly tribes in the interior.", "259": "The Syracusans now took heart again, marched into the Katancan territory and laid it waste, and attempted to burn the camp of the Athenians.", "260": "Upon this all men blamed Nikias for deliberating and taking precautions until the time for action was gone by.", "261": "No one could find any fault with him when he was actually fighting;", "262": "but though a bold and energetic man in action, he was slow to form plans and begin an enterprise.", "263": "XVII.", "264": "Thus when he did at length return to Syracuse, he managed the operation so swiftly and so skilfully that he disembarked his troops at Thapsus before the enemy were aware of his approach, took Epipolæ by surprise, took prisoners three hundred of the force of picked men who endeavoured to recapture that fort, and routed the Syracusan cavalry, which had hitherto been supposed to be invincible.", "265": "Moreover, what chiefly terrified the Sicilians, and seemed wonderful to all Greeks, was the speed with which he built a wall round Syracuse, a city quite as large as Athens itself, but one which is much more difficult to invest completely, because of the sea being so near to it, and the rough ground and marshes by which it is surrounded on the land side.", "266": "Yet he all but succeeded in accomplishing this feat, although he was not in a con­ dition of body to superintend such works personally, for he suffered greatly from a disease of the kidneys, to which we must attribute whatever was left undone by his army.", "267": "For my own part I feel great admiration for the diligence and skill of the general, and for the bravery of the soldiers, which enabled them to gain such successes.", "268": "The poet Euripides, after their defeat and utter overthrow wrote this elegy upon them:", "269": "“ Eight times they boat the Syracusan host, Before the gods themselves declared them lost.", "270": "”Indeed, they beat the Syracusans far more than eight times, before the gods turned against the Athenians and dashed them to the ground when at the height of their pride.", "271": "XVIII.", "272": "Nikias was present, in spite of his sufferings, at most of these actions ;", "273": "but when his disease grew worse, ho was forced to stay in the camp with a small guard, while Lamachus took the command of the army, and fought a battle with the Syracusans, who were endeavouring to build a counter-wall which would obstruct the Athenians in building their wall of circumvallation.", "274": "The Athenians were victorious, but followed up their success in such a disorderly manner that Lamachus was left alone and ex­ posed to the attacks of the Syracusan cavalry.", "275": "He at once challenged their leader, a brave man named Kallimachus, to single combat, and both received and inflicted a mortal wound.", "276": "His dead body and arms fell into the hands of the Syracusans, who at once charged up to the Athenian walls, where Nikias lay helpless.", "277": "The extremity of the danger roused him, and he ordered his attendants to set fire to a quantity of timber which had been brought thither to construct military engines, and to some of the engines themselves.", "278": "This desperate expedient checked the Syra cusans, and saved N ikias and the Athenians ;", "279": "for the rest of the Syracusan forces on perceiving so great a body of flame returned in haste to their city.", "280": "This affair left Nikias in sole command, and he had great hopes of taking the place;", "281": "for many cities in Sicily had formed alliances with him, ships laden with corn kept arriving to supply his camp, and all began to be eager to be on his side, and to share in the fruits of his success.", "282": "The Syracusans themselves sent to propose terms of peace, for they despaired of being able to defend their city any longer against him.", "283": "At this time Gylippus too, a Lacedæmonian who was sent to assist them, heard during his voyage that they were completely enclosed and reduced to great straits, but held on his voyage notwith­ standing, in order that even if, as he imagined, all Sicily had fallen into the hands of the Athenians, he might at any rate defend the Greek cities in Italy from sharing its fate.", "284": "The air indeed was full!", "285": "of rumours that the Athe­ nians were carrying all before them, and that the good fortune and skill of their general rendered him invincible.", "286": "Even Nikias himself was so elated by his apparent good fortune, that he forgot his wonted prudence, and imagining from the secret intelligence which he had from his friends within Syracuse that it was on the point of surrender, neglected Gylippus altogether, and kept so bad a watch at the straits of Messina with his fleet, that Gylippus managed to cross there and land in Sicily.", "287": "Here he at once proceeded to gather an army together, but in a quarter of the island far away from Syracuse, so that the people of Syracuse knew nothing of his arrival.", "288": "They even appointed a day for the public assembly to meet and discuss terms of surrender with Nikias, and were about to attend it, as they thought that it would be best for them to come 10 terms before the city was quite surrounded by the wall of the Athenians.", "289": "There was now only a very small portion of this left to be finished, and all the materials for building it were collected on the spot.", "290": "XIX.", "291": "At this crisis there arrived at Syracuse Gongylus, a Corinthian, in one trireme.", "292": "All crowded round him.", "293": "to hear what news he brought.", "294": "He informed them that Gylippus would soon come to their aid by land, and that other triremes besides his own were on their way by sea.", "295": "This intelligence was scarcely believed, until it was con­ firmed by a message from Gylippus himself, bidding them march out and meet him.", "296": "They now took courage and prepared for battle.", "297": "Gylippus marched into the town, and at once led the Syracusans out to attack the Athenians.", "298": "When Nikias had likewise brought his army out of their camp, Gylippus halted his men, and sent a herald to offer them an armistice for five days, on condition that they would collect their effects and withdraw from Sicily.", "299": "Nikias disdained to answer this insulting message;", "300": "but some of hissoldiers jeeringly enquired whether the presence of one Spartan cloak and staff had all at once made the Syracusans so strong that they could despise the Athenians, who used to keep three hundred such men, stronger than Gylippus and with longer hair, locked up in prison, and feared them so little that they delivered them up to the Lacedæmonians again.", "301": "Timæus says that the Sicilian Greeks despised Gylippus for his avaricious and con­ temptible character, and that when they first saw him, they ridiculed his long hair and Spartan cloak.", "302": "Afterwards, however, he tells us that as soon as Gylippus appeared they flocked round him as small birds flock round an owl, and were eager to take service under him.", "303": "This indeed is the more probable story ;", "304": "for they rallied round him, regarding his cloak and staff to be the symbols of the authority of Sparta.", "305": "And not only Thucydides, but Philistus, a Syracusan citizen by birth, who was an eyewitness of the whole campaign, tells us that nothing could have been done without Gylippus.", "306": "In the first battle after his arrival, the Athenians were victorious, and slew some few Syra­ cusans, amongst whom was the Corinthian Gongylus, but on the following day Gylippus displayed the qualities of a true general.", "307": "He used the same arms, horses, and ground as before, but he dealt with them so differently that he defeated the Athenians.", "308": "Checking the Syracusans, who wished to chase them back to their camp, he ordered them to use the stones and timber which had been collected by the Athenians, to build a counter-wall, reaching beyond the line of circumvallation, so that the Athenians could no longer hope to surround the city.", "309": "And now the Syracusans, taking fresh courage, began to man their ships of war, and to cut off the stragglers with their cavalry.", "310": "Gylippus personally visited many of the Greek cities in Sicily, all of whom eagerly promised their aid, and furnished him with troops;", "311": "so that Nikias, perceiving that ho was losing ground, relapsed into his former desponding condition, and wrote a despatch to Athens, bidding the people cither send out another armament, or let the one now in Sicily return to Athens, and especially beseeching them to relieve him from his command, for which he was incapacitated by disease.", "312": "XX.", "313": "The Athenians had long before proposed to send out a reinforcement to the army in Sicily, but as all had gone on prosperously, the enemies of Nikias had contrived to put it off.", "314": "Now, however, they were eager to send him assistance.", "315": "It was arranged that Demosthenes should employ himself actively in getting ready a large force, to go to reinforce Nikias in the early spring, while Eurymedon, although it was winter, started immediately with a sup­ ply of money, and with a decree naming Euthydemus and Menander, officers already serving in his army, to be joint commanders along with him.", "316": "Meanwhile, Nikias was suddenly attacked by the Syracusans both by sea and land.", "317": "His ships were at first thrown into confusion, but rallied and s ank many of the enemy, or forced them to run on shlore;", "318": "but on land Gylippus managed at the same time to surprise the fort of Plemmyrium, where there was a magazine of naval stores and war material of all kinds.", "319": "A considerable number of the garrison, also, were either slain or taken prisoners;", "320": "but the most serious result was the stoppage of Nikias's supplies, which heretofore had been easily and quickly brought through the Great Harbour, while it remained in the hands of the Athenians, but which now could not reach his camp by sea without a convoy and a battle..", "321": "Moreover, the Syracusan fleet had not been defeated by any superiority of force of the Athenian, but by the disorder into which it had been thrown by pursuing the enemy.", "322": "They therefore determined to renew the conflict with better success.", "323": "Nikias, on his part, was unwilling to fight a second time, thinking it was folly to fight with a diminished and disheartened force when ho knew that Demosthenes was hurrying to his aid with a large and unbroken armament.", "324": "However, Menander and Euthydemus, the newly-elected generals, were eager to distinguish themselves by per­ forming some brilliant action before the arrival of Demos­ thenes, and to eclipse the fame of Nikias himself.", "325": "The pretext they used was the glory of Athens, which they said would be dishonoured fur ever if they should now appear afraid to accept the Syracusans' ofer of battle.", "326": "The battle was fought :", "327": "and the Athenian left wing, we are told by Thucydides, was utterly defeated by the skil­ ful tactics of the Corinthian steersman Aristion.", "328": "Many Athenians perished, and Nikias was greatly disheartened, for he had now proved unfortunate both when bole com­ mander and when acting with colleagues.", "329": "XXI.", "330": "Matters were in this posture when Demosthenes was descried in the offing, approaching with a splendid armament which struck terror into the hearts of the enemy.", "331": "His fleet consisted of seventy-three ships, on board of which were live thousand heavy-armed troops, and three thousand javelin men, archers, and slingers.", "332": "The glitter­ ing arms of the troops, the flaunting banners of the ships of war, and the music of the flutes to which the rowers kept time with their oars, made a gallant display, which delighted the Athenians as much as it depressed the Syra­ cusans.", "333": "These latter, indeed, were struck with dismay, and thought that their last victory had been won in vain, and that they were labouring to no purpose against a foe whopo ranks were continually reinforced.", "334": "Nikias was not long allowed to feast his eyes on this welcome spectacle undisturbed.", "335": "Demosthenes, as soon as he landed, insisted on the necessity of instantly attacking Syracuse, and putting an end to the siege, either by capturing the place, or by returning at once to Athens in case of failure.", "336": "Against this Nikias, who was alarmed at the idea of such vigorous action, urged that it would be unwise to run such a risk.", "337": "Delay, he argued, favoured the besiegers more than the besieged, as their resources must soon fail, in which case their allies would desert them and they would again be brought to the necessity of capitula­ ting.", "338": "Nikias adopted this view because of what he heard from his secret correspondents within the city, who urged him to continue the siege, telling him that already the Syracusans began to feel the war too great a burden for them to support, and that Gylippus was very unpopular among them, so that in a short time they would utterly refuse to hold out any longer, and would come to terms with the Athenians.", "339": "Nikias could only hint at these secret sources of information, and so his counsels were thought by his colleagues to be mere cowardice.", "340": "They declared loudly that the original mistake was about to be repeated, and the first terror-stricken impression of the armament frittered away, until familiarity with the sight of it had bred con­ tempt in the breasts of their enemies.", "341": "They therefore eagerly seconded the proposal of Demosthenes, and forced Nikias, though sorely against his will, to yield to their representations.", "342": "Accordingly, Demosthenes with the land force assaulted the outlying fort on the high ground of Epipolæ by night, and took it by surprise, killing part of its garrison and putting the remainder to flight.", "343": "He did not halt there, but followed up his success by marching further on towards the city, until he was met by some Boeotian heavy-armed troops, who had been the first to rally, and now in a compact mass met the Athenians with their spears levelled, and with loud shouts forced them to give way with severe loss.", "344": "The whole Athenian army was by this thrown into confusion and panic, as the fugitives broke the formation of those troops who were still marching to the front, so that in some cases they actually fought with one another, each believing the others to be enemies.", "345": "Thus the Athenians fell into sad disorder and ruin;", "346": "for they were unable to distinguish friends from foes in the uncertain light, as the moon, now nearly setting, glanced upon spear-points and armour without showing them clearly enough to enable men to see with whom they had to deal.", "347": "The moon was behind the backs of the Athenians :", "348": "and this circumstance was greatly against them, for it made it hard for them to see the numbers of their own friends, but shone plainly on the glittering shields of their antagonists, making them look taller and more terrible than they were.", "349": "Finally, attacked as they were on every side, they gave way and fled.", "350": "Some were slain by the enemy, some by their own countrymen, and some were dashed to pieces by falling down the precipices;", "351": "while the rest, as they straggled about the country, were cut off by the Syracusan cavalry.", "352": "Two thousand men perished, and of the survivors few brought back their arms.", "353": "XXII.", "354": "Nikias, who had expected this reverse, now cast the blame of it upon Demosthenes;", "355": "and he, admitting his error, besought Nikias to embark his army and sail away as quickly as possible, pointing out that no further reinforcement could be hoped for, and that they could not hope for success with the force now at their disposal.", "356": "Even had they been victorious, he argued, they had in­ tended to leave their present camp, which was unhealthy at all times, and was now in the hot season becoming pestilential.", "357": "The time was the beginning of autumn, and many of the Athenians were sick, while all were dis­ heartened.", "358": "Nikias, however, opposed the idea of retreat, not because he did not fear the Syracusans, but because he feared the Athenians more, and the treatment which as an unsuccessful general he would probably meet with.", "359": "He declared that he saw no reason for alarm, and that even if there was, that he would rather perish by the hands of the enemy than those of his countrymen.", "360": "A very different sentiment to that which was afterwards uttered by Leon the Byzantine, who said, “My countrymen, I had rather be put to death by you than to be put to death together with you.", "361": "\"With regard to the place to which it would be best for them to remove their camp, that, Nikias said, was a question which they might take time to discuss.", "362": "Demosthenes, seeing that Nikias was thus obstinate, and conscious that his own project, when adopted, had led to a frightful disaster, ceased pressing him to raise the siege, and gave the other generals to understand that Nikias must have secret reasons, from his correspondents within the city, which led him to persevere thus obstinately in remaining where he was.", "363": "This caused them also to withdraw their objections to remaining;", "364": "but when anothei army came to assist the Syracusans, and the Athenians began to perish from malaria, even Nikias himself agreed that it was time to retreat, and issued orders to his men to hold themselves in readiness to embark.", "365": "XXIII.", "366": "When all was ready, and the enemy off their guard, as they did not expect the Athenians to retreat, an eclipse of the moon took place, which greatly terrified Nikias and some others who, from ignorance or superstition, were in the habit of taking account of such phenomena.", "367": "That the sun should be sometimes eclipsed even the vulgar understood to be in some way due to the moon intercepting its light:", "368": "but what body could intercept the moon's light, so that suddenly tho full moon should pale its light and alter its colour, they could not explain, but thought that it was a sinister omen and portended some great calamity.", "369": "The treatise of Anaxagoras, the first writer who has clearly and boldly explained the phases and eclipses of the moon, was then known only to a few, and had not the credit of antiquity, while even those who understood it were afraid to mention it to their most trusted friends.", "370": "Men at that time could not endure natural philosophers and those whom they called in derision stargazers, but accused them of degrading the movements of the heavenly bodies by attributing them to necessary physical causes.", "371": "They drove Protagoras into exile, and cast Anaxagoras into prison, from whence lie was with difficulty rescued by Perikles ;", "372": "while Sokrates, who never took any part in these speculations, was nevertheless put to death because he was a philosopher.", "373": "It was not until after the period of which I am writing that the glorious works of Plato shed their light upon mankind, proving that Nature obeys a higher and divine law, and removing the reproach of impiety which used to attach to those who study these matters, so that all men might thereafter investigate natural phenomena unreproved.", "374": "Indeed, Plato's companion Dion, although the moon was eclipsed when he was starting from the island of Zakynthus to attack the despot Dionysius, was not in the least disturbed by the omen, but sailed to Syracuse and drove out the despot.", "375": "Nikias at this time was without a competent soothsayer, for his intimate friend, Stilbides, who used to check a great deal of his supersti­ tion, died shortly before this.", "376": "Indeed, the omen, if rightly explained, as Philochorus points out, is not a bad one but a very good one for men who are meditating a retreat;", "377": "for what men are forced to do by fear, requires darkness to conceal it, and light is inimical to them.", "378": "Moreover men were only wont to wait three days after an eclipse of the moon, or of the sun, as we learn from Autokleides in his book on divination;", "379": "but Nikias persuaded them to wait for another complete circuit of the moon, because its fac e would not shine upon them propitiously before that time after its defilement with the gross earthy particles which had intercepted its rays.", "380": "*XXIV.", "381": "Nikias now put all business aside, and kept offering sacrifices and taking omens, until the enemy at­ tacked him.", "382": "Their infantry assailed the camp and siege works, while their fleet surrounded the harbour, not in ships of war ;", "383": "but the very boys and children embarked in what boats they could find and jeered at the Athenians, challenging them to come out and fight.", "384": "One of these boys, named Herakleides, the son of noble parents, ventured too far.", "385": "and was captured by an Athenian ship.", "386": "His uncle Pollichus, fearing for his safety, at once advanced with ten triremes which were under his command ;", "387": "and this movement brought forward the rest of the Syracusan fleet to support him.", "388": "An obstinate battle now took place, in which the Syracusans wore victorious, and many of the Athenians perished, amongst whom was their admiral Eurymedon.", "389": "And now the Athenians refused to remain I efore Syracuse any longer, and called upon their generals to lead them away by land, for the Syracusans after their victory had at once blockaded the entrance to the harbour, so that no passage was left.", "390": "Nikias and the other generals refused to agree to this proposal, as they thought it would be a pity to abandon a fleet of so many transports, and nearly two hundred ships of war.", "391": "They placed the flower of the land force on board the ships, with the best of the slingers and darters, and manned one hundred and ten triremes, for they had not sufficient oars for a large:", "392": "number.", "393": "Nikias now abandoned the great camp and walls of investment, which reached as far as the temple of Herakles, and drew the army up on the beach as spectators of the battle.", "394": "Thus the Syracusan priests and generals were able for the first time since the siege began to sacrifice to Herakles, as they were wont to do, while the people were manning their fleet.", "395": "XXV.", "396": "The Syracusan soothsayers promised them the victory if they awaited attack and did not begin the attack :", "397": "for Herakles himself never struck the first blow, but always waited for his enemies to attack him.", "398": "The sea- fight which now took place was the fiercest and most obstinately contested of all those which took place through­ out the war, and its varying fortunes were shared with agonizing interest by the Athenian army and the citizens on the walls of Syracuse, who were able from their respec­ tive positions to overlook the whole battle and watch the manoeuvres of each ship.", "399": "The Athenians were placed at a great disadvantage by having all their ships collected into one mass, where they were attacked from all sides by the lighter and more manageable vessels of the enemy.", "400": "The Syracusans also used stones as missiles, which strike with equal effect, however they are thrown, while the Athenians replied with volleys of arrows and javelins, whoso aim was often spoiled by the motion of the vessels, and which are useless unless they fly with the point foremost.", "401": "All these details had been foreseen and taught to the Syracusans by Aristion the Corinthian steersman, who fell in the moment of victory.", "402": "The Athenians were finally routed and driven ashore with great slaughter, and their retreat by sea com­ pletely cut off.", "403": "Knowing how difficult it would be to make their way to any place of safety by land, they allowed themselves to be so paralyzed by despair, that they let the Syracusans tow away their ships as prizes, without making an effort to save them, and actually neglected to ask for a truce for the burial of their dead.", "404": "They seemed to think that the case of the sick and wounded whom they saw amongst them, and whom they must perforce abandon when they left their camp, was even more pitiable than that of the floating corpses, and they actually envied the lot of the slain, knowing well that after a few more days of suffering they themselves were all destined to share their fate.", "405": "XXVI.", "406": "They were all eager to depart during the night which followed this disastrous day;", "407": "but Gylippus, per­ ceiving that the people of Syracuse were so given up to feasting and merry-making, celebrating both their victory and the festival of their national hero Herakles, to whom the day was sacred, that they could not be either forced or persuaded into attempting to harass the enemy's retreat, sent some of those men who had formerly been in corre­ spondence with Nikias to tell him not to attempt to retreat that night, as all the roads were occupied by Syracusans lying in wait to attack him.", "408": "Deceived by this intelligence, Nikias waited to find what he feared in the night turned into a reality on the following day.", "409": "At daybreak the passes were occupied by the Syracusans, who also threw up entrenchments at all the places where rivers had to be forded, and broke all the bridges, stationing their cavalry upon the level ground, so that the Athenians could not advance a step without fighting.", "410": "The Athenians remained for all that day and the following night in their camp, and then set out, with such weeping and lamentation that it seemed rather as if they were leaving their native country than a hostile one, so distressed were they to see the miseries of their friends and relatives, and of the sick and wounded who were unable to accompany their march and had to be left to their fate, while they themselves had a presentiment that their present sufferings were nothing in comparison with those which awaited them.", "411": "Among all these piteous sights, Nikias himself offered a glorious example.", "412": "Worn out by disease, compelled by the exigencies of the retreat to forego the medicines and treatment which his condition required, he nevertheless, weak as he was, did more than many strong men could do, while all his men know well that he made those efforts, not from any wish or hope to save his own life, but that it was solely on their behalf that he did not give way to despair.", "413": "The tears and lamen­ tations of the rest were prompted by their own private sorrrows and fears, but the only grief shown by Nikias was that so splendid an expedition should have ended in such miserable failure.", "414": "Those who watched his noble bearing and remembered how earnestly lie had opposed the whole scheme, were filled with compassion for his undeserved sufferings.", "415": "They began to despair of the favour of Heaven being shown to themselves, when they reflected that this man, careful as ho had always been to perform every religious duty, was now no better off than the humblest or the most wicked soldier in his army.", "416": "XXVII.", "417": "Nikias made heroic efforts by cheerful looks, on­ couraging speeches, and personal appeals to his followers, to show himself superior to fortune.", "418": "Throughout the retreat, although for eight days in succession lie was constantly harassed by the attacks of the enemy, ho nevertheless kept the division under his command unbroken and undefeated, until the other part of the army under Demosthenes was forced to surrender, being completely surrounded in an enclosed olive ground, the property of Polyzelus, brother of the despot Gelon.", "419": "Demosthenes himself drew his sword and stabbed himself, but not mortally, for the Syracusans quickly interposed and forced him to desist.", "420": "When the Syracusans told Nikias of this disaster, and allowed him to send horsemen to convince him of its truth, he proposed terms to Gylippus, which were that the Athenians should be allowed to leave Sicily, on condition of the repayment of the whole expenses of the war, for which lie offered to give hostages.", "421": "These terms were refused, and the enemy with insulting cries and threats proceeded to shoot with missiles of all kinds at the Athenians, who were now com­ pletely without food or drink.", "422": "Yet Nikias prevailed upon them to hold out during that night, and on the following day he led them, still under fire from the enemy, across the plain leading to the river Asinarus.", "423": "There some were forced into the stream by the enemy, while others cast themselves in to quench their thirst.", "424": "A most dreadful slaughter now took place, the Athenians being wild with thirst, and the Syracusans killing them as they drank, until Nikias surrendered himself to Gylippus, saying, \" I beseech you, now that you are victorious, to show some mercy, not to me, but to the Athenian troops.", "425": "Consider how changeful is the fortune of war, and how gently the Athenians dealt with your men in their hour of victory.", "426": "\"Gylippus was visibly affected by the words, and by the sight of Nikias;", "427": "for he knew how well the Spartan prisoners had been treated by him, when the peace was made with Athens;", "428": "moreover, he thought that it would be a great honour to him if he could carry home the enemy's commander-in-chief as a prisoner.", "429": "He received Nikias with kindness, and gave orders to take the rest of the Athenians alive.", "430": "It was long, however, before these orders were understood and obeyed, so that more Athenians were slain than survived, although many were spared by the Syracusans in order that they might be sold for slaves.", "431": "The prisoners were now assembled together, and their arms and armour hung upon the trees by the river side, as a trophy of the victory.", "432": "The victors next crowned themselves with garlands, decorated their horses, cut off the manes and tails of the captured horses, and marched back into their own city, having by their courage and skill won the most complete victory ever gained by one Greek state over another.", "433": "XXVIII.", "434": "At a public assembly of the Syracusans and their allies which was shortly afterwards held, the orator Eurykles proposed that the day on which Nikias was taken should be kept as a festival for ever, upon which no work should be done, and sacrifice should be offered to the gods, and that the feast should be called the Asinaria, from the name of the river where the victory was won.", "435": "The day was the twenty-sixth of the Dorian month Karneius, which the Athenians call Metageitnion (Sep­ tember 21st).", "436": "Furthermore, he proposed that the Athe­ nian slaves and allies should bo sold, that the Athenians themselves, with what native Sicilians had joined them, should be confined in the stone quarries within the city of Syracuse, and that their generals should be put to death.", "437": "These propositions were accepted by the Syracusans, who treated Hermokrates with contempt when he urged that to be merciful in victory would be more honourable to them than the victory itself.", "438": "Gylippus too, when he begged that he might carry the Athenian generals alive to Sparta, was shamefully insulted by the excited Syra­ cusans, who had long disliked the irritating Spartan airs of superiority natural to Gylippus, and now, flushed with victory, no longer cared to conceal their feelings.", "439": "Timæus tells uas that they accused him of avarice and peculation, a hereditary vice, it appears, in his family since his father Kleandrides was banished from Sparta for taking bribes, while he himself afterwards stole thirty of the hundred talents which Lysander sent home to Sparta, and hid them under the roof of his house, but was informed against, and exiled in disgrace.", "440": "This will be found de­ scribed at greater length in the Life of Lysander.", "441": "In his account of the death of Nikias and Demosthenes, Timæus does not exactly follow the narrative of Thucy­ dides and Philistus, as he informs us that while the assembly was still sitting, Hermokrates sent to their prison to inform them that they were condemned to death, and to afford them the means of dying by their own hands, while the other historians state that the Syracusans put them to death.", "442": "*Be this as it may, their dead bodies were exposed before the gates of Syracuse as a spectacle for the citizens.", "443": "I have heard also that at the present day a shield is shown in one of the temples at Syracuse, which is said to be that of Nikias, and which is beautifully adorned with woven coverings of purple and gold.", "444": "XXIX.", "445": "Of the Athenians, the most part perished in the stone quarries of disease and insufficient food, for they received only a pint of barley-meal and half-a-pint of water each day.", "446": "Not a few, however, were sold into slavery, being stolen for that purpose by Syracusans, or having escaped disguised as slaves.", "447": "The rest were at length branded upon their foreheads with the figure of a horse, and sold into slavery.", "448": "Yet even in this extremity their well-bred and dignified behaviour came to their aid ;", "449": "for they soon either obtained their freedom, or gained the con­ fidence and respect of their masters.", "450": "Some gained their freedom by their knowledge of Euripides.", "451": "It appears that the dramas of Euripides were especially popular in Sicily, but that only a few fragments of his works had hitherto reached the Greek cities in that island.", "452": "We are told that many of these captives on their return to Athens affec­ tionately embraced Euripides, and told him how some of them had been sold into slavery, but had been set free after they had taught their masters as much of his poetry as they could remember, while others, when wandering about the country as fugitives after the battle, had obtained food and drink by reciting passages from his plays.", "453": "We need not then wonder at the tale of the people of Kaunus, who, when a ship pursued by pirates was making for their harbour at first refused to admit it, but afterwards enquired whether any on board knew the plays of Euripides;", "454": "and on hearing that they did, allowed them to enter the harbour and save themselves.", "455": "XXX.", "456": "At Athens the news of the catastrophe was at first disbelieved, because of the unsatisfactory way in which it reached the city.", "457": "A stranger, it is said, disem­ barked at Peiræus, went into a barber's shop, and began to converse about what had happened as upon a theme which must be uppermost in every man's mind.", "458": "The astonished barber, hearing for the first time such fearful tidings, ran up to Athens to communicate it to the archons, and to the public in the market-place.", "459": "All were shocked and astonished at hearing this, and the archons immediately convoked the public assembly, and brought the barber before it.", "460": "When he was asked to explain from whom he had heard this intelligence, as he could give no satisfactory account, he was regarded as a disturber of the public tranquillity by fabricating idle tales, and was even put to the torture.", "461": "Soon, however, men arrived who confirmed his tale, and described all the details of the catastrophe as far as they had witnessed them.", "462": "Then at last the countrymen of Nikias believed, after his death, what he had so often foretold to them during his life.", "463": "I. MARCUS CRASSUS* was the son of a father who had been censor, and enjoyed a triumph;", "464": "but he was brought up with his two brothers in a small house.", "465": "His brothers were married in the lifetime of their parents, and all had a common table, which seems to have been the chief reason that Crassus was a temperate and moderate man in his way of living.", "466": "Upon the death of one of his brothers, Crassus married the widow,† and she became the mother of his children;", "467": "for in these matters also he lived as regular a life as any Roman.", "468": "However, as ho grew older, he was charged with criminal intercourse with Licinia,‡ one of the Vestal Virgins, who was brought to trial;", "469": "the prosecutor was one Plotinus.", "470": "Licinia had a pleasant estate in the suburbs, which Crassus wished to get at a small price, and with this view he was continually about the woman and paying his court to her, which brought on him the sus­ picion of a criminal intercourse;", "471": "but he was acquitted by the judices, being indebted in some degree to his love of money for his acquittal from the charge of debauching the vestal.", "472": "But he never remitted his attentions to Licinia till he got possession of the property.", "473": "II.", "474": "Now, the Romans say that the many good qualities of Crassus were obscured by one vice, avarice;", "475": "but the fact appears to be that one vice, which was more predominant in his character than all the rest hid his other vices.", "476": "They allege, as the chief proof of his avarice, the mode in which he got his money and the amount of his property.", "477": "Though he did not at first possess above three hundred talents, and during his first consulship he dedicated the tenth part of his property to Hercules,.", "478": "and feasted the people, and gave every Roman out of his own means enough to maintain him for three months;", "479": "yet, before the Parthian expedition, upon making an estimate of his property, he found it amount to seven thousand one hundred talents.", "480": "The greatest part of this, if one must tell the truth, though it be a scandalous story, he got together out of the fire and the war, making the public misfortunes the source of his wealth;", "481": "for, when Sulla took the city, and sold the property of those whom he put to death, considering it and calling it spoil, and wishing to attach the infamy of the deed to as many of the most powerful men as he could, Crassus was never tired of receiving or buying.", "482": "Besides this, observing the acci­ dents that were indigenous and familiar at Rome, con­ flagrations, and tumbling down of houses owing to their weight and crowded state, he bought slaves, who were architects and builders.", "483": "Having got these slaves to the number of more than five hundred, it was his practice to buy up houses on fire, and the houses which were adjoin­ ing to those on fire;", "484": "for the owners, owing to fear and uncertainty, would sell them at a low price;", "485": "and thus the greatest part of Rome fell into the hands of Crassus:", "486": "but, though he had so many artizans, he built no house except his own;", "487": "for he used to say that those who were fond of building were ruined by themselves, without the aid of any opponent.", "488": "Though he had many silver mines, and much valuable land, and many labourers on it, still one would suppose that all this was of little value, compared with the value of his slaves:", "489": "so many excellent slaves he possessed,-readers, clerks, assayers of silver,.", "490": "house­ managers, and table-servants;", "491": "and ho himself super­ intended their education, and paid attention to it and taught them, and, in short, he considered that a master was mainly concerned in looking after his slaves, who were the living implements of domestic economy.", "492": "And here Crassus was right, if, as he used to say, it was his opinion that he ought to effect everything by the instru­ mentality of slaves, and that he himself should direct the slaves;", "493": "for, we observe, that what is economical with respect to things lifeless is political with respect to men.", "494": "But he was not right in thinking and saying that nobody was rich who could not maintain an army out of his substance ;", "495": "for war feeds not by a fixed allowance, accord­ ing to Archidamus;", "496": "† and, consequently, the wealth that is required for war is unlimited;", "497": "and this opinion of Crassus was very different from the opinion of Marius;", "498": "for when Marius, after giving to each man fourteen jugera of land, found that they wanted more, he said,\" May there never be a Roman who thinks that too little which is enough to maintain him.\"", "499": "III.", "500": "Besides this, Crassus was hospitable to stras, as if for his house was open to all, and he used to lend myself to his friends without interest;", "501": "but he would demand back immediately on the expiration of the time of the borrower, which made the gratuitous loan more burden­ some than heavy interest.", "502": "In his entertainments the invitation was usually to persons of the plebeian class, and general:", "503": "and the frugality of the banquet, which was accompanied with neatness and a friendly welcome, made it more agreeable than a sumptuous feast.", "504": "In his literary pursuits he mainly studied oratory,.", "505": "and that kind which was of practical use;", "506": "and, having attained an ability in speaking equal to the first among the Romans, he sur­ passed in care and labour those who had the greatest talents;", "507": "for they say, there was no case, however mean and contemptible, which he approached without prepara­ tion ;", "508": "and often, when Pompeius, and Cæsar, and Cicero, were unwilling to get up to speak, he would perform all the duties of an advocate :", "509": "and for this reason he became more popular, being considered a careful man, and always ready to give his help.", "510": "He pleased people, also, by his friendly and affable manner in taking them by the hand, and addressing them;", "511": "for Crassus never met a Roman, however low and humble his condition might be, without returning his salute,t and addressing him by his name.", "512": "He is also said to have been well versed in history, and to paid some attention to philosophy by studying the ngs of Aristoteles, in which he had for his teacher .", "513": "exajnder, a man who gave a proof of his moderation and easy temper in his intercourse with Crassus;", "514": "for it was not easy to say whether he was poorer when he became acquainted with Crassus, or after the acquaintance was made.", "515": "He was, indeed, the only friend of Crassus, who always accompanied him when he travelled abroad;", "516": "and he used to wear a cloak,.", "517": "lent him for the purpose, which on his return he was asked to give back.", "518": "Oh, the sub­ mission t of the man!", "519": "for the poor fellow did not consider poverty among the things that are indifferent.", "520": "But this belongs to a later period.", "521": "IV.", "522": "When Marius and Cinna had got the upper hand, and it was soon apparent that they would reinstate them­ selves in Rome, not for the benefit of their country, but plainly for the destruction and ruin of the nobles, those who were caught in the city were put to death:", "523": "among whom were the father and brother of Crassus.", "524": "Crassus, being very young, escaped immediate danger;", "525": "but, seeing that he was hemmed in on all sides, and hunted by the tyrants, he took with him three friends and ten slaves;", "526": "and, using wonderful expedition, made his escape to Iberia, having been there before, when his father was Praetor,‡ and having made himself friends.", "527": "Finding all in great alarm and trembling at the cruelty of Marius, as if he were close at hand, he did not venture to make himself known, but sought refuge in a tract bordering on the sea, belonging to Vibius Pacianus,* where he hid himself in a large cave.", "528": "He sent a slave to Vibius to sound his dis­ position;", "529": "for the provisions that Crassus brought with him were now exhausted.", "530": "On hearing the news, Vibius was pleased that Crassus had escaped;", "531": "and inquiring about the number of persons with him, and where the place was, he did not go himself to see them, but he took his villicus near the spot, and ordered him to have food daily prepared, and to carry it and place it near the rock, and to go away without speaking a word, and not to be curious about the matter, or make any inquiries;", "532": "and he gave him notice, that if he did meddle at all he should be put to death, but if he faithfully helped in the matter he should have his freedom.", "533": "The cave is not far from the sea, and the precipices which shut it in leave a small and hardly perceptible path t which leads into the cave;", "534": "but when you have entered, it opens to a wonderful height, and spreads out wide, with recesses which open into one another, and are of a large circuit.", "535": "It is also neither without water nor light:", "536": "for a spring of the purest water oozes out at the base of the precipice;", "537": "and there are natural clefts about that part where the rock closes, by which the external light is admitted, and in the daytime the spot is fully illuminated.", "538": "The air within is free from all moisture caused by dropping, and is quite pure, owing to the compactness of the rock, which diverts all the wet and droppings to the spring.", "539": "V.", "540": "While Crassus stayed in the cave, the slave came daily to bring provisions;", "541": "but he did not see the persons who were concealed, or know who they were;", "542": "though he was seen by them, inasmuch as they knew, and watched the times of his coming.", "543": "Now, the provision that was made for their meals was ample enough even for luxury, and not merely sufficient for their necessities.", "544": "But Vibius determined to show Crassus every kind of friendly atten­ tion;", "545": "and it occurred to him to consider the youth of Crassus, that he was a very young man, and that provision should be made in some degree also for the pleasures suit­ able to his age, and that merely to supply his wants would argue that he was serving Crassus as little as he could, rather than with hearty zeal;", "546": "accordingly, he took with him two handsome female slaves, and went down to the sea-coast.", "547": "When he came to the place, he pointed to the road that led up to it, and told them to go in boldly.", "548": "Crassus, seeing them approach, was afraid that the spot was known, and had been discovered;", "549": "and, accordingly, he asked them what they wanted, and who they were.", "550": "The women replied, as they had been instructed, that they were looking for their master, who was concealed there;", "551": "on which Crassus perceived the joke which Vibius was playing off upon him, and his kind attentions, and received the women;", "552": "and they stayed with him for the rest of the time, telling and reporting to Vibius what he requested them.", "553": "Fenestella* says, that he saw one of these slaves when she was an old woman, and that he had often heard her mention this, and tell the story with pleasure.", "554": "VI.", "555": "In this way Crassus spent eight months in conceal­ ment;", "556": "but as soon as he heard of Cinna's end, he showed himself, and out of the numbers that flocked to him he selected two thousand five hundred, with whom he went round to the cities;", "557": "and one city, Malaca,* he plundered, according to the testimony of many authors, though they say that he denied the fact, and contradicted those who affirmed it.", "558": "After this he got together some vessels, and crossed over to Libya, to Metellus Pius,† a man of reputa­ tion who had collected a force by no means contemptible.", "559": "But he stayed no long time there;", "560": "for he quarrelled with Metellus, and then set out to join Sulla, by whom he was treated with particular respect.", "561": "When Sulla had passed over the sea to Italy, he wished all the young men who were with him to aid him actively, and he appointed them to different duties.", "562": "Crassus, on being sent into the country of the Marsi to raise troops, asked for a guard, because the road lay through a tract which was occupied by the enemy;", "563": "Sulla replied to him in passion and with vehemence, “I give thee as guards thy father, thy brother, thy friends, thy kinsmen, who were cut off illegally and wrongfully, and whose murderers I am now pursuing.\"", "564": "Stung by these words, and pricked on to the undertaking, Crassus immediately set out, and, vigorously making his way through the enemy, he got together a strong force, and showed himself active in the battles of Bulla.", "565": "The events of that war, it is said, first excited him to rivalry and competition with Pompeius for distinction.", "566": "Pompeius was younger than Crassus, and his father had a bad repute at Rome, and had been bitterly hated by the citizens;", "567": "but still Pompeius shone conspicuous in the events of that period and proved himself to be a great man, so that Bulla showed him marks of respect which he did not very often show to others of more advanced years and of his own rank, by rising from his seat when Pompeius approached, and uncovering his head, and addressing him by the title of Imperator.", "568": "All this set Crassus in a flame, and goaded him, inasmuch as he was thus slighted in comparison with Pompeius;", "569": "and with good reason;", "570": "Crassus was deficient in experience, and tho credit that he got by his military exploits was lost by his innate vices,-love of gain and meanness;", "571": "for, upon taking Tudertia,* a city of the Umbri, it was suspected that he appropriated to himself most of the spoil, and this was made a matter of charge against him to Sulla.", "572": "However, in the battle near Rome,t which was the greatest in all the war, and the last, Sulla was defeated, the soldiers under his command being put to flight, and some of them trampled down in the pursuit:", "573": "Crassus, who commanded the right wing, was victorious, and, after continuing tho pursuit till nightfall, he sent to Sulla to ask for something for his soldiers to cat, and to report his success.", "574": "But, during the proscriptions and confiscations, on the other hand, he got a bad name, by buying at low prices large properties, and asking for grants.", "575": "It is said that, in the country of the Bruttii, ho also proscribed a person, not pursuant to Sulla's orders, but merely to enrich himself thereby, and that, on this account, Sulla, who disapproved of his conduct, never employed him again in any public business.", "576": "However, Crassus was most expert in gaining over everybody by flattery;", "577": "and, on the other hand, he was easily taken in by flattery from any person.", "578": "It is further mentioned as a peculiarity in his character, that, though very greedy of gain,t he hated and abused those most who were like himself.", "579": "VII.", "580": "But Crassus was most annoyed at the military success of Pompeius, and his enjoying a triumph before he became a senator, and being called by the citizens Magnus, which means Great.", "581": "On one occasion, when somebody obsei ved that Pompeius the Great was approach­ ing, Crassus smiled, and asked.", "582": "How great lie was ?", "583": "But, as Crassus despaired of equalling Pompeius in military reputation, he entered upon a political career, and, by his activity, by pleading in the courts, and lending money.", "584": "and by canvassing for candidates, and subjecting himself to all kinds of scrutiny in conjunction with those who wanted anything of the people, he acquired a power and reputation equal to what Pompeius had got by his many and great military services.", "585": "And the result to each of them was something unusual;", "586": "for, when Pompeius was absent from Rome, his name and his influence in the State, by reason of his military exploits, was superior to that of Crassus;", "587": "but when Pompeius was at Rome, he often fell short of Crassus in influence, for his haughty temper and habitual pride made him avoid crowds and retire from the Forum, and seldom give his aid to those who sought it, and then not readily;", "588": "his object being to keep his power at a higher pitch, by exercising it only on his own behalf.", "589": "But Crassus was always ready to make himself useful, and he did not keep himself retired, nor was he difficult of access, but he was always busy in everything that was going on, and by the general kindness of his behaviour lie got the advantage over the proud bearing of Pompeius.", "590": "In personal dignity, in persuasive speech, and attractive expression of countenance it is said they were both equally fortunate.", "591": "However, this rivalry did not hurry Crassus into any personal enmity or ill-will, and though he was annoyed at Pompeius and Cæsar receiving greater honour than himself, he never allowed this jealous feeling to be associated with any hostility or ill disposition.", "592": "It is true that when Cæsar was taken and detained by the pirates, he cried out, \"What pleasure you will have, Crassus, when you hear of my capture! \"", "593": "But afterwards, at least, they were on friendly terms, and, when Cæsar was going to Iberia, as praetor,* and had no money in consequence of his creditors having come upon him and seizing all his outfit, Crassus did not leave him in this difficulty, but got him released, by becoming security for him to the amount of eight hundred and thirty talents.", "594": "When all Rome became divided into three parties,-that of Pompeius, Cæsar and Crassus,—(for Cato * had more reputation than power, and was more admired than followed), the sober and COIl­ servative part of the citizens adhered to Pompeius;", "595": "the violent and those who were lightly moved, were led by the hopes that they had from Cæsar;", "596": "Crassus, by keeping a middle position, used both parties for his purposes, and, as he very often changed in his political views, he was neither a firm friend nor an irreconcilable enemy, but he would readily give up either his friendship or his enmity on calculation of interest;", "597": "so that within a short interval, he often came forward to speak both for and against the same men and the same measures.", "598": "He had also great influence, both because he was liked and feared, but mainly because he was feared.", "599": "Accordingly Sicinius,t who was the most violent in his attacks on the magistrates and popular leaders of the day, in reply to one who asked, “ Why Crassus was the only person whom he did not worry, and why he let him alone ? \" said,", "600": "“That he had hay on his horn:", "601": "” now, the Romans were accustomed to tie some hay round the horn of an ox that butted, as a warning to those who might meet it.", "602": "VIlI.", "603": "The insurrection of the gladiators and their devastation of Italy, which is generally called the war of Spartacus, t originated as follows :", "604": "-One Lentulus Batiates kept gladiators in Capua, of whom the majority, who were Gauls and Thracians, had been closely confined, not for any misbehaviour on their part, but through the villainy of their purchaser, for the purpose of fighting in the games.", "605": "Two hundred of these resolved to make their escape;", "606": "but their design being betrayed, those who had notice of the discovery, and succeeded in getting away, to the number of seventy-eight, took knives and spits out of a cook's shop, and sallied out.", "607": "Meeting on the way with some waggons that were conveying gladiators' arms to another city, they plundered the waggons, and armed themselves.", "608": "Seizing on a strong position, they chose three leaders, of whom the first was Spartacus, a Thracian of nomadic race, a man not only of great courage and strength, but, in judgment and mildness of character, superior to his condition, and more like a Greek than one would expect from his nation.", "609": "They say that when Spartacus was first taken to Rome to be sold, a snake was seen folded over his face while he was sleeping, and a woman, of the same tribe with Spartacus, who was skilled in divination, and possessed by the mysterious rites of Dionysus, declared that this was a sign of a great and formidable power which would attend him to a happy termination.", "610": "This woman was at that time cohabiting with Spartacus, and she made her escape with him.", "611": "IX.", "612": "The gladiators began by repelling those who came against them from Capua and getting a stock of military weapons, for which they gladly exchanged their gladiators' arms, which they threw away as a badge of dishonour, and as barbaric.", "613": "Clodius* the praetor was next sent against them from Rome, with three thousand men, and he blockaded them on a mountain which had only one ascent, and that was difficult and narrow, and Clodius had possession of it;", "614": "on all other sides there were steep smooth­ faced precipices.", "615": "On the top of the hill there grew a great quantity of wild vines, and the men of Spartacus cutting off all the shoots that were adapted to their purpose, and, intertwining them, made strong and long ladders, so that when fastened above, they reached along the face of the precipice to the level ground, and they all safely de­ scended by them except one man, who stayed to take care of the arms;", "616": "and, when all the rest had descended, he let the arms down, and, having done this, he got down safe himself.", "617": "The Romans did not know what was going on ;", "618": "and accordingly, when the gladiators surrounded them, they were put in alarm by the surprise, and fled, on which the enemy took their camp.", "619": "Many of the herdsmen and shepherds in those parts also joined the gladiators, men ever ready for a quarrel, and light of foot, some of whom the gladiators armed, and others they employed as scouts and light troops.", "620": "Publius Barinus * the praetor was next sent against them, whose legatus, one Furius, at the head of two thousand soldiers, the gladiators engaged and put to flight.", "621": "Cossinus was then despatched, with a largo force, to advise with Barinus, and to be associated in tho command;", "622": "but Spartacus, watching his opportunity, while Cossinus was bathing at Salenæ, † was very near seizing him.", "623": "Cossinus made his escape with great difficulty, and Spartacus, seizing the baggage, closely followed up the pursuit, with great slaughter of the Romans, and he took the camp.", "624": "Cossinus also fell.", "625": "Spartacus, after defeating the praetor himself in many other battles, and at last seizing his lictors and his horse, now became great and formidable:", "626": "but still he formed a just judgment of the state of affairs and, not expecting to get the advantage over the power of the Romans, he designed to lead his forces to the Alps ;", "627": "thinking that it was advisable for them to cross the mountains and to go to their several homes, some to Thrace and some to Gaul.", "628": "But the gladiators being strong in numbers, and confident, would not listen to him, and they went about ravaging Italy.", "629": "The Senate

"634": "Spartacus now attempted to force his way towards the Alps;", "635": "and Cassius, † who was the governor of Gaul upon the Padus, met him with ten thousand men, and a battle was fought, in which Cassius was defeated with great loss, and with difficulty made his escape.X.", "636": "The Senate, on receiving this news, angrily bade the consuls keep quiet, and they appointed Crassus to the command of the war, whose reputation and popularity induced many of the nobles to serve under him.", "637": "Crassus took his station on the frontiers of Picenum, with the view of waiting for Spartacus, who was moving in that direction ;", "638": "and he sent Mummius, his legatus, at the head of two legions, to make a circuit, and with orders to follow the enemy, but not to engage with them, nor come to close quarters.", "639": "But Mummius, as soon as he got what he thought a favourable opportunity, fought a battle, and was defeated;", "640": "many of his men fell, and many, flying without their arms, made their escape.", "641": "Crassus received Mummius himself roughly, and arming the soldiers again, he required of them security for their arms, that they would keep them;", "642": "and five hundred, who had been the first to run, and had shown most cowardice, he distributed into fifty decades,.", "643": "and out of each decade he took one man, by lot, and put him to death;", "644": "thus inflicting on the soldiers this ancient mode of punishment which had long fallen into disuse;", "645": "for disgrace also is added to the manner of death, and many things horrible and dreadful to see accompany the punishment, in the presence of all the spectators.", "646": "After inflicting this punishment, he made his men again face about and march against the enemy.", "647": "Spartacus, however, avoided Crassus, and made his way through Lucania to the sea, and, falling in with some Cilician piratical vessels, in the Straits, he formed a design to seize Sicily, and by throwing two thousand men into the island, to kindle again the servile war there, the flames of which had not long since been quenched, and required only a few sparks to set it again in a blaze.", "648": "The Cilicians t came to terms with Spartacus, and received his presents;", "649": "but they deceived him, and sailed off.", "650": "Under these circumstances, he marched back from the coast, and fixed his army in the peninsula of the Rhegine territory.", "651": "Crassus now came up, and observing that the nature of the ground suggested what was to be done, he resolved to build a wall across the isthmus, for the purpose of keeping his soldiers employed, and cutting off the supplies of the enemy.", "652": "Though the undertaking was great and difficult, he accomplished it, and completed the work, contrary to all expectation, in a short time, by digging a ditch ‡ from sea to sea, through the neck of land, three hundred stadia in length, fifteen feet deep, and as many wide;", "653": "and above the ditch he raised a rampart of surprising height and strength.", "654": "At first Spartacus paid no attention to what was going on, and treated it with contempt;", "655": "but when forage began to fail, and he wanted to advance further into the interior, he discovered the lines of Crassus;", "656": "and as there was nothing to be got in the peninsula, taking advantage of a night when there was a fall of snow and a wintry storm, he filled up a small part of the ditch with earth, and wood, and the branches of trees, and so carried over a third part of his army.", "657": "XI.", "658": "Now Crassus was afraid that Spartacus might form a design to march against Rome;", "659": "but he was encouraged by many of the followers of Spartacus quitting their leader, in consequence of some disputes, and encamping by them­ selves upon the banks of the lake Lucanis,* which they say is subject to changes, at certain intervals becoming sweet, and then again salt, and not potable.", "660": "Crassus coming upon this band, drove them from the lake;", "661": "but he was prevented from cutting them to pieces and pursuing them, by the sudden appearance of Spartacus, who checked the flight.", "662": "Crassus had, before this, written to the Senate, to say that they ought to summon Lucullus t from Thrace, and Pompeius from Iberia;", "663": "but he now changed his mind, and made every effort to put an end to the war before they arrived, knowing that the success would be attributed to him who came last, and brought help, and not to himself.", "664": "Accordingly, he determined to attack first those who had separated from the main body, and were carrying on the campaign by themselves, under the command of Caius Oannicius and Castus;", "665": "and he dispatched six thousand men.", "666": "with orders to occupy a certain hill, and keep them­ selves concealed.", "667": "The men of Crassus endeavoured to escape notice by covering their helmets ;", "668": "but, being seen by two women, who were sacrificing for the enemy, they would have been in danger, if Crassus had not quickly appeared, and fought a battle, the most severely contested of all in this war, in which he destroyed twelve thousand three hundred men, of whom he found only two wounded in the back:", "669": "all the rest died in the ranks, fighting against the Romans.", "670": "After the defeat of this body, Spartacus retired to the mountains of Petilia,* followed by Quintius,† one of the generals of Crassus, and Scrofas, his quæstor, who hung close on his rear.", "671": "But, upon Spartacus facing about, the Romans were thrown into disorderly flight, and made their escape, after having with difficulty rescued their quæstor, who was wounded.", "672": "This success was the ruin of Spartacus, in consequence of the self- confidence which it infused into the slaves:", "673": "they would not now consent to avoid a battle, nor yet would they obey their commanders, whom they surrounded, with arms in their hands, on the march, and compelled to lead them back through Lucania against the Romans, wherein they did the very thing that Crassus desired ;", "674": "for it was reported that Pompeius was now approaching, and there were not a few who openly said that the victory in this war belonged to him;", "675": "for he would fight as soon as he arrived, and put an end to the campaign.", "676": "While Crassus, therefore, who was eager to decide the affair by a battle, and to fix his camp near the enemy, was engaged in digging his trenches, the slaves came up to them and attacked the men who were at work.", "677": "As fresh men from both sides kept coming up to help their comrades, Spartacus, seeing that he must fight, arranged all his army in order of battle.", "678": "When his horse was brought to him, he drew his sword and said, that if he won the battle he should have plenty of fine horses from the enemy, and if he was defeated he should not want one;",

engaged with and killed two centurions.", "681": "At last, after those about him had fled, he kept his ground, and, being surrounded by a great number, he fought till he was cut down.", "682": "But, though Crassus had been successful, and had displayed the skill of a great general, and had exposed his person to danger, yet the credit of the victory did not escape being appropriated to Pompeius;", "683": "for those who fled from the battle were destroyed by him, and Pompeius wrote to the Senate that Crassus had defeated the slaves in the open field, but he had cut up the war by the roots.-", "684": "Now Pompeius had a splendid triumph for his victory over Sertorius and his exploits in Iberia ;", "685": "but Crassus did not venture to ask for the greater triumph;", "686": "and even as to the foot triumph called the ovation, which ho did enjoy, it was considered but a mean thing, and below his dignity that he had a triumph for a servile war.", "687": "But how the ovation differs from the other triumph, and about the name, I have spoken in the ' Life of Marcellus.'tXII.", "688": "After these events, Pompeius was forthwith in­ vited to the consulship,.", "689": "and, though Crassus Lad hopes of becoming his colleague, still he did not hesitate to solicit the assistance of Pompeius.", "690": "Pompeius gladly listened to his proposal, for he was desirous in any way always to have Crassus his debtor for some obligation, and he actively exerted himself on behalf of Crassus;", "691": "and finally ho said.", "692": "in his address to the public assembly, that he should feel no less grateful for the return of Crassus as his colleague than for his own election.", "693": "They did not, however, continue in this harmony after entering on their office, but they differed on almost every subject, and quarrelled about everything, and by their disputes ren­ dered their consulship unfruitful in all political measures, and ineffectual:", "694": "however, Crassus made a great festival in honour of Hercules, and feasted the people at ten thousand tables, and gave them an allowance of corn for three months.", "695": "It was at the close of their consulship, when Pompeius and Crassus happened to be addressing the public assembly, that a man, not of any distinction, a Roman eques, a rustic in his mode of life, and one who did not meddle with public affairs, Onatius Aurelius,t got up on the rostra, and, coming forward,told a dream which he had had.", "696": "\" Jupiter,\" he said, “ appeared to me, and bade me tell the citizens not to let the consuls lay down their office before they have become friends.\"", "697": "Upon the man saying this, and the assembly bidding the consuls be reconciled, Pompeius stood silent;", "698": "but Crassus offering his right hand first, said, “ Citizens, I do not consider that I am humbling myself or doing anything unworthy of me when I make the advance towards good-will and friend­ ship to Pompeius, to whom you gave the name of Magnus before he had a beard, and voted a triumph before he was a senator.", "699": "\"XIII.", "700": "These were the things worthy of commemoration in the consulship of Crassus.", "701": "But his censorship ‡ passed over altogether without results, and without any active measures;", "702": "for he neither revised the senate, nor inspected the equites, nor made a census of the citizens, though he had for his colleague Lutatius Catulus, the mildest of the Romans.", "703": "But it is said that Crassus designed a shameful and violent measure, to make Egypt tributary to the Romans, and that Catulus opposed him vigorously, on which a difference arising between them, they voluntarily laid down their office.", "704": "In the affair of Catiline,* which was a serious matter, and one that came near overthrow­ ing Rome, some suspicion, it is true, attached to Crassus, and a man came forward to name him as implicated in the conspiracy, but nobody believed him.", "705": "However, Cicero, in one of his orations, evidently imputed to Crassus and Caesar participation in the plot;", "706": "but this oration was not published till after the death of both of them.", "707": "But in the oration on his consulship, Cicero says that Crassus came to him by night and brought a letter t which con­ tained information on the affair of Catiline, as if his object was to establish the truth of the conspiracy.", "708": "Now Crassus always hated Cicero for this, but his son stood in the way of the censors are here briefly alluded to by Plutarch.", "709": "One of the most important was the numbering of the people and the registration of property for the purposes of taxation.", "710": "This quarrel of the censors is mentioned by Dion Cassius (37. c. 9).", "711": "of his doing Cicero any open injury.", "712": "For Publius,* who was fond of oratory and of improving himself, was much attached to Cicero, and went so far as to change his dress when Cicero did at the time of his trial, and he induced the other young men to do the same.", "713": "At last he prevailed upon his father, and reconciled him to Cicero.XIV.", "714": "When Caesar returned from his province,† he made preparations to be a candidate for the consulship;", "715": "but, observing that Crassus and Pompeius were again at enmity, he did not choose by applying to one of them for his help to have the other for his enemy, and he did not think that he could succeed if neither of them assisted him.", "716": "Accordingly, he set about reconciling them, by continually urging upon them, and showing that by their attempts to ruin one another they would increase the power of the Ciceros, and Catuli, and Catos, who would lose all their influence if they would unite their friends and adherents, and so direct the administration with combined strength, and one purpose.", "717": "By persuasion and effecting a reconciliation, he brought them together, and he formed out of the union of all three an irresistible power by which he put down the Roman senate and the people, though he did not make Pompeius and Crassus more powerful, one through the other, but by means of the two he made himself most powerful;", "718": "for immediately on being supported by Pompeius and Crassus, he was elected consul by a great majority.", "719": "While Cæsar was ably discharging the business of the consulship, Crassus and Pompeius, by procuring for him the command of armies, and by delivering Gaul into his hands, fixed him in a kind of acropolis, thinking that they should ad­ minister the rest of the State as they mutually agreed, after securing to Caesar the authority which the lot had given him.", "720": "Now Pompeius did all this through un­ bounded love of power;", "721": "but to the old vice of Crassus, his avarice, there was now added a new passion, ambition for trophies and triumphs excited by the great exploits of Cæsar, since it was in this alone that he was Cæsar's inferior;", "722": "for he had the superiority in everything else;", "723": "and his passion remitted not nor diminished till it resulted in an inglorious death and public misfortunes.", "724": "Cæsar had come down from Gaul to the city of Luca, and many of the Romans went to him there, and Pompeius and Crassus had private conferences with him, in which they agreed to take affairs in hand more vigorously, and to hold the whole power of the State at their disposal, to which end Caesar was to remain in his military command, and Pompeius and Crassus were to have other provinces and armies.", "725": "To this object there was only one road, which was to ask for a second consulship, and Cæsar was to assist them in their canvass by writing to his friends and sending many of his soldiers to support them at the comitia.",

"738": "By such arguments, which were also his real opinions, Cato, all but by force, brought Domitius to the Forum, and many sided with them.", "739": "And those who were surprised at the canvassing of Pompeius and Crassus were no small number.", "740": "“", "741": "Why then do they want a second consulship?", "742": "And why do they wish to be colleagues again?", "743": "And why will they not have the consulship with other colleagues?", "744": "There are many men among us who are surely not unworthy to be colleagues with Crassus and Pompeius.\"", "745": "This alarmed the partizans of Pompeius, who now abstained from no proceeding, however dis­ orderly and violent;", "746": "but, in addition to all the rest, they placed a body of men to lie in wait and attack Domitius as he was going down to the Forum, while it was still dark, with his partizans, and they killed the man that held the light, and wounded many, among whom was Cato.", "747": "After putting the party of Domitius to flight, and driving them back to the house,.", "748": "Pompeius and Crassus were proclaimed consuls.", "749": "Shortly after, they again sur­ rounded the Senate-house with armed men, and, after driving Cato out of the Forum, and killing some persons who opposed them, they procured another five years t of administration to be added to Cæsar's term, and the two provinces of Syria and Iberia to be given to them.", "750": "When the lots were cast, Crassus got Syria, and Pompeius had Iberia.", "751": "XVI.", "752": "The result of the lot was not universally dis­ liked;", "753": "for the majority wished Pompeius not to be far from the city, and Pompeius, who was much attached to his wife,.", "754": "intended to spend his time chiefly in Rome.", "755": "Crassus showed by his joy, immediately on the falling out of the lot, that he considered no greater good fortune had ever befallen him, and he could scarcely keep quiet before strangers and in public;", "756": "to his friends he uttered many foolish and puerile expressions quite inconsistent with his years and temper, for he had never before shown himself in the least degree a braggart or arrogant.", "757": "But now, being mightily elated, and his head completely turned, he was not for making Syria or Palestine the limit of his victories;", "758": "but, designing to make the exploits of Lucullus against Tigranes, and those of Pompeius against Mithri­ dates appear mere child's play, he extended his hopes as far as to the Bactrians, and the Indians, and the external sea.", "759": "And yet there was no mention of a Parthian war in the law t that was drawn up on this occasion.", "760": "But every­ body knew that Crassus was passionately bent on a Parthian war, and Cæsar wrote to him from Gaul, ap­ proving of his design, and urging him to it.", "761": "When it was known that Ateius,* the tribune, intended to offer some opposition to his leaving the city, and many persons joined him who complained that Crassus was going to make war upon a people who were doing the Romans no wrong, and had a treaty with them, Crassus in alarm prayed Pompeius to accompany him, and escort him out of the city.", "762": "Now, the reputation of Pompeius with the multitude was great, and, by showing himself in front of Crassus, with cheerful looks and countenance, he tran­ quillized a numerous body of people who were prepared to obstruct Crassus, and to raise a shout against him, so that they made way and let him pass through them quietly.", "763": "But Ateius met Crassus, and, first of all, en­ deavoured to stop him by words, and he protested against his marching out:", "764": "in the next place, he ordered his attendant to lay hold of Crassus, and to detain him;", "765": "but, as the rest of the tribunes would not allow this, the attendant quitted his hold of Crassus, and Ateius running to the gate, placed there a burning brazier, and, as soon as Crassus arrived, he threw incense and poured libations upon it, and, at the same time, he denounced against Crassus curses, in themselves dreadful and terrific, and, in addition thereto, he uttered the names of certain awful and inauspicious deities.", "766": "The Romans say that these mysterious and ancient curses have great efficacy, that no man can escape upon whom they are laid, and that he who utters them also has an unlucky end, and, accord­ ingly, they are not denounced either on ordinary occa­ sions, or by many persons.", "767": "Ateius was blamed for letting loose such imprecations and religious fears upon a State, on behalf of which he was hostile to Crassus.", "768": "XVII.", "769": "When Crassus arrived at Brundisium, though the sea was still rough owing to the wintry weather, he would not wait, but he set sail, and so lost many of his vessels.", "770": "After getting together the remnant of his forces, he marched through Galatia.*", "771": "Finding King Deiotarus, who was now a very old man, founding a new city, Crassus said sarcastically, “ King, you are beginning to build at the twelfth hour.\"", "772": "The Galatian, with a smile, replied, “ You, too, Imperator, I observe, are not very early with your Parthian expedition.\"", "773": "Now Crassus was past sixty, and he looked older than ho was.", "774": "On his arrival, matters at first turned out fully equal to his expectation;", "775": "for he easily threw a bridge over the Euphrates, and got his army across safely, and he also obtained possession of many cities in Mesopotamia which surrendered.", "776": "Before one of them, of which Apollonius was tyrant, he lost a hundred men, upon which he brought his force against the place, and, having got possession of it, he made plunder of all the property, and sold the people:", "777": "the Greeks called the city Zenodotia.†", "778": "On the capture of the city, Crassus allowed his soldiers to proclaim him Imperator, wherein he greatly disgraced himself, and showed the meanness of his spirit, and that he had no good hopes of greater things, as he was content with so slight a success.", "779": "Having put garrisons in the cities that had surrendered, to the amount of seven thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry, he retired to winter in Syria, and there to await his son,‡ who was coming from Cæsar in Gaul, with the decorations that he had gained by his valour, and with a thousand picked forsemen.", "780": "This seemed to be the first blunder of Crassus, or at least, it was the greatest blunder that he committed next to the expedition itself;", "781": "for he ought to have advanced and to have secured Babylon and Seleukeia,* two cities which were always hostile to the Parthians;", "782": "instead of which, he gave his enemies time to make preparation.", "783": "The next thing the people blamed was his waste of time in Syria, which was employed more for purposes of money profit than for military purposes;", "784": "for he did not occupy himself in reviewing the numbers of his troops, nor establishing games to keep the soldiers in exercise, but he busied himself about estimating the revenues of cities, and he was for many days with weights and scales in his hands among the treasures of the goddess in Hierapolis,† and, after requiring from the towns and princes con­ tingentis of men, he would remit his requisitions for a sum of money;", "785": "by all which he lost his reputation, and fell into contempt.", "786": "The first sign that happened to him proceeded from this goddess herself, whom some consider to be Aphrodite (Venus);", "787": "and others Hera (Juno) ;", "788": "others again believe her to be the cause that has supplied from moisture the seeds for all things, and nature, and the power that has pointed out the source of all good things for men;", "789": "for, as they were going out of the temple, young Crassus first stumbled at the gate, and then his father fell upon him.", "790": "XVIII.", "791": "While Crassus was getting together his forces out of the winter quarter, there came ambassadors from Arsakes t with a short message.", "792": "They said, if the army was sent by the Romans, there was nothing but war without truce, and without any terms;", "793": "but if Crassus, contrary to the wish of his country, as they heard, had brought arms against the Parthians and occupied territory for his private profit, Arsakes would act with moderation, and would take pity on the old age of Crassus, and give up to the Romans the men whom he had in his power, and who were rather under guard themselves than keeping guard over others.", "794": "Crassus haughtily replied, that he would give an answer in Seleukeia;", "795": "on which Vagises, the oldest of the ambassadors, smiled, and, showing the palm of his hand, said, “ From here, Crassus, hair will grow before you see Seleukeia.”", "796": "The ambassadors now returned to Hyrodes, to inform him that he must be ready for war.", "797": "From the cities of Mesopotamia, in which there were Roman garrisons, some soldiers, who made their escape at great hazard, brought reports that caused much anxiety, having been eye-witnesses of the numbers of the enemy, and of their mode of attacking the cities ;", "798": "and, as is usual, they magnified everything which they reported.", "799": "“", "800": "When the enemy pursued,\" they said, “ no man could escape from them, and when they fled, they could not be overtaken;", "801": "that strange missiles preceded the appearance of the enemy, and before one could see who sent them, they pierced through everything that they struck ;", "802": "and as to the arms of the mailed * soldiers, some were made to push through every obstacle, and others to give way to nothing.\"", "803": "When the soldiers heard this their courage sank;", "804": "for they had been led to believe that the Parthians did not differ at all from the Armenians and Cappadocians, whom Lucullus plundered and robbed till he was weary, and they thought that the hardest part of the war would be a long march, and the pursuit of men who would not come to close quarters;", "805": "but now, contrary to their hopes, they were in expectation of a contest and great danger, so that some of the officers thought that Crassus ought to stop, and again submit to their deliberation the general state of affairs.", "806": "Among these was Cassius t the quæstor.", "807": "The seers, also, in gentle terms showed that bad and unfavourable signs were always prognosticated to Crassus by the victims.", "808": "But Crassus paid no attention to them, nor to those who advised anything else except to move on.", "809": "XIX.", "810": "But Crassus was in no small degree encouraged by Artabazes t the king of the Armenians, who came to the camp with six thousand horsemen.", "811": "These were said to be the guards and attendants of the king;", "812": "and he promised ten thousand men clothed in mail and thirty thousand infantry, who were to be maintained at his own cost.", "813": "He attempted to persuade Crassus to invade Parthia through Armenia;", "814": "for, he said, the army would not only have abundance of provision in its march through the country by reason of him supplying them, but would also advance safely, having in their front many mountains and con­ tinuous hills, and ground unfavourable for cavalry, in which alone lay the strength of the Parthians.", "815": "Crassus was well enough satisfied with the zeal of the king and the splendour of the proffered aid;", "816": "but he said he would march through Mesopotamia, where he had loft many brave Romans;", "817": "upon this the Armenian went away.", "818": "As Crassus was taking his army over at the Zeugma,* many extraordinary claps of thunder broke around, and many flashes of lightning came right in front of the army;", "819": "and a wind, mingled with cloud and hurricane,t falling on the raft, broke up and crushed to pieces a large part of it.", "820": "The spot also, on which Crassus intended to encamp, was struck with two thunderbolts.*", "821": "A horse, belonging to the general, which was caparisoned in splendid style, violently dragged along the man who held the reins, and plunging into the stream, disappeared.", "822": "It is said also, that the first eagle which was raised, turned round spontaneously.", "823": "Added to this, it happened that, as they were giving out the rations to the soldiers after crossing the river, lentils and salt were given first, which the Romans consider to be symbols of lamentation, and are accustomed to place before the dead;", "824": "and, as Crassus was haranguing the soldiers, an expression escaped him which greatly alarmed the army.", "825": "He said he would destroy the raft over the river, that no one among them might return ;", "826": "and though he ought, upon seeing the imprudence of his words, to have recalled what he had said and explained it to the soldiers, he neglected to do so, through his arrogant temper.", "827": "Finally, when he was offering the usual expiatory sacrifice, and the priest had put the viscera into his hands, he threw them away, on which, observing that the standers­ by were greatly disturbed, he said with a smile, “ Such is old age;", "828": "but no arms at least shall drop from its hands.\"XX.", "829": "After this he advanced along the river, with seven legions and nearly four thousand horsemen, and almost as many light-armed troops as horsemen.", "830": "Some of the scouts now returned from their exploration and reported that the country was clear of men, and that they had fallen in with the tracks of many horses, which indicated that they had turned about and were retreating.", "831": "This gave Crassus still better hopes, and made the soldiers com­ pletely despise the Parthians, who, as they supposed, would not come to close quarters.", "832": "However, Cassius again had some conversation with Crassus, and advised him at least to give his troops rest in some of the garrisoned cities, till he should get some certain information about the enemy;", "833": "but if he would not do this, to advance towards Seleukeia along the river.", "834": "He urged that the boats which carried the provisions would furnish them with supplies by stopping at the places of encampment, and that, by having the river as a protection against being hemmed in by the enemy, they would always be able to fight them on fair terms.", "835": "XXI.", "836": "While Crassus was considering and reflecting on these matters, there comes an Arab chieftain, Ariamnes * by name, a cunning and faithless man, and of all the misfortunes that were by chance combined to ruin the Romans the chief and crowning mischief.", "837": "Some of them who had served with Pompeius knew him as one who had received favours from Pompeius, and was supposed to be a friend to the Romans;", "838": "but he now came to Crassus with a treacherous intent, and with the privity of the royal generals, to try if he could draw him far away from the river and the foot of the hills, into a boundless plain, where he might be surrounded by the enemy;", "839": "for nothing was further from the intentions of the Parthians than to attack the Romans right in front.", "840": "Accordingly, the barbarian coming to Crassus (and he was a plausible talker), spake in high terms of Pompeius as his benefactor, and praised the force of Crassus;", "841": "but he blamed him for his tardiness, inasmuch as he was delaying and making preparation, as if he would have occasion to employ arms instead of hands and the most active feet, against an enemy who had long been trying to get together, as quick as they could, their most valuable property and their best slaves, and to move off to the Scythians or Hyrkanians.", "842": "\"And yet,\" he said, “ if you intend to fight, you ought to press on before the king recovers his courage and all his forces are concentrated;", "843": "for now Surena and Sillakes hare been thrown in your way to stand the attack, and the king is no where to be seen.”", "844": "But all this was false.", "845": "For Hyrodes had at first divided his forces into two parts, and he was himself ravaging Armenia to take vengeance on Artavasdes;", "846": "but he sent Surena against the Romans, not because he despised them, as some say, for it was not consistent for him to disdain Crassus as an antagonist, the first of the Romans, and to war against Artavasdes and take the villages of Armenia;", "847": "but it seems that be really feared the danger, and that he was on the watch to await the result, and that he put Surena in the front to try the fortune of a battle, and so to divert the enemy.", "848": "For Surena was no person of mean estate:", "849": "in wealth, birth, and consideration, he was next to the king;", "850": "but, in courage and ability, the first of the Parthians of his time;", "851": "and, besides all this, in stature and beauty of person he had no equal.", "852": "He used always to travel, when he was on his own business, with a thousand camels to carry his baggage, and he had following him two hundred carriages for concubines;", "853": "and a thousand mailed horsemen, with a larger number of light cavalry, escorted him;", "854": "and he had in all, horsemen, clients,.", "855": "and slaves, no less than ten thousand.", "856": "Now by hereditary right he had the privilege of first placing the diadem on the head of him who became king of the Parthians;", "857": "† and this very Hyrodes, who had been driven out, he restored to the Parthian empire, and took for him Seleukeia the Great, being the first to mount the wall and to put to flight with his own hand those who opposed him.", "858": "Though he was not yet thirty years of age at that time, he had the first reputation for prudent counsel and judgment, by which qualities particularly he caused the ruin of Crassus, who through his confidence and pride in the first place, and next through his fears and his misfortunes, became a most easy victim to fraud.", "859": "XXII.", "860": "The barbarian, after persuading Crassus, drew him away from the river, and led him through the plains by a track at first convenient and easy, but which soon became toilsome;", "861": "for it was succeeded by deep sand, and plains treeless and waterless, not bounded in any direction by any object that the eye could reach, so that, not only through thirst and the difficulty of the march, was the army exhausted, but even the aspect of all around caused the soldiers to despond past all comfort, seeing neither plant, nor stream, nor top of sloping hill, nor blade of grass sprouting or rising through the earth, but a bare sea-like wave of desert heaps of sand environing the army.", "862": "Now this of itself made the Romans suspect treachery.", "863": "Messengers also came from Artavasdes the Armenian, with a message that he was engaged in a heavy struggle since Hyrodes had fallen upon him, and that he could not send Crassus aid;", "864": "but he advised Crassus above all things to change his route immediately, and, by joining the Armenians, to bring the contest with Hyrodes to a close:", "865": "but, if he would not do this, he recommended him to advance, and always to avoid encamping in such places as were adapted for the movements of cavalry, and to keep close to the mountainous parts:", "866": "to all which Crassus sent no written answer, but, under the influence of passion and perverse disposition, he answered, that he had no leisure at present to deal with the Armenians, but he would come at another time to punish Artavasdes for his treachery.", "867": "Cassius was again much dissatisfied;", "868": "but he gave over advising Crassus, who was out of humour with him, though Cassius himself abused the barbarian. \"", "869": "What evil dæmon,” he said, “ vilest of men, brought you to us, and by what drugs and witchcraft have you persuaded Crassus to plunge his army into a boundless wilderness and an abyss, and to pursue a path more fit for a nomadic chief of robbers than for a Roman Imperator ?”", "870": "But the barbarian, who was a cunning fellow, with abject servility, prayed him to endure a little longer;", "871": "and, while running along with the soldiers and giving them his help, he would jeer at them in a laughing mood, and say, “ I sup­ pose you think that you are marching through Campania, and you long for the fountains, and streams, and shades, and baths, and taverns ?", "872": "Have you forgotten that you are crossing the confines of the Arabs and Assyrians ? \"", "873": "Thus the barbarian amused the Romans, and before his treachery was discovered he rode off, net, however, without the knowledge of Crassus, after making him believe that he would serve the Roman army, and put the affairs of the enemy in confusion.", "874": "XXIII.", "875": "It is said that on that day Crassus did not appear, as is the custom of Roman generals, in a purple dress, but in black, which he immediately changed on observing what he had done:", "876": "and it is also said that the men who carried the standards had much difficulty in raising some of them up, for they stuck in the ground as if they were firmly rooted there.", "877": "Crassus ridiculed all these omens, and quickened his march, urging the infantry to follow after the cavalry, till at last a few of those who had been sent forward as scouts came up, and reported that the rest of them had been cut off by the enemy, and they had escaped with difficulty, and that the Parthians were advancing with a large force, and full of confidence.", "878": "This threw all the army into confusion, and Crassus was completely confounded, and began to put his men in order hastily, and with no great presence of mind:", "879": "at first, as Cassius recommended, he extended the line of the legion­ ary soldiers as far as possible in the plain, and making it of small depth, in order to prevent the enemy from attack­ ing them on the flank, he distributed the cavalry on the wings;", "880": "but he changed his plan and, drawing his men together, formed them into a deep square of four fronts, with twelve cohorts on each side.", "881": "By the side of each cohort he placed a body of horse, in order that no part of the army might be without the aid of the cavalry, but might make the attack equally protected on all sides.", "882": "He gave one of the wings to Cassius, and the other to young Crassus;", "883": "he himself took his station in the centre.", "884": "Thus advancing, they came to a stream called Balissus,* which was neither large nor copious;", "885": "but it was a joyful sight to the soldiers in the midst of the drought and heat, and by comparison with the rest of their laborious march through a country without water.", "886": "Now most of the commanders thought that they ought to encamp and spend the night there, and learn what was the number of the enemy, and the nature and disposition of their force, and so advance against them at daybreak;", "887": "but Crassus, being prevailed upon by the importunity of his son, and the cavalry with him, to advance immediately, and engage with the enemy, gave orders for the men who required it to eat and drink in their ranks.", "888": "And before this could be well accomplished all through the ranks, he led on his men, not slowly, nor halting at intervals, as is usual when men are marching to battle, but he kept them up to a quick, unbroken pace, until the enemy were in sight, who, contrary to expectation, did not appear to the Romans to be either numerous or formidable;", "889": "for Surena disguised his numbers by placing the mass of his force behind the front ranks, and he prevented their bright armour from being seen by ordering his men to cover themselves with cloaks and skins.", "890": "But when they were near the Romans, and the standard was raised by the general, first of all they filled the plain with a deep sound and a terrific noise;", "891": "for the Parthians do not excite themselves to battle with horns or trumpets, but they have hollow instruments,!", "892": "made of skin, and furnished with brass bells, on which they strike at the same time in various parts;", "893": "and these instru­ ments produce a kind of deep and dismal sound, corn­ pounded of the roaring of wild beasts and the harsh crash of thunder;", "894": "for the Parthians rightly judge that of all the senses the hearing is that which causes the greatest alarm in the mind, and that, when this sense is affected, there is the speediest and greatest disturbance in the judgment.", "895": "XXIV.", "896": "The Romans were startled at the noise, when all of a sudden throwing off the covering of their armour the Parthians appeared, with their helmets and breast- plates flashing like flame, the Margian steel * glittering sharp and bright, and the horses equipped in mail of brass and iron;", "897": "but Surena was most conspicuous of all, being the tallest and handsomest man among them, though his personal appearance, owing to his feminine beauty, did not correspond to his reputation for courage, for he was dressed more in the Median fashion, with his face painted t and his hair parted, while the rest of the Parthians, still keeping to the Scythian fashion, wore their hair long and bushy to make themselves more formidable.", "898": "At first the Parthians intended to fall upon them with their long spears, and to drive the front ranks from their ground;", "899": "but when they saw the depth of their close-locked ranks, and the firmness and stability of the men, they drew back;", "900": "and while they seemed to be at the same time dispersing themselves and breaking their ranks, they threw themselves around the square before the Romans were aware of it.", "901": "Crassus ordered the light-armed troops to spring forward;", "902": "but they had not advanced far before they were met by a shower of arrows, which galled them, and they ran back for shelter among the legionary soldiers, and caused the beginning of disorder and alarm among the Romans, who saw the vigour with which the arrows were discharged and their strength, for they tore the armour and made their way through everything alike, whether hard or soft defence.", "903": "The Parthians, dispersing themselves at considerable distances from one another, began to dis­ charge their arrows from all points at once, not taking any very exact aim (for the close and compact ranks of the Romans did not give a man the opportunity of missing if he wished it), but sending their arrows with vigorous and forcible effect from bows which were strong and large, and, owing to their great degree of bending, dis­ charged the missiles with violence.", "904": "Now the condition of the Romans was pitiable from the beginning:", "905": "for, if they kept their position, they were exposed to be wounded, and if they attempted to close with the enemy, they were just as far from doing the enemy any harm, and they suffered just as much;", "906": "for the Parthians while retreating * still discharged their arrows, and they do this most effec­ tually next to the Scythians:", "907": "and it is a most subtle device to make their escape from danger while they are still fighting, and to take away the disgrace of flight.", "908": "XXV.", "909": "†", "910": "The Romans endured so long as they had hopes that the Parthians would withdraw from the contest when they had discharged their arrows, or would come to close quarters;", "911": "but when they perceived that there were many camels standing there, loaded with arrows, and that the Parthians who had first shot all their arrows, turned round to the camels for a fresh supply, Crassus, seeing no end to this, began to lose heart, and he sent messengers to his son with orders to force the enemy to engage before he was surrounded, for the Parthians were mainly attacking and surrounding with their cavalry the wing commanded by young Crassus, with the view of getting in his rear.", "912": "Accordingly, the young man taking thirteen hundred horsemen,—a thou­ sand of whom he had brought from Cæsar,—and five hundred archers, and eight cohorts of the legionary soldiers, who were nearest to him, wheeled about to attack the Parthians.", "913": "But the Parthians, who were manoeuvring about Crassus, either because they fell in with some marshes,.", "914": "as some say, or because it was their design to attack Crassus when they had drawn him as far as they could from his father, turned round and fled.", "915": "On this Crassus, calling out that the Parthians did not stand their ground, advanced with Censorinus and Mega­ bacchus,t of whom Megabacchus was distinguished for courage and strength, and Censorinus ‡ was a senator and a powerful speaker, both of them companions of Crassus, and about the same age.", "916": "The cavalry pursued the enemy, nor did the infantry allow themselves to be left behind, being full of alacrity and hope of victory;", "917": "for they thought that they were victorious and in pursuit:", "918": "but they had not gone far before they perceived the stratagem;", "919": "for the Parthians, who were supposed to be flying, began to face about, and others, in greater numbers, joined them.", "920": "Upon this the Romans halted, thinking that the enemy would come to close quarters with them, as they were only few in number.", "921": "But the Parthians placing their mailed horsemen in the front, to oppose the Romans, rode about them with the rest of the cavalry dispersed, and, by trampling the ground, they raised from the bottom heaps of sand, which threw up such an immense cloud of dust that the Romans could neither see clearly nor speak;", "922": "and, being driven into a narrow compass, and falling one on another, they were wounded and died no easy nor yet a speedy death, for tortured with violent convulsions and pain, and writhing with the arrows in them, they broke them in the wounds, and, by trying to pull out by force the barbed points, which had pierced through their veins and nerves, they increased the evil by breaking the arrows, and thus injured themselves.", "923": "Many thus fell, and the survivors also were unable to fight;", "924": "for, when Publius encouraged them to attack the mailed horsemen, they showed him that their hands were nailed to their shields, and their feet fastened right through to the ground, so that they were unable either to fly or to defend themselves.", "925": "However, Publius cheering the cavalry, made a vigorous attack with them, and closed with the enemy;", "926": "but the Romans were under a disadvan­ tage, both as to attack and defence, striking with small and feeble spears against breast-plates of raw hide and iron, and receiving the blows of long spears on the lightly- equipped and bare bodies of the Gauls, for Orassus trusted most to them, and with them indeed he did wonderful feats;", "927": "for the Gauls, laying hold of the long spears, and closing with the Parthians, pushed them from their horses, the men, owing to the weight of their armour, being unable to stir themselves;", "928": "and many of the Gauls, quit­ ting their own horses, and slipping under those of the enemy, wounded them in the belly, and the horses spring­ ing up through pain, and, at the same time, trampling on their riders and the enemy, fell dead.", "929": "The Gauls were most oppressed by the heat and thirst, being unaccustomed to both, and they had lost most of their horses by driving them against the long spears.", "930": "They were, therefore, com­ pelled to retreat to the legionary soldiers, taking with them Publius, who was badly wounded.", "931": "Seeing a sandy eminence near, they retreated to it, and fastened their horses in the middle, and closing in their front by close­ locking their shields, they thought they could thus more easily repel the enemy:", "932": "but it turned out just the other way;", "933": "for, while they were on the level ground, the front ranks did, in some sort, give relief to those who were behind;", "934": "but on this spot, which raised the men one above another, by reason of the inequality of the ground, and placed every one who was in the rear above the man in front of him, there was no one who could escape, and they were all alike exposed to the missiles, lamenting their inglorious and unresisting death.", "935": "There were with Pub­ lius two Greeks, who belonged to the dwellers in those parts in Carrhæ,* Hieronymus and Nikomachus, both of whom attempted to persuade Publius to retire with them, and to make his escape to Ichnæ,† a city which had taken the side of the Romans, and was not far off.", "936": "But he replied that no death was so dreadful as to make Publius, through fear of it, desert those who were losing their lives for his sake, and bade them save themselves, and taking leave of them, he allowed them to go:", "937": "himself being unable to use his hand effectually, for it was pierced by an arrow, presented his side to his shield-bearer t and ordered him to despatch him with his sword.", "938": "They say that Censorinus perished in the same way, and that Mega­ bacchus killed himself, and all the rest of the most dis­ tinguished men.", "939": "The Parthians, ascending the hill, trans- fixed with their spears the survivors;", "940": "and it is said that not more than five hundred were taken prisoners.", "941": "The Parthians, cutting off the head of Publius, immediately rode off to attack Crassus.XXVI.", "942": "With Crassus matters were thus.", "943": "After ordering his son to make an attack on the Parthians, and receiving intelligence that they were routed to a great distance, and were hotly pursued;", "944": "seeing also that the enemy in front were no longer pressing on him so much as before, for most of them had crowded to the place where young Crassus was, he recovered his courage a little, and draw­ ing his forces together, posted them on a sloping ground, being in immediate expectation that his son would return from the pursuit.", "945": "Of those who were sent by Publius to his father, when he began to be in danger, the first fell Into the hands of the enemy and were killed;", "946": "and the next, after escaping with great difficulty, reported that Publius was lost, if he did not receive speedy and sum­ cient aid from his father.", "947": "Now, Crassus was affected by many contending feelings at once, and he no longer viewed anything with sober judgment.", "948": "Distracted by alarm for the whole army, and love of his son at the same time, he was urged by one motive to go to his aid, and by the other not to go:", "949": "but finally he began to move in advance.", "950": "In the mean time the enemy came up, making themselves more formidable by their shouts and pæans, and many of the drums again bellowed around the Romans, who were in expectation of a second attack.", "951": "The Parthians, carrying the head of Publius fixed on a spear, rode close up to the Romans, and, displaying it insult­ ingly, asked who were his parents and family, for it was not decent to suppose that so noble and brave a youth was the son of so cowardly and mean a man as Crassus.", "952": "The sight of this broke and unstrung the spirit of the Romans more than all the rest of their dangers;", "953": "and it did not fill them with a spirit for revenge, as one might have supposed, but with shuddering and trembling.", "954": "Yet they say that the courage of Crassus on that dreadful occasion shone forth more brightly than ever before;", "955": "for he went along the ranks, crying out, \"Mine alone, Romans, is this misfortune:", "956": "but the great fortune and glory of Rome abide in you, if your lives are saved, un­ broken and unvanquished:", "957": "and, if you have any pity on me, who have been deprived of the noblest of sons, show this in your fury against the enemy.", "958": "Take from

whom, by being first vanquished, prevented them from vanquishing the victors;", "962": "for it is not by good fortune that the Roman state has advanced to such a height of power, but by the endurance and courage of those who meet danger.", "963": "\"XXVII.", "964": "Though Crassus used such words to encourage them, he did not see many eager to follow his exhorta­ tions :", "965": "but, by ordering them to shout the battle cry, he dis­ covered the dispirited condition of his men, so weak, and feeble, and irregular a shout they made ;", "966": "while the cries on the side of the enemy were clear and bold.", "967": "When the Parthians began the attack, their slaves and clients, riding about on the flanks of the Romans, galled them with their arrows :", "968": "and the horsemen in front, using their long spears, kept driving the Romans into a narrow com­ pass, except those who, to avoid death from the arrows, made a desperate attempt to rush upon the Parthians;", "969": "wherein they did the enemy little damage, but met with a speedy death by great and mortal wounds;", "970": "for the Par­ thians drove their spears, heavy with iron, against the horsemen;", "971": "and, from the force of the blow, they often went even through two men.", "972": "After thus fighting, as dark came on the Parthians retired, saying, that they allowed Crassus a single night to lament his son, unless he should take better counsel for himself, and choose rather to come to King Arsakes than to be taken.", "973": "The Parthians encamped near the Romans, in high hopes.", "974": "A painful night followed to the Romans, who neither paid any attention to the interment of the dead, nor care to the wounded, and those who were in the agonies of death;", "975": "but every man was severally lamenting his own fate;", "976": "for it appeared that they could not escape, either if they waited there till daybreak, or if they plunged by night into a boundless plain.", "977": "And the wounded caused a great difficulty;", "978": "for they would be an obstacle to the quickness of their flight if they attempted to carry them off:", "979": "and, if they should leave them, their shouts would betray the attempt to escape unobserved.", "980": "Though they considered Crassus to be the cause of all their sufferings, the sol­ diers still wished to see him and hear his voice.", "981": "But Crassus, wrapping himself up in his cloak, lay concealed in the dark, an example to the many of fortune's reverses, and to the wise of want of judgment and of ambition, which made him dissatisfied unless he was the first and greatest among so many thousands, and think that he lacked everything because he was judged to be inferior to two men only.", "982": "However, Octavius the legate, and Cassius, endeavoured to rouse and comfort him;", "983": "but, finding that he had entirely given himself up to despair, they called together the centurions and tribunes, and, after deliberating, they resolved not to stay on the ground, and they made an attempt at first to put the army in motion without the sound of the trumpet, and in silence.", "984": "But when the soldiers who were disabled, per­ ceived that they were going to be deserted, terrible dis­ order and confusion, mingled with groans and shouts, filled the camp;", "985": "and this was followed by disorder and panic as they began to advance,

conveyed to Coponius was some ad van tage to Crassus;", "991": "for Coponius concluded that this hasty and confused message indicated that he who brought it had no good news to report:", "992": "and, accordingly, he imme­ diately ordered the soldiers to arm;", "993": "and, as soon as he learned that Crassus was on his march, he went out to meet him, and, taking charge of him and his army, con­ ducted them into the city.", "994": "XXVIII.", "995": "Though the Parthians during the night disco­ vered that the Romans were making their escape, they did not pursue, but at daybreak they came upon

plete cohorts, while it was still dark, under the command of Varguntinus the legate, got separated from the rest and lost their way, and, being surrounded by the Par­ thians on an eminence, they fought till they were all killed, with the exception of twenty men.", "998": "The Par­ thians, admiring the courage of these twenty men, who were endeavouring to push through them with their bare swords, made way and allowed them a passage through their ranks, and to march slowly to Carrhæ.", "999": "A false report reached Surena, that Crassus and all the men of rank had made their escape, and that those who had fled to Carrhæ were a mingled rabble not worth notice.", "1000": "Thinking, then, that he had lost the end of his victory, but being still doubtful and wishing to know the truth, in order that he might either stay there and besiege the town, or leave the people of Carrhæ behind and pursue Crassus, he sends one of the men with him, who could speak both languages, with instructions to approach the walls, and in the Roman language to call out for Crassus himself or Cassius, and to say that Surena wished to have a conference with them.", "1001": "The man did as he was ordered;", "1002": "and when it was reported to Crassus, he ac­ cepted the invitation, and soon after there came from the barbarians some Arabs who well knew Crassus and Cassius by sight, having been in the camp before the battle.", "1003": "The Arabs, observing Cassius on the wall, said that Surena proposed a truce, and offered, if they would become friends to the king, to let them go safe, if they would leave Mesopotamia;", "1004": "for he considered this pro­ posal advantageous to both sides, rather than to let matters come to extremities.", "1005": "Cassius accepted the pro­ posal, and asked for a place and time to be fixed where Surena and Crassus should meet:", "1006": "the men replied that this should be done, and rode off.", "1007": "XXIX.", "1008": "Now Surena was delighted at the Romans being besieged, and at daybreak he led the Parthians against the city, who, with many insulting expressions, bade the Romans, if they wished to have a truce, deliver up to them Crassus and Cassius * in chains.", "1009": "The Romans were vexed at being deceived;", "1010": "and, telling Crassus to give up all hopes of aid from the Armenians as too remote and groundless, they prepared to make their escape by stealth;", "1011": "and none of the people of Carrhæ were to know this before the time came.", "1012": "But Andromachus, that most faithless wretch, heard of it from Crassus, who confided to him the secret, and also the guidance on the route.", "1013": "Accordingly, all was known to the Parthians;", "1014": "for Andro­ machus reported to them every particular.", "1015": "But as it is not the custom of the Parthians to fight in the dark, and indeed they cannot easily do it, and Crassus had left the city by night, Andromachus contrived that the Parthians should not be far behind in the pursuit, by leading the Romans first by one route and then by another, till at last he brought them out of their course into deep marshes and ground full of ditches, and thus made the march diffi­ cult and circuitous to all who followed him;", "1016": "for there were some who suspected that Andromachus had no honest object in turning and twisting about, and there­ fore did not follow.", "1017": "Cassius, indeed, returned to Carrhæ;", "1018": "and when the guides, who were Arabs, advised him to wait till the moon had passed the Scorpion, he replied, \" I fear the Archer more than the Scorpion,\" and, saying this, he rode off to Syria, with five hundred horsemen.", "1019": "Others, who had faithful guides, got into a mountainous country, called Sinnaca, * and were in a safe position before daybreak:", "1020": "they were about five thousand in number, and were commanded by a brave man, Octavius.", "1021": "But day break found Crassus exposed to the treachery of Andro­ machus in the unfavourable ground and the marshes.", "1022": "Crassus had with him four cohorts of the legionary soldiers, and a very few honemen, and five lictors, with whom he got upon the reed with great difficulty just as the enemy was falling upon him;", "1023": "and now being about twelve stadia short of joining Octavius, he fled to another hill not so difficult for cavalry nor yet so strong, but one that lay below Sinnaca, and was connected with it by a long ridge, which stretched through the middle of the plain.", "1024": "His danger was apparent to Octavius, who ran before any one else with a few men, from the higher ground to aid Crassus, upon which the rest of the men, abusing themselves for cowards, rushed forward, and, falling on the enemy, and repulsing them from the hill, put Crassus in the midst of them, and threw their shields before him, proudly exclaiming that there was no Parthian missile which should strike the Imperator until all of them had fallen in defence of him.", "1025": "XXX.", "1026": "Surena observing that the spirit of the Par­ thians was somewhat dulled towards the contest, and, if the night should come on and the Romans get among the mountains, they could not by any means be overtaken, employed the following stratagem against Crassus.", "1027": "Some of the captives were let loose, who, in the Parthian camp, had heard the barbarians saying to one another, in pur­ suance of a concerted plan, that the king did not wish the war with the Romans to be carried to extremities, but desired to have their friendship again, by doing them the favour of treating Crassus kindly.", "1028": "Accordingly the bar­ barians stopped fighting;", "1029": "and Surena, with his chief officers, riding gently up to the hill, unstrung his bow, and holding out his right hand, invited Crassus to come to terms, saying, that Crassus had put the king's courage and power to the test, though the king did not wish it, and yet the king of his own free will made the Romans an offer of mercy and friendship by being ready to make a truce with them if they would retire, and by giving them the opportunity of a safe retreat.", "1030": "Upon Surena saying this the Romans eagerly accepted his proposal, and were overjoyed;", "1031": "though Crassus,, having been always over­ reached by their fraud, and considering the suddenness of the change to be inexplicable, would not listen to them and hesitated.", "1032": "But the soldiers began to call out and urge him to accept the terms, and they fell to abusing and reproaching him, for wishing to expose them to the risk of fighting with those whom he did not venture to go to a conference with, even when they laid aside their arms.", "1033": "Crassus at first attempted to prevail on them by entreaty, and he said that, if they would hold out for the rest of the day, they would be able to march by night through the rough and mountain country, and he pointed out to them the route, and entreated them not to throw away their hopes when safety was so near;", "1034": "but, as the soldiers began to be exasperated and to clatter their arms and threaten him, he was alarmed, and advanced towards Surena, after first turning round and merely saying, \"Octavius and Petronius, and you Roman officers who are here, you see that I go under compulsion, and you are witnesses that I am treated in a shameful way and am under constraint;", "1035": "but, if you get safe home, tell all the world, that Crassus lost his life through the treachery of the enemy, and was not surrendered by his fellow-citizens.", "1036": "\"XXXI.", "1037": "Yet Octavius and those about him did not stay behind, but descended the hill with Crassus.", "1038": "However, Crassus made the lictors who were following him turn back.", "1039": "The first who met them, on the part of the bar­ barians, were two Greeks of half-breed, who, leaping down from their horses, made their obeisance to Crassus, and, addressing him in the Greek language, urged him to send forward some persons, who, as they said, would see that Surena himself and those about him were advancing without armour and without their weapons.", "1040": "Crassus replied, thai if he had the least concern about his life, he should not have put himself into their hands;", "1041": "however, he sent two Roscii, brothers, to inquire upon what terms they should meet, and how many of them.", "1042": "Surena im­ mediately seized and detained the two brothers, and he himself advanced on horseback with the chief officers, and said, \" What is this ?", "1043": "the Roman Imperator on foot while we are riding!” and he ordered them to bring a horse to Crassus.", "1044": "Crassus observed that neither himself nor Surena was acting wrong in coming to the conference according to the fashion of their respective countries;", "1045": "on which Surena said that from that moment there was a truce and peace between king Hyrodes and the Romans;", "1046": "but that it was requisite to advance to the river,.", "1047": "and there have the agreement put in writing;", "1048": "\" for you Romans,\" he said, “ have not a very good memory about contracts and he held out his right hand to Crassus.", "1049": "When Crassus was going to send for a horse, Surena said there was no occasion ;", "1050": "“ for the king gives you this.\"", "1051": "At the same time a horse with golden bits stood close by Crassus, and the grooms raised him up and mounted him, and then followed, quickening the horse's pace with blows.", "1052": "Octavius first laid hold of the bridle of the horse, and, after him, Petronius, one of the tribunes, and then the rest got round the horse of Crassus, endeavouring to stop it, and dragging away those who pressed close upon Crassus on each side.", "1053": "This led to a struggle and tumult, and finally to blows ;", "1054": "Octavius drew his sword and killed the groom of one of the barbarians, and another struck Octavius from behind and killed him.", "1055": "Petronius had no weapon, and, being struck on the breast-plate, he leapt down from the horse unwounded;", "1056": "and a Parthian, named Pomaxathres, killed Crassus.*", "1057": "Some say that it was not Pomaxathres, but another, who killed Crassus, and that Pomaxathres cut off the head and right hand when Crassus was lying on the ground.", "1058": "But these are rather matters of conjecture than of certain knowledge ;", "1059": "for of those who were present some fell there fighting about Crassus, and the rest immediately fled back to the hill.", "1060": "Upon this the Parthians came and said, that Crassus had been pu­ nished as he deserved, but Surena invited the rest to come down and fear nothing:", "1061": "whereupon, some of the Romans came down and surrendered, and the rest dispersed them­ selves under cover of night, of whom a very few escaped ;", "1062": "the rest the Arabs hunted out, and put to death when they caught them.",

of the Roman prisoners who bore the greatest resemblance to Crassus, Caius Paccianus, putting on a barbarian female dress, and being instructed to answer as Crassus and Imperator to those who addressed him, was conducted, seated on a horse, and in front of him trumpeters, and some lictors rode upon camels;", "1068": "and there were purses- suspended from the fasces, and, by the side of the axes, heads of Romans newly cut off.", "1069": "Behind these followed courtesans of Seleukeia, singing girls, who chanted many obscene and ridiculous things about the effeminacy and cowardice of Crassus.", "1070": "All this was public.", "1071": "But Surena assembling the Senate of Seleukeia,t laid before them certain licen­ tious books of the Milesiaca of Aristeides,‡ and, in this matter, at least, there was no invention on his part;", "1072": "for they were found among the baggage of Rustius,§ and they gave Surena the opportunity of greatly insulting and ridiculing the Romans, because they could not, even when going to war, abstain from such things and such books.", "1073": "To the Senate of Seleukeia, however, Æsopus∥ a- peared to be a wise man, when they saw Surena with the wallet of Milesian obscenities in front of him, and drag­ ging behind him a Parthian Sybaris in so many waggons full of concubines, in a manner forming a counterpart to those vipers and skytalæ* so much talked of, by present­ ing the visible and the front parts formidable and terrific, with spears, and bows, and horses, but in the rear of the phalanx, terminating in harlots, and rattling cym-. bals, and lute-playing, and nocturnal revels with women.", "1074": "Rustius, indeed, merits blame, but the Parthians were shameless in finding fault with the Milesian stories;", "1075": "for many of the kings who have reigned over them, as Arsakidæ, have been the sons of Milesian and Ionian concubines.", "1076": "XXXIII.", "1077": "While this was going on, Hyrodes happened to have been reconciled to Artavasdes the Armenian, and had agreed to receive the sister of Artavasdes as wife to his son Pacorus:", "1078": "and there were banquets and drinking- parties between them, and representations of many Greek plays;", "1079": "for Hyrodes was not a stranger either to the Greek language or the literature of the Greeks :", "1080": "and Artavasdes used to write tragedies, and speeches, and histories, some of which are preserved.", "1081": "When the head of Crassus was brought to the door, the tables were taken away, and a tragedy actor Jason,t by name, a native of Tralles, chanted that

"1108": "but yet this method of amassing a fortune seems much the more honourable, when compared with Crassus's purchase of confiscated lands and his habit of bidding for houses that were on fire.", "1109": "Crassus too used to practise these openly, like a trade:", "1110": "while he was also accused of taking bribes for his speeches in the Senate, of defrauding the allies of Rome, of currying favour with great ladies and assisting them to shield offenders from justice.", "1111": "Nothing of this sort was ever laid to the charge of Nikias, who, however, was ridiculed for giving money to common informers because he feared their tongues.", "1112": "Yet this action of his, though it would have been a disgrace to Perikles, or Aristeides, was a necessity for Nikias, who was naturally of a timid disposition.", "1113": "Thus Lykurgus the orator excused himself when accused of having bought off some informers who threatened him. \" I am glad,\" said he, \" that after so long a public life as mine I should have been at last convicted of giving bribes rather than of receiving them.", "1114": "\"The expenditure of Nikias was all calculated to increase his popularity in the state, being devoted to offerings to the gods, gymnastic contests and public dramatic perform­ ances.", "1115": "But all the money he spent that way, and all that he possessed was but a small part of what Crassus bestowed upon a public feast at Rome for some tens of thousands of guests, whom he even maintained at his own cost for some time after.", "1116": "So true it is that wickedness and vice argue a want of due balance and proportion in a man's mind, which leads him to acquire wealth dishonestly, and then to squander it uselessly.", "1117": "II.", "1118": "So much for their riches.", "1119": "Now in their political life, Nikias never did anything bold, daring or unjust, for he was outwitted by Alkibiades, and always stood in fear of the popular assembly.", "1120": "Crassus, on the other hand, is ac­ cused of great inconsistency, in lightly changing from one party to another, and he himself never denied that he once obtained the consulship by hiring men to assassinate Cato and Domitius.", "1121": "And in the assembly held for the dividing for the provinces, many were wounded and four men slain in the Forum, while Crassus himself (which I have forgotten to mention in his Life) struck one Lucius Annalius, a speaker on the other side, so violent a blow with his fist that his face was covered with blood.", "1122": "But though Crassus was overbearing and tyrannical in his public life, yet we cannot deny that the shrinking timidity and cowardice of Nikias deserve equally severe censure;", "1123": "and it must be remembered that when Crassus was carrying matters with so high a hand, it was no Kleon or Hyperbolus that he had for an antagonist, but the great Julius Caesar himself, and Pompeius who had triumphed three several times, and that he gave way to neither of them, but became their equal in power, and even excelled Pompeius in dignity by obtaining the office of censor.", "1124": "A great politician should not try to avoid unpopularity, but to gain such power and reputation as will enable him to rise above it.", "1125": "Yet if it were true that Nikias preferred quiet and security to anything else, and that he stood in fear of Alkibiades in the assembly, of the Spartans at Pylus, and of Perdikkas in Thrace, he had every opportunity to repose himself in Athens and to “ weave the garland of a peaceful life,\" as some philosopher calls it.", "1126": "He had indeed a true and divine love of peace, and his attempt to bring the Peloponnesian war to an end, was an act of real Hellenic patriotism.", "1127": "In this respect Crassus cannot be compared with Nikias, not though he had carried the frontier of the Roman empire as far as the Caspian and the Indian seas.", "1128": "III.", "1129": "Yet a statesman, in a country which appreciates his merits, ought not when at the height of his power to make way for worthless men, and place in office those who have no claim to it, as Nikias did when he laid down his own office of commander-in-chief and gave it to Kleon, a man who possessed no qualification whatever for the post except his brazen effrontery.", "1130": "Neither can I praise Crassus for having so rashly and hurriedly brought the war with Spartacus to a crisis, although he was actuated by an honourable ambition in fearing that Pompeius would arrive and take from him the glory of having completed the war, as Mummius took from Marcellus the glory of winning Corinth.", "1131": "But on the other hand the conduct of Nikias was altogether monstrous and inexcusable.", "1132": "He did not give up his honourable post to his enemy at a time when there was hope of success and little peril.", "1133": "He saw that great danger was likely to be incurred by the general in command at Pylus, and yet he was content to place himself in safety, and let the state run the risk of ruin, by entrusting an incompetent person with the sole management of affairs.", "1134": "Yet Themistokles, rather than allow an ignorant commander to mismanage the war against Persia, bribed him to lay down his office.", "1135": "So also Cato at a most dangerous crisis became a candidate for the office of tribune of the people in order to serve his country.", "1136": "But Nikias, reserving himself to play the general at the expense of the village of Minoa, the island of Kythera, and the miserable inhabitants of Melos,* when it came to fighting the Lacedæmonians eagerly stripped off his general's cloak, and entrusted to an inexperienced and reckless man like Kleon, the conduct of an enterprise involving the safety of a large Athenian fleet and army, showing himself no less neglectful of his own honour than he was of the interests of his country.", "1137": "After this he was forced against his will into the war with Syracuse, in which he seems to have imagined that his army would capture the city by remaining before it doing nothing, and not by vigorous attacks.", "1138": "No doubt it is a great testimony to the esteem in which he was held by his countrymen, that he was always opposed to war and unwilling to act as general, and was nevertheless always forced by them to undertake that office:", "1139": "whereas Crassus, who always wished for an independent command, never obtained one except in the servile war, and then only because all the other generals, Pompeius, Metellus, and Lucullus, were absent.", "1140": "Yet at that time Crassus was at the height of his power and reputation:", "1141": "but his friends seem to have thought him, as the comic poet has it, “ Most excellent, save in the battle-field.", "1142": "”And in his case also, the Romans gained no advantage from his ambitious desire of command.", "1143": "The Athenians sent Nikias to Sicily against his will, and Crassus led the Romans to Parthia against their will.", "1144": "Nikias suffered by the actions of the Athenians, while Rome suffered by the actions of Crassus.", "1145": "IV.", "1146": "However, in their last moments we incline rather to praise Nikias than to blame Crassus.", "1147": "Nikias, a skilful and experienced commander, did not share the rash hopes of his countrymen, but never thought that Sicily could be conquered, and dissuaded them from making the attempt.", "1148": "Crassus, on the other hand, urged the Romans to undertake the war with Parthia, representing the conquest of that country as an easy operation, which he nevertheless failed to effect.", "1149": "His ambition was vast.", "1150": "Caesar had conquered the Gauls, Germans, Britons, and all the west of Europe, and Crassus wished in his turn to march eastward as far as the Indian Ocean, and to conquer all those regions of Asia which Pompeius and Lucullus, two great men and actuated by a like desire for conquest, had previously aspired to subdue.", "1151": "Yet they also met with a like opposition.", "1152": "When Pompeius was given an unlimited command in the East, the appointment was opposed by the Senate, and when Cæsar routed thirty thousand Germans, Cato proposed that he should be delivered up to the vanquished, and that thus the anger of the gods should be turned away from the city upon the author of so great a crime as he had committed by breaking his word.", "1153": "Yet the Romans slighted Cato'e proposals and held a solemn thanksgiving for fifteen days to show their joy at the news.", "1154": "How many days then must we imagine

bear prosperity with moderation;", "1288": "in the open field he was equal to any general of his time in enterprise, and as to all military matters that required stealthy manoeuvres, the taking advantage of strong posi­ tions and rapid movements, and also craft and deception, he was in the moment of need most cunning in device.", "1289": "In rewarding courage he was bountiful, and in punishing for offences he was merciful.", "1290": "And yet, in the last part of his life, his cruel and vindictive treatment of the hostages may be alleged as a proof that his temper was not naturally humane, but that he put on the appearance of mildness through calculation and as a matter of necessity, But it is my opinion that no fortune can ever change to the opposite character a virtue which is genuine and founded on principle;", "1291": "still it is not impossible that good intentions and good natural dispositions, when impaired by great misfortunest contrary to desert, may together with

struck with its unusual colour (it was completely white), and caught it.", "1299": "It happened that Sartorius was staying in those parts, and when people brought him as presents anything that they had got in hunting, or from their farms, he would readily receive it and make a liberal return to those who showed him such attentions.", "1300": "Accordingly the man brought the fawn and gave it to Sertorius, who accepted the present.", "1301": "At first he took no particular pleasure in the animal, but in course of time, when he had made it so tame and fami­ liar that it would come to him when he called it, accom­ pany him in his walks, and oared not for a crowd and all the noise of the army, by degrees he began to give the thing a supernatural character, saying that the fawn was a gift from Artemis (Diana), and he gave out as a token of this that the fawn showed him many hidden things ;", "1302": "for he knew that it is the nature of barbarians to be easily accessible to superstition.", "1303": "He also resorted to such tricks as these:", "1304": "whenever he had got secret information that the enemy had invaded any part of the country, or were attempting to draw any city away from him, he would pretend that the deer had spoken to him in his sleep, and bil him keep his troops in readiness ;", "1305": "and, on the other hand, when he heard that his generals had got a victory, he would keep the messenger concealed, and bring for­ ward the deer crowned with chaplets, as is usual on the occasion of good news, and tell his men to rejoice and sacrifice to the gods, as they would hear of some good luck.", "1306": "XII.", "1307": "By these means he tamed the people, and had them more manageable for all purposes, as they believed they were led, not by the counsels of a foreigner, but by a deity, and facts also confirmed them in this opinion, inasmuch as the power of Sertorius increased beyond all expectation;", "1308": "for with the two thousand six hundred men whom he called Romans, and four thousand Lusitanian targetiers, and seven hundred horsemen, whom he joined to a motley band of seven hundred Libyans, who crossed over with him to Lusitania, he fought with four Roman generals, who had under them one hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers, six thousand horsemen, two thousand bowmen and slingers, and cities innumerable, while he had only twenty cities in all under him.", "1309": "But though so feeble and insignificant at first, he not only subdued great nations, and took many cities, but of the generals who were opposed to him he defeated

came from Narbo,§ in Gaul, to his relief, and Pompeius Magnus || was hastily despatched from Rome with an army ;", "1313": "for Metellus was perplexed at having to deal with a daring man, who evaded all fighting in the open field, and could adapt himself to any circumstances by reason of the light and easy equipment and activity of his Iberian army ;", "1314": "he who had been dis­ ciplined in regular battles fought by men in full armour and commanded a heavy immovable mass of men, who were excellently trained to thrust against their enemies, when they came to close quarters, and to strike them down, but unable to traverse mountains, to be kept always on the alert by the continual pursuing and retreating of light active men, and to endure hunger like them, and to live under the open sky without fire or tent.", "1315": "XIII.", "1316": "Besides this,", "1317": "Metellus was now growing old, and after so many great battles was somewhat inclined to an easy and luxurious mode of life;",

escape if he had to fly, or opportunity of hemming in an enemy if he was in pursuit.", "1321": "Consequently, it happened that Metellus, being prevented from fighting, was damaged as much as men who are beaten in battle, and Sartorius by flying had all the advantage of the pursuer.", "1322": "He used to cut off the supplies of water, and check the foraging ;", "1323": "and when Metellus was advancing Sertorius would get out of his way, and when he was encamped he would not let him rest;", "1324": "when Metellus was occupied with a siege, Sertorius would all at once show himself, and put

combat, the men cried out and bid him fight, as it would be a match between a general and a general, and a Roman and a Roman ;", "1326": "and when Metellus declined, they jeered him.", "1327": "But he laughed at them, and he did right;", "1328": "for a general, as Theophrastus.", "1329": "said, should die the death of a general, not that of a common targetier.", "1330": "Metellus perceiving that the Langobritæ † assisted Sertorius in no small degree, and that their town could easily be taken, as it was ill supplied with water, for they had only one well in the city, and any one who blockaded the place would be master of the streams in the suburbs and near the walls, he advanced against the city, expecting to finish the siege in two days, as there was no water ;", "1331": "and accordingly

for each skin a considerable sum of money.", "1333": "Many Iberians and Moors volunteered for the service, and, selecting the men who were strong and light-footed, he sent them through the mountain parts, with orders, when they had delivered the skins to the people in the city, to bring out of the town all the useless people, that the water might last the longer for those who defended the place.", "1334": "When the news reached Metellus he was much annoyed, for his soldiers had already consumed their provisions;", "1335": "but he sent Aquinius,* at the head of six thousand men, to forage.", "1336": "Sertorius got notice of this, and laid an ambush on the road of three thousand men who starting up out of a bushy ravine, fell on Aquinius as he was returning.", "1337": "Sertorius

retreat amidst the jeers of the Iberians.", "1339": "XIV.", "1340": "By such acts as these Sartorius gained the admiration and love of the barbarians;", "1341": "and, by introducing among them the Roman armour, and discipline, and signals, he took away the frantic and brutal part of their courage, and transformed them from a huge band of robbers into an efficient regular army.", "1342": "Besides, he em­ ployed gold and silver unsparingly for the decoration of their helmets, and he ornamented their shields, and accustomed them to the use of flowered cloaks and tunics, and, by supplying them with money for such purposes, and entering into a kind of honourable rivalry with them, he made himself popular.", "1343": "But they were most gained by what he did for their children.", "1344": "The youths of noblest birth he collected from the several nations at Osca,f a large city, and set over them teachers of Greek and Roman learning;", "1345": "and thus he really had them as hostages under the show of educating them, as if he intended to give them a, share in the government and the administration when they attained to man's estate.", "1346": "The fathers were wonder­ fully pleased at seeing their children dressed in robes with purple borders, aud going so orderly to the schools of Sertorius, who paid for their education, and often had examinations into their proficiency, and gave rewards to the deserving, and presented them with golden ornaments for the neck, which the Romans call “ bullæ.”*", "1347": "It was an Iberian usage for those whose station was about the com­ mander to die with him when he fell in battle, which the barbarians in those parts express by a term equivalent to the Greek “ devotion.”†", "1348": "Now only a few shield-bearers and companions followed the rest of the commanders;", "1349": "but many thousands followed Sertorius, and were devoted to die with him.", "1350": "It is said that, when the army of Sertorius was routed near a certain city and the enemy was pressing on them, the Iberians, careless about them­ selves, saved Sertorius, and, raising him on their shoulders, every one vying with the rest helped him to the walls;", "1351": "and when their general was secure they then betook them­ selves to flight, each as well as he could.", "1352": "XV.", "1353": "Sertorius was not beloved by the Iberians only, but also by the soldiers of Italy, who served with him.", "1354": "When Perpenna Vento, ‡ who belonged to the same party at;", "1355": "Sertorius,had arrived in Iberia with much money and a large force, and had determined to carry on war against Metellus on his own account, his soldiers were dissatisfied, and there was much talk in the camp about Sertorius, to the great annoyance of Perpenna, who was proud of his noble family and his wealth.", "1356": "However, when the soldiers heard that Pompeius was crossing the Pyrenees, taking their arms and pulling up the standards, they assailed Perpenna with loud cries, and bade him lead them to Sertorius;", "1357": "if he did not, they threatened to leave him, and go of themselves to a man who was able to take care of himself and others too.", "1358": "Perpenna yielded, and led them to join the troops of Sertorius, to the number of fifty-three cohorts.", "1359": "XVI.", "1360": "All the nations within the Iber river.", "1361": "were now joining Sertorius at once, and he was powerful in numbers;", "1362": "for they were continually flocking and crowding to him from all quarters.", "1363": "But he was troubled by the loose discipline and self-confidence of the barbarians, who called on him to attack the enemy, and were impatient of delay, and he attempted to pacify them with reasons.", "1364": "Seeing, however, that they were discontented, and were unwisely pressing him with their demands, he let them have their way, and winked at their engaging with the enemy, in so far as not to be completely crushed, but to get some hard knocks, which he hoped would render them more tractable for the future.", "1365": "Things turning out as he expected, Sertorius came to their aid when they were flying, and brought them back safe to the camp.", "1366": "However, as he wished also to cheer their spirits, a few days after this adventure he had all the army assembled, and introduced before them two horses,† one very weak and rather old, the other of a large size and strong, with a tail remarkable for the thickness and beauty of the hair.", "1367": "There stood by the side of the weak horse a tall strong man, and by the side of the strong horse a little man of mean appearance.", "1368": "On a signal given to them, the strong man began to pull the tail of the horse with all his might towards him, as if he would tear it off;", "1369": "the weak man began to pluck out the hairs from the tail of the strong horse one by one.", "1370": "Now the strong man, after no small labour to himself to no purpose, and causing much mirth to the spectators, at last gave up ;", "1371": "but the weak man in a trice, and with no trouble, bared the tail of all its hairs.", "1372": "On which Sertorius getting up, said, “ You see, fellow allies, that perseverance will do more than strength, and that many things which cannot be compassed all at once, yield to continued efforts;", "1373": "for endurance is invincible, and it is thus that time in its course assails and vanquishes every power, being a favour­ able helper to those who with consideration watch the opportunities that it offers, but the greatest of enemies to those who hurry out of season.\"", "1374": "By contriving from time to time such means as these for pacifying the barbarians, he managed his opportunities as he chose.", "1375": "XVII.", "1376": "His adventure with the people called Charicatani* was not less admired than any of his military exploits", "1377": "The Charicatani are a people who live beyond the river Tagonius:", "1378": "they do not dwell in cities or villages;", "1379": "but there is a large lofty hill, which contains caves and hollows in the rocks, looking to the north.", "1380": "The whole of the country at the foot of the hill consists of a clayey mud and of light earth, easily broken in pieces, which is not strong enough to bear a man's tread;", "1381": "and if it is only slightly touched will spread all about, like unslaked lime or ashes.", "1382": "Whenever the barbarians through fear of war hid them­ selves in their caves, and, collecting all their plunder there kept quiet, they could not be taken by any force;", "1383": "and now, seeing that Sertorius had retired before Metellus, and had encamped near the hill, they despised him as being beaten, on which Sertorius, whether in passion or not wishing to appear to be flying from the enemy, at daybreak rode up to the place and examined it.", "1384": "But he found the mountain unassailable on all sides ;", "1385": "and while he was perplexing himself to no purpose and uttering idle threats, he saw a great quantity of dust from this light earth carried by the wind against the barbarians;", "1386": "for the caves are turned, as I have said, to the north, and the wind which blows from that quarter (some call it “ caecias \") prevails most, and is the strongest of all the winds in those parts, being generated in wet plains and snow-covered mountains;", "1387": "and at that time particularly, it being the height of summer, it was strong, and maintained by the melting of the ice in the sub-arctic regions, and it blew most pleasantly both on the barbarians and their flocks, and refreshed them.", "1388": "Now, Sertorius, thinking on all these things, and also getting information from the country people, ordered his soldiers to take up some of the light ashy earth, and bringing it right opposite to the hill to make a heap of it there;", "1389": "which the barbarians thought to be intended as a mound for the purpose of getting at them, and they mocked him.", "1390": "Sertorius kept his soldiers thus employed till night­ fall, when he led them away.", "1391": "At daybreak a gentle breeze at first began to blow, which stirred up the lightest part of the earth that had been heaped, together, and scattered it about like chaff;", "1392": "but when the caecias began to blow strong, as the sun got higher, and the hills were all covered with dust, the soldiers got on the heap of earth and stirred it up to the bottom, and broke the clods;", "1393": "and some also rode their horses up and down through the earth, kicking up the light particles and raising them so as to be caught by the wind, which receiving all the earth that was broken and stirred up, drove it against the dwellings of the barbarians, whose doors were open to the caecias.", "1394": "The barbarians, having only the single opening to breathe through, upon which the wind fell, had their vision quickly obscured, and they were speedily overpowered by a suffocating difficulty of breathing, by reason of respiring a thick atmosphere filled with dust.", "1395": "Accordingly, after holding out with difficulty for two days, they surrendered on the third, and thus added not so much to the power as to the reputation of Sertorius, who had taken by stratagem a place that was impregnable to arms.", "1396": "XVIII.", "1397": "Now, as long as Sertorius had to oppose Me­ tellus, he was generally considered to owe his success to the old age and natural tardiness of Metellus, who was no match for a daring man, at the head of a force more like a band of robbers than a regular army.", "1398": "But when Pom­ peius had crossed the Pyrenees, and Sertorius had met him in the field, and he and Pompeius had mutually offered one another every opportunity for a display of generalship, and Sertorius had the advantage in stratagem and caution, his fame was noised abroad as far as Rome, and he was considered the most able general of his age in the conduct of a war:", "1399": "for the reputation of Pompeius was no small one;", "1400": "but at that time particularly he was enjoying the highest repute by reason of his distinguished exploits in the cause of Sulla, for which Bulla gave him the name of Magnus, which means Great, and Pompeius obtained triumphal honours before he had a beard.", "1401": "All this made many of the cities which were subject to Sertorius turn their eyes towards Pompeius, and feel inclined to pass over to him;", "1402": "but their intentions were checked by the loss at Lauron,* which happened contrary to all expectation.", "1403": "Sertorius was besieging this town, when Pompeius came with all his force to relieve it.", "1404": "There was a hill, well situated for enabling an enemy to act against the place, which Ser­ torius made an effort to seize, and Pompeius to prevent its being occupied.", "1405": "Sertorius succeeded in getting possession of the hill, on which Pompeius made his troops stop, and was well pleased at what had happened, thinking that Sertorius was hemmed in between the city and his ow­ army;", "1406": "and he sent a message to the people in Lauron, bidding them be of good cheer, and to keep to their walls and look on while Sertorius was blockaded.", "1407": "Sertorius smiled when he heard of this, and said he would teach Sulla's pupil (for so he contemptuously called Pompeius) that a general should look behind him rather than before.", "1408": "As he said this he pointed out to his men, who were thus blockaded, that there were six thousand heavy armed soldiers, whom he had left in the encampment, which he had quitted before he seized the hill, in order that if Pompeius should turn against them, the soldiers in camp might attack him in the rear.", "1409": "And Pompeius too saw this when it was too late, and he did not venture to attack Sertorius for fear of being surrounded;", "1410": "and though he could not for shame leave the citizens in their danger, he was obliged to sit there and see them ruined before his eyes ;", "1411": "for the barbarians in despair surrendered.", "1412": "Sartorius spared their lives, and let them all go;", "1413": "but he burnt the city, not for revenge or because he was cruel, for of all commanders Sertorius appears to have least given way to passion ;", "1414": "but he did it to shame and humble the admirers of Pompeius, and that the barbarians might say that Pompeius did not help his allies, though he was close at hand, and all but warmed with the flames of their city.", "1415": "XIX.", "1416": "However, Sertorius was now sustaining several defeats, though he always saved himself and those with him from defeat;", "1417": "but his losses were occasioned by the other generals.", "1418": "Yet he gained more credit from the means by which he repaired his defeats than the generals on the other side who won the victories;", "1419": "an instance of which occurred in the battle against Pompeius, on the Sucro, and another in the battle near Tuttia,* against Pompeius* and Metellus together.", "1420": "Now the battle on the Sucro is said to have been brought about by the eagerness of Pompeius, who wished Metellus to have no share in the victory.", "1421": "Sertorius, on his part, also wished to engage Pompeius before Metellus arrived;", "1422": "and, drawing out his forces when the evening was coming on, he commenced the battle, thinking that, as the enemy were strangers and unacquainted with the ground, the darkness would be a disadvantage to them, whether they were the pursued or the pursuers.", "1423": "When the battle began, it happened that Sertorius was not engaged with Pompeius, but with Afranius at first, who commanded the left wing of tho enemy, while Sertorius commanded his own right.", "1424": "But, hearing that those who were opposed to Pompeius were giving way before his attack and being defeated, Sertorius left the right wing to the care of other generals, and has­ tened to the support of the wing that was giving way.", "1425": "Bringing together the soldiers who were already flying, and those who were still keeping their ranks, he encouraged them and made a fresh charge upon Pompeius, who was pur­ suing, and put his men to the rout;", "1426": "on which occasion Pompeius himself nearly lost his life, and had a wonderful escape after being wounded.", "1427": "The Libyans of Sertorius seized the horse of Pompeius, which was decked with golden ornaments and loaded with trappings;", "1428": "but while they were dividing the booty and quarrelling about it, they neglected the pursuit.", "1429": "As soon as Sertorius quitted the right wing to relieve the other part of the army, Afranius t put to flight his opponents and drove them to their camp, which be entered with the captives, it being now dark, and began to plunder, knowing nothing of the defeat of Pompeius, and being unable to stop his soldiers from seizing the booty.", "1430": "In the mean time Sertorius returned, after defeating the enemy who were opposed to him, and falling on the soldiers of Afranius, who were all in dis­ order and consequently panic-stricken, he slaughtered many of them.", "1431": "In the morning he again armed his troops and came out to fight;", "1432": "but observing that Metellus was near, he broke up his order of battle, and marched off sayng, “ If that old woman kad not come up, I would have given this boy a good drubbing by way of lesson, and have sent him back to Rome.\"XX.", "1433": "About this time Sertorius was much dispirited, because that deer * of his could nowhere be found ;", "1434": "for he was thus deprived of a great means of cheering the barbarians, who then particularly required consolation.", "1435": "It hippend that some men, who were rambling about at nigh for other purposes, fell in with the deer and caught it, for they knew it by the colour.", "1436": "Sertorius hearing of this, promised to give them a large sum of money if they woull mention it to nobody ;", "1437": "and, concealing the deer for sevenl days, he came forward with a joyful countenance to the tribunal, and told the barbarian chiefs that the deity prognosticated to him in his sleep some great good fortuie.", "1438": "He then ascended the tribunal, and transacted busiress with those who applied to him.", "1439": "The deer being let lose by those who had charge of it close by, and, seeing Sertorius, bounded joyfully up to the tribunal, and, standing by him, placed its head on his knees, and toucled his right hand with its mouth, having been accustomed to do this before.", "1440": "Sertorius cordially returned the caresses of the animal, and even shed tears.", "1441": "The spectators were at first surprised;", "1442": "then clapping their hands and shouting, they conducted Sertorius to his residence, considering him to be a man superior to other mortals an!", "1443": "beloved by the gods ;", "1444": "and they were full of good hopesXXI.", "1445": "Sertorius, who had reduced the enemy to tie greatest straits in the plains about Seguntum,* was con­ polled to fight a battle with them when they came dovn to plunder and forage.", "1446": "The battle was well contested on both sides.", "1447": "Memmius, one of the most skilful of the can­ manders under Pompeius, fell in the thick of the fight, and Sertorius, who was victorious, and making a great slaughter of those who opposed him, attempted to get at Metellus, who stood his ground with a resolution above his years, and, while fighting bravely, was struck by a spear.", "1448": "This made the Romans who were on the spot, as well as those who heard of it, ashamed to desert their leader, and inspired them with courage against their enemies.", "1449": "After covering Metellus with their shields and rescuing him from danger, by making a vigorous onset they drove the Iberians from their ground;", "1450": "an, as the victory now changed sides, Sertorius, with a view of securing a safe retreat for his men, and contriving the means of getting together another army without any interruption, retired to a strong city in the mountains and began to repair the walls and strengthen the gates, though his object was anything rather than to stand a siege:", "1451": "but his design was to deceive the enemy, in which he succeeded;", "1452": "for they sat down before the place, thinking they should take it without difficulty, and in the mean time they let the defeated barbarians escape, and allowed Sertorius to collect a fresh army.", "1453": "It was got together by Sertorius sending officers to the cities, and giving orders that when they had collected a good body of men, they should dispatch a messenger to him.", "1454": "When the mes­ senger came, he broke through the besiegers without any difficulty and joined his troops;", "1455": "and now he again advanced against the enemy in great force, and began to cut off their land supplies by ambuscades, and hemming them in, and showing himself at every point, inasmuch as his attacks were made with great expedition;", "1456": "and he cut off all their maritime supplies by occupying the coast with his piratical vessels, so that the generals opposed to him were obliged to separate, one to march off into Gaul, and Pompeius to winter among the Vaccæi,* in great distress for want of supplies, and to write to the Senate, that he would lead his army out of Iberia, if they did not send him money, for he had spent all his own in defence of Italy.", "1457": "There was great talk in Rome that Sertorius would come to Italy before Pompeius;", "1458": "t to such difficulties did Sertorius, by his military abilities, reduce the first and ablest of the generals of that age.", "1459": "XXII.", "1460": "Metellus also showed, that he feared the man and thought he was powerful;", "1461": "for he made proclamation, that it any Roman killed Sertorius he would give him a hundred talents of silver and twenty thousand jugera of land;", "1462": "and, if he was an exile, permission to return to Rome:", "1463": "thus declaring that he despaired of being able to defeat Sertorius in the field, and therefore would purchase his life by treachery.", "1464": "Besides this, Metellus was so elated by a victory which on one occasion he gained over Sertorius, and so well pleased with his success, that he was proclaimed Imperator,* and the cities received him in his visits to them with sacrifices and altars.", "1465": "It is also said, that he allowed chaplets to be placed on his head, and accepted invitations to sumptuous feasts, at which he wore a triumphal vest;", "1466": "and Victories,t which were con­ trived to move by machinery, descended and distributed golden trophies and crowns, and companies of youths and women sang epinician hymns in honour of him.", "1467": "For this he was with good reason ridiculed, for that after calling Sertorius a runaway slave of Sulla, and a remnant of the routed party of Carbo, he was so puffed up and trans­ ported with delight because he had gained an advantage over Sertorius, who had been compelled to retire.", "1468": "But it was a proof of the magnanimous character of Sertorius, first, that he gave the name of Senate to the Senators who fled from Rome and joined him, and that he appointed quæstors and generals from among them, and arranged everything of this kind according to Roman usage;", "1469": "and next, that though he availed himself of the arms, the money and the cities of the Iberians, he never yielded to them one tittle of the Roman supremacy, but he appointed Romans to be their generals and commanders, considering that he was recovering freedom for the Romans, and was not strengthening the Iberians against the Romans;", "1470": "for Ser­ torius loved his country and had a great desire to return home.", "1471": "Notwithstanding this, in his reverses he behaved like a brave man, and never humbled himself before his enemies ;", "1472": "and after his victories he would send to Metellus and to Pompeius, and declare that he was ready to lay down his arms and to live in a private station, if he might be allowed to return home ;", "1473": "for, he said, he would rathei bo the obscurest citizen in Rome than an exile from his country, though he were proclaimed supreme ruler of all other countries in the world.", "1474": "It is said, that he longed to return home chiefly on account of his mother, who brought him up after his fathers death, and to whom he was com­ pletely devoted.", "1475": "At the time when his friends in Iberia invited him to take the command, he heard of the death of his mother, and he was near dying of grief.", "1476": "He lay in his tent for seven days without giving the watchword, or being seen by any of his friends;", "1477": "and it was with diffi­ culty that his fellow-generals and those of like rank with himself, who had assembled about his tent, prevailed on him to come out to the soldiers, and take a share in the administration of affairs, which were going on well.", "1478": "This made many people think that Sertorius was naturally a man of mild temper, and well disposed to a quiet life;", "1479": "but that, owing to uncontrollable causes, and contrary to his wishes, he entered on the career of a commander, and then, when he could not ensure his safety, and was driven to arms by his enemies, he had recourse to war as the only means by which he could protect his life.", "1480": "XXIII.", "1481": "His negociations with Mithridates also were a proof of his magnanimity;", "1482": "for now that Mithridates, rising from the fall that he had from Sulla, as it were, to a second contest, had again attacked Asia, and the fame of Sertorius was great, and had gone abroad to all parts, and those who sailed from the West had filled the Pontus with the reports about him, as if with so many foreign wares, Mithridates was moved to send an embassy to him, being urged thereto mainly by the fulsome exaggerations of his flatterers, who compared Sertorius to Hannibal and Mithridates to Pyrrhus, and said that if the Romans were attacked or both sides, they could not hold out against such great abilities and powers combined, when the most expert of commanders had joined the greatest of kings.", "1483": "Accordingly, Mithridates sent ambassadors to Iberia, with letters to Sertorius and proposals.", "1484": "On his part he offered to supply money and ships for the war, and he asked from Sertorius a confirmation of his title to the whole of Asia, which he had given up to the Romans pursuant to the treaty made with Sulla.", "1485": "Sertorius assembled a council, which he called a senate, and all the members advised to accept the king's proposal, and to be well content with it;", "1486": "they said the king only asked of them a name and an empty answer touching things that were not in their power, in return for which they were to receive what they happened to stand most in need of.", "1487": "But Sertorius would not listen to this;", "1488": "he said he did not grudge Mithridates having Bithynia and Cappadocia;", "1489": "these were nations that were accustomed to a king, and the Romans had nothing to do with them;", "1490": "but the province which belonged to the Romans by the justest of titles, which Mithridates took from them and kept, from which, after a contest, he was driven out by Fimbria, and which he gave up by treaty with Sulla,*—that province he would never allow to fall again into the power of Mithridates;", "1491": "for it was fit that the Roman state should be extended by his success, not that his success should be owing to her humiliation.", "1492": "To a generous mind, victory by honest means was a thing to desire, but life itself was not worth having with dis­ honour.", "1493": "XXIV.", "1494": "When this was reported to Mithridates he was amazed, and it is said that he remarked to his friends­ what terms, then, will Sertorius impose when he is seated on the Palatium,† if now, when he is driven to the shores of the Atlantic, he fixes limits to our kingdom, and threatens us with war if we make any attempt upon Asia ?", "1495": "However, a treaty was made, and ratified by oath, on the following terms:", "1496": "Mithridatest was to have Cappadocia and Bithynia, and Sertorius was to send him a general and soldiers;", "1497": "and Sertorius was to receive from Mithridates three thousand talents, and forty ships.", "1498": "Sertorius sent as general to Asia Marcus Marius, one of the Senators who had fled to him;", "1499": "and Mithridates, after assisting him to take some of the Asiatic cities,§ followed Marius as he entered them with the fasces and axes, voluntarily taking the second place and the character of an inferior.", "1500": "Marius restored some of the cities to liberty, and he wrote to others to announce to them their freedom from taxation through the power of Sertorius;", "1501": "so that Asia, which was much troubled by the Publicani,* and oppressed by the rapacity and insolence of the soldiers quartered there, was again raised on the wings of hope, and longed for the expected change of masters.", "1502": "XXV.", "1503": "In Iberia, the senators and nobles about Ser­ torius, as soon as they were put into a condition to hope that they were a match for the opposite party, and their fears were over, began to feel envious, and had a foolish jealousy of the power of Sertorius.", "1504": "Perpenna encouraged this feeling, being urged by the empty pride of high birth to aspire to the supreme command, and he secretly held treasonable language to those who were favourable to his designs. “", "1505": "What evil dæmon,” he would say, \" has got hold of us, and carried us from bad to worse—us who did not brook to stay at home and do the bidding of Sulla, though in a manner he was lord of all the earth and sea at once, but coming here with ill luck, in order to live free, have voluntarily become slaves by making ourselves the guards of Sertorius in his exile, and while we are called a senate, a name jeered at by all who hear it, we submit to insults, and orders, and sufferings as great as the Iberians and Lusitanians endure.\"", "1506": "Their minds filled with such sug­ gestions as these, the majority did not, indeed, openly desert Sertorius, for they feared his power, but they secretly damaged all his measures, and they oppressed the barbarians by severe treatment and exactions, on the pre­ text that it was by the order of Sertorius.", "1507": "This caused revolts and disturbances in the cities;", "1508": "and those who were sent to settle and pacify these outbreaks returned after causing more wars, and increasing the existing in­ subordination ;", "1509": "so that Sertorius, contrary to his former moderation and mildness, did a grievous wrong to the sons of the Iberians, who were educating at Osca,* by putting some to death, and selling others as slaves.", "1510": "XXVI.", "1511": "Now Perpenna, having got several to join him in his conspiracy, gained over Manlius, one of those who were in command.",

Perpenna and Graecinus,t and some others whom Aufidius knew to be in the conspiracy, he was confounded, yet he made light of the story to the youth, and told him to despise Manlius for a lying braggart;", "1517": "but he went to Perpenna, and, showing him the critical state of affairs, and the danger, urged him to the deed.", "1518": "The conspirators followed his advice, and having engaged a man to bring letters they introduced him to Sertorius.", "1519": "The letters gave information of a victory gained by one of the generals, and a great slaughter of the enemy.", "1520": "Upon this Sertorius was overjoyed, and offered a sacrifice for the happy tidings ;", "1521": "and Perpenna proposed to feast him and his friends (and they were of the number of the conspirators), and after much entreaty he prevailed on Sartorius to come.", "1522": "Now when­ ever Sertorius was present, an entertainment was conducted with great propriety and decorum;", "1523": "for he would not tolerate any indecent act or expression, but accustomed his companions to enjoy mirth and merriment with orderly behaviour, and without any excess;", "1524": "but, on this occasion, in the midst of the feast, seeking to begin a quarrel, they openly used obscene language, and, pretending to be drunk, behaved indecently, for the purpose of irritating Sertorius.", "1525": "Whether it was that he was vexed at this disorderly con­ duct, or had now suspected their design by the flagging of the conversation* and their unusual contemptuous manner towards him, he changed his posture on the couch by throwing himself on his back, as if he was paying no attention to them, and not listening.", "1526": "On Perpenna taking a cup of wine, and in the middle of the draught throwing it from him and so making a noise, which was the signal agreed on, Antonius, who lay next to Sertorius, struck him with his sword.", "1527": "On receiving the blow, Sertorius turned himself, and at the same time attempted to rise, but Antonius, throwing himself upon his chest, held his hands, and he was despatched by blows from many of the conspirators, without even making any resistance.", "1528": "XXVII.*", "1529": "Now

"1531": "After em­ ploying the means that Sertorius had got together, just so far as to disgrace himself, and show that he was not suited either to command or to obey, he engaged with Pompeius.", "1532": "Being quickly crushed by him and taken prisoner, he did not behave himself even in this extremity as a commander should do;", "1533": "but having got possession of the papers of Ser­ torius, he offered to Pompeius to show him autograph letters from consular men and persons of the highest influence at Rome, in which Sertorius was invited to Italy, and was assured that there were many who were desirous to change the present settlement of affairs, and to alter the constitution.", "1534": "Now Pompeius, by behaving on this oc­ casion, not like a young man, but one whose understanding was well formed and disciplined, relieved Rome from great dangers and revolutions.", "1535": "He got together all those letters, and all the papers of Sertorius, and burnt them, without either reading them himself or letting any one else read them ;", "1536": "and he immediately put Perpenna to death, through fear that there might be defection and disturbance if the names were communicated to others.", "1537": "Of the fellow-con­ spirators of Perpenna, some were brought to Pompeius, and put to death;", "1538": "and others, who fled to Libya, were pierced by the Moorish spears.", "1539": "Not one escaped, except Aufidius, the rival of Manlius, and this happened, either because he escaped notice, or nobody took any trouble about him, and he lived to old age, in some barbarian village, in poverty and contempt.", "1540": "THE historian Douris tells us that the lather of Eumenes of Kardia was so poor that ho was obliged to act as a waggoner;", "1541": "yet he gave his son a liberal education both in mental and bodily exercises.", "1542": "While Eumenes was yet a lad, Philip, King of Macedon, happened to come to the city of Kardia, where he amused his leisure time by witnessing the gymnastic exercises of the young men.", "1543": "Perceiving that Eumenes was one of the most athletic, and that he was a manly and clever boy, Philip took him away and attached him to his own person.", "1544": "A more probable story is that Philip gave the boy this advance­ ment out of regard for his father, whose friend and guest he was.", "1545": "After the death of Philip, Eumenes continued in the service of his son Alexander, and was thought to be as wise and as faithful as any of that prince's servants.", "1546": "His position was nominally that of chief secretary, but he was treated with as much honour and respect as the king's most intimate friends, and was entrusted with an inde­ pendent command during the Indian campaign.", "1547": "On the death of Hephæstion, Perdikkas was appointed to succeed him, and Eumenes was given the post of commander of the cavalry, vacated by Perdikkas.", "1548": "Upon this Neoptolemus, the chief of the men-at-arms, sneered at Eumenes, saying that he himself bore a spear and shield in Alexander's service, but that Eumenes bore a pen and writing-tablets.", "1549": "However the Macedonian chiefs laughed him to scorn, as they well knew the worth of Eumenes, and that he was so highly esteemed that Alexander himself had done him the honour to make him his kinsman by marriage.", "1550": "He bestowed upon him Barsine, the sister of that daughter of Artabazus by whom he himself had a son named Herakles, and gave her other sister Apame to Ptolemaeus at the time when he distributed the other Persian ladies among his followers.", "1551": "II.", "1552": "Eumenes however was often in danger of incurring the displeasure of Alexander, because of his favourite Hephaestion.", "1553": "On one occasion a house was assigned to Evion, Hephæstion's flute-player, which the servants of Eumenes had previously claimed for their mastery lodging.", "1554": "Hearing this, Eumenes went to Alexander in a rage, and complained that it was better to be a flute- player than a soldier.", "1555": "At first Alexander agreed with him, and blamed Hephaestion for his conduct.", "1556": "But afterwards he changed his mind, and attributed what Eumenes had done to a desire to insult himself, rather than to vindicate his rights against Hephæstion.", "1557": "At another time, when Alexander was about to despatch Nearchus with a fleet to explore the Atlantic, he asked his friends to subscribe some money, as he had none in his treasury.", "1558": "The sum for which Eumenes was asked was three hundred talents, of which he only paid one hundred, and said that he had had great difficulty in collecting even that amount.", "1559": "Alexander did not reproach him, nor take the money from him;", "1560": "but he ordered his slaves secretly to set the tent of Eumenes on fire, hoping when his property was brought out of it to prove him to have lied in saying that he possessed so little money.", "1561": "However the tent burned quicker than was expected, and Alexander was sorry that he had destroyed all the papers and writings which it contained.", "1562": "There was found in the ruins more than a thousand talents' worth of gold and silver, melted by the heat of the fire.", "1563": "Of this Alexander refused to take any, but sent orders to all the officers of his kingdom to replace the accounts and writings which had been destroyed.", "1564": "Once again too he quarrelled with Hephaestion about some present to which each laid claim.", "1565": "They each abused the other roundly, but Eumenes camo off the victor.", "1566": "Shortly afterwards, however, Hephæstion died, to the great grief of Alexander, who was enraged with all those who had disliked Hephaestion when alive, and were pleased at his death.", "1567": "He regarded Eumenes with especial hatred, and frequently referred to his quarrels with Hephæstion.", "1568": "Eumenes, however, being a shrewd man, determined that what seemed likely to become his ruin should prove his salvation.", "1569": "He won Alexander's favour by inventing new and extravagant modes of showing honour to his friend, and spent money profusely in providing him with a splendid funeral.", "1570": "III.", "1571": "When Alexander himself died, and the Macedonian army quarrelled with its chiefs, he in reality espoused the cause of the latter, although he declared that he belonged to neither party, modestly observing that it was not for him, a stranger, to interfere in the quarrels of Macedonians with one another.", "1572": "In the general division of Alexander's conquests which then took place, Eumenes obtained Cappa­ docia, Paphlagonia, and the coast of the Euxine sea as far as Trapezus.*", "1573": "This country was not yet conquered by the Macedonians, but was ruled by Ariarathes, and Leonnatus and Antigonus were requested by Perdikkas to come with a largo army to put Eumenes in possession of his princi­ pality.", "1574": "Antigonus took no heed of this command, as ho was already revolving immense schemes of conquest, and beginning to despise his colleagues.", "1575": "Leonnatus, however, did begin to march an army towards Phrygia, intending to help Eumenes, but on the way he was met by Hekatæus the despot of Kardia, who besought him to assist the Mace­ donians under Antipater, who were being besieged in the city of Lamia.", "1576": "Leonnatus on hearing this became eager to cross his army over the straits into Europe;", "1577": "and conse­ quently he sent for Eumenes and reconciled him with Hekatæus.", "1578": "These two men had always been at enmity with one another on political grounds.", "1579": "Eumenes had often endeavoured to use his influence with Alexander to crush Hekataeus, and restore liberty to the oppressed citizens of Kardia, and never ceased accusing him of tyranny and injustice.", "1580": "On this occasion Eumenes refused to take part in the expedition into Europe, stating that he feared Antipater, who had always been his enemy, and who would be very likely to assassinate him to please Hekatæus.", "1581": "In answer to these objections Leonnatus un­ folded to him his secret plans.", "1582": "His march to relieve Anti­ pater was merely intended as a pretence to cover his real object, which was to attempt to make himself master of Macedonia.", "1583": "He also showed Eumenes several letters which he had received from Pella, in which Kleopatra offered to marry him if he would march thither.", "1584": "However Eumenes, either because he feared Antipater, or because he thought Leonnatus to be embarked upon a rash and crazy enterprise, left him by night, taking with him all his property.", "1585": "He was attended by three hundred horsemen, and two hundred armed slaves, and had with him treasure to the amount of five thousand talents.", "1586": "He fled at once to Perdikkas, and betrayed all Leonnatus's plans to him, by which treachery he gained great favour with Perdikkas, and soon afterwards was established in his government of Cappadocia by an army led by Perdikkas himself.", "1587": "Ariarathes was taken prisoner, the country subdued and Eumenes proclaimed satrap over it.", "1588": "He distributed the government of the various cities amongst his friends, established garrisons, courts of justice, and receivers of revenue, as an absolute ruler, without any interference from Perdikkas.", "1589": "But when Perdikkas left the country Eumenes followed him, as he did not wish to be away from the court of that prince.", "1590": "IV.", "1591": "However, Perdikkas considered that be was well able to carry out his own designs abroad, but required an active and faithful lieutenant to guard what he already possessed it homo.", "1592": "Consequently when he reached Cilicia he sent Eumenes back, nominally to his own government, but really to observe Armenia where Neoptolemns was en­ deavouring to raise a revolt.", "1593": "Eumenes had frequent interviews with this man, who was of a flighty and vain­ glorious character, and tried to restrain him from any act of open rebellion.", "1594": "Perceiving also that the Macedonian phalanx was grown very strong, and gave itself most insolent airs, he determined to raise up some counterpoise to it, in the shape of a force of cavalry.", "1595": "He set free from all taxes and state payments whatever those men of his province who were able to serve as horse soldiers, and bestowed fine horses, purchased by himself, upon their officers and those whom he especially trusted.", "1596": "He divided them into regiments, frequently bestowed upon them honours and rewards, and constantly exercised them in the performance of military manoeuvres.", "1597": "Some of the Macedonians were alarmed, but others were delighted to see in how short a time he had raised a force of no less than six thousand three hundred cavalry soldiers.", "1598": "V.", "1599": "When Kraterus and Antipater, having made them­ selves masters of Greece, crossed over into Asia to destroy the kingdom of Perdikkas, and were about to invade Cappadocia, Eumenes was appointed by Perdikkas, who was absent on a campaign against Ptolemy, to be com­ mander-in-chief of the forces in Cappadocia and Armenia.", "1600": "He also sent letters, ordering Neoptolemus and Alketas to place themselves under the orders of Eumenes.", "1601": "Alketas at once refused to serve under him, alleging that the Macedonian troops which he commanded would be ashamed to fight against Antipater, and were willing to receive Kraterus as their king.", "1602": "Neoptolemus also no longer con­ cealed the treachery which he had so long meditated, and when summoned by Eumenes to join him, answered by drawing up his men in order of battle.", "1603": "Now did Eumenes reap the fruits of his prudence and foresight;", "1604": "for though his infantry was vanquished, yet his cavalry completely overthrew Neoptolemus, and captured all his baggage.", "1605": "He also caught the phalanx of the enemy when disordered by its victory, and forced it to surrender at discretion, and swear allegiance to himself.", "1606": "Neoptolemus fled with a few followers and joined Kraterus and Antipater, by whom an embassy had been sent to Eumenes to offer him the peaceful enjoyment of his government if he would join them, and likewise a large accession of territory and force, on condition that he would cease to regard Antipater with dislike and would not become an enemy to his friend Kraterus.", "1607": "To these overtures Eumenes answered that he had long hated Antipater, and was not likely to begin to love him now, when he saw him making war against his own friends, but that he was willing to act as mediator between Kraterus and Perdikkas, if they wished to ar­ range a fair and honourable peace.", "1608": "He declared that as long as he had breath in his body he would resist all unjust schemes of spoliation, and would rather lose his life than betray the confidence bestowed upon him by Perdikka3.VL", "1609": "When Eumenes returned this answer to Antipater­ he was deliberating what was the next step to take, when - suddenly Neoptolemus arrived bringing the news of his defeat, and begging for immediate assistance.", "1610": "He wished one of the chiefs to accompany him, but especially Kraterus, declaring that he was so popular with the Macedonians that if they so much as caught sight of his broad-brimmed Macedonian hat, and heard his voice, they would go over to him in a body.", "1611": "Indeed the name of Kraterus had great influence with the Macedonians, and he was their favourite general now that Alexander was dead, for they remembered how steadfast a friend Kraterus had proved to them, and how ho had often incurred the anger of Alexander by opposing his adoption of Persian habits, and standing by his countrymen when they were in dan­ ger of being neglected and despised by a corrupt and effeminate court.", "1612": "Kraterus accordingly sent Antipater into Cilicia, and himself with the greater part of the army marched with Neoptolemus to fight Eumenes, whom he imagined he should catch unawares, engaged in feasting and celebrating his late victory.", "1613": "It did not argue any very great skill in Eumenes, that he soon became aware of the march of Kraterus to attack him;", "1614": "but to conceal his own weak points, not only from the enemy, but also from his own troops, and actually to force them to attack Kraterus without knowing against whom they fought, appears to me to have been the act of a consummate general.", "1615": "He gave out that Neoptolemus and Pigres were about to attack him a second time, with some Cappadocian and Paphlagonian cavalry.", "1616": "On the night when he in­ tended to start he fell asleep and dreamed a strange dream.", "1617": "He seemed to see two Alexanders, each at the head of a phalanx, preparing to fight one another.", "1618": "Then Athena came to help the one, and Demeter the other.", "1619": "After a hard fight, that championed by Athena was overcome, and then Demeter gathered ears of corn, and crowned the victorious phalanx with them.", "1620": "He at once conceived that this dream referred to himself because he was about to fight for a most fertile land and one that abounded in corn;", "1621": "for at that time the whole country was sown with wheat, as if it wero time of peace, and the fields promised an abundant harvest.", "1622": "He was confirmed in his idea of the meaning of his dream when he heard that the watchword of the enemy was ‘ Athena,' with the countersign ‘ Alexander.'", "1623": "Hearing this, he himself gave the word ‘ Demeter,' with the countersign ‘ Alexander,' and ordered all his soldiers to crown themselves and adorn their arms with ears of wheat.", "1624": "He was often tempted to explain to his officers who it was against whom they were about to fight;", "1625": "but in spite of the inconvenience of such a secret, he decided finally to keep it to himself.", "1626": "VII.", "1627": "He was careful not to send any Macedonians to attack Kraterus, but entrusted this duty to two divisions of cavalry, which he placed under the command respect­ ively of Pharnabazus the son of Artabazus and Phoenix of Tenedos.", "1628": "These he ordered, as soon as they saw the enemy, to charge at full speed, and not to give them time for any parley, or to send a herald;", "1629": "for he was grievously afraid that if the Macedonians recognized Kraterus they would desert to him.", "1630": "He himself formed three hundred of the best of his cavalry into a compact mass with which he proceeded towards the light, to engage the detachment under Neoptolemus.", "1631": "The main body, as soon as it had passed a small hill, came in sight of the enemy and at once charged at full gallop.", "1632": "Kraterus at this broke out into violent abuse of Neoptolemus, saying that he had been deceived by him about the Macedonians who were to have deserted.", "1633": "However, he called upon those about him to quit them like men, and advanced to meet the horsemen.", "1634": "The shock was terrible.", "1635": "Their spears were soon broken, and the fight was continued with swords.", "1636": "Kraterus proved no unworthy successor of Alexander, for he slew many and often rallied his troops, until a Thracian rode at him sideways and struck him from his horse.", "1637": "No one recog­ nized him as he lay on the ground except Gorgias, one of the generals of Eumenes, who at once dismounted and kept guard over him, although he was grievously hurt and almost in the death-agony.", "1638": "Meanwhile Eumenes encountered Neoptolemus.", "1639": "Each had a long-standing grudge against the other;", "1640": "but it chanced that in the first two charges which took place they did not see one another.", "1641": "The third time they recog­ nized one another, and at once drew their daggers and rode together with loud shouts of defiance.", "1642": "With their reins flowing loose they drove their horses against one another like two triremes, and each clutched at the other as he passed, so that each tore the helmet from the other's head, and burst the fastenings of the corslet upon his shoulder.", "1643": "Both fell from their horses, and wrestled together in deadly strife on the ground.", "1644": "As Neoptolenius strove to rise, Eumenes struck him behind the knee, and leaped upon his own feet, but Neoptolemus rested upon his other knee, and continued the fight until he received a mortal stab in the neck.", "1645": "Eumenes through the mortal hate which he bore him at once fell to stripping him of his armour and abusing him, forgetting that he was still alive.", "1646": "He received a slight stab in the groin, but the wound frightened Eumenes more than it hurt him, as the hand that dealt it was almost powerless.", "1647": "Yet when Eumenes had finished despoiling the corpse he found that he was severely cut about the arms and thighs, in spite of which he remounted his horse, and rode to the other side of the battle-field, where he thought the enemy might still be offering resistance.", "1648": "Here he heard of the death of Kraterus, and rode up to where he lay.", "1649": "Finding that he was still alive and conscious, Eumenes dismounted, and with tears and protestations of friendship cursed Neop­ tolemus and lamented his hard fate, which had forced him either to kill his old friend and comrade or to perish at his hands.", "1650": "VII.", "1651": "This victory was won by Eumenes about ten days after his former one.", "1652": "He gained great glory from this double achievement, as he appeared to have won one battle by courage and the other by generalship.", "1653": "Yet he was bitterly disliked and hated both by his own men and by the enemy, because he, a stranger and a foreigner, had vanquished the most renowned of the Macedonians in fair fight.", "1654": "Now if Perdikkas had lived to hear of the death of Kraterus, he would have been the chief Macedonian of the age;", "1655": "but the news of his death reached the camp of Perdikkas two days after that prince had fallen in a skirmish with the Egyptians, and the enraged Macedonian soldiery vowed vengeance against Eumenes Antigonus and Antipater at once declared war against him:", "1656": "and when they heard that Eumenes, passing by Mount Ida where the king- used to keep a breed of horses, took as many as he required and sent an account of his doing so to the Masters of the Horse, Antipater is said to have laughed and declared that he admired the wariness of Eumenes, who seemed to expect that he would bo called upon to give an account of what he had done with the king'is property.", "1657": "Eumenes had intended to fight a battle on the plains of Lydia near Sardis, because his chief strength lay in his cavalry, and also to let Kleopatra† see how powerful he was;", "1658": "but at her particular request, for she was afraid to give umbrage to Antipater, he marched into Upper Phrygia, and passed the winter in the city of Kelainæ.", "1659": "While here, Alketas, Polemon, and Dokimus caballed against him, claiming the supreme command foi themselves.", "1660": "Hereupon Eumenes quoted tho proverb, \" No one reflects that ho who rules must die.", "1661": "\"He now promised his soldiers that in three days he would give them their pay, and accomplished this by selling the various fortified villages and castles in the neighbourhood to them, all of which were full of human beings to sell for slaves, and of cattle.", "1662": "The officers who bought these places from Eumenes were supplied by him with siege-artillery to take them, and the proceeds of tho plunder were set off against the arrears of pay duo to the soldiers.", "1663": "This proceeding made Eumenes very popular with his army, indeed, when a proclamation was dis­ tributed in his camp by contrivance of tho enemy, in which a reward of a hundred talents and special honours were offered to the man who would kill Eumenes, the Macedonians were greatly enraged, and determined that a body-guard of one thousand men, of the best families in Macedonia, should watch over his safety day and night.", "1664": "The soldiers obeyed him with alacrity and were proud to receive from his hands the same marks of favour which kings are wont to bestow upon their favourites.", "1665": "Eumenes even took upon himself to give away purple hats and cloaks, which is accounted the most royal present of all by the Macedonians.", "1666": "IX.", "1667": "Success exalts even mean minds, and men always appear to have a certain dignity when in high station and power;", "1668": "but the truly great man proves his greatness more by the way in which he bears up against misfortunes and endures evil days, as did Eumenes.", "1669": "He was defeated by Antigonus in Southern Cappadocia by treachery, but when forced to retreat he did not allow the traitor who had betrayed him to make good his escape to Antigonus, but took him and banged him on the spot.", "1670": "He managed to retreat by a different road to that on which the enemy were pursuing, and then suddenly turning about, en­ camped on the battle-field of the day before.", "1671": "Here he collected the dead bodies, burned them with the timber of the houses in the neighbouring villages, and raised se­ parate barrows over the remains of the officers and the men —monuments of his hardihood and presence of mind which excited the admiration of Antigonus himself when ho again passed that way.", "1672": "The two armies were still sometimes so near each other, that Eumenes once had an opportunity of making himself master of the whole of tho enemy's baggage, which would have enriched his troops with an immense booty.", "1673": "He feared that the possession of such wealth would render them eager to quit his toilsome and peiilous service, and sent secret warning under the pretext of private friendship to Menander, the general who had been left in charge of the baggage, and enabled him to withdraw into an unassailable position.", "1674": "This seemingly generous action excited the gratitude of the Macedonians, whose wives and children it had saved from slavery and dishonour, till Antigonus pointed out to them that Eumenes had spared them only that he might not encumber himself.-X. After this, Eumenes, who was being constantly pursued by a superior force, recommended the greater part of his men to return to their homes.", "1675": "This he did either because he was anxious for their safety, or because he did not wish to drag about with him a force which was too small to fight, and too large to move with swiftness and secrecy.", "1676": "He himself took refuge in the impregnable fortress of Nora, on the borders of Cappadocia and Lycaonia, with five hundred horse and two hundred foot soldiers, and dismissed from thence with kind speeches and embraces, all of his friends who wished to leave the fortress, dismayed by the prospect of the dreary imprisonment which awaited them during a long siege in such a place.", "1677": "Antigonus when he arrived summoned Eumenes to a conference before beginning the siege, to which he answered, that Antigonus had many friends and officers, while he had none remaining with him, so that unless Antigonus would give him hostages for his safety, he would not trust himself with him.", "1678": "Upon this Anti­ gonus bade him remember that he was speaking to his superior.", "1679": "“While I can hold my sword,\" retorted Eumenes, \"I acknowledge no man as my superior.\"", "1680": "However, after Antigonus had sent his cousin Ptolemaeus into the fortress, as Eumenes had demanded, he came down to meet Antigonus, whom he embraced in a friendly manner, as became men who had once been intimate friends and comrades.", "1681": "They talked for a long time, and Eumenes astonished all the assembly by his courage and spirit;", "1682": "for he did not ask for his life, and for peace, as they expected, but demanded to be reinstated in his govern­ ment, and to have all the grants which he had received from Perdikkas restored to him.", "1683": "The Macedonians meanwhile flocked round him, eager to see what sort of man this Eumenes was, of whom they had heard so much;", "1684": "for since the death of Kraterus no one had been talked of so much as Eumenes in the Macedonian camp.", "1685": "Antigonus began to fear for his safety;", "1686": "he ordered them to keep at a distance, and at last throwing his arms round the waist of Eumenes conducted him back through a passage formed by his guards to the foot of the fortress.", "1687": "XI.", "1688": "After this Antigonus invested the place with a double wall of circumvallation, left a force sufficient to guard it, and marched away.", "1689": "Eumenes was now closely besieged.", "1690": "There was plenty of water, corn, and salt in the fortress, but nothing else to eat or to drink.", "1691": "Yet he managed to render life cheerful, inviting all the garrison in turn to his own table, and entertaining his guests with agreeable and lively conversation.", "1692": "He himself was no sturdy warrior, worn with toil and hardships, but a figure of the most delicate symmetry, seemingly in all the freshness of youth, with a gentle and engaging aspect.", "1693": "He was no orator, but yet was fascinating in conversation, as we may partly learn from his letters.", "1694": "During this siege, as he perceived that the men, cooped up in such narrow limits and eating their food without exercise, would lose health, and also that the horses would lose condition if they never used their limbs, while it was most important that, if they wet e required for a sudden emergency, they should be able to gallop, he arranged the largest room in the fort, fourteen cubits in length, as a place of exercise for the men, and ordered them to walk there, gradually quickening their pace, so as to combine exercise with amusement.", "1695": "For the horses, he caused their necks to be hoisted by pulleys fastened in the roof of their stable, until their fore feet barely touched the ground.", "1696": "In this uneasy position they were excited by their grooms with blows and shouts until the struggle produced the effect of a hard ride, as they sprung about and stood almost erect upon their hind legs till the sweat poured off them, so that this exercise proved no bad training either for strength or speed.", "1697": "They were fed with bruised barley, as being more quickly and easily digested.", "1698": "XII.", "1699": "After this siege had lasted for some time, Anti­ gonus learned that Antipater had died in Macedonia, and that Kassander and Polysperchon were fighting for his in­ heritance.", "1700": "He now conceived great hopes of gaining the supreme power for himself, and desired to have Eumenes as his friend and assistant in effecting this great design.", "1701": "He sent Hieronymus of Kardia, a friend of Eumenes, to make terms with him.", "1702": "Hieronymus proffered a written agreement to Eumenes, which Eumenes amended, and thus appealed to the Macedonians who were besieging him to decide between the two forms, as to which was the most just.", "1703": "Antigonus for decency's sake had mentioned the names of the royal family of Macedonia in the beginning of his agreement, but at the end of it demanded that Eumenes should swear fealty to himself.", "1704": "Eumenes corrected this by inserting the names of Queen Olympias and all the royal family, and then took a solemn oath of fealty, not to Anitigonus alone, but to Olympias and all tho royal house of Macedonia.", "1705": "This form was thought more reasonable by the Macedonians, who swore Eumenes according to it, raised the siege, and sent to Antigonus that he also might swear in the same form as Eumenes.", "1706": "After this Eumenes delivered up all the Cappadocian hostages in Nora, soon collected a forco of little less than a thousand men, from his old soldiers who were still roaming about that country, and rode off with them, as he very rightly distrusted Antigonus, who as soon as he heard of what had happened, sent orders to the Macedonians to continue the siege, and bitterly reproached them for allowing Eumenes to amend the form of oath tendered to him.", "1707": "XIII.", "1708": "While Eumenes was retreating be received letters from the party in Macedonia opposed to Antigonus, in which Olympias begged him to como and take the son of Alexander, whose life was threatened, under his protec­ tion ;", "1709": "while Polysperchon and Philip, the king, bade him take the command of the army in Cappadocia and make war against Antigonus, empowering him out of the trea­ sure at Quinda to take five hundred talents, as compensa­ tion for his own losses, and to make what use he pleased of the remainder for the expenses of the war.", "1710": "He was also informed that orders had been sent to Antigenes and Teutamus the commanders of the Argyraspides, the celebrated Macedonian regiment with the silver shields, to put him in possession of the treasure which they had brought from Susa, and to place themselves with their troops under his command.", "1711": "Antigenes and Teutamus, on receiving these orders, received Eumenes with all outward manifestations of friendship, but were really full of concealed rage at being superseded by him.", "1712": "He, however, judiciously allayed their wrath by refusing to take the money, which he said ho did not need, while as they were both unwilling to obey and unable to command, he called in the aid of super­ stition, and declared that Alexander himself had appeared to him in a dream, as when alive, arrayed in the ensigns of royalty, seated in his tent, and despatching affairs of state, and he proposed that they should erect a magnificent tont, should place a golden throne in the centre, on which should bo laid a diadem, sceptre and royal apparel, and that there they should transact business as in the presence of the king.", "1713": "Antigenes and Teutamus willingly agreed tc this proposal, which flattered their self-love by seeming to place them on an equality with Eumenes.", "1714": "As they marched up the country they were met by Peukestas, a friend of Eumenes, and by several other satraps, or provincial governors, who came accompanied by considerable bodies of troops, whose numbers and excellent equipment and discipline gave great encouragement to the Macedonian soldiery.", "1715": "But these satraps, since the death of Alexander, had become dissolute, licentious, and effeminate princes, with all the vices of Eastern despots.", "1716": "They perpetually intrigued and quarrelled with one another, while they courted the Macedonians by profuse liberality, providing them with magnificent banquets and unlimited wine, until they entirely ruined the discipline of their camp, and led them to meditate choosing their leaders by a popular vote, as is done in republican cities.", "1717": "Eumenes, perceiving that the satraps mistrusted one another, but that they all agreed in hating and fearing himself, and only wanted an opportunity for having him assassinated, pretended to be in want of money, and borrowed large sums from those whom he chiefly suspected of designs against his person, so that he secured the safety of his person by taking other men's money, an object which most people are glad to attain by giving their own.", "1718": "XIV.", "1719": "While the peace lasted, the Macedonian soldiery willingly listened to the flattering promises of the satraps, each of whom wished to raise a force and make war upon the others;", "1720": "but when Antigonus moved to attack them with a large army, and a real general was imperatively demanded to meet him, then not only the soldiers im­ plicitly obeyed Eumenes, but even those princes who during the peace bad affected such airs of independence lowered their tone and each without a murmur proceeded to his appointed duty.", "1721": "When Antigonus was endeavour­ ing to cross the river Pasitigris, none of the confederates except Eumenes perceived his design, but he boldly with­ stood him, and in a pitched battle slew many men, filled the stream with corpses, and took four thousand prisoners.", "1722": "And also, when Eumenes fell sick, the Macedonians clearly proved that they knew that the others could give them banquets and fair promises, but that he alone could lead them to victory.", "1723": "When the army was in Persia, Peukestas magnificently entertained all the soldiers, giving each man a victim for sacrifice, and thought that by this liberality he had quite won their hearts;", "1724": "but a few days afterwards, when they came into the presence of the enemy, Eumenes happened to be ill, and was being carried in a litter apart from the noise of the march in order to obtain rest.", "1725": "As the army gained the crest of some low hills they suddenly saw the enemy's troops marching down into the plain below.", "1726": "As soon as they saw the head of the column, with its gilded arms flashing in the sun, and the elephants with their towers and purple trappings, ready for instant attack, the Macedonians halted, grounded their arms, and refused to proceed until Eumenes should put himself at their head, plainly telling their officers that they dared not risk a battle without him for their leader.", "1727": "Eumenes at once came to the front at full speed in his litter, of which he caused the curtains on both sides to be drawn back, while he waved his hand to them in delight.", "1728": "They, in return, greeted him in the Macedonian fashion by shouts and the clash of their arms, and at once took up their shields and levelled their lances with a loud cry, challenging the enemy to come and fight them, for they now had a general to lead them on.", "1729": "XV.", "1730": "Antigonus, who had learned from prisoners that Eumenes was sick and travelling in a litter, imagined that it would not be difficult to overcome the others, and therefore hastened his march, hoping to bring on a battle while Eumenes was still unable to command.", "1731": "When, however, as he rode along the enemy's line he observed their admirable order and arrangement, he hesitated to attack.", "1732": "At last he perceived the litter proceeding from one wing to the other.", "1733": "Then, with a loud laugh, as was his habit when joking with his friends, he exclaimed, “ It is that litter, it seems, that is manoeuvring against us \"", "1734": "Saying this, he at once withdiew his forces and encamped at some little distance.", "1735": "The army of Eumenes, however, soon afterwards, needing refreshment and repose, forced their generals to place them in cantonments for the winter in the district of Gabiene.", "1736": "These were so scattered, that the whole army was spread over a distance of a thousand stadcs (or a hundred and twenty-five English miles).", "1737": "Antigonus, hearing this, marched suddenly to attack them by a very difficult road, on which no water was to be found, but which nevertheless was very short and direct.", "1738": "He hoped to fall upon the enemy while scattered in their winter quarters, and defeat them before their generals could rally them into a compact mass.", "1739": "But as he marched through a desert region his army met with strong winds and bitter cold, so that the men were forced to light large fires to warm themselves, and these gave notice of their arrival to the enemy;", "1740": "for the natives who inhabited the mountains near the line of Antigonus's march, when they saw the numerous fires lighted by his troops, sent mes­ sengers on swift camels to tell Peukestas what they had observed.", "1741": "He was much alarmed at the news, and, noticing that the rest of the satraps shared his fears, proposed to retreat to the opposite extremity of the province, where they might at least reassemble a part of their force before the enemy came up.", "1742": "Eumenes, however, calmed their fears by promising that he would stop the progress of Antigonus, and prevent his coming to attack them until three days after they expected him.", "1743": "His counsels pre­ vailed, and he at once despatched messengers to call the troops together out of their winter quarters, and collect all the available force, while he himself with the other generals rode to the front, and selecting a spot which was plainly visible to those crossing the desert, ordered fires to be lighted at intervals, as though an army were encamped along the frontier awaiting the attack of Anti­ gonus.", "1744": "The latter, observing the heights covered with watch-fires, was filled with rage and mortification, ima­ gining that the enemy must long ago have known his plans.", "1745": "Fearing to fight with his wearied troops against men who were fresh and had been living in comfort, he turned aside from the desert, and refreshed his army among some neighbouring villages.", "1746": "When, however, he saw no enemy, or any signs of a hostile army being near, and learned from the natives that no troops had been seen by them, but only a large number of fires, he perceived that he had been out-manoeuvred by Eumenes, and marched forward in anger, determined to settle their disputes by a pitched battle.", "1747": "XVI.", "1748": "Meanwhile the greater part of the army of Eu­ menes had assembled, and, admiring his stratagem, de­ clared that he alone was fit to be their leader.", "1749": "This so vexed the officers in command of the Argyi aspids, Anti­ genes, and Teutamus, that they determined to make away with him, and they held a council with most of the satraps and officers of the army to determine how best they might rid themselves of him.", "1750": "They all agreed that it would be wisest to make use of his talents in the approaching battle, and immediately after the battle to assassinate him.", "1751": "This result of their deliberations was at once be­ trayed to Eumenes by Eudamus, the officer in command of the elephants, and Phædimus, not from any love they bore to him, but through fear of losing the money which they had lent him.", "1752": "Eumenes thanked them for their kindness, and afterwards observed to the few friends whom he could trust, that ho was living amongst a herd of savage beasts.", "1753": "He withdrew to his tent, made his will, and destroyed all his private papers, not wishing after his death to involve any one in danger.", "1754": "After having made these arrangements, he thought of allowing the enemy to win the victory, or of escaping through Armenia and Media into Cappadocia.", "1755": "He came to no decided resolution while his friends were present, but merely discussed tho various chances which presented themselves to his ver­ satile intellect, and then proceeded to array his troops in order of battle, uttering words of encouragement to them all, whether Greek or barbarian, while he himself was received with cheerful and confident shouts by the Argy­ raspids, who bade him be of good cheer, as the enemy never could abide their onset.", "1756": "These men were the oldest of the soldiers of Philip and Alexander, and had remained unconquered in battle up to that time, although many of them were seventy and none of them were less than sixty years old.", "1757": "They now called out, as they moved to attack the troops of Antigonus, \" Ye are fighting against your fathers, ye unnatural children.\"", "1758": "Charging with fury, they broke down all opposition, for no one could stand before them, though most of the enemy died where they stood.", "1759": "On this side Antigonus was utterly defeated, but his cavalry were victorious;", "1760": "and through the base and unsoldierly conduct of Peukestas the whole of the baggage fell into his hands, by his own great presence of mind and the nature of the ground.", "1761": "This was a vast plain, not dusty, and yet not hard, but like a sea-beach, composed of a light loose sand, covered with a salt crust.", "1762": "Upon this the trampling of so many horses and men soon raised a cloud of dust through which no object could be seen, as it whitened the whole air and dazzled the eyes.", "1763": "Through this Antigonus dashed unnoticed, and made himself master of the baggage, together with the wives and children of the army of Eumenes.", "1764": "XVII.", "1765": "When the battle was over, Teutamus at once sent to offer terms for the recovery of the baggage.", "1766": "As Antigonus promised that he would deliver everything up to the Argyraspids, and that their wives and children should be kindly treated, if Eumenes were placed in his hands, the Macedonians were treacherous and wicked enough to resolve to deliver him alive into the hands of his enemies.", "1767": "With this intent they drew near to him, on various pretexts, some lamenting their loss, some en­ couraging him because of the victory he had won, and some preferring charges against the other generals.", "1768": "Sud­ denly they fell upon him, snatched away his sword, and bound his hands.", "1769": "When Nikanor was sent to conduct him to Antigonus, he asked, while he was passing through the ranks of the Macedonians, to be permitted to address them, not with any intention of begging his own life, but that he might clearly point out to them what was to their own advantage.", "1770": "Silence was enforced, and Eumenes, standing on a hillock, held forth his fettered hands, and spoke as follows:", "1771": "—\" Basest of Macedonians, could Anti­ gonus ever have erected such a monument of your dis­ grace as you have set up yourselves by surrendering your general to him ?", "1772": "Is it not shameful for you, who have conquere 1 in the battle, to acknowledge yourselves de­ feated because of your baggage, as though victory lay more in money than in arms, so that you should ransom your baggage by delivering up your general ?", "1773": "I indeed am now being carried off captive, an unconquered man, who has overcome his foes, but has been ruined by his friends;", "1774": "but I beseech you in the name of the Zeus that protects armies, and the gods who watch over the true keeping of oaths, kill me here with your own hands;", "1775": "for I shall be slain by you no less when I am put to death in the enemy's camp.", "1776": "Antigonus cannot complain of this action of yours, for he wishes to receive Eumenes dead, and not alive.", "1777": "If you are chary of your own hands to do the deed, one of mine will suffice if you will loose it from its bonds.", "1778": "Or if you will not trust me with a sword, then cast me, bound as I am, to be trampled on by the elephants.", "1779": "If you will act thus I will acquit you of all blame, and will declare that you have dealt with your general as became honourable men.", "1780": "\"XVIII.", "1781": "When Eumenes had spoken thus, all the army was grieved and lamented his fate, but the Argyraspids called out that he must be carried away, and no attention paid to his talk;", "1782": "for, they said, it mattered little what fate betel a pestilent fellow from the Chersonese, who had involved the Macedonians in endless wars and troubles, but that it was not to be borne that the bravest of the soldiers of Philip and Alexander, after their unheard-of exploits, should in their old age be deprived of the fruits of their toils and be forced to depend upon charity, or that their wives should pass a third night in the enemy's camp.", "1783": "They at once hurried him away.", "1784": "When he reached the enemy's quarters, Antigonus, fearing that he would be crushed to death by the crowd (for not a man remained in the camp), sent ten of the strongest elephants, and many Medes and Parthians, armed with spears, to keep off the press from him.", "1785": "He himself could not bear to see Eumenes, because they had once been friends and comrades;", "1786": "and when he was asked by those who had charge of his person how they were to treat him, answered, \" Like an elephant, or a lion!\"", "1787": "After a while he felt compassion for his sufferings, and ordered his heavy chains to be removed, appointed an attendant to anoint his person, and allowed his friends to have free access to him and supply him with provisions.", "1788": "A long debate took place for several days about the fate of Eumenes, in which Nearchus, a Cretan, and the young Demetrius, pleaded earnestly for him, while the other generals all opposed them and pressed for his execution.", "1789": "It is said that Eumenes himself inquired of his jailer, Onomarchus, what the reason was that Anti­ gonus, having got his enemy into his power, did not put him to death quickly or else set him free honourably.", "1790": "When Onomarchus insultingly answered that it was not then, but in the battle-field that he ought to have shown how little he feared death, Eumenes retorted, \"I proved it there also;", "1791": "ask those whom I encountered;", "1792": "but I never met a stronger man than myself.\"", "1793": "\"Since then you have now met with a stronger man than yourself,\" said Onomarchus;", "1794": "\" why cannot you patiently await his pleasure ?", "1795": "\"XIX.", "1796": "When, therefore, Antigonus made up his mind to put Eumenes to death, he ordered him to be kept without food.", "1797": "He lingered thus for two or three days;", "1798": "but as the camp was suddenly broken up, men were sent to despatch him.", "1799": "Antigonus restored his body to his friends, and permitted them to burn it and collect the ashes in a silver urn to be carried to his wife and children.", "1800": "The death of Eumenes was quickly avenged by Heaven, which stirred up Antigonus to regard the Argyraspids with abhorrence, as wicked and faithless villains.", "1801": "He placed them under the command of Sibystius, the governor of Araohosia, and gave him orders to employ them, by small parties at a time, upon services which would ensure th3ir destruction, so that not one of them should ever return to Macedonia, or behold the Grecian sea.", "1802": "THE above are all the particulars of the live3 of Eumenes and Sertorius which have come down to us, and which appear worth recording.", "1803": "When we come to compare them, we find that each was an exile from his native country, and commanded a numerous army of foreign troops, although Sertorius enjoyed the great advantage of an undisputed command, while Eumenes always had to contend with many competitors for the first place, which nevertheless he always obtained by his brilliant exploits.", "1804": "Sertorius was eagerly followed by men who were proud to obey him, but Eumenes was only obeyed out of self-interest, by men who were incompetent to lead.", "1805": "The Roman ruled the tribes of Lusitania and Iberia, who had been long before conquered by the Romans, while the Kardian led the Macedonians, when fresh from the conquest of the world.", "1806": "Yet Sertorius was always looked up to as a wise man and a consummate captain, whereas Eumenes was despised as a mere quill-driver before he fought his way to the rank of general;", "1807": "so that Eumenes not only started with less advantages, but met with much greater difficulties, before he attained to dis­ tinction.", "1808": "Moreover, Eumenes throughout his whole career was constantly opposed by open enemies, and constantly had to make head against secret plots and intrigues;", "1809": "whereas Sertorius was at first opposed by none of the officers under his command, and at the very last only by a few.", "1810": "The one had for his object merely to conquer his enemies, while the other, after winning a victory, was obliged to defend himself against the jealousy of his fiends.", "1811": "II.", "1812": "Their military achievements are pretty equally balanced;", "1813": "although Eumenes was naturally fond of war and tumults, while Sertorius was of a quiet and peaceful disposition.", "1814": "Thus it happened that Eumenes, rather than dwell in comfortable and honourable retirement, passed his whole life in war, because he could not be satisfied with anything short of a throne;", "1815": "while Sertorius, who hated war, was forced to fight for his own safety against foes who would not allow him to live in peace.", "1816": "Antigonus would have made use of Eumenes as an officer with pleasure, if the latter would have laid aside his designs upon the throne of Macedonia;", "1817": "but Pompeius and his party would not so much as allow Sertorius to live, although his only wish was to be at rest.", "1818": "From this it resulted that the one of his own free will went to war to obtain power, while the other was forced against his will to obtain power in order to repel attacks.", "1819": "The one died by an unexpected stroke, while the other long looked for death, and at last even wished for it.", "1820": "In the first this shows a noble and generous spirit, not to distrust his friends;", "1821": "while the latter seems rather to argue weak­ ness of purpose, for though Eumenes had long intended to fly, yet he did not, and was taken.", "1822": "The death of Sertorius did not disgrace his life, for he met at the hands of his friends with that fate which none of his enemies could inflict upon him;", "1823": "but Eumenes, who could not escape before he was taken prisoner, and yet was willing to live after his capture, made a discreditable end;", "1824": "for by his entreaties to be spared, he proved that his enemy had conquered not merely his body but also his spirit.", "1825": "ARCHIDAMUS, the son of Zeuxidamus, king of Lacedaemon, after a glorious reign, left one son, Agis, by a noble lady named Lampito, and a much younger one, named Agesilaus, by Eupolia, the daughter of Melesippides.", "1826": "As by the Spartan law Agis was the next heir, and succeeded to the throne, Agesilaus was prepared for the life of a private man, in that severe Spartan school by which obedience is instilled into the youth of that country.", "1827": "For that reason it is said that the epithet of 'man-subduing' is applied to Sparta by the poet Simonides, because the Spartan customs render the citizens well behaved, and amenable to dis­ cipline, like horses who are broken to harness early in life.", "1828": "The direct heirs to the throne are not subjected tc this training;", "1829": "but in the case of Agesilaus it happened that when he began to rule he had previously been taught to obey.", "1830": "This rendered him by far the most popular of the kings of Sparta, because, in addition to the haughty spirit that became a king, he had learned to sympathize with the people over whom he ruled.", "1831": "II.", "1832": "Agesilaus was an early and intimate friend of Lysander, as they were both placed as boys in the same herd or troop for the purposes of discipline.", "1833": "It was then that Lysander learned to admire the moderation and self- restraint of Agesilaus, who, although he was ambitious and high-spirited, with a most vehement and passionate desire to be first in every kind of competition, was yet of a manageable and easily ruled disposition, very sensitive to reproach, and far more afraid of blame than of toils or dangers.", "1834": "The misfortune of his lame leg was almost un­ noticed, partly from the robust vigour of his frame, and also from his own cheerful acknowledgment of this defect, being always the first to joke about it He sought by these means to remedy his lameness, while his daring spirit never allowed it to prevent his undertaking the most dangerous and laborious adventures.", "1835": "We have no record of his appearance, for he himself never would con­ sent to have his portrait taken, and even when dying begged that no statue or painting of him should be taken.", "1836": "We are, however, told that he was of small and mean stature, but that his lively and cheerful temper, even in the most trying situations, and the absence of anything harsh and overbearing in his manners, made him more popular than many younger and handsomer men even in extreme old age.", "1837": "The historian Theophrastus informs us that the mother of Agesilaus was a very small woman, and that the Ephors had fined Archidamus, on that special ground, for marrying her.", "1838": "\"She will not bring forth kings to rule us,\" said they, \" but kinglets.\"", "1839": "III.", "1840": "During the reign of Agis, Alkibiades arrived in Lacdaemon as an exile, having made his escape from the army in Sicily, and, after a short sojourn, was universally believed to be carrying on an intrigue with the king's wife, Timaea, insomuch that Agis refused to recognize her child as his own, but declared that Alkibiades was its father.", "1841": "The historian Douris tells us that Timaea was not altogether displeased at this imputation, and that when nursing the child among her attendants she was wont to call it Alkibiades instead of Leotvchides.", "1842": "The same authority states that Alkibiades himself declared that he seduced Timaea, not out of wantonness, but with the ambitious design of placing his own family upon the throne of Sparta.", "1843": "In consequence of this, Alkibiades, fearing the wrath of Agis, left Sparta, and the child was always viewed with suspicion by Agis, and never treated as his own son, until in his last illness the boy by tears and entreaties prevailed upon him to bear public witness to his legitimacy.", "1844": "But after the death of Agis, Lysander, the conqueror of Athens, who was the most important man in Sparta, began to urge the claims of Agesilaus to the throne, on the ground that Leotychides was a bastard, and therefore excluded from the succession.", "1845": "Many of the other citizens eagerly espoused the cause of Agesilaus, because they had been brought up in his company, and had become his intimate friends.", "1846": "There was, however, one Diopeithes, a soothsayer, who was learned in prophetic lore, and enjoyed a great reputation for wisdom and sanctity.", "1847": "This man declared that it was wrong for a lame man to become king of Lacedæmon, and quoted the following oracle:", "1848": "­ “Proud Sparta, resting on two equal feet, Beware lest lameness on thy kings alight;", "1849": "Lest wars unnumbered toss thee to find fro, And thou thyself be ruined in the fight.", "1850": "\"In answer to this, Lysander argued that the oracle really warned the Spartans against making Leotychides king;", "1851": "for the god was not likely to allude to actual lame­ ness, which might not even be congenital, but might arise from some accidental hurt, as disqualifying any one for the office of king, but rather meant by a \" lame reign,\" the reign of one who was not legitimate, and not truly descended from Herakles.", "1852": "Agesilaus also said that Posei­ don bore witness to the illegitimacy of Leotychides;", "1853": "for Agis was said to have been cast out of his bed chamber by an earthquake, after which he abstained from approaching his wife, on religious grounds, for a period of more than ten months, at the end of which Leotychides was born.", "1854": "IV.", "1855": "Having been raised to the throne on those grounds Agesilaus at the same time acquired the large property left by the late king Agis, as Leotychides was declared illegitimate and driven into exile.", "1856": "As his own mother's family were respectable, but very poor, he distributed half this property among them, thus making sure of their good will and favour, and removing any jealousy which they might feel at his elevation.", "1857": "Moreover, as Xenophon tells us, he gained the greatest influence by always deferring to the wishes of his country, and thus was really enabled to act exactly as he pleased.", "1858": "The whole power of the state was at that time vested in the Ephors and the Senate of Elders, of whom the Ephors are elected every year, while the Elders sit for life.", "1859": "These two bodies were intended as a check upon the power of the kings, who would otherwise have been absolute, as has been explained in the Life of Lykurgus.", "1860": "Between these magistrates and the kings there was generally a bad understanding;", "1861": "but Agesilaus adopted an opposite line of conduct.", "1862": "He never attempted to oppose or thwart the Ephors or the Senate, and even showed a marked defer­ ence to them, referring the initiative of all state affairs to them, hurrying into their presence when summoned, and rising from his royal throne whenever they appeared, while he presented each senator, on his election, with a cloak and an ox, to congratulate him on joining the Senate.", "1863": "Thus he appeared to exalt the power of the Ephors and to court their favour, but he himself was by far the greatest gainer, as his own personal influence was greatly increased, and the power of the crown much strengthened by the general good will which he inspired.", "1864": "V.", "1865": "In his dealings with his fellow-citizens he is more to be praised as an enemy than as a friend;", "1866": "for he would not act unjustly to injure his enemies, but he sometimes disre­ garded justice in the interests of his friends.", "1867": "He was of too generous a nature to refrain from applauding even his enemies when they deserved it, but could not bear to reproach his friends for their faults, which he delighted to share with them, and to extricate them from the con­ sequences, for he thought nothing disgraceful if done to serve a friend.-", "1868": "He was also ever ready to forgive and assist those with whom he had been at variance, and thus won all hearts, and attained to a true popularity.", "1869": "The Ephors indeed, perceiving this, imposed a fine upon him, alleging as a reason for it that he was attaching the Spartans to his own person instead of to the State.", "1870": "For just as physical philosophers tell us that if the principle of strife and opposition were removed, the heavenly bodies would stand still, and all the productive power of nature would be at an end, so did the Laconian lawgiver endeavour to quicken the virtue of his citizens by constructing a con­ stitution out of opposing elements, deeming that success is barren when there is none to resist, and that the harmonious working of a political system is valueless if purchased by the suppression of any important element.", "1871": "Some have thought that the germ of this idea can be traced in Homer,* for he would not have represented Agamemnon as rejoicing when Achilles and Odysseus quarrel 'with savage words,' had he not thought that some great public benefit would arise from this opposition and rivalry of the bravest.", "1872": "But to this one cannot altogether agree;", "1873": "for party strife, if carried to excess, proves most dangerous and ruinous to all communities.", "1874": "VI.", "1875": "Shortly after Agesilaus had been raised to the throne he received news from Asia that the Persian king was preparing a large army with which he intended to drive the Lacedaemonians into the sea.", "1876": "Upon hearing this, Lysander was very eager to be sent out again to conduct affairs in Asia, in order that he might be able to assist his own friends and partizans, whom he had appointed as governors to many of the cities in that country, but who had mostly been forcibly expelled by the citizens for theii insolent and tyrannical conduct.", "1877": "He therefore urged Agesilaus to undertake a campaign in Asia as the champion of Greece, and advised him to land upon some distant part of the coast, so as to establish himself securely before the arrival of the Persian army.", "1878": "At the same time he despatched instructions to his friends in Asia, to send to Lacedaemon, and demand Agesilaus as their general.", "1879": "In a public debate upon the subject, Agesilaus agreed to conduct the war if he were furnished with thirty Spartans to act as generals, and to form a council of war.", "1880": "He also demanded a force of ten thousand picked men of the Neodamodes, or enfranchised Helots, and six thousand hoplites, or heavy armed troops, from the allied cities in Greece.", "1881": "By the active cooperation of Lysander all this was quickly agreed upon, and Agesilaus was sent out with a council of thirty Spartans, in which Lysander at once took the lead, not merely by his own great name and influence, but by reason of his intimacy with Agesilaus, through which it was supposed that this campaign would raise him to more than kingly power.", "1882": "While the army was being assembled at Garæstus, Agesilaus himself proceeded to Aulis with his friends, and while sleeping there, he appeared in a dream to hear a voice saying:", "1883": "“0 king of the Lacedaemonians, since no one has ever been commander-in-chief of all the Greeks, save you and Agamemnon alone, it is fitting that you, since you command the same troops, start from the same place, and are about to attack the same enemy, should offer sacrifice to the same goddess to whom he sacrificed here before setting out.\"", "1884": "Upon this there, at once, occurred to the mind of Agesilaus the legend of the maiden who was put to death on that occasion by her own father, in obedience to the soothsayers;", "1885": "but he did not allow himself to be disturbed by this omen, but arose and told the whole dream to his friends, observing that it was his intention to pay all due honour to the goddess Artemis, but not to imitate the barbarous conduct of Agamemnon.", "1886": "He now proceeded to hang garlands upon a hind, and ordered his own soothsayer to offer it as a sacrifice, disregarding the claims of the local Bœotian priest to do so.", "1887": "The Bœotarchs, however, heard of this, and were greatly incensed at what they considered an insult.", "1888": "They at once despatched a body of armed men to the spot, who forbade Agesilaus to offer sacrifice there, contrary to the ancestral customs of the Bœotians, and cast off the victim from the altar where it lay.", "1889": "After this Agesilaus sailed away in great trouble of mind, both from the anger he felt tow ards the Thebans, and from the evil omen which had befallen him, as he feared that it portended the failure of his Asiatic campaign.", "1890": "VII.", "1891": "On his arrival at Ephesus, he was much offended by the great power and influence possessed by Lysander, whoso ante-chamber was always crowded, and who was always surrounded by persons desirous of paying their court to him.", "1892": "They evidently thought that although Agesilaus might be nominally in command of the expedition, yet that all real power and direction of affairs was enjoyed by Lysander, who had made himself feared and respected throughout Asia, beyond any other Greek commander, and had been able to benefit his friends and crush his enemies more effectually than any one had previously done.", "1893": "As all this was still fresh in the memory of all men, and especially as they perceived the extreme simpli­ city and courteousness of Agesilaus's manners and con­ versation, and observed, too, that Lysander was still as harsh, rude, and imperious as before, they all looked up to him alone as the virtual commander.", "1894": "The other Spartan members of the council were deeply dissatisfied at finding that Lysander treated them rather as though he were king and they were merely there to ratify his decrees, than as their colleague with powers no more extensive than their own;", "1895": "while Agesilaus himself, who though he was above feeling any jealousy of the honours paid to Lysander, yet was ambitious and covetous of honour, began to fear that if any brilliant success should be achieved, the credit of it would be given to Lysander alone.", "1896": "He therefore proceeded to oppose all Lysander's plans, and if he knew that Lysander was interested in any enterprise, he took care to put it off and neglect it, while he successively rejected the petitions of every person in whom he knew Lysander to take an interest.", "1897": "In judicial decisions also he invariably acquitted those whom Lysander wished to punish, and condemned to pay heavv fines those whom he endeavoured to serve.", "1898": "As this took place so frequently that it could not be attributed to chance, but to a systematic purpose, Lysander was forced to warn his partizans that his intervention was an injury and not a benefit to them, and that they must desist from their obsequious attentions to him, and address themselves directly to the king.", "1899": "VIII.", "1900": "As these remarks seemed intended to place the king'is policy in an invidious light, Agesilaus determined to humble him still further, and appointed him his carver.", "1901": "He then said aloud in the hearing of many persons, \" Let them now go and pay their court to my carver.\"", "1902": "Vexed at this insult, Lysander remonstrated with him, saying, \"Truly, Agesilaus, you know how to degrade your friends.\"", "1903": "\"Ay, to be sure,\" answered he, \"those among them who want to appear greater than I am.\" * \"Perhaps,\" replied Lysander, “you have spoken the truth, and 1 have not acted rightly.", "1904": "Bestow on me, however, some post in which I may be usefully employed without wounding your feelings.", "1905": "\"Upon this, Lysander was despatched on a mission to the Hellespont, where he found means to gain over a Persian noble named Spithridates, who had received some offence from Pharnabazus, the satrap of that province.", "1906": "Lysander induced this man to join Agesilaus with all his property, and with a regiment of two hundred horse;", "1907": "yet he himself did not forget his quarrel, and for the rest of his life assiduously plotted to remove the succes­ sion to the throne of Sparta from the two royal families, and to throw it open to all Spartans alike.", "1908": "It is indeed probable that he would have raised an important com­ motion in Sparta, had he not been slain in an expedition in Bœotia.", "1909": "Thus do ambitious men do more harm than good in a state, unless they have an unusual power of self-restraint.", "1910": "Lysander no doubt acted very offensively, and made a very unreasonable display of his pride;", "1911": "yet Agesilaus might have discovered some better method of correcting the faults of so great a man.", "1912": "Indeed, in my opinion they were both equally blinded by the same passion for personal aggrandizement, so that the one forgot the power of his prince, and the other could not bear with the shortcomings of his friend.", "1913": "IX.", "1914": "Tissaphernes was at first afraid of Agesilaus, and began tc treat with him about setting free the Greek cities on the Ionian coast from the power of the king of Persia.", "1915": "Afterwards, however, he imagined that the force at his disposal justified him in breaking off these negotia­ tions, and he declared war, to the great delight of Agesilaus.", "1916": "Great expectations had indeed been formed in Greece of the army of Agesilaus, and it was thought a strange thing that ten thousand Greeks under Xenophon should march through Persia to the sea, and defeat the king of Persia's troops as often as they pleased, while Agesilaus, the commander of the Lacedaemonians, the leading people in Greece, who were all-powerful both by sea and land, should accomplish nothing.", "1917": "He now revenged himself on the faithless Tissaphernes for his perjury by an equal piece of deceit, and gave out that he was about to march into Karia.", "1918": "When, however, the Persian army was assembled there, he proceeded north­ wards to Phrygia, where he took many cities, and gained much plunder, pointing out to his friends that although to solemnly plight one's word and then to break it is wrong, yet that to out-manœuvre one's enemies is not only lawful, but profitable and glorious.", "1919": "Being, however, deficient in cavalry, and warned by the omen of a victim being found with an imperfect liver, he retired to Ephesus, and there collected a cavalry force, giving rich men the alternative of either serving themselves in his army, or of furnishing a horse soldier instead.", "1920": "Many preferred to do so, and Agesilaus soon possessed a force of warlike cavalry in the place of worthless foot soldiers;", "1921": "for those who did not wish to serve personally hired men who were willing to fight, and those who could not ride hired those who could.", "1922": "Just so did Agamemnon act very wisely in receiving a valuable mare, and thereby allow­ ing a rich man to purchase his discharge from military service.", "1923": "Agesilaus now gave orders that the heralds who conducted the sale of captives by auction, should strip them of their clothes, and put them up for sale in a state of perfect nudity.", "1924": "Their clothes were sold separately, and the Greek soldiers laughed heartily at the white and soft skins, which never had felt the sun or wind, dis­ played by these Asiatics, and began to feel contempt for such effeminate adversaries.", "1925": "Agesilaus himself, pointing first to the captives themselves, and then to their clothes and other property, observed, “These are the men with whom you have to fight, and these are the things you fight for.\"X.", "1926": "When the season for active operations returned he announced his intention of marching into Lydia, not meaning thereby to deceive Tissaphernes;", "1927": ". but Tissa­ phernes deceived himself, for he distrusted Agesilaus on account of his former stratagem.", "1928": "He therefore concluded that it was Agesilaus's real intention to invade Karia, especially as he was weak in cavalry, which could not act in that province.", "1929": "When, however, Agesilaus, as he had announced, marched into the level country near Sardis, Tissaphernes was obliged to hurry thither with all speed;", "1930": "and by means of his cavalry he cut off many stragglers from the Greek army.", "1931": "Agesilaus now perceived that the enemy's infantry had not come up, while he had all his troops in hand.", "1932": "He at once determined to fight, and having formed his cavalry and light-armed troops into one mixed body he ordered them to advance at once and attack the enemy, while he led on the heavy infantry in person.", "1933": "The Persians were routed, and the Greeks, following up their victory, took the enemy's camp with great slaughter.", "1934": "This victory not only enabled them to plunder the king's territories undisturbed, but also gave them the satisfaction of hearing that Tissaphernes, a bad man, and one for whom all the Greeks felt an especial hatred, had at length met with his deserts.", "1935": "Immediately after the battle the king of Persia sent Tithraustes to him, who caused him to be beheaded.", "1936": "Tithraustes now begged Agesilaus to make peace and leave the country, and offered him money if he would do so.", "1937": "Agesilaus answered that he had no power to make peace or war, but that such propositions must be referred to the authorities at home;", "1938": "while as to money he said that he preferred enriching his soldiers to enriching himself, and that among the Greeks it was not considered honourable to receive bribes, but rather to take plunder from their enemies.", "1939": "Nevertheless, wishing to oblige Tithraustes, because he had avenged Greece upon that common enemy of all, Tissaphernes, he removed his army into Phrygia, receiving a sum of thirty talents from Tithraustes for the maintenance of his soldiery.", "1940": "During his march he received a despatch from the government of Sparta, appointing him to the command of the naval as well as of the military forces in Asia.", "1941": "He was now at the zenith of his fame and the greatest man of his age, as Theopompus truly observes;", "1942": "yet he had more reason to be proud of his virtue than of his power.", "1943": "He was thought, however, to have committed an error in placing Peisander in command of the fleet, disregarding the claims of older and more experienced men, and pre­ ferring the advancement of his wife'is brother to the interests of his country.", "1944": "XI.", "1945": "Having established his army in the province ruled by Pharnabazus, he not only found abundance of pro­ visions, but also was able to amass much booty.", "1946": "He marched as far as the borders of Paphlagonia, and gained the alliance of Kotys,* the king of that country.", "1947": "Spithridates, ever since he had revolted from Pharna­ baus, had constantly accompanied Agesilaus, together with his very handsome son, named Megabates, of whom Agesilaus was greatly enamoured, and a fair daughter.", "1948": "Agesilaus persuaded King Kotys to marry this girl, and received from him a force of one thousand horsemen, and two thousand light troops, called peltasts.", "1949": "With these he returned into Phrygia, and laid waste the country of Pharnabazus, who dared not meet him in the field, and feared to trust himself in any of his fortresses, but hovered about the country, taking his valuable property with him, and keeping his place of encampment as secret as he could.", "1950": "The watchful Spithridates, however, at last found an opportunity to attack him, and, with Herippidas the Spartan, took his camp and all his property.", "1951": "On this occasion Herippidas acted with great harshness in ordering all the plunder to be given up to be sold by auction, according to Greek usage.", "1952": "He forced the barbarian allies to disgorge their booty, and searched for all that had been captured in so offensive a manner that Spithridates, in disgust at his conduct, at once went off to Sardis, taking with him the entire Paphlagonian force.", "1953": "We are told that Agesilaus was terribly chagrined at this.", "1954": "He felt vexed at losing a good friend in Spithridates, and losing, too, a large force with him, while he was ashamed of the character for meanness and avarice which this miserable squabble would gain for Sparta, especially as he had always prided himself on showing a contempt for money both in politics and in private life.", "1955": "XII.", "1956": "After this, Pharnabazus was desirous of conferring with him, and a meeting was arranged between them by a friend of both, Apollophanes of Kyzikus.", "1957": "Agesilaus arrived first, and sitting down upon some thick grass under the shade of a tree, awaited the coming of Pharna­ bazus.", "1958": "Presently Pharnabazus arrived, with soft rugs and curiously-wrought carpets, but on seeing Agesilaus simply seated on the ground, he felt ashamed to use them, and sat down on the ground beside him, although he was dressed in a magnificent robe of many colours.", "1959": "They now greeted one another, and Pharnabazus stated his case very fairly, pointing out that he had done much good service to the Lacedæmonians during their war with Athens, and yet that his province was now being laid waste by them.", "1960": "Seeing all the Spartans round him hanging down their heads with shame, and not knowing what to answer because they knew that what Pharnabazus said was true, Agesilaus said:", "1961": "\"We Spartans, Pharnabazus, were formerly at peace with your king, and then wo respected his territory as that of a friend.", "1962": "Now we are at war with him, and regard all his property as that of an enemy.", "1963": "Now as we see that you still wish to belong to the king, we very naturally endeavour by injuring you to injure him.", "1964": "But from the day on which you shall declare that you will be a friend and ally of the Greeks rather than a slave of the king of Persia, you may regard this fleet and army and all of us, as the guardians of your property, of your liberty, and of all that makes life honourable and enjoyable.\"", "1965": "In answer to this, Pharna­ bazus said:", "1966": "\" If the king shall send any other general.", "1967": "and put me under him, I will join you.", "1968": "But if he placed me in command, I will cheerfully obey him, and will fight you and do you all the mischief in my power.", "1969": "\"Agesilaus was struck by the high-minded tone of this reply, and at once rose and took him by the hand, saying, \"Would to God, Pharnabazus, that such a man as you might become our friend rather than our enemy.", "1970": "\"XIII.", "1971": "As Pharnabazus was retiring with his friends, his son stayed behind, and running up to Agesilaus said with a smile, \" Agesilaus, I make you my guest,\"* and gave him a fine javelin which he carried in his hand.", "1972": "Agesilaus gladly accepted this offer, and, delighted with the engaging manners and evident friendship of the young man, looked round for some suitable present, and seeing that the horse of his secretary Idæus was adorned with fine trappings, took them off and gave them to the boy.", "1973": "Agesilaus never forgot the connection thus formed between them, but in after days, when the son of Pharnabazus was impoverished and driven into exile by his brother, he welcomed him to the Peloponnese, and provided him with protection and a home.", "1974": "He even went so far as to employ his influence in favour of an Athenian youth to whom the son of Pharnabazus was attached.", "1975": "This boy had outgrown the age and size of the boy-runners in the Olympic stadium, and was consequently refused leave to compete in that race.", "1976": "Upon this the Persian made a special application to Agesilaus on his behalf;", "1977": "and Agesilaus, willing to do anything tc please his protégé, with great difficulty and management induced the judges to admit the boy as a competitor.", "1978": "This, indeed, was the character of Agesilaus, disinterested and just in all matters except in furthering the interests of his friends, in which case he seems to have hesitated at nothing.", "1979": "A letter of his to Idrilus, the Karian, runs as follows :", "1980": "\" If Nikias be innocent, acquit him ;", "1981": "if he be guilty, acquit him for my sake;", "1982": "but in any case acquit him.\"", "1983": "Such was Agesilaus in most cases where his friends were concerned;", "1984": "although in some few instances he allowed expediency to prevail over affection, and sacrificed his personal friend to the general advantage, as, for example, once, when owing to a sudden alarm the camp was being hurriedly broken up, he left a sick friend behind in spite of his passionate entreaties, observing as he did so, that it is hard to be wise and compassionate at the same time.", "1985": "This anecdote has been preserved by the philosopher Hieronymus.XIV.", "1986": "Agesilaus was now in the second year of his command in Asia, and had become one of the foremost men of his time, being greatly admired and esteemed for his remarkable sobriety and frugality of life.", "1987": "When away from his headquarters he used to pitch his tent within the precincts of the most sacred temples, thus making the gods witnesses of the most private details of his life.", "1988": "Among thousands of soldiers, moreover, there was scarcely one that used a worse mattress than Agesilaus.", "1989": "With regard to extremes of heat and cold, he seemed so constituted as to be able to enjoy whatever weather the gods might send.", "1990": "It was a pleasant and enjoyable spectacle for the Greek inhabitants of Asia to see their former tyrants, the deputy governors of cities and generals of provinces, who used to be so offensively proud, insolent, and profusely luxurious, now trembling before a man who walked about in a plain cloak, and altering their whole conduct in obedience to his curt Laconian sayings.", "1991": "Many used to quote the proverb of Timotheus, that \"Ares alone is king, and Hellas fears not the power of gold.\"XV.", "1992": "The whole of Asia Minor was now excited, and ripe for revolt.", "1993": "Agesilaus established order * in the cities on the coast by mild measures, without either banishing or putting to death any of the citizens, and next deter­ mined to advance farther, and transfer the theatre of war from the Ionic coast to the interior.", "1994": "He hoped thus to force the Persian king to fight for his very existence, and for his pleasant palaces at Susa and Ecbatana, and at any rate to keep him fully employed, so that from henceforth he might have no leisure or means to act as arbitrator between the Greek states in their disputes, and to corrupt their statesmen by bribes.", "1995": "At this crisis, however, there arrived the Spartan Epikydides.", "1996": "He announced that Sparta was involved in an important war with Thebes and other Greek states, and brought an imperative sum­ mons from the ephors to Agesilaus to return at once and assist his countrymen at home.", "1997": "\"O Greeks, that will upon yourselves impose Such miserable, more than Persian woes.", "1998": "\"It is pitiable to think of the malevolence and ill-will which produced this war, and arrayed the states of Greece against one another, putting a stop to such a glorious career of conquest at its very outset, exchanging a foreign for a civil war, and recalling the arms which were being used against the Persians to point them at Grecian breasts.", "1999": "I cannot agree with the Corinthian, Demaratus, when he says that those Greeks who did not see Alex­ ander seated upon the throne of Darius lost one of the most delightful spectacles in the world.", "2000": "I think they would have been more likely to weep when they reflected that this conquest was left for Alexander and the Mace­ donians to effect, by those Greek generals who wasted the 7esources of their country in the battles of Leuktra and Koronea, Corinth and Mantinea.", "2001": "Still, nothing is more honourable to Agesilaus than the promptitude with which he withdrew from Asia, nor can we easily find another example of straightforward obedience and self­ sacrifice in a general.", "2002": "Hannibal was in great difficulties and straits in Italy, and yet yielded a very unwilling obedience when summoned home to protect Carthage, while Alexander merely sneered at the news of the battle between Agis and Antipater, observing, \" It appears, my friends, that while we have been conquering Darius here, there has been a battle of mice in Arcadia.", "2003": "\"Well then does Sparta deserve to be congratulated on the love for her and the respect for her laws which Agesilaus showed on this occasion, when, as soon as the despatch reached him, he at once stopped his prosperous and victorious career, gave up his soaring hopes of con­ quest, and marched home, leaving his work unfinished, regretted greatly by all his allies, and having signally confuted the saying of Phæax the son of Erasistratus, that the Lacedæmonians act best as a state, and the Athenians as individuals.", "2004": "He proved himself indeed to be a good king and a good general, but those who knew him most intimately prized him more as a friend and companion than as either a king or a soldier.", "2005": "The Persian gold coins bore the device of an archer:", "2006": "and Agesilaus as he broke up his camp observed that he was being driven out of Asia by ten thousand archers, meaning that so many of these coins had been distributed among the statesmen of Athens and Thebes, to bribe them into forcing those countries to go to war with Sparta.", "2007": "XVI.", "2008": "He now crossed the Hellespont and proceeded through Thrace.", "2009": "Here he did not ask leave of any of the barbarian tribes to traverse their country, but merely inquired whether they would prefer him to treat them as friends or as enemies during his passage.", "2010": "All the tribes received him in a friendly manner and escorted him through their land, except the Trallians,* to whom it is said that Xerxes himself gave presents, who demanded from Agesilaus a hundred talents of silver and a hundred female slaves for his passage.", "2011": "He answered, \" Why did they not come at once and take them ;", "2012": "\" and immediately marched into their country, where he found them strongly posted, and routed them with great slaughter.", "2013": "He made the same enquiry, about peace or war, of the King of Macedonia, and on receiving the answer that he would consider the question, \" Let him consider,\" said he, \" but let us march in the meanwhile.\"", "2014": "Struck with admiration and fear at his daring, the king bade him pass through as a friend.", "2015": "On reaching the country of Thessaly, he found the Thessalians in alliance with the enemies of Sparta, and laid waste their lands.", "2016": "He sent however Xenokles and Skythes to Larissa, the chief town in Thessaly, to arrange terms of peace.", "2017": "These men were seized upon by the Thessalians and cast into prison, at which the army was greatly excited, thinking that Agesilaus could do no less than besiege and take Larissa.", "2018": "He, on the other hand, said that he valued the lives of either of these two men more than all Thessaly, and obtained their release by negotiation.", "2019": "This ought not to surprise us in Agesilaus, for when he heard of the great battle at Corinth where so many distinguished men fell, and where though many of the enemy perished the Spartan loss was very small, he showed no signs of exultation, but sighed heavily, and said, \" Alas for Greece, that she should by her own fault have lost so many men, who if they were alive could conquer all the barbarians in the world.", "2020": "\"The Thessalian tribe of the Pharsalians* now attacked his army, upon which he charged them with five hundred horse, and having routed them erected a trophy near Mount Narthakius.",

once to obey, and informed his friends that the day for which they had marched all the way from Asia would soon be at hand.", "2024": "He also sent for a reinforcement of two morast from the army at Corinth.", "2025": "The Lacedæmonian government at home, also, wishing to do him honour, made proclamation that who­ soever would might enrol himself to serve the King.", "2026": "All eagerly gave in their names, and from them the ephors selected fifty of the strongest, whom they sent to Agesilaus as a body-guard.", "2027": "He now marched through Thermopylae, crossed the friendly country of Phokis, and entered Boeotia near Chæronea.", "2028": "While encamped there, he observed that the sun was eclipsed and became crescent- shaped, and at the same time came the news of the defeat and death of Peisander in a great sea-fight off Knidus, against Pharnabazus and Konon the Athenian.", "2029": "Agesilaus was naturally grieved both at his brother-in-law's death and at the disaster which had befallen Sparta, but as he feared to damp the courage of his soldiers on the eve of battle, he ordered the messengers to spread the contrary intelligence, that the Spartans had been victorious in the sea-fight, and he himself appeared with a garland on his head, offered sacrifice as though he had heard good news, and distributed portions of the meat to his friends, as presents of congratulation.", "2030": "XVIII.", "2031": "Proceeding on his march through Bœotia he reached Koroneia, where he came into the presence of the enemy, and arrayed his forces for battle, placing the men of Orchomenos* on the left wing, while he led the right in person.", "2032": "In the army of the allies the Thebans formed the right, and the Argives the left wing.", "2033": "Xenophon informs us that this battle was the most furiously contested one that ever was known.", "2034": "He himself was an eye-witness of it, as he had served with Agesilaus during his Asiatic campaign, and had accompanied him on his return to Europe.", "2035": "I'he first shock was not very severe, as the Thebans easily overthrew the Orchomeni­ ans, while Agesilaus with equal ease routed the Argives.",

"Agesilaus might now easily have won a partial victory, by allowing the Thebans to pass back again through his own lines and attacking them as they did so.", "2038": "Instead of this, his fierce spirit led him to form his troops in close order and attack them front to front.", "2039": "The Thebans fought with no less courage, and a terrible battle raged all along the line, but most fiercely at tho point where the chosen body-guard of fifty men fought round the Spartan king.", "2040": "The courage of these men saved the life of Agesilaus, for they recklessly exposed themselves in his defence, and by their exertions, although they could not prevent his being severely wounded, yet by receiving on their bodies through their shields and armour many blows which were intended for him, they succeeded in dragging him from where he had fallen among the enemy, and formed a bulwark around him, slaying many of the enemy, but with great loss to themselves.", "2041": "The Lacedæmonians, unable to force back the Thebans, were at length compelled to open their ranks, and let them pass through, which at first they had scorned to do.", "2042": "They then assailed them on the flanks and

fell in that battle.", "2048": "Next morning Agesilaus, wishing to discover whether the Thebans would renew the contest, ordered his soldiers to crown themselves with garlands, and the flute-players to play martial music while a trophy was erected in honour of the victory.", "2049": "When the enemy sent to ask for a truce for the burial of their dead, he granted it, and having thus confirmed his victory, caused himself to be carried to Delphi.", "2050": "Here the Pythian games were being celebrated, and Agesilaus not only took part in the procession in honour of the god, but also dedicated to him the tithe of the spoils of his Asiatic campaign, which amounted to one hundred talents.", "2051": "On his return home, he was loved and admned by all his fellow-countrymen for his simple habits of life;", "2052": "for he did not, like so many generals, return quite a different man, corrupted by foreign manners, and dissatisfied with those of his own country, but, just like those who had never crossed the Eurotas, he loved and respected the old Spartan fashions, and would not alter his dining at the public table, his bath, his domestic life with his wife, his care of his arms, or the furniture of his house, the doors of which we are told by Xenophon, were so old that it was thought that they must be the original ones put up by Aristodemus.", "2053": "Xenophon also tells us that

Lysander meant some day to address to the people of Sparta, he wished to make it public.", "2064": "However, one of the senators, after reading the speech, was alarmed at the plausible nature of the argument which it contained, and advised Agesilaus not to dig Lysander out of his grave, but rather to bury the speech with him.", "2065": "This advice caused Agesilaus to desist from his project.", "2066": "He never openly attacked his political enemies, but contrived to get them appointed generals and governors of cities.", "2067": "When they displayed their bad qualities in these posts and were recalled to take their trial he used to come forward as their friend and by his exertions on their behalf make them his active partisans instead of his enemies, so that before long he succeeded in breaking up the party which was opposed to him, and reigned alone without any rival;", "2068": "for the other king, Agesipolis, whose father had been an exile, and who was himself very young, and of a mild and unassuming temper, counted for nothing in the state.", "2069": "Agesilaus won over this man also, and made a friend of him;", "2070": "for the two kings dine at the same phiditium, or public table, when they are at Sparta.", "2071": "Knowing Agesipolis, like himself, to be prone to form attachments to young men, he always led the conversation to this subject, and encouraged the young king in doing so;", "2072": "for these love affairs among Lacedæmonians have in them nothing disgraceful, but produce much modest emulation and desire for glory, as has been explained in the Life of Lykurgus.", "2073": "XXI.", "2074": "Being now the most powerful man in Sparta, Agesilaus obtained the appointment of admiral of the fleet for Teleutias, his half-brother;", "2075": "and thereupon making an expedition against Corinth, he made himself master of the long walls by land, through the assistance of his brother at sea.", "2076": "Coming thus upon the Argives, who then held Corinth, in the midst of their Isthmian festival, he made them fly just as they had finished the customary sacrifice, and leave all their festive provision behind them.", "2077": "Upon this the Corinthian exiles.", "2078": "who were with him begged him to preside over the games, but this he refused to do, ordering them to celebrate the festival, while he took care that they did so without interruption.", "2079": "After he was gone the Argives returned, and celebrated the Isthmian games over again.", "2080": "Some of the winners on the former occasion now won the prize again, while others were defeated.", "2081": "Agesilaus observed that the Ar­ gives by this act confessed themselves to be cowards, if they set so high a value on presiding at the games, and yet did not dare to fight for it.", "2082": "With regard to such matters he used to think that a middle course was best, and he always was present at the choruses and games at Sparta, taking great interest in their manage­ ment, and not even neglecting the races for boys and for girls;", "2083": "but of some other matters in which most men were interested he seemed to be entirely ignorant.", "2084": "For instance Kallipides, who was esteemed the finest tragic actor in Greece, once met him and spoke to him, after which he swaggered along amongst his train, but finding that no notice was taken of him, he at length asked, uDo you not know me, 0 king?\"", "2085": "Agesilaus at this looked carefully at him, and enquired, \"Are you not Kallipides the player ? \" for so the Lacedæmonians name actors.", "2086": "Again, when he was invited to hear some one imitate the nightingale he answered, \" I have heard the original.", "2087": "\"", "2088": "Menekrates the physician, after having succeeded in curing some cases of sickness which were thought to be desperate, was given the title of Zeus, and used to use this appellation on all occasions in a foolish manner.", "2089": "lie even went so far as to write to Agesilaus in the following terms, \" Menekrates Zens wishes King Agesilaus health.\"", "2090": "To this he answered, \" King Agesilaus wishes Menekrates more sense.", "2091": "\"XXII.", "2092": "While he was encamped in the temple of Hera, near Corinth, watching the soldiers disposing of the captives which they had taken ambassadors came from Thebes to treat for peace with him.", "2093": "He always had borne a grudge against that city, and thinking that this would be a good opportunity to indulge his hatred, he pretended neither to see nor to hear them when they addressed him.", "2094": "But he soon paid the penalty of his insolence;", "2095": "for before the Thebans left him news was brought that an entire mora had been cut to pieces by Iphikrates.", "2096": "This was the greatest disaster which had befallen the Spartans for many years;", "2097": "for they lost a large number of brave and well-equipped citizen F, all heavy-armed hoplites, and that too at the hands of mere mercenary light troops and peltasts.", "2098": "On hearing this Agesilaus at first leaped up to go to their assistance ;", "2099": "but when he heard that they were completely destroyed, he returned to the temple of Hera, and recalling the Boeotian ambassadors, bade them deliver their message.", "2100": "But they now in their turn assumed a haughty demeanour, and made no mention of peace, but merely demanded leave to proceed to Corinth.", "2101": "At this, Agesilaus in a rage answered, \" If you wish to go there to see your friends rejoicing over their success, you will be able to do so in safety to-morrow.\"", "2102": "On the next day he took the ambassadors with him, and marched, laying waste the country as he went, up to the gates of Corinth, where, having thus proved that the Corinthians dared not come out and resent his conduct, he sent the ambassadors into the city.", "2103": "As for himself, he collected the survivors of the mora, and marched back to Lacedæmon, always starting before daybreak, and encamping after sunset, that he might not be insulted by the Arcadians, who bitterly hated the Lacedaemonians and enjoyed their discomfiture.", "2104": "After this at the instance of the Achæans he crossed over into Akarnania with them, where he obtained much plunder, and defeated the Akarnanians in battle.", "2105": "The Achaeans now begged him to remain, and so prevent the enemy from sowing their fields in the winter;", "2106": "but he answered that he should do exactly the reverse, because, if the enemy next year had a good prospect of a harvest, they would be much more inclined to keep the peace than if their fields lay fallow.", "2107": "And this opinion of his was justified by the result;", "2108": "for as soon as the Akarnanians heard that another campaign was threat­ ened, they made peace with the Achæans.", "2109": "XXIII.", "2110": "Konon and Pharnabazus, after their victory in the sea-fight at Knidus, had obtained command of tho seas and began to plunder the coast of Laconia, while the Athenian walls likewise were restored, with money supplied by Pharnabazus for that purpose.", "2111": "These circumstances disposed the Lacedæmonians to make peace with the king of Persia.", "2112": "They consequently sent Antalkidas to Tiribazus to arrange terms, and most basely and wickedly gave up to the king those Greek cities in Asia on behalf of which Agesilaus had fought.", "2113": "Antalkidas, indeed, was his enemy, and his great reason for concluding a peace on any terms was, that war was certain to increase the reputation and glory of Agesilaus.", "2114": "Yet when some one reproached Agesilaus, saying that the Lacedæmonians were Medising,* he answered, “ Nay, say, rather, the Medes (Persians) are Laconising.", "2115": "\"", "2116": "By threats of war he compelled those Greek states who were unwilling to do so to accept the terms of the peace, especially the Thebans;", "2117": "for one of the articles of the peace was, that the Thebans should leave the rest of Bœotia independent, by which of course they wero greatly weakened.", "2118": "This was proved by subsequent events.", "2119": "When Phoebidas, in defiance of law and decency, seized the Kadmeia, or citadel of Thebes, in time of peace, all Greeks cried shame on him, and the Spartans felt especial annoyance at it.", "2120": "The enemies of Agesilaus now angrily enquired of Phœbidas who ordered him to do so, and as his answers hinted at Agesilaus as having sug- -vested the deed, Agesilaus openly declared himself to be on Phoebidas's side, and said that the only thing to bo considered was, whether it was advantageous to Sparta or not;", "2121": "for it was always lawful to render good service to the state, even impromptu and without previous orders.", "2122": "Yet in his talk Agesilaus always set a high value upon justice, calling it the first of all virtues;", "2123": "for he argued that courage would be useless without justice;", "2124": "while if all men were just, there would be no need of courage.", "2125": "When he was informed, “ The pleasure of the great king is so-and-so,\" he was wont to answer,“ How can he be greater than I, unless he be juster ?", "2126": "\"-thus truly pointing out that justice is the real measure of the greatness of kings.", "2127": "When the king of Persia sent him a letter during the peace, offering to become his guest.", "2128": "and friend, he refused to open it, saying that he was satisfied with the friendship existing between the two states, and that while that lasted he required no private bond of union with the king of Persia.", "2129": "However, in his actions he was far from carrying out these professions, but was frequently led into unjust acts by his ambition.", "2130": "In this instance he not only shielded Phœbidas from punishment for what he had done at Thebes, but persuaded Sparta to adopt his crime as its own, and continue to hold the Kadmeia, appointing as the chiefs of the garrison Archias and Leontidas,t by whose means Phœbidas made his way into the citadel.", "2131": "XXIV.", "2132": "This at once gave rise to a suspicion that Phoebidas was merely an agent, and that the whole plot originated with Agesilaus himself, and subsequent events confirmed this view;", "2133": "for as soon as the Thebans drove out the garrison and set free their city, Agesilans made war upon them to avenge the murder of Archias and Leontidas, who had been nominally polemarchs, but in reality despots of Thebes.", "2134": "At this period Agesipolis was dead, and his successor Kleombrotus was despatched into Bœotia with an army;", "2135": "for Agesilaus excused himself from serving in that campaign on the ground of age, as it was forty years since he had first borne arms, and he was consequently exempt by law.", "2136": "The real reason was that he was ashamed, having so lately been engaged in a war to restore the exiled popular party at Phlius, to be seen now attacking the Thebans in the cause of despotism.", "2137": "There was a Lacedœmonian named Sphodrias, one of the faction opposed to Agesilaus, who was established as Spartan governor of the town of Thespiæ, a daring and ambitious man, but hot-headed, and prone to act without due calculation.", "2138": "This man, who longed to achieve dis­ tinction, and who perceived that Phœbidas had made a name throughout Greece by his exploit at Thebes, per­ suaded himself that it would be a much more glorious deed if he were to make himself master of the Peiræus, and so by a sudden attack cut off the Athenians from the sea.", "2139": "It is said that this attempt originated with the Bœotarchs, Pelopidas and Mellon, who sent emissaries to Sphodrias to praise and flatter him, and point out that he alone was capable of conducting so bold an adventure.", "2140": "By this language, and an affectation of sympathy with Lace­ dæmon, these men at length prevailed on him to attempt a most unrighteous deed, and one which required con­ siderable boldness and good fortune to ensure its success.", "2141": "Daylight, however, overtook Sphodrias before he had crossed the Thriasian plain, near Eleusis.", "2142": "All hope of surprising Peiræus by a night attack was now gone, and it is said, also, that the soldiers were alarmed and terror- stricken by certain lights which gleamed from the temples at Eleusis.", "2143": "Sphodrias himself, now that his enterprise had so manifestly failed, lost heart, and after hurriedly seizing some unimportant plunder, led his men back to Thespiæ.", "2144": "Upon this an embassy was sent from Athens to Sparta to complain of the acts of Sphodrias;", "2145": "but on the arrival of the ambassadors at Sparta they found that the government there were in no need of encouragement from without to proceed against Sphodrias, for they Lad already summoned him home to be tried for his life.", "2146": "Sphodrias durst not venture to return to Sparta, for he saw that his fellow-countrymen were angry with him and ashamed of his conduct towards the Athenians, and that they wished rather to be thought fellow-sufferers by his crime than accomplices in it.", "2147": "XXV.", "2148": "Sphodrias had a son, named Kleonymus, who was still quite a youth, and who was beloved by Archi­ damus, the son of Agesilaus.", "2149": "He now assisted this youth, who was pleading his father's cause as best he might, but he could not do so openly, because Sphodrias belonged to the party which was opposed to Agesilaus.", "2150": "When, how­ ever, Kleonymus came to him, and besought him with tears and piteous entreaties to appease Agesilaus, because the party of Sphodrias dreaded him more than any one else, the young man, after two or three days' hesitation, at length, as the day fixed for the trial approached, mus­ tered up courage to speak to his father on the subject, telling him that Kleonymus had begged him to intercede for his father.", "2151": "Agesilaus was well aware of his son's intimacy with Kleonymus, which he had never discouraged;", "2152": "for Kleo­ nymus promised to become as distinguished a man as any in Sparta.", "2153": "He did not on this occasion, however, hold out to his son any hopes of a satisfactory termination of the affair, but said that he would consider what would be the most fitting and honourable course to pursue.", "2154": "After this reply, Archidamus had not the heart to meet Kleonymus, although he had before been accustomed to see him several times daily.", "2155": "This conduct of his plunged the friends of Sphodrias into yet deeper despair of his cause, until Ety­ mokles, one of the friends of Agesilaus, in a conference with them, explained that what Agesilaus really thought about the matter was, that the action itself deserved the greatest censure;", "2156": "but yet that Sphodrias was a brave ener­ getic man, whom Sparta could not afford to lose.", "2157": "Agesilaus used this language out of a desire to gratify his son, and from it Kleonymus soon perceived that Archi­ damus had been true to him in using his interest with his father;", "2158": "while the friends of Sphodrias became much more forward in his defence.", "2159": "Indeed Agesilaus was remarkably fond of children, and an anecdote is related of him, that when his children were very little he was fond of playing with them, and would bestride a reed as if it were a horse for their amusement.", "2160": "When one of his friends found him at this sport, he bade him mention it to no one before he himself became the father of a family.", "2161": "XXVI.", "2162": "Sphodrias was acquitted by the court;", "2163": "and the Athenians, as soon as they learned this, prepared for war.", "2164": "Agesilaus was now greatly blamed, and was charged with having obstructed the course of justice, and having made Sparta responsible for an outrage upon a friendly Greek state, merely in order to gratify the childish caprice of his son.", "2165": "As he perceived that Kleombrotus was unwilling to attack the Thebans, he himself invaded Bœotia, disre­ garding the law under which on a former occasion he had pleaded exemption from military service on account of his age.", "2166": "Here lie fought the Thebans with varying success;", "2167": "for once, when he was being borne out of action wounded, Antalkidas observed to him, “ A fine return you are getting from the Thebans for having taught them how to fight against their will.\"", "2168": "Indeed, the military power of the Thebans at that time was at its height, having as it were been exercised and practised by the many campaigns under­ taken against them by the Lacedæmonians.", "2169": "This was why Lykurgus of old, in his three celebrated rhetras, forbado the Lacedæmonians to fight often with the same people, lest by constant practice they should teach them how to fight.", "2170": "Agesilaus was also disliked by the allies of the Lacedæmonians, because of his hatred of Thebes and his desire to destroy that state, not on any public grounds, but merely on account of his own bitter personal dislike to the Thebans.", "2171": "The allies complained grievously that they, who composed the greater part of the Lacedaemonia.", "2172": "force, should every year be led hither and thither, and exposed to great risks and dangers, merely to satisfy one man's personal pique.", "2173": "Hereupon we are told that Agesi­ laus, desiring to prove that this argument about their composing so large a part of the army was not founded on fact, made use of the following device :", "2174": "-He ordered all the allies to sit down in one body, and made the Lacedæ­ monians sit down separately.", "2175": "Next he gave orders, first that all the potters should stand up;", "2176": "and when they had risen, he ordered the smiths, carpenters, masons, and all the other tradesmen successively to do so.", "2177": "When then nearly all the allies had risen to their feet, the Spartans all remained seated, for they were forbidden to learn or to practise any mechanical art.", "2178": "At this Agesilaus sailed, and said, “ You see, my men, how many more soldiers we send out than you do.", "2179": "\"XXVII.", "2180": "On his return from his campaign against the Thebans, Agesilaus, while passing through Megara, was seized with violent pain in his sound leg, just as he was entering the town-hall in the Acropolis of that city.", "2181": "After this it became greatly swelled and full of blood, and seemed to be dangerously inflamed.", "2182": "A Syracusan physician opened a vein near the ankle, which relieved the pain, but the flow of blood was excessive, and could not be checked, so that he fainted away from weakness, and was in a very dangerous condition.", "2183": "At length the bleeding stopped, and he was conveyed home to Lacedæ­ mon, but he remained ill, and unable to serve in the wars for a long time.", "2184": "During his illness many disasters bofel the Spartans both by land and by sea.", "2185": "Of these, the most important was the defeat at Tegyra, where for the first time they were beaten in a fair fight by the Thebans.", "2186": "The Lacedæmonians were now eager to make peace with all the Greek cities, and ambassadors from all parts of Greece met at Sparta to arrange terms.", "2187": "Among them was Epameinondas, a man who was renowned for his culture and learning, but who had not hitherto given any proof of his great military genius.", "2188": "This man, per­ ceiving that all the other ambassadors were sedulously paying their court to Agesilaus, assumed an independent attitude, and in a speech delivered before the congress declared that nothing kept the war alive except the unjust pretensions of Sparta, who gained strength from the sufferings of the other states, and that no peace could be durable unless such pretensions were laid aside, and Sparta reduced to the equality with the rest of the cities of Greece.", "2189": "XXVIII.", "2190": "Agesilaus, observing that all the represen­ tatives of the Greek states were filled with admiration at this language, and manifested strong sympathy with the speaker, enquired whether he thought it right and just that the cities of Boeotia.", "2191": "should be left independent.", "2192": "Epameinondas quickly and boldly enquired It!", "2193": "answer, whether he thought it right to leave each of the towns in Laconia independent.", "2194": "At this Agesilaus leaped to his feet in a rage, and asked him to state clearly whether he meant to leave Boeotia independent.", "2195": "As Epameinondas in reply merely repeated his question, as to whether Agesilaus meant to leave Laconia independent, Agesilaus became furious, eagerly seized the opportunity to strike the name of Thebes out of the roll of cities with whom peace was being made, and declared war against it.", "2196": "He ratified a treaty of peace with the other Greek cities, and bade their representatives begone, with the remark, that such of their disputes as admitted of settlement must be arranged by peaceful negotiation, and such as could not must be decided by war;", "2197": "but that it was too much trouble for him to act as arbitrator between them in their manifold quarrels and disagreements.", "2198": "Kleombrotus, the other Spartan king, was at this time in the Phokian territory at the head of an army.", "2199": "The Ephors now at once sent orders to him to cross the Theban frontier, while they assembled a force from all the allied cities, who were most reluctant to serve, and objected strongly to the war, yet dared not express their discontent or disobey the Lacedæmonians.", "2200": "Many sinister omens were observed, which we have spoken of in the life of Epameinondas, and Prothous the Laconian openly opposed the whole campaign;", "2201": "yet Agesilaus would not desist, but urged on the war against Thebes, imagining that now, when all the other states were standing aloof, and Thebes was entirely isolated, he had a more favourable opportunity than might ever occur again for destroying that city.", "2202": "The dates of this war seem to prove that it was begun more out of ill-temper than as a consequent of any definite plan ;", "2203": "for the peace was ratified in Lacedaemon with the other cities on the fourteenth of the month Skirophorion;", "2204": "and on the fifth of the next month, Hekatombæon, only twenty days afterwards, the Spartans were defeated at Leuktra.", "2205": "A thousand Lacedæ­ monians perished, among them Kleombrotus the king, and with him the flower of the best families in Sparta.", "2206": "There fell also the handsome son of Sphodrias, Kleonymus, who fought before the king, and was thrice struck to the ground and rose again before he was slain by the Thebans.", "2207": "XXIX.", "2208": "In spite of the unparalleled disaster which had befallen the Lacedæmonians, for the Theban victory was the most complete ever won by one Greek state over another, the courage of the vanquished is nevertheless as much to be admired as that of the victors.", "2209": "Xenophon remarks that the conversation of good and brave men, even when jesting or sitting at table, is always worth remembering, and it is much more valuable to observe how nobly all really brave and worthy men bear themselves when in sorrow and misfortune.", "2210": "When the news of the defeat at Leuktra arrived at Sparta, the city was celebrating the festival of the Gymnopædia, and the chorus of grown men was going through its usual solemnity in the theatre.", "2211": "The Ephors, although the news clearly proved that all was lost and the state utterly ruined, yet would not permit the chorus to abridge its performance, and forbado the city to throw off its festal appearance.", "2212": "They privately communicated the names of the slain to their relatives, but they themselves calmly continued to preside over the contest of the choruses in the theatre, and brought the festival to a close as though nothing unusual had occurred.", "2213": "Next morning, when all men knew who had fallen and who had survived, one might see those whose relations had been slain, walking about in public with bright and cheer­ ful countenances:", "2214": "but of those whose relatives survived, scarce one showed himself in public, but they sat at home with the women, as if mourning for the dead;", "2215": "or if any one of them was forced to come forth, he looked mournful and humbled, and walked with cast-down eyes.", "2216": "Yet more admirable was the conduct of the women, for one might see mothers receiving their sons who had survived the battle with silence and sorrow, while those whose children had fallen proceeded to the temples to return thanks to the gods, and walked about the city with a proud and cheerful demeanour.", "2217": "XXX.", "2218": "Yet, when their allies deserted them, and when the victorious Epameinondas, excited by his success, was expected to invade Peloponnesus, many Spartans remembered the oracle about the lameness of Agesilaus, and were greatly disheartened and cast down, fearing that they had incurred the anger of Heaven, and that the misfortunes of the city were due to their own conduct in having excluded the sound man from the throne, and chosen the lame one;", "2219": "the very thing which the oracle had bidden them beware of doing.", "2220": "Nevertheless, Agesilaus was so powerful in the state, and so renowned for wisdom and courage, that they gladly made use of him as their leader in the war, and also employed him to settle a certain constitutional difficulty which arose about the political rights of the survivors of the battle.", "2221": "They were unwilling to disfranchise all these men, who were so numerous and powerful, because they feared that if so they would raise a revolution in the city.", "2222": "For the usual rule at Sparta about those who survive a defeat is, that they are incapable of holding any office in the state;", "2223": "nor will any one give them his daughter in marriage ;", "2224": "but all who meet them strike them, and treat them with contempt.", "2225": "They hang about the city in a squalid and degraded con­ dition, wearing a cloak patched with pieces of a different colour, and they shave one half of their beards, and let the other half grow.", "2226": "Now, at the present crisis it was thought that to reduce so many citizens to this condition, especially when the state sorely required soldiers, would be an absurd proceeding;", "2227": "and consequently, Agesilaus was appointed lawgiver, to decide upon what was to be done.", "2228": "He neither altered the laws, nor proposed any new ones, but laid down his office of lawgiver at once, with the remark, that the laws must be allowed to sleep for that one day, and afterwards resume their force.", "2229": "By this means he both preserved the laws, retained the services of the citizens for the state, and saved them from infamy.", "2230": "With the intention of cheering up the young men, and enabling them to shake off their excessive despondency, he led an army into Arcadia.", "2231": "He was careful to avoid a battle, but captured a small fort belonging to the people of Mantinea, and overran their territory;", "2232": "thus greatly raising the spirits of the Spartans, who began to pluck up courage, and regard their city as not altogether ruined.", "2233": "XXXI.", "2234": "After this, Epameinondas invaded Laconia with the army of the Thebans and their allies, amounting in all to no less than forty thousand heavy-armed soldiers.", "2235": "Many light troops and marauders accompanied this body, so that the whole force which entered Laconia amounted in all to seventy thousand men.", "2236": "This took place not less than six hundred years after the Dorians had settled in Lacedæmon;", "2237": "and through all that time these were the first enemies which the country had seen ;", "2238": "for no one before this had dared to invade it.", "2239": "Now, however, the Thebans ravaged the whole district with fire and sword, and no one came out to resist them, for Agesilaus would not allow the Lacedæmonians to fight against what Theopompus calls ‘ such a heady torrent of war,' but contented himself with guarding the most important parts of the city itself, disregarding the boastful threats of the Thebans, ,lio called upon him by name to come out and fight for his country, since he was the cause of all its misfortunes, because he had begun the war.", "2240": "Agesilaus was also distracted by the disorderly and excited state of the city itself, for the old men were in an agony of grief, resentment, and wounded honour, while the women could not be kept quiet, but were wrought to frenzy, by hearing the cries of the enemy, and seeing the fires which they lighted.", "2241": "He also suffered much at the thought of his own dishonour;", "2242": "for when he had ascended the throne, Sparta was the greatest and most powerful city in Greece, and now he beheld her shorn of all her glories, and his favourite boast, that no Laconian woman had ever seen the smoke of an enemy'a fire rendered signally untrue.", "2243": "We are told that when some Athenian was disputing with Antalkidas about the bravery of their respective nations, and saying, \"We have often chased you away from the Kephissus,” Antal­ kidas answered, “ Yes, but we have never had to chase you away from the Eurotas.", "2244": "This is like the answer made by some Spartan of less distinction to an Argive, who said, “ Many of you Spartans lie buried in Argive soil,” to which he replied, “ But none of you are buried in Laconia.", "2245": "\"XXXII.", "2246": "We are told at this time Antalkidas was one of the Ephors, and became so much alarmed that he sent his family away to the island of Kythera.", "2247": "Agesilaus, when the enemy attempted to cross the river and force their way into the city, abandoned most part of it, and drew up his forces on the high hills in the centre.", "2248": "At that time the river Eurotas was in high flood, as much snow had fallen, and the excessive cold of the water, as well as the strength of the stream, rendered it hard for the Thebans to cross.", "2249": "Epameinondas marched first, in the front rank of the phalanx;", "2250": "and some of those who were present pointed him out to Agesilaus, who is said to have gazed long at him, saying merely, 0 thou man of great deeds.", "2251": "\"", "2252": "Epameinondas was eager to assault the city itself, and to place a trophy of victory in its streets;", "2253": "but as he could not draw Agesilaus into a battle, he drew off his forces, and again laid waste the country.", "2254": "Meanwhile, in Lace­ daemon itself, a body of two hundred men, of doubtful fidelity, seized the Issorium, where the temple of Artemis stands, which is a strong and easily defensible post.", "2255": "The Lacedæmonians at once wished to attack them, but Age­ silaus, fearing that some deep-laid conspiracy might break out, ordered them to remain quiet.", "2256": "He himself, dressed simply in his cloak, unarmed, and attended only by one slave, went up to the two hundred, and, in a loud voice, told them that they had mistaken their orders;", "2257": "that they had not been ordered to go thither, nor yet to go all together in a body, but that some were to be posted there, pointing to some other place, and the rest elsewhere in the city.", "2258": "They, hearing his commands, were delighted, imagining that their treason was undiscovered, and imme* diately marched to the places which he indicated.", "2259": "Agesi­ laus at once occupied the Issorium with troops which he could trust, and in the ensuing night seized and put to death fifteen of the leaders of the two hundred.", "2260": "Another more important conspiracy was betrayed to him, whoso members, full Spartan citizens, were met together in ono house to arrange revolutionary schemes.", "2261": "At such a crisis it was equally impossible to bring these men to a regular trial, and to allow them to carry on their intrigues.", "2262": "Age­ silaus therefore, after taking the Ephors into his con­ fidence, put them all to death untried, though before that time no Spartan had ever been executed without a trial.", "2263": "As many of the Periœki and helots who had been entrusted with arms escaped out of the city and deserted to the enemy, which greatly disheartened the Spartans, he ordered his servants to visit the quarters of these soldiers at daybreak every morning, and wherever any one was gone, to hide his arms, so that the number of deserters might not be known.", "2264": "We are told by some historians that the Thebans left Laconia because the weather became stormy, and their Arcadian allies began to melt away from them.", "2265": "Others say that they spent three entire months in the country, and laid nearly all of it waste.", "2266": "Theopompus relates that when the Bœotarchs had decided to leave the country, Phrixus, a Spartan, came from Agesilaus and offered them ten talents to be gone, thus paying them for doing what they had long before determined to do of their own accord.", "2267": "XXXIII.", "2268": "I cannot tell, however, how it was that Theo­ pompus discovered this fact, and that no other historian mentions it.", "2269": "All writers agree, nevertheless, in declaring that at this crisis Sparta was saved by Agesilaus, who proved himself superior to party-spirit and desire of per­ sonal distinction, and steadily refused to risk an engage­ ment.", "2270": "Yet he never was able to restore the city to the glorious and powerful condition which it had previously held, for Sparta, like an athlete who has been carefully trained throughout his life, suddenly broke down, and never recovered her former strength and prosperity.", "2271": "It is very natural that this should have happened, for the Spartan constitution was an excellent one for promoting courage, good order, and peace within the city itself;", "2272": "but when Sparta became the head of a great empire to be maintained by the sword, which Lykurgus would have thought a totally useless appendage to a well-governed and prosperous city, it utterly failed.", "2273": "Agesilaus was now too old for active service in tho field, but his son, Archidamus, with some Sicilian mer­ cenary troops which had been sent to the aid of the Spar­ tans by the despot Dionysius, defeated the Arcadians in what was known as the ‘ Tearless Battle,' where he did not lose one of his own men, but slew many of the enemy.", "2274": "This battle strikingly proved the weakness of the city, for in former times the Spartans used to regard it as such a natural and commonplace event for them to conquer their enemies, that they only sacrificed a cock to the gods, while those who had won a victory never boasted of it, and those who heard of it expressed no extravagant delight at the news.", "2275": "When the Ephors heard of the battle at Mantinea, which is mentioned by Thucydides in his history, they gave the messenger who brought the tidings a piece of meat from the public dining-table, as a present for his good news, and nothing more.", "2276": "But now, when the news of this battle reached Sparta, and Archidamus marched triumphantly into the town, all their accustomed reserve broke down.", "2277": "His father was the first to meet him, weeping for joy.", "2278": "After him came the senate, and the elders and women flocked down to the river side, holding up their hands to heaven and giving thanks to the gods for having put away the undeserved reproach of Sparta, and having once more allowed her to raise her head.", "2279": "It is said, indeed, that the Spartans before this battle were so much ashamed of themselves, that they dared not even look their wives in the face.", "2280": "XXXIV.", "2281": "The independence of Messenia had been restored by Epameinondas, and its former citizens col­ lected together from all quarters of Greece.", "2282": "The Lacedæ­ monians dared not openly attack these men, but they felt angry with Agesilaus, because during his reign they had lost so fine a country, as large as Laconia itself, and as fertile as any part of Greece, after having enjoyed the possession of it for so many years.", "2283": "For this reason Agesilaus refused to accept the terms of peace offered by the Thebans.", "2284": "He was so unwilling to give up his nominal claim to Messenia, although he had practically lost that country, that instead of recovering it he very nearly lost Sparta as well, as he was outmanoeuvred by Epameinondas.", "2285": "This happened in the following manner.", "2286": "The people of Mantinea revolted from the Thebans, and solicited aid from the Lacedæmonians.", "2287": "When Epamei­ nondas heard that Agesilaus was marching thither at the head of an army, he eluded the Mantineans by a night march from Tegea, invaded the Lacedæmonian territory, and very nearly succeeded in avoiding the army of Agesi­ laus and catching Sparta defenceless.", "2288": "However, Euthynus of Thespiæ, according to Kallisthenes, or, according to Xenophon, a certain Cretan warned Agesilaus of his danger, upon which he at once sent a mounted mes­ senger to the city with the news, and shortly afterwards marched thither himself.", "2289": "Soon the Thebans appeared, crossed the Eurotas, and assaulted the city with great fury, while Agesilaus, old as he was, defended it with all the spirit and energy of youth.", "2290": "He did not, as on the former occasion, consider that caution would be of any service, but perceived that reckless daring alone could save Sparta.", "2291": "And by incredible daring he did then snatch the city from the grasp of Epameinondas, and set up a trophy of victory, having afforded to the women and children the glorious spectacle of the men of Lacedæmon doing their duty on behalf of the country which reared them.", "2292": "There, too, might Archidamus be seen in the thick of the fight, displaying the courage of a man, and the swiftness of a youth, as he ran to each point where the Spartans seemed likely to give way, and everywhere with a few followers resisted a multitude of the enemy.", "2293": "I think, however, that Isidas, the son of Phœbidas, must have been most admired both by his own countrymen and even by the enemy.", "2294": "He was remarkably tall and handsome, and was just of the age when boyhood merges into manhood.", "2295": "Naked, without either clothes or armour, having just been anointing himself at home, he rushed out of his house, with a sword in one hand and a spear in the other, ran through the front ranks, and plunged among the enemy, striking down all who opposed him.", "2296": "He received not a single wound, either because the gods admired his bravery and protected him, or else because he appeared to his foes to be something more than man.", "2297": "After this exploit we are told that the Ephors crowned him for his bravery, and fined him a thousand drachmas for having fought without his shield.", "2298": "XXXV.", "2299": "A few days afterwards was fought the battle of Mantinea, where, just as Epameinondas was carrying all before him and urging his troops to pursue, Antikrates the Lacedæmonian met him and wounded him, according to Dioskorides with a spear, while the Lacedæmonians to this day call the descendants of Antikrates Machairones, that is, children of the sword, as though he struck him with a sword.", "2300": "Indeed, they regarded Antikrates with such a love and admiration, because of the terror which Epameinondas had struck into their hearts while he was alive, that they decreed especial honours and presents to be bestowed upon him, and granted to his descendants an immunity from taxes and public burdens which is enjoyed at the present day by Kallikrates, one of the descendants of Antikrates.", "2301": "After this battle and the death of Epameinondas the Greek states made peace between one another.", "2302": "When, however, all the other states were swearing to observe the peace, Agesilaus objected to the Messenians, men, he said, without a city, swearing any such oath.", "2303": "The rest, how.", "2304": "ever, raised no objections to the oath of the Messenians, and the Lacedæmonians upon this refused to take any part in the proceedings, so that they alone remained at war, because they hoped to recover the territory of Messenia.", "2305": "Agesilaus was thought an obstinate and headlong man, and insatiable of war, because he took such pains to under­ mine the general peace, and to keep Sparta at war at a time when he was in such distress for money to carry it on, that he was obliged to borrow from his personal friends and to get up subscriptions among the citizens, and when he had much better have allowed the state some repose and watched for a suitable opportunity to regain the country;", "2306": "instead of which, although he had lost so great an empire by sea and land, he yet insisted on continuing his frantic and fruitless efforts to reconquer the paltry territory of Messenia.", "2307": "XXXVI.", "2308": "He still further tarnished his glory by taking service under the Egyptian Tachos.", "2309": "It was thought un­ worthy of a man who had proved himself the bravest and best soldier in Greece, and who had filled all the inhabited world with his fame, to hire himself out to a barbarian rebel, and make a profit of his great name and military reputation, just like any vulgar captain of mercenaries.", "2310": "If, when more than eighty years old, and almost crippled by honourable wounds, he had again placed himself at tho head of a glorious crusade against the Persian on behalf of the liberties of Greece, all men would have admired his spirit, but even then would not entirely have approved of the undertaking;", "2311": "for to make an action noble, time and place must be fitting, since it is this alone that decides whether an action be good or bad.", "2312": "Agesilaus, however, cared nothing for his reputation, and considered that no service undertaken for the good of his country would be dishonourable or unworthy of him, but thought it much more unworthy and dishonourable to sit uselessly waiting for death at home.", "2313": "He raised a body of mercenary troops with the money furnished by Tachos, and set sail, accom­ panied, as in his former expedition, by thirty Spartan counsellors.", "2314": "When he landed in Egypt, the chief generals and ministers of King Tachos at once came to pay their court to him.", "2315": "The other Egyptians also eagerly crowded to see Agesilaus, of whom they had heard so much.", "2316": "When, however, they saw only a little deformed old man, in mean attire, sitting on the grass, they began to ridicule him, and contemptuously to allude to the proverb of the mountain in labour, which brought forth a mouse.", "2317": "They were even more astonished when, of the presents offered to him, he accepted flour, calves, and geese, but refused to receive dried fruits, pastry, and perfumes.", "2318": "When greatly pressed to accept of these things, he ordered them to be given to the helots.", "2319": "Yet we are told by Theophrastes that lie was much pleased with the flowering papyrus, of which garlands are made, becanso of its neat and clean appearance, and he begged for and received some of this plant from the king when he left Egypt.", "2320": "XXXVII.", "2321": "When he joined Tachos, who was engaged in preparing his forces for a campaign, he was disap­ pointed in not receiving the chief command, but being merely appointed to lead the mercenary troops, while Chabrias the Athenian was in command of the fleet, Tachos himself acting as commander-in-chief.", "2322": "This was the first vexatious circumstance which occurred to Age­ silaus;", "2323": "and soon he began to feel great annoyance at the vainglorious swaggering tone of the Egyptian king, which nevertheless he was obliged to endure throughout the whole of a naval expedition which they undertook against the Phœnicians, during which he suppressed his feelings of disgust as well as he could until at last he had an opportunity of showing them.", "2324": "Nektanebis, the cousin of Tachos, and the commander of a large portion of his force, revolted, and caused himself to be proclaimed King of Egypt.", "2325": "He at once sent to Agesilaus begging for his assistance, and he also made the same proposals to Chabrias, offering them great rewards if they would join him.", "2326": "Tachos, hearing of this, also began to supplicate them to stand by him, and Chabrias besought Agesilaus to remain in the service of Tachos, and to act as his friend.", "2327": "To this, however, Agesilaus answered, \"You, Chabrias, have come here on your own responsibility, and are able to act as you please.", "2328": "I was given by Sparta to the Egyptians as their general.", "2329": "It would not become me, therefore, to make war against those whom I was sent to aid, unless my country orders me to do so.\"", "2330": "After ex­ pressing himself thus, he sent messengers to Sparta, with instructions to depreciate Tachos, and to praise Nekta­ nebis.", "2331": "Both these princes also sent embassies to the Lace­ dæmonians, the one begging for aid as their old friend and ally, the other making large promises of future good- will towards them.", "2332": "After hearing both sidos, the Spartans publicly answered the Egyptians, that Agesilaus would decide between them, and they sent him a private despatch, bidding him to do what was best for Sparta.", "2333": "Hereupon Agesilaus and the mercenaries left Tachos, and joined Nektanebis, making the interests of his country the pro­ text for his extraordinary conduct, which we can hardly call anything better than treachery.", "2334": "However, the Lace­ dæmonians regard that course as the most honourable which is the most advantageous to their country, and know nothing of right or wrong, but only how to make Sparta great.", "2335": "XXXVIII.", "2336": "Tachos, deserted by the mercenaries, now fled for his life;", "2337": "but another claimant of the throne arose in the district of Mendes, and made war against Nektane­ bis with an army of one hundred thousand men.", "2338": "Nekta­ nebis, in his talk with Agesilaus, spoke very confidently about this force, saying that they were indeed very numo­ rous, but a mere mixed multitude of rustic recruits, whom he could afford to despise.", "2339": "To these remarks Agesilaus answered, “ It is not their numbers, but their ignorance which I fear, lest we should be unable to deceive them.", "2340": "Stratagems in war consist in unexpectedly falling upon men who are expecting an attack from some other quarter, but a man who expects nothing gives his enemy no oppor­ tunity to take him unawares, just as in wrestling ono cannot throw one's adversary if he stands still.", "2341": "\"The Mendesian soon began to intrigue with Agesilaus, and Nektanebis feared much that he might succeed in detaching him from himself.", "2342": "Consequently, when Age­ silaus advised him to fight as soon as possible, and not prolong the war against men who were indeed inexpe­ rienced in battle, but who were able, from their enormous numbers, to raise vast entrenchments and surround him on every side, he took the exactly opposite course, and retired to a strongly fortified city, of great extent, viewing Age­ silaus with suspicion and fear.", "2343": "Agesilaus was grieved at this, but, feeling ashamed to change sides a second time and so completely fail in his mission, he followed Nekta­ nebis into his fortress.", "2344": "XXXIX.", "2345": "When the enemy advanced and began to build a wall round the city, Nektanebis, fearing the consequences of a siege, was eager to fight, as were also the Greeks, for they were very short of provisions.", "2346": "Agesilaus, however, opposed this design, for which he was heartily abused by the Egyptians, who called him a traitor and the betrayer of their king.", "2347": "He paid but little attention to their slanders, but watched for an opportunity to effect the project which he had conceived.", "2348": "This was as follows:", "2349": "-", "2350": "The enemy were digging a trench round the city, with the intention of completely isolating the garrison and starving it out.", "2351": "When then the two ends of this trench, which was to surround the city, had nearly met, Agesilaus towards evening ordered the Greeks to get under arms, and, proceeding to Nektanebis, said, \" Young man, this is our opportunity.", "2352": "I would not say anything about it before, lest the secret should be divulged.", "2353": "But now the enemy themselves have secured our position by digging this enormous trench;", "2354": "for the part of it which is completed will keep off their superior numbers from us, while upon the ground which still remains unbroken we can fight them on equal terms.", "2355": "Come now, prove yourself a man of courage, charge bravely with us, and save both yourself and your army.", "2356": "Those of the enemy whom we first attack will not be able to resist our onset, and the rest will not be able to reach us because of the trench.", "2357": "\"Nektanebis was surprised at the ingenuity of Agesilaus, placed himself in the midst of the Greeks, and charging with them gained an easy victory.", "2358": "Having once established an ascendancy over the mind of Nektanebis, Agesilaus now proceeded to use the same trick again with the enemy.", "2359": "By alternately retreating and advancing he led them on until he had enticed them into a place between two deep canals.", "2360": "Here he at once formed his troops on a front equal to the space between the canals, and charged the enemy, who were unable to use their numbers to outflank and surround him.", "2361": "After a short resistance they fled.", "2362": "Many were slain, and the rest completely dispersed.", "2363": "XL.", "2364": "This victory secured the throne of Egypt for Nek­ tanebis.", "2365": "He now showed great esteem for Agesilaus, and begged him to remain in Egypt during the winter.", "2366": "Age­ silaus, however, was anxious to return home and assist in the war which was going on there, as he knew that Sparta was in great want of money, and was paying a force of mercenary troops.", "2367": "Nektanebis escorted him out of the country with great honour, giving him many presents, and the sum of two hundred and thirty talents of silver to be used in meeting the expenses of the war.", "2368": "As it was winter, and stormy weather, Agesilaus did not venture to cross the open sea, but coasted along the shores of Libya, as far as a desert spot known as the Harbour of Menelaus, where he died, in the eighty-fourth year of his age, and having been king of Sparta for forty-one years, during thirty of which he was the greatest and most powerful man in Greece, having been looked upon as all but the king of the whole country, up to the time of the battle of Leuktra.", "2369": "It was the Spartan custom, in the case of citizens who died in foreign countries, to pay them the last rites wherever they might be, but to take home the remains of their kings.", "2370": "Consequently the Spartan counsellors enveloped the body in melted wax, as they could not obtain honey, and took it home to Lacedæmon.", "2371": "Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, succeeded him on the throne, and his posterity continued to reign until Agis, the fifth in descent from Agesilaus, was murdered by Leonidas, because he endeavoured to restore the ancient discipline of Sparta,I. TOWARDS Pompeius the Roman people seem to have been disposed from the very first, just as the Prometheus of Aeschylus* was towards his deliverer Hercules, when he says :", "2372": "­ “ Though hateful is the sire, most dear to me the son.\"", "2373": "For neither did the Romans ever display hatred so violent and savage towards any commander as towards Strabo t the father of Pompeius, whom they dreaded, when he was alive, for his military talent, for he was a man most expert in arms;", "2374": "and when he was killed by lightning and his body was carried out to interment they pulled it from the bier on which it was lying and treated it with indignity:", "2375": "nor, on the other hand, did any other Roman besides Pompeius ever receive from the people tokens of affection so strong, or so early, or which grew so rapidly with his good fortune, or abided with him so firmly in his reverses.", "2376": "The cause of their hatred to the father was his insatiable avarice :", "2377": "the causes of their affection to the son were many;", "2378": "his temperate life, his practice in arms, the persuasiveness of his speech, the integrity of his character, and his affability to every man who came in his way, so that there was no man from whom another could ask a favour with so little pain, and no man whose requests another would more willingly labour to satisfy.", "2379": "For in addition to his other endearing qualities, Pompeius could give without seeming to confer a favour, and he could receive with dignity.", "2380": "II.", "2381": "At the beginning also his countenance contributed in no small degree to win the good-will of the people and to secure a favourable reception before he opened his mouth.", "2382": "For the sweetness of his expression was mingled with dignity and kindness, and while he was yet in the very bloom of youth his noble and kingly nature clearly showed itself.", "2383": "There was also a slight falling back of the hair and softness in the expression of his eyes, which produced a resemblance to the likenesses of Alexander, though in­ deed the resemblance was more talked of than real.", "2384": "Accordingly many at first gave him the name, which Pompeius did not object to, whence some in derision called him Alexander.", "2385": "It was in allusion to this that Lucius Philippus,* a consular man, when he was speaking in favour of Pompeius, said it was nothing strange if he who was Philippus loved Alexander.", "2386": "They used to report that Flora the courtesan, when she was now advanced in years, always spoke with pleasure of her intimacy with Pompeius, and said that she could never leave the embrace of Pom­ peius without bearing marks t of the ardour of his passion.", "2387": "Besides this, Flora used to tell that Geminius, one of the companions of Pompeius, conceived a passion for her, and plagued her much with his solicitations, and when she said that for the sake of Pompeius she could not consent, Geminius applied to Pompeius.", "2388": "Now Pompeius, as she told the story, gave Geminius permission, but he never after touched Flora or had a meeting with her, though it was believed that he was attached to her ;", "2389": "and Flora did not take this as most courtesans do, but was ill for a long time through grief and regret for the loss of her lover.", "2390": "And indeed it is said that Flora enjoyed such reputation and was so much talked of, that Cæcilius Metellus, when he was ornamenting the temple of the Dioscuri with statues and paintings, had the portrait of Flora painted and placed in the temple on account of her beauty.", "2391": "The wife of his freedman Demetrius also, who had the greatest influence with Pompeius and left a property of four thousand talents, contrary to his habit he did not treat kindly nor in a manner befitting her free condition :", "2392": "but it was through fear of her beauty, which was irresistible and much talked about, and that he might not appear to be captivated by her.", "2393": "Though he was so exceedingly cautious in such matters and so much on his guard, yet he did not escape the imputations of his enemies on the ground of amours, but he was slanderously accused of commerce with married women and of betraying many of the public interests to gratify them.", "2394": "Of his temperance and simplicity in his way of living the following anecdote is told.", "2395": "On one occasion when he was ill and indisposed to his ordinary food, the physician prescribed a thrush for him.", "2396": "After search had been made and none found, for the season was past, some one observed that one might be found at the house of Lucullus, for he kept them all the year round:", "2397": "“ Well then,\" said Pompeius, “ I suppose if Lucullus were not luxurious, Pompeius could not live;", "2398": "” and without regarding the physician's advice he took something that was ready at hand.", "2399": "This, however, belongs to a later period.", "2400": "III.", "2401": "When he was still quite a youth and was serving under his father, who was opposed to Cinna, he had one Lucius Terentius * for his companion and tent-mate.", "2402": "This Lncius being bribed by Cinna, designed to kill Pompeius, and others were to fire the general's tent.", "2403": "Information of this came to Pompeius while he was at supper, at which, nothing disturbed, he went on drinking more gaily, and showing great signs of affection towards Terentius;", "2404": "but when they were turning in to rest he slipped unobserved from under the tent, and after placing a guard about his father, kept quiet.", "2405": "When Terentius thought the time was come, drawing his sword he got up, and approaching the bed of Pompeius, he struck many blows upon the bed­ covering, supposing that Pompeius was lying there.", "2406": "Upon this there was a great commotion owing to the soldiers' hatred of their general, and there was a movement made towards mutiny by the men beginning to pull down the tents and take their arms.", "2407": "The general, fearing the tumult, did not come near;", "2408": "but Pompeius, going about in the midst of the soldiers, implored them with tears in his eyes, and finally throwing himself on his face before the gate of the camp right in their way, he lay there weeping, and told those who were going out to trample on him, so that every man drew back for very shame, and thus the whole army, with the exception of eight hundred men, changed their design and were reconciled to their com­ mander.", "2409": "IV.", "2410": "Upon the death of Strabo, Pompeius had to defend a prosecution in respect of a charge of peculation against his father.", "2411": "He detected one of his freedmen in having appropriated most of the property, and proved it to the magistrates;", "2412": "but he was himself accused of having in his possession hunting nets and books which were taken among the plunder at Asculum.*", "2413": "He received these things from his father when he took Asculum, but he lost them after his return to Rome, when the guards of Cinna broke into his house and plundered it.", "2414": "He had many preliminary contests with the accuser before the trial commenced, in which, by showing himself to possess an acuteness and firmness above his years, he got great reputation and popu­ larity, so that Antistius,* who was praetor and presided at that trial, conceived a great affection for Pompeius, and offered him his daughter to wife, and spoke about it to his friends.", "2415": "Pompeius accepted the proposal, and an agree­ ment was secretly made between them;", "2416": "but yet the matter did not fail to be generally known by reason of the parti­ zanship of Antistius.", "2417": "When at last Antistius declared the votes of the judices to be for his acquittal, the people, as if a signal had been concerted, called out the name Talasius, † which, pursuant to an old custom, they are used to utter on the occasion of a marriage.", "2418": "This ancient custom, they say, had the following origin:", "2419": "When the daughters of the Sabines had come to Rome to see the games, and the noblest among the Romans were carrying them off to be their wives, some goatherds and herdsmen of mean condition took upon their shoulders a tall hand­ some maid and were carrying her off.", "2420": "In order, however, that none of the better sort who might fall in with them should attempt to take the maid from them, they called out as they ran along that she was for Talasius (now Talasius was a man of rank and much beloved), so that those who heard the cry clapped their hands and shouted as being pleased at what the men were doing and com­ mending them for it.", "2421": "From this time forth, as the story goes, inasmuch as the marriage of Talasius turned out to be a happy one, it is usual to utter the same expression by way of merriment at the occasion of a marriage.", "2422": "This is the most probable story among those which are told about the name Talasius.", "2423": "However, a few days after the trial Pompeius married Antistia.V.", "2424": "Having gone to Cinna ‡ to the camp, Pompeius be­ came alarmed in consequence of some charge and false accusation, and he quickly stole out of the way.", "2425": "On his disappearing, a rumour went through the camp and a report that Cinna had murdered the young man, where­ upon the soldiers, who had long been weary of him and hated their general, made an assault upon him.", "2426": "Cinna attempted to escape, but he was overtaken by a centurion, who pursued him with his naked sword.", "2427": "Cinna fell down at the knees of the centurion, and offered him his seal ring, which was of great price;", "2428": "but the centurion with great contempt replied:", "2429": "“ I am not going to seal a con­ tract, but to punish an abominable and unjust tyrant,\" and so killed him.", "2430": "Cinna thus perished, but he was suc­ ceeded in the direction of affairs by Carbo, a still more furious tyrant than himself, who kept the power in his hands till Sulla advanced against him, to the great joy of the most part, who in their present sufferings thought even a change of masters no small profit.", "2431": "To such a con­ dition had calamities brought the state, that men despairing of freedom sought a more moderate slavery.", "2432": "VI.", "2433": "Now about this time Pompeius was tarrying in Picenum in Italy, for he had estates.", "2434": "there, but mainly because he liked the cities, which were well disposed and friendly towards him by reason of their ancient connection with his father.", "2435": "Seeing that the most distinguished and chief of the citizens were leaving their property and flock­ ing from all sides to Sulla's camp as to a harbour of refuge, Pompeius did not think it becoming in him to steal away to Sulla like a fugitive, nor without bringing some contribution, nor yet as if he wanted help, but he thought that he should begin by doing Sulla some service and so approach with credit and a force.", "2436": "Accordingly he attempted to rouse the people of Picenum, who readily listened to his proposals, and paid no attention to those who came from Carbo.", "2437": "A certain Vindius having re­ marked that Pompeius had just quitted school to start up among them as a popular leader, the people were so infu­ riated that they forthwith fell on Vindius and killed him.", "2438": "Upon this Pompeius, who was now three and twenty years of age, without being appointed general by any one, but himself assuming the command in Auximum,* a large city, placing a tribunal in the forum and by edict ordering two brothers Ventidii who were among the chief persons in the place and were opposing him on behalf of Carbo, to quit the city, began to enlist soldiers, and to appoint centurions and officers over them, and he went to all the surrounding cities and did the same.", "2439": "All who were of Carbo's party got up and quitted the cities, but the rest gladly put themselves in the hands of Pompeius, who thus in a short time raised three complete legions, and having supplied himself with provisions and beasts of burden and waggons and everything else that an army requires, advanced towards Sulla, neither hurrying nor yet content with passing along unobserved, but lingering by the way to harass the enemy, and endeavouring to detach from Carbo every part of Italy that he visited.", "2440": "VII.", "2441": "Now there rose up against him three hostile generals at once, Carinna,† and Clœlίus and Brutus, not all in front, nor yet all from the same quarter, but they surrounded him with three armies, with the view of completely destroying him.", "2442": "Pompeius was not alarmed, but getting all his force together he attacked one of the armies, that of Brutus, placing in the front his cavalry, among whom he himself was.", "2443": "From the side of the enemy the Celtæ rode out to meet him, when Pompeius with spear in hand struck the first and strongest of them and brought him down;", "2444": "on which the rest fled and put the infantry also into confusion, so that there was a general rout.", "2445": "Hereupon the generals quarrelled among themselves and retired, as each best could, and the cities took the part of Pompeius, seeing that the enemy had dispersed in alarm.", "2446": "Next came Scipio‡the consul against him, but before the lines had come close enough to discharge their javelins, the soldiers of Scipio saluted those of Pompeius and changed sides, and Scipio made his escape.", "2447": "Finally, near the river Arsis,* Carbo himself attacked Pompeius with several troops of horse, but Pompeius bravely stood the attack, and putting them to flight pursued and drove all of them upon difficult ground where no cavalry could act;", "2448": "and the men, seeing that there was no hope of saving themselves, surrendered with their arms and horses.", "2449": "VIII.", "2450": "Sulla had not yet received intelligence of these events, but upon the first news and reports about Pompeius, being alarmed at his being among so many hostile generals of such reputation, he made haste to relieve him.", "2451": "Pompeius being informed that Sulla was near, ordered his officers to arm the forces and to display them in such manner that they might make the most gallant and splendid appearance to the Imperator, for he expected to receive great honours from him;", "2452": "and he got more than he expected.", "2453": "For when Sulla saw him approaching and his army standing by, admirable for the brave appearance of the men and elated and rejoicing in their success, he leapt down from his horse, and being addressed, according to custom, by the title of Imperator, he addressed Pompeius in return by the title of Imperator, though nobody would have expected that Sulla would give to a young man who was not yet a member of the Senate, the title for which he was fighting against the Scipios and the Marii.", "2454": "And indeed everything else was in accordance with the first greeting, for Sulla used to rise from his seat as Pompeius approached and take his vest from his head, which he was not observed to do generally to any other person, though there were many distinguished men about him.", "2455": "Pompeius, however, was not made vain by these marks of distinction, but on being immediately sent into Gaul by Bulla, where Metellus* commanded and appeared to be doing nothing correspondent to his means, Pompeius said it was not right to take the command from a man who was his senior and superior in reputation;", "2456": "however he said he was ready to carry on the war in conjunction with Metellus, if he had no objection, in obedience to his orders and to give him his assistance.", "2457": "Metellus accepted the proposal and wrote to him to come, on which Pompeius entering Gaul, performed noble exploits, and he also fanned into a flame again and warmed the warlike and courageous temper of Metellus, which was now near becoming extinct through old age, as the liquid, heated stream of copper by flowing about the hard, cold metal is said to soften and to liquefy it into its own mass better than the fire.", "2458": "But as in the case of an athletet who has obtained the first place among men and has gloriously vanquished in every contest, his boyish victories are made of no account and are not registered;", "2459": "so the deeds which Pompeius then accomplished, though of themselves extraordinary, yet as they were buried under the number and magnitude of his subsequent struggles and wars, I have been afraid to disturb them, lest if we should dwell too long on his first exploits, we should miss the acts and events which are the most important and best show the character of the man.", "2460": "IX.‡", "2461": "Now when Sulla was master of Italy and was pro­ claimed Dictator, he rewarded the other officers and generals by making them rich and promoting them to magistracies and by granting them without stint and with readiness what they asked for.", "2462": "But as he admired Pompeius for his superior merit and thought that he would be a great support to his own interests, he was anxious in some way to attach him by family relations.", "2463": "Metella, the wife of Sulla, had also the same wish, and they persuaded Pompeius to put away Antistia and to take to wife Aemilia, the step-daughter of Bulla, the child of Metella by Scaurus, who was then living with her husband and was pregnant.", "2464": "This matter of the marriage was of a tyrannical character, and more suited to the interests of Sulla than conformable to the character of Pompeius, for Aemilia, who was pregnant, was taken from another to be married to him, and Antistia was put away with dishonour and under lamentable cir­ cumstances, inasmuch as she had just lost her father also, and that, too, on her husband's account;", "2465": "for Antistius was murdered in the Senate-house because he was considered to be an adherent of Sulla for the sake of Pompeius;", "2466": "and the mother of Antistia having witnessed all this put an end to her life, so that this misfortune was added to the tragedy of the marriage;", "2467": "and in sooth another besides, for Aemilia herself died immediately afterwards in childbirth in the house of Pompeius.X.", "2468": "After this, news arrived that Perpenna* was secur­ ing Sicily for himself, and that the island was supplying to those who remained of the opposite faction a point for concentrating their forces;", "2469": "for Carbo † was afloat in those parts with a navy, and Domitius had fallen upon Libya, and many other fugitives of note were crowding there, who had escaped from the proscriptions.", "2470": "Against these Pompeius was sent with a large force:", "2471": "and Perpenna immediately evacuated Sicily upon his arrival.", "2472": "Pompeius relieved the cities which had been harshly treated, and behaved kindly to them all except to the Mamertini in Messene.", "2473": "For when the Mamertini protested against the tribunal and the Roman adminis­ tration of justice, on the ground that there was an old Roman enactment which forbade their introduction, “Won’t you stop,\" said he, \"citing laws to us who have our swords by our sides?”", "2474": "It was considered also that Pompeius triumphed over the misfortunes of Carbo in an inhuman manner.", "2475": "For if it was necessary to put Carbo to death, as perhaps it was, he ought to have been put to death as soon as he was taken, and then the act might have been imputed to him who gave the order.", "2476": "But Pompeius produced in chains a Roman who had three times been Consul, and making him stand in front of the tribunal while he was sitting, sat in judgment on him, to the annoyance and vexation of those who were present;", "2477": "after which he ordered him to be removed and put to death.", "2478": "They say that when Carbo had been dragged off, seeing the sword already bared, he begged them to allow him to retire for a short time as his bowels were disordered.", "2479": "Caius Oppius,* the friend of Caesar, says that Pompeius behaved inhumanly to Quintus Valerius also;", "2480": "for Pompeius, who knew that Valerius was a learned man and a particular lover of learning, embraced him, and after walking about with him and questioning him about what he wanted to know, and getting his answer, he ordered his attendants to take Valerius away and immediately put him to death.", "2481": "But when Oppius is speaking of the enemies or friends of Cæsar, it is necessary to be very cautious in believing what he says.", "2482": "Now as to those enemies of Sulla who were of the greatest note and were openly taken, Pompeius of necessity punished them;", "2483": "but as to the rest he allowed as many as he could to escape detection, and he even aided some in getting away.", "2484": "Pompeius had determined to punish the inhabitants of Himera which had sided with the enemy;", "2485": "but Sthenis the popular leader having asked for a conference with him, told Pompeius that he would not do right, if he let the guilty escape and punished the innocent.", "2486": "On Pompeius asking who the guilty man was, Sthenis replied, it was himself, for he had persuaded those citizens who were his friends, and forced those who were his enemies.", "2487": "Pompeius admiring the bold speech and spirit of the man pardoned him first and then all the rest.", "2488": "Hearing that his soldiers were committing excesses on the march, he put a seal on their swords, and he who broke the seal was punished.", "2489": "XI.", "2490": "While he was thus engaged in Sicily and settling the civil administration, he received a decree of the Senate and letters from Sulla which contained an order for him to sail to Libya and vigorously oppose Domitius,* who had got together a power much larger than that with which Marius no long time back had passed over from Libya to Italy and put all affairs at Rome in con­ fusion by making himself a tyrant after having been a fugitive.", "2491": "Accordingly making his preparations with all haste Pompeius left in command in Sicily Memmius, t his sister's husband, and himself set sail with a hundred and twenty large ships, and eight hundred transports which conveyed corn, missiles, money, and engines.", "2492": "On his landing with part of his vessels at Utica and the rest at Carthage, seven thousand men deserted from the enemy and came over to him;", "2493": "he had himself six complete legions.", "2494": "It is said that a ludicrous thing occurred here.", "2495": "Some soldiers having fallen in with a treasure, as it seems, got a large sum of money.", "2496": "The matter becoming known, all the rest of the soldiers got a notion that the place was full of money, which they supposed to have been hid during the misfortunes of the Carthaginians.", "2497": "The consequence was that Pom­ peius could do nothing with the soldiers for many days while they were busy with looking after treasure, but he went about laughing and looking on so many thou­ sands all at one time digging and turning up the ground, till at last the men were tired and told their commander to lead them were he pleased, as they had been punished enough for their folly.", "2498": "XII.", "2499": "Domitius had posted himself to oppose Pompeius, with a ravine in his front which was difficult to pass and rough;", "2500": "but a violent rain accompanied with wind commenced in the morning and continued, so that Domitius giving up his intention of fighting on that day ordered a retreat.", "2501": "Pompeius taking advantage of this oppor­ tunity advanced rapidly and began to cross the ravine.", "2502": "But the soldiers of Domitius were in disorder and con­ fusion, and what resistance they offered was neither made by the whole body nor yet in any regular manner :", "2503": "the wind also veered round and blew the storm right in their faces.", "2504": "However the storm confused the Romans also, for they did not see one another clearly, and Pom­ peius himself had a narrow escape with his life, not being recognised by a soldier to whom he was somewhat slow in giving the word on being asked for it.", "2505": "Having repulsed the enemy with great slaughter (for it is said that out of twenty thousand only three thousand escaped) they saluted Pompeius with the title of Imperator.", "2506": "But Pompeius said that he would not accept the honour, so long as the enemy's encampment was standing, and if they thought him worthy of this title they must first destroy the camp, upon which they forthwith rushed against the rampart, and Pompeius fought without a helmet for fear of what just had happened.", "2507": "The camp was taken and Domitius fell.", "2508": "Some of the cities imme­ diately submitted, and others were taken by storm.", "2509": "Pompeius also made a prisoner of Iarbas,* one of the kings, who had sided with Domitius, and he gave his kingdom to Hiempsal.", "2510": "Availing himself of his suc­ cess and the strength of his army he invaded Numidia.", "2511": "After advancing many days' march and subduing all whom he met with, and firmly establishing the dread of the Romans among the barbarians which had now somewhat subsided, he said that he ought not to leave even the wild beasts of Libya, without letting them have some experience of the strength and courage of the Romans.", "2512": "Accordingly he spent a few days in hunting lions and elephants ;", "2513": "* and in forty days in all, as it is said, he defeated his enemies, subdued Libya, and settled all the affairs of the kings, being then in his four and twentieth year.", "2514": "XIII.", "2515": "On his return to Utica he received letters from Sulla, with orders to disband the rest of the army, and to wait there with one legion for his successor in the com­ mand.", "2516": "Pompeius was annoyed at this and took it ill, though he did not show it;", "2517": "but the army openly expressed their dissatisfaction, and when Pompeius requested them to advance, they abused Sulla, and they said they would not let Pompeius be exposed to danger without them, and they advised him not to trust the tyrant.", "2518": "At first Pom­ peius endeavoured to mollify and quiet them, but finding that he could not prevail, he descended from the tribunal and went to his tent weeping.", "2519": "But the soldiers laid hold of him and again placed him on the tribunal, and a great part of the day was spent in the soldiers urging him to stay and be their leader, and in Pompeius entreating the soldiers to be obedient and not to mutiny, till at last, as they still urged him and drowned his voice with their cries, he swore he would kill himself, if they forced him;", "2520": "and so at last with great difficulty they were induced to stop.", "2521": "Sulla at first received intelligence that Pompeius had revolted, on which he said to his friends, it was his fate now that he was old to fight with boys, alluding to the fact that Marius, who was very young, gave him most trouble, and brought him into the extremes!", "2522": "danger;", "2523": "but on hearing the true state of affairs, and perceiving that everybody with right good will was eager to receive Pom­ peius and to escort him, he made haste to outdo them.", "2524": "Accordingly he advanced and met Pompeius, and receiving him with all possible expressions of good-will, he saluted him with a loud voice by the name of Magnus,* and he bade those who were present to address him in the same way.", "2525": "The word Magnus means Great.", "2526": "Others say that it was in Libya first that the whole army with acclamation pro­ nounced the name, and that it obtained strength and currency by being confirmed by Bulla.", "2527": "But Pompeius himself, after everybody else, and some time later when he was sent into Iberia as proconsul against Sertorius, began to call himself in his letters and edicts Magnus Pompeius;", "2528": "for the name was no longer invidious when people had been made familiar with it.", "2529": "And here one may justly admire and respect the old Romans, who requited with such appellations and titles not success in war and battles only, but honoured therewith political services and merits also.", "2530": "Two men accordingly the people proclaimed Maximi, which means the Greatest;", "2531": "Valerius,† because he reconciled the senate to the people when there was a misunderstanding between them;", "2532": "and Fabius Rullus,t because he ejected from the senate certain rich persons the children of freedmen who had been enrolled in the list of senators.", "2533": "XIV.", "2534": "After this Pompeius asked for a triumph, but Bulla opposed his claim:", "2535": "for the law gives a triumph to a consul or to a praetor* only, but to no one else.", "2536": "And this is the reason why the first Scipio, after defeating the Carthaginians in greater and more important contests in Iberia, did not ask for a triumph, for he was not consul, nor yet praetor.", "2537": "Sulla considered that if Pompeius, who was not yet well bearded, should enter the city in triumph, he who, by reason of his age, was not yet a member of the senate, both his own office and the honour given to Pom­ peius would be exposed to much obloquy.", "2538": "Sulla made these remarks to Pompeius, to show that he did not intend to let him have a triumph, but would resist him and check his ambition, if he would not listen to reason.", "2539": "Pompeius, however, was not cowed, but he told Sulla to reflect, that more men worship the rising than the setting sun, intending him to understand that his own power was on the increase, but that the power of Sulla was diminishing and fading away.", "2540": "Bulla did not distinctly hear these words, but observing that those who did hear them, by looks and gestures expressed their astonishment, he asked what it was that Pompeius had said.", "2541": "When he heard what it was, he was confounded at the boldness of Pompeius, and called out twice, “ Let him triumph! \"", "2542": "Now many persons were annoyed, and expressed their dissatisfaction at the triumph, on which Pompeius, wishing to annoy them still more, it is said, made preparation for entering the city in a car drawn by four elephants,t for he brought from Libya many of the king's elephants that he had taken;", "2543": "but as the gate was too narrow, he gave up his project and con­ tented himself with horses.", "2544": "The soldiers, who had not obtained as much as they expected, were ready to make a disturbance and impede the triumph, but Pompeius said that he cared not for it, and would rather give up the triumph than humour them;", "2545": "whereupon Servilius,* a man of distinction, who had made most opposition to the triumph of Pompeius, said, Now he perceived that Pompeius was really Great and was worthy of the triumph.", "2546": "It is also certain that he might then have been easily admitted into the senate, if he had chosen;", "2547": "but he showed no eagerness for it, seeking, as they say, reputation from what was unusual.", "2548": "For it was nothing surprising if Pompeius were a senator before the age, but it was a most distinguished honour for him to triumph before he was a senator.", "2549": "Another thing also gained him the good-will of the many in no small degree, for the people were delighted at his being reviewed among the Equites after the triumph.", "2550": "XV.", "2551": "Sulla t was annoyed to see to what a height of reputation and power Pompeius was advancing, but as he was ashamed to attempt to check his career he kept quiet.", "2552": "However, when Pompeius had brought about the election of Lepidus as consul in spite of Sulla and against his wish, by canvassing for Lepidus, and by employing the affection of the people towards himself to induce them to favour Lepidus, Bulla seeing Pompeius retiring with the crowd through the Forum, said, \" I see, young man, that you are pleased with your victory:", "2553": "and indeed how can it be otherwise than generous and noble, for Lepidus, the vilest of men, to be declared consul before Catulus the best, through your management of the people ?", "2554": "However, it is time for you not to slumber, but to attend to affairs, for you have strengthened your rival against yourself.\"", "2555": "Bulla.", "2556": "showed mainly by his testament that he was not well disposed to Pompeius, for he left legacies to his other friends, and made them his son's guardians, but he passed over Pompeius altogether.", "2557": "But Pompeius took this very quietly, and behaved on the occasion as a citizen should do;", "2558": "and accordingly, when Lepidus and some others were putting impediments in the way of the body being interred in the Field of Mars, and were not for allowing the funeral to be public, Pompeius brought his aid, and gave to the interment both splendour and security.", "2559": "XVI.", "2560": "As soon as Sulla's death made his prophetic warnings manifest, and Lepidus was attempting to put himself in Sulla’s place, not by any circuitous movement or contrivance, but by taking up arms forthwith, and again stirring up and gathering round him the remnants of the factions which had long been enfeebled and had escaped from Sulla;", "2561": "and his colleague Catulus, to whom the most honest and soundest part of the Senate and the people attached themselves, was the first of the Romans of the day for reputation of temperance and integrity, but was considered to be better adapted for the conduct of civil than of military affairs, and circumstances themselves were calling for Pompeius, he did not hesitate what course to take, but attaching himself to the optimates,* he was appointed commander of a force to oppose Lepidus, who had already stirred up a large part of Italy and held with an army under the command of Brutus, Gaul within the Alps.", "2562": "Now Pompeius easily defeated the rest whom he attacked, but at Mutinat in Gaul he sat down for some time opposite to Brutus, while Lepidus having hurried on to Rome and posted himself before the walls was demand­ ing a second consulship and terrifying the citizens with a numerous army.", "2563": "But the alarm was ended by a letter from Pompeius, who had brought the war to a fortunate issue without a battle.", "2564": "For Brutus, whether it was that he gave up his force himself or was betrayed by his army changing sides, surrendered his person to Pompeius and with some horsemen as an escort retired to one of the small towns near the Padus, where after the interval of a single day he was put to death by Geminius, whom Pompeius sent to him;", "2565": "and Pompeius was much blamed for this.", "2566": "For at the very commencement of the affair of the army changing sides, he wrote to the Senate that Brutus* had voluntarily surrendered, and he then sent another letter in which he criminated the man after he was put to death This Brutus was the father of the Brutus who together with Cassius killed Cæsar, a man who neither fought nor died like his father, as is told in his Life.", "2567": "As soon as Lepidus was driven from Italy, he made his escape into Sardinia, where he fell sick and died of vexation, not at the state of affairs, as they say, but from finding some writing by which he discovered that his wife had committed adultery.", "2568": "XVII.", "2569": "But a general, Sertorius,t who in no respect resembled Lepidus, was in possession of Iberia and was hovering over the other Romans, a formidable adversary;", "2570": "for the civil wars had concentrated themselves as in a final disease in this one man, who had already destroyed many of the inferior commanders, and was then engaged with Metellus Pius, who was indeed a distinguished soldier and of great military ability, but owing to old age was con­ sidered to be following up the opportunities of war some what tardily, and was anticipated in his plans by the quickness and rapidity of Sertorius, who attacked him at all hazards and somewhat in robber fashion, and by his ambuscades and circuitous movements confounded a man well practised in regular battles and used to command a force of heavy-armed soldiers trained to close fighting.", "2571": "Upon this Pompeius, who had an army under his command, bestirred himself to be sent out to support Metellus;", "2572": "and though Catulus ordered him to disband his force he would not obey, but kept under arms in the neighbourhood of the city continually inventing excuses, until the command was given to him on the proposal of Lucius Philippus.", "2573": "It was on this occasion, as it is said, that some one in the Senate asked Philippus with some surprise, if he thought that Pompeius ought to be sent out as Proconsul,.", "2574": "and Philippus replied, “ Not as Proconsul, as I think, but in place of the Consuls,\" meaning that both the consuls of that year were good for nothing.", "2575": "XVIII.", "2576": "When Pompeius arrived in Iberia, as it usually happens with the reputation of a new commander, he gave the people great hopes, and the nations which were not firmly attached to the party of Sertorius began to stir themselves and change sides;", "2577": "whereupon Sertorius gave vent to arrogant expressions against Pompeius, and scoffingly said, he should only need a cane and a whip for this youth, if he were not afraid of that old woman, meaning Metellus.", "2578": "However he conducted his military operations with more caution, as in fact he kept a close watch on Pompeius and was afraid of him.", "2579": "For con­ trary to what one would have expected, Metellus.", "2580": "had become very luxurious in his mode of life and had com­ pletely given himself up to pleasure, and there had been all at once a great change in him to habits of pride and extravagance, so that this also brought Pompeius a surpass­ ing good-will and reputation, inasmuch as he maintained a frugal mode of living, a thing that cost him no great pains, for he was naturally temperate and well regulated in his desires.", "2581": "Though there were many vicissitudes in the war, the capture of Lauron by Sertorius gave Pompeius most annoyance;", "2582": "for while he supposed that Sertorius was surrounded, and had uttered certain boasting expres­ sions, all at once it appeared that he himself was completely hemmed in, and as for this reason he was afraid to stir, he saw the city burnt before his face.", "2583": "But he defeated, near Valentia, Herennius and Perpenna, who were men of military talent, and among others had fled to Sertorius and served under him;", "2584": "and he slaughtered above ten thousand of their men.XIX.", "2585": "Elated by this success, and full of great designs, he hastened to attack Sertorius himself, in order that Metellus might not share the victory.", "2586": "They engaged on the banks of the Sucro, though it was near the close of day, both parties fearing the arrival of Metellus, one wish­ ing to fight by himself, and the other wishing to have only one opponent.", "2587": "The issue of the battle was doubtful, for one wing was victorious on each side;", "2588": "but of the two commanders-in-chief Sertorius got the more honour, for he put to flight the enemy who were opposed to him.", "2589": "A man of tall stature, an infantry soldier, attacked Pompeius, who was on horseback;", "2590": "and as they closed and came to a- struggle, the blows of the swords fell on the hands of both, but not with the same effect;", "2591": "for Pompeius was only wounded, but he cut off the man's hand.", "2592": "Now, as many men rushed upon Pompeius, and the rout had already begun, he escaped, contrary to all expectation, by quitting his horse, which had trappings of gold and decorations of great value;", "2593": "for while the enemy were dividing the booty and fighting about it with one another, they were left behind in the pursuit.", "2594": "At daybreak both commanders again placed their forces in order of battle, with the intention of securing the victory, but when Metellus approached, Sertorius retreated and his army dispersed.", "2595": "For the fashion of his men was to disperse and again to come together, so that Sertorius often wandered about alone, and often appeared again at the head of one hundred and fifty thousand men, like a winter-torrent suddenly swollen.", "2596": "Now, when Pompeius went to meet Metellus after the battle, and they were near one another, he ordered his lictors to lower their fasces out of respect to Metellus as the superior in rank.", "2597": "But Metellus would not allow this, and in all other respects he behaved with considera­ tion to Pompeius, not assuming any superiority on tho ground of being a consular and the elder, except that when the two armies encamped together the watchword for both armies was given out by Metellus;", "2598": "but the two armies generally encamped apart.", "2599": "For the enemy used to cut off their communications and beparate them, being fertile", "2600": "In stratagems, and skilful in showing himself in many quarters in a short time, and in leading from one combat to another.", "2601": "Finally, by cutting off their supplies, plun­ dering the country, and getting the command of the sea, he drove both Pompeius and Metellus from that part of Iberia which was under him, and they were compelled to fly to other provinces through want of provisions.", "2602": "XX.", "2603": "Pompeius having spent most of his own property and applied it to the purposes of the war, demanded money of the senate, and said that he would come to Italy with his army if they did not send it.", "2604": "Lucullus, who was then consul, being at variance with Pompeius, and intriguing to get the command in the Mithridatic war for himself, bestirred himself to get money sent for fear of letting Bompeius have a reason for leaving Sertorius, and attacking Mithridates, which he wished to do, for Mithridates was considered to be an opponent whom it would be an honour to oppose and easy to vanquish.", "2605": "In the meantime, Ser­ torius.", "2606": "was assassinated by his friends, of whom Perpenna was the chief leader, and he attempted to do what Ser­ torius had done, having indeed the same troops and means, but not equal judgment for the management of them.", "2607": "Now Pompeius immediately advanced against Perpenna, and perceiving that he was foundering in his affairs, he sent down ten cohorts into the plain, as a bait, and gave them orders to disperse as if they were flying.", "2608": "When Perpenna had attacked the cohorts, and was engaged in the pursuit, Pompeius appeared in full force, and joining battle, gave the enemy a complete defeat.", "2609": "Most of the officers fell in the battle;", "2610": "but Perpenna was brought to Pompeius, who ordered him to be put to death, in which he did not show any ingratitude, nor that he had forgotten what had happened in Sicily, as some say, but he displayed great prudence and a judgment that was advantageous to the commonweal.", "2611": "For Perpenna, who had got pos­ session of the writings of Sartorius, offered to produce letters from the most powerful men in Rome, who being desirous to disturb the present settlement and to change the constitution, invited Sertorius to Italy.", "2612": "Now Pom­ peius, apprehending that this might give rise to greater wars than those which were just ended, put Perpenna to death, and burnt the letters without even reading them.", "2613": "XXI.", "2614": "After staying- long enough to extinguish the chief disturbances, and to quiet and settle those affairs which were in the most inflammatory state, he led his army back to Italy, and happened to arrive at the time when the servile war t was at its height.", "2615": "This was the reason why Crassus the commander urged on the hazard of a battle, which he gained, with the slaughter of twelve thousand three hundred of the enemy.", "2616": "Fortune, however, in a manner adopted Pompeius into this success also, for five thousand men who escaped from the battle fell in his way, all of whom he destroyed, and he took the oppor­ tunity of writing first to the senate, to say that Crassus indeed had conquered the gladiators in a pitched battle, but he had pulled up the war by the roots.", "2617": "And this was agreeable to the Romans to hear, owing to their good-will towards Pompeius, and also to speak of.", "2618": "As to Iberia and Sertorius, no one even in jest would have said that the conquest was due to any one else than Pompeius.", "2619": "But though the man was in such repute, and such expectations were entertained of him, there was still some suspicion and fear that he would not disband his army, but would make his way by arms and sovereign power straight to the polity of Sulla.", "2620": "Accordingly, those who through fear ran to greet him on the way, were as many as those who did it from good-will.", "2621": "But when Pompeius had removed this suspicion also by declaring that he would disband his army after the triumph, there still remained one subject of reproach for those who envied him, that he attached himself more to the people than to the senate, and that he had determined to restore the authority of the tribunate, which Sulla had destroyed, and to court the favour of the many, which was true.", "2622": "For there was nothing for which the people were more madly passionate, and nothing which they more desired, than to see that magistracy again, so that Pompeius considered the opportunity for this poli­ tical measure a great good fortune, as he could not have found any other favour by which to requite the good-will of the citizens, if another had anticipated him in this.", "2623": "XXII.", "2624": "Now after a second triumph * and the consulship were voted to him, Pompeius was not for this reason con­ sidered an object of admiration and a great man;", "2625": "but the people considered it a proof of his distinction, that Crassus, though the richest of all who were engaged in public life, and the most powerful speaker and the greatest man, and though he despised Pompeius and everybody else, did not venture to become a candidate for the consulship till he had applied to Pompeius.", "2626": "Pompeius indeed was well pleased with this, as he had long wished to have the opportunity of doing some service and friendly act to Crassus.", "2627": "According he readily accepted the advances of Crassus, and in his address to the people he declared that he should be as grateful to them for his colleague as for the consulship.", "2628": "However, when they were elected con­ suls, they differed about everything, and came into colli­ sion :", "2629": "in the senate Crassus had more weight, but among the people the influence of Pompeius was great.", "2630": "For Pompeius restored the tribunate t to the people, and he allowed the judicia to be again transferred to the Equites by a law.", "2631": "But the most agreeable of all spectacles was that which Pompeius exhibited to the people when he personally solicited his discharge from service.", "2632": "It is the custom among the Roman Equites* when they have served the time fixed by law, to lead their horse into the Forum before the two men whom they call Censors, and after mentioning each general and Imperator under whom they have served, and giving an account of their service, they receive their dismissal.", "2633": "Honours also and infamy are awarded according to each man's conduct.", "2634": "Now on this occasion the Censors Gellius and Lentulus were sitting in all their official dignity, and the Equites who were to be inspected were passing by, when Pompeius was seen descending from the higher ground to the Forum, bearing the other insignia of his office, but leading his horse by the hand.", "2635": "When he came near and was full in sight, he bade the lictors make way for him, and he led his horse to the tribunal.", "2636": "The people admired, and kept profound silence;", "2637": "the censors were both awed and delighted at the sight.", "2638": "Then the elder said:", "2639": "“ I ask you, Pompeius Magnus, if you have performed all the military services that the law requires ?", "2640": "\" Pompeius replied with a loud voice, “ I have performed all, and all under my own command as Im­ perator.\"", "2641": "On hearing this the people broke out into loud shouts, and it was impossible to repress the acclamations, so great was their delight;", "2642": "but the censors rising, con­ ducted Pompeius home to please the citizens, who followed with loud expressions of applause.", "2643": "XXIII.", "2644": "Now when the term of office was near expiring for Pompeius, and the differences with Crassus were increasing, one Caius Aurelius,* who though a man of equestrian rank did not meddle with public affairs, on the occasion of an assembly of the people ascended the Rostra, and coming forward said, that Jupiter had appeared to him in his sleep and had bid him tell the consuls not to lay down their office before they were reconciled.", "2645": "On this being said, Pompeius stood still, without saying a word, but Crassus making the first advance to take his hand and address him, said, \" I think I am doing nothing ignoble or mean, fellow citizens, in being first to give way to Pompeius, whom you considered worthy of the name of Magnus before he had a beard, and decreed to him two triumphs before he was a senator.\"", "2646": "Upon this they were reconciled and laid down their office.", "2647": "Now Crassus con­ tinued the kind of life which he had originally adopted ;", "2648": "but Pompeius withdrew himself from his numerous en­ gagements as advocate, and gradually quitted the forum, and seldom went into public, and always with a large crowd of people.", "2649": "For it was no longer easy to meet with him or see him without a train;", "2650": "but he took most pleasure in showing himself with a numerous company close around him, and by these means he threw a dignity and importance about his presence, and thought that he ought to keep his high rank from contact or familiarity with the many.", "2651": "For life in the garment of peace is a hazardous thing towards loss of reputation for those who have gained distinction in arms and are ill suited for civil equality;", "2652": "for such men claim the first place in peace also, as in war, while those who get less honour in war cannot submit to have no advantage in peace at least.", "2653": "Wherefore when they meet in the Forum with the man who has been distinguished in camps and triumphs, they humble him and cast him down;", "2654": "but if a man renounces all pretensions to civil distinction and withdraws, they maintain his military honours and power untouched by envy.", "2655": "Facts soon showed this.", "2656": "XXIV", "2657": "Now the power of the pirates * had its begin­ ning in Cilicia, and at first its adventure was attended with hazard and sought concealment, but it gained confidence and daring in the Mithridatic war by lending itself to aid the king.", "2658": "Then, the Romans being engaged in the civil wars about the gates of Rome, the sea was left destitute of all protection, and this by degrees drew them on, and encouraged them not to confine their attacks to those who navigated the sea, but to ravage islands and maritime cities.", "2659": "And now men who were powerful by wealth and of distinguished birth, and who claimed superior education, began to embark on board piratical vessels and to share in their undertakings as if the occu­ pation was attended with a certain reputation and was an object of ambition, There were also piratical posts established in many places and fortified beacons, at which armaments put in, which were fitted out for this peculiar occupation not only with bold vigorous crews and skilful helmsmen and the speed and lightness of the ships, but more annoying than their formidable appearance was their arrogant and pompous equipment, with their golden streamers † and purple sails and silvered oars, as if they rioted in their evil practices and prided themselves on them.", "2660": "And flutes and playing on stringed instruments and drinking along the whole coast, and capture of persons high in office, and ransomings of captured cities, were a dis­ grace to the Roman supremacy.", "2661": "Now the piratical ships had increased to above a thousand, and the cities capture by them were four hundred.", "2662": "They attacked and plundered the asyla and sacred places which had hitherto been un­ approached, such as those of Claros,* Didyma, Samothrace, the temple of Chthonia in Hermione, the temple of Æsculapius in Epidaurus, and those of Neptune at the Isthmus and Tænaros and Kalauria, and those of Apollo at Actium and Leucas, and that of Juno in Samos, and in Argos, and Lacinium.", "2663": "They also performed strange rites on Olympus t and celebrated certain mysterious ceremonies, among which were those of Mithras,‡ and they are continued to the present time, having been first introduced by them.", "2664": "But they did most insult to the Romans, and going up from the sea they robbed on their roads and plundered the neighbouring villas.", "2665": "They once seized two praetors Sextilius and Bellinus in their purple dress, and they carried off with them their attendants and lictors.", "2666": "They also took the daughter of Antonius, a man who had enjoyed a triumph, as she was going into the country, and she was ransomed at great cost.", "2667": "But their most insulting behaviour was iu the following fashion.", "2668": "Whenever a man who was taken called out that he was a Roman and mentioned his name, they would pretend to be terror-struck and to be alarmed, and would strike their thighs and fall down at his knees praying him to pardon them;", "2669": "and their captive would believe all this to be real, seeing that they were humble and suppliant.", "2670": "Then some would put Roman shoes on his feet, and others would throw over him a toga, pretending it was done that there might be no mistake about him again.", "2671": "When they had for some time mocked the man in this way and had their fill of amusement, at last they would put a ladder down into the sea, and bid him step out and go away with their best wishes for a good journey;", "2672": "and if a man would not go, then they shoved him into the water.", "2673": "XXV.", "2674": "The power of the pirates extended over the whole of our sea* at once in a measure, so that it could not be navigated and was closed against all trade.", "2675": "It was this which mainly induced the Romans, who were hard pressed for provisions and were expecting great scarcity, to send out Pompeius to clear the sea of the pirates.", "2676": "Gabinius,t one of the friends of Pompeius, drew up a law which gave Pompeius, not a naval command, but palpably sole dominion and power over all men without any responsibility.", "2677": "For the law gave him authority over the sea within the columns of Hercules and all the main land to the distance of four hundred stadia from the sea.", "2678": "There were not many places within the Roman dominions which lay beyond those limits, but the chief nations and the most powerful of the kings were comprised within them.", "2679": "Besides this, Pompeius was empowered to choose fifteen legati from the Senate who should command in particular parts, to take from the treasuries and from the Publican!", "2680": "as much money as he pleased, and two hundred ships, with full authority as to the number and levying of the armed force and of the rowers for the vessels.", "2681": "When these provisions of the law were read, the people received them with exceeding great satisfaction, but the chief of the Senate and the most powerful citizens considered that this unlimited and indefinite power was indeed too great to be an object of envy, but was a matter for alarm.", "2682": "Accordingly with the exception of Caesar they opposed the law;", "2683": "but Cæsar spoke in favour of it, though indeed he cared very little for Pompeius, but from the beginning it was his plan to insinuate himself into the popular favour and to gain over the people.", "2684": "But the rest vehemently assailed Pompeius.", "2685": "One of the consuls who had observed to him that if he emulated Romulus he would not escape the end of Romulus, was near being killed by the people.", "2686": "When Catulus came forward to speak against the law, the people out of respect were silent for some time;", "2687": "but after he had spoken at length with honourable mention of Pompeius and without any invidious remark, and then advised the people to spare him and not to expose such a man to repeated dangers and wars, “ What other man,” he con­ tinued, It will you have, if you lose him ? \" when with one accord all the people replied, “ Yourself.\"", "2688": "Now as Catulus could produce no effect, he retired from the Rostra;", "2689": "when Roscius* came forward, nobody listened, but he made signs with his fingers that they should not appoint Pompeius to the sole command, but should give him a colleague.", "2690": "At this it is said that the people being irritated sent forth such a shout, that a crow t which was flying over the Forum was stunned and fell down into the crowd.", "2691": "Whence it appears, that birds which fall, do not tumble into a great vacuum in the air caused by its rending and separation, but that they are struck by the blow of the voice, which, when it is carried along with great mass and strength, causes an agitation and a wave in the air.", "2692": "XXVI.", "2693": "Now for the time the assembly was dissolved.", "2694": "But on the day on which they were going to put the law to the vote, Pompeius privately retired to the country, but on hearing that the law had passed, he entered the city by night, considering that he should make himself an object of jealousy if the people met him and crowded about him.", "2695": "At daybreak he came into public and sacri­ ficed;", "2696": "and an assembly being summoned he contrived to get many other things in addition to what had been voted, and nearly doubled his armament.", "2697": "For he manned five hundred ships, and one hundred and twenty thousand heavy-armed soldiers and five thousand horse were raised.", "2698": "He chose out of the senate twenty-four men who had held command and served the office of praetor;", "2699": "and there were two quæstors.", "2700": "As the prices of provisions immediately fell, it gave the people, who were well pleased to have it, opportunity to say that the very name of Pompeius had put an end to the war.", "2701": "However, by dividing the waters and the whole space of the internal sea into thirteen parts and appointing a certain number of ships and a commander for each, with his force, which was thus dispersed in all directions, he surrounded the piratical vessels that fell in his way in a body, and forthwith hunted them down and brought them into port;", "2702": "but those who separated from one another before they were taken and effected their escape, crowded from all parts and made their way to Cilicia as to a hive ;", "2703": "and against them Pompeius himself went with sixty of the best ships.", "2704": "But he did not sail against them till he had completely cleared of the piratical vessels the Tyr­ rhenian sea, the Libyan, and the seas around Sardinia, and Corsica, and Sicily, in forty days in all, by his own * unwearied exertions and the active co-operation of his commanders.", "2705": "XXVII.", "2706": "In Rome the consul Piso, through passion and envy, was damaging the preparations for the war, and disbanding the seamen who were to man the ships, but Pompeius sent round his navy to Brundisium and himself advanced through Tyrrhenia to Rome.", "2707": "On hearing this all the people poured forth out of the city upon the road, just as if they had not only a few days before conducted him out of the city.", "2708": "And the rejoicing was caused by the speediness of the change, which was contrary to expectation, for the Forum had a superabundance of provisions.", "2709": "The consequence was that Piso ran the risk of being deprived of the consulship, for Gabinius had already a law drawn up.", "2710": "But Pompeius prevented this, and having managed everything else with moderation and got what he wanted, he went down to Brundisium and set sail.", "2711": "But though he was pressed by the urgency of the business and sailed past the cities in his haste, still he did not pass by Athens but he went up to it.", "2712": "After sacrifices to the gods and addressing the people, just as he was quitting the place he read two inscriptions, each of a single verse, addressed to him, the one within the gate, \"As thou own'at thyself a mortal, so thou art in truth a God.* and that on the outside:", "2713": "“ Expected, welcomed, seen, we now conduct thee forth.\"", "2714": "Now as he treated mercifully some of the piratical crews which still held together and were cruising about the seas upon their preferring entreaties to him, and after receiving a surrender of their vessels and persons did them no harm, the rest entertaining good hopes attempted to get out of the way of the other officers, and coming to Pompeius they put themselves into his hands with their children and wives.", "2715": "But he spared all, and it was chiefly through their assist­ ance that he tracked out and caught- those who still lurked in concealment, as being conscious that they had committed unpardonable crimes.", "2716": "XXVIII.", "2717": "The greater part and the most powerful of the pirates had deposited their families and wealth, and their useless people, in garrisons and strong forts among the heights of the Taurus;", "2718": "but manning their ships the pirates themselves awaited the approach of Pompeius near Coracesiumt in Cilicia, and a battle was fought in which they were defeated and afterwards blockaded.", "2719": "At last sending a suppliant message they surrendered themselves and their cities and the islands of which they had possession and in which they had built forts that were difficult to force and hard to ap­ proach.", "2720": "Accordingly the war was ended, and all the pirates were driven from the sea in no more than three months.", "2721": "Pompeius received by surrender many ships, and among them ninety with brazen beaks.", "2722": "The pirates, who amounted to more than twenty thousand, he never thought of putting to death, but he considered that it would not be prudent to let them go and to allow them to be dispersed or to unite again, being poor, and warlike and many in number.", "2723": "Reflecting then that by nature man neither is made nor is a wild animal nor unsocial, and that he changes his character by the practice of vice which is contrary to his nature, but that he is tamed by habits and change of place and life, and that wild beasts by being accustomed to a gentler mode of living put off their wildness and savageness, he determined to transfer the men to the land from the sea and to let them taste a quiet life by being accustomed to live in cities and to cultivate the ground.", "2724": "The small and somewhat depopulated cities of Cilicia received some of the pirates whom they associated with them­ selves, and the cities received some additional tracts of land;", "2725": "and the city of Soli,* which had lately been deprived of its inhabitants by Tigranest the Armenian king, he restored and settled many of them in it.", "2726": "To the greater part he gave as their residence Dyme‡ in Achæa, which was then without inhabitants and had much good land.", "2727": "XXIX.", "2728": "Now those who envied Pompeius found fault with these measures;", "2729": "but as to his conduct towards Metellus* in Crete, even his best friends were not pleased with it.", "2730": "Metellus, who was a kinsman of the Metellus who had the command in Iberia jointly with Pompeius, was sent as commander to Crete before Pompeius was chosen.", "2731": "For Crete was a kind of second source of pirates and next to Cilicia;", "2732": "and Metellus having caught many of them in the island took them prisoners and put them to death.", "2733": "Those who still survived and were blockaded, sent a suppliant message and invited Pompeius to the island, as being a part of his government and falling entirely within the limits reckoned from the coast.", "2734": "Pompeius accepted the invitation and wrote to Metellus to forbid him continuing the war.", "2735": "He also wrote to the cities not to pay any attention to Metellus, and he sent as commander one of his own officers, Lucius Octavius, who entering into the forts of the besieged pirates and fighting on their side made Pompeius not only odious and intolerable, but ridiculous also, inasmuch as he lent his name to accursed and godless men and threw around them his reputation as a kind of amulet, through envy and jealousy of Metellus.", "2736": "Neither did Achilles, † it was argued, act like a man, but like a youth all full of violence and passionately pursuing glory, when he made a sign to the rest of the Greeks and would not let them strike Hector, “ For fear another gave the blow and won", "2737": "The fame, and he should second only come;", "2738": "­ but Pompeius even protected and fought in behalf of the common enemy, that he might deprive of a triumph a general who had endured so much toil.", "2739": "Metellus however did not give in, but he took and punished the pirates, and after insulting and abusing Octavius in his camp he let him go.XXX.", "2740": "When news reached Rome that the Pirates' war was at an end and that Pompeius being now at leisure was visiting the cities, Manlius, * one of the tribunes, proposed a law, that Pompeius should take all the country and force which Lucullus commanded, with the addition of Bithynia, which Glabriot had, and should carry on the war against the kings Mithridates and Tigranes, with both the naval force and the dominion of the sea on the terms on which he received it originally.", "2741": "This was in short for the Roman dominion to be placed at the disposal of one man.", "2742": "For the provinces which alone he could not touch under the former law, Phrygia, Lycaonia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, the upper Colchis, Armenia, these he now had together with the armies and resources with which Lucullus defeated Mithridates and Tigranes.", "2743": "But though Lucullus was thus deprived of the glory of his achievements and was receiving a successor in a triumph rather than in a war, the aristo­ cratical party thought less of this, though they con­ sidered that the man was treated unjustly and un­ gratefully, but they were much dissatisfied with the power of Pompeius which they viewed as the setting up of a tyranny, and they severally exhorted and encouraged one another to oppose the law and not to give up their freedom.", "2744": "But when the time came, the rest kept back through fear of the people and were silent, except Catulus, who after finding much fault with the law and the tribune, yet without persuading any one, urged the Senate from the Rostra, repeating it many times, to seek for a mountain,!", "2745": "like their ancestors, and a rock, to which they might fly for refuge and preserve their liberty.", "2746": "Accordingly the law was ratified, as they say, by all the tribes,!", "2747": "and Pompeius in his absence was put in possession of nearly everything which Sulla got after he had made himself master of the city by arms and war.", "2748": "On receiving the letters and reading the decrees in the presence of his friends who were congratu­ lating him, Pompeius is said to have contracted his eyebrows and to have struck his thigh, and to have spoken like a man who was already tired and averse to command, \"Oh, the endless toils, how much better it were to have been one unknown to fame, if there shall never be an end to my military service and I shall never elude this envy and live quietly in the country with my wife.\" *", "2749": "On hearing these expressions not even his intimate friends could endure his hypocritical pretences, as they knew that he was the more delighted, inasmuch as his difference with Lucullus gave additional fire to his innate ambition and love of command.", "2750": "XXXI.", "2751": "And in truth his acts soon discovered his real temper:", "2752": "for he issued counter-edicts in all directions by which he required the presence of the soldiers and summoned to him the subject rulers and kings.", "2753": "And as he traversed the country, he let nothing that Lucullus had done remain undisturbed, but he both remitted the punishments of many, and took away what had been given, and in short he left nothing undone in his eager­ ness to prove to the admirers of Lucullus t that he was entirely without power.", "2754": "Lucullus through his friends complained to Pompeius, and it was agreed that they should have a meeting.", "2755": "They met in Galatia:", "2756": "and as they were most distinguished generals and had won the greatest victories, their lictors met with the fasces wreathed with bay;", "2757": "but Lucullus advanced from green and shady parts, and Pompeius happened to have crossed an extensive tract without trees and parched.", "2758": "Accord­ ingly the lictors of Lucullus seeing that the bays of Pompeius were faded and completely withered, gave them some of their own which were fresh, and so decorated and wreathed the fasces of Pompeius with them.", "2759": "This was considered a sign that Pompeius was coming to carry off the prizes of victory and the glory that was due to Lucullus.", "2760": "As to the order of his consulship and in age also Lucullus had the priority, but the reputation of Pompeius was more exalted on account of his two triumphs.", "2761": "However they managed their first interview with as much civility and friendliness as they could, magnifying the exploits of each other, and congratulating one another on their victories:", "2762": "in their conferences how­ ever they came to no reasonable or fair settlement, but even fell to mutual abuse, Pompeius charging Lucullus with avarice, and Lucullus charging Pompeius with love of power;", "2763": "and they were with difficulty separated by their friends.", "2764": "Lucullus being in Galatia assigned portions of the captured land and gave other presents to whom he chose;", "2765": "while Pompeius, who was encamped at a short distance, prevented any attention being paid to the orders of Lucullus, and took from him all his soldiers except sixteen hundred, whose mutinous disposition he thought would make them useless to himself, but hostile to Lucullus.", "2766": "Besides this,", "2767": "Pompeius disparaged the exploits of Lucullus and openly said that Lucullus had warred against tragedies and mere shadows of kings, while to himself was reserved the contest against a genuine power and one that had grown wiser by losses, for Mithridates was now having recourse to shields, and swords and horses.", "2768": "Lucullus retorting said, that Pompeius was going to fight with a phantom and a shadow of war, being accustomed, like a lazy bird, to descend upon the bodies that others had slaughtered and to tear the remnants of wars;", "2769": "for so had he appropriated to himself the victories over Sertorius, Lepidus and Spartacus, though Crassus, Metellus and Catulus had respectively gained these victories:", "2770": "it was no wonder then, if Pompeius was surreptitiously trying to get the credit of the Armenian and Pontic wars, he who had in some way or other contrived to intrude himself into a triumph over runaway slaves.", "2771": "XXXII.", "2772": "Lucullus* now retired, and Pompeius after distributing his whole naval force over the sea between Phœnicia and the Bosporus to keep guard, himself marched against Mithridates, who had thirty thousand foot soldiers of the phalanx and two thousand horsemen, but did not venture to fight.", "2773": "First of all, Mithridates left a strong mountain which was difficult to assault, whereon he happened to be encamped, because he supposed there was no water there;", "2774": "but Pompeius, after occupying the same mountain, conjectured from the nature of the vege­ tation upon it and the hollows formed by the slopes of the ground that the place contained springs, and he ordered wells to be dug in all parts:", "2775": "and immediately the whole army had abundance of water, so that it was a matter of surprise that Mithridates had all along been ignorant of this.", "2776": "Pompeius then surrounded Mithridates with his troops and hemmed him in with his lines.", "2777": "After being blockaded forty-five days Mithridates succeeded in stealing away with the strongest part of his army, after having first massacred those who were unfit for service and were sick.", "2778": "Next,", "2779": "Pompeius overtook him on the Euphrates and pitched his camp near him;", "2780": "and fearing lest Mithri­ dates should frustrate his design by crossing the river, he led his army against him in battle order at midnight, at which very hour it is said that Mithridates had a vision in his sleep which forewarned him of what was going to happen.", "2781": "He dreamed that he was sailing on the Pontic sea with a fair wind, and was already in sight of the Bosporus, and congratulating his fellow voyagers, as a man naturally would do in his joy at a manifest and sure deliverance;", "2782": "but all at once he saw himself abandoned by everybody and drifting about upon a small piece of wreck.", "2783": "While he was suffering under this anguish and these visions, his friends came to his bed-side and roused him with the news that Pompeius was attacking them.", "2784": "The enemy accordingly must of necessity fight in defence of their camp, and the generals leading their forces out put them in order of battle.", "2785": "Pompeius, seeing the preparations to oppose him, hesitated about running any risk in the dark, and thought that he ought only to surround the enemy, to prevent their escape, and attack them when it was daylight, inasmuch as their numbers were greater.", "2786": "But the oldest centurions by their entreaties and exhortations urged him on;", "2787": "for it was not quite dark, but the moon which was descending in the horizon still allowed them to see objects clear enough.", "2788": "And it was this which most damaged the king's troops.", "2789": "For the Romans advanced with the moon on their backs, and as the light was much depressed towards the horizon, the shadows were projected a long way in front of the soldiers and fell upon the enemy, by reason of which they could not accurately estimate the distance between them and the Romans, but supposing that they were already at close quarters they threw their javelins without effect and struck nobody.", "2790": "The Romans perceiving this rushed upon the enemy with shouts, and as they did not venture to stand their ground, but were terror-struck and took to flight, the Romans slaughtered them to the number of much more than ten thousand, and took their camp.", "2791": "Mithridates at the commencement with eight hundred horsemen cut his way through the Romans, but the rest were soon dispersed and he was left alone with three persons, one of whom was his concubine Hypsikratia,* who on all occasions showed the spirit of a man and desperate courage;", "2792": "and accordingly the king used to call her Hypsikrates.", "2793": "On this occasion, armed like a Persian and mounted on horseback, she was neither exhausted by the long journeys nor ever wearied of attending to the King's person and his horse, till they came to a place called Inora,† which was filled with the King's property and valuables.", "2794": "Here Mithridates took costly garments and distributed among those who had flocked to him after the battle.", "2795": "He also gave to each of his friends a deadly poison to carry about with them, that none of them might fall into the hands of the Romans against his will.", "2796": "Thence he set out towards Armenia to Tigranes, but Tigranes forbade him to come and set a price of a hundred talents upon him, on which Mithri- dates passed by the sources of the Euphrates and cons tinued his flight through Colchis.", "2797": "*XXXIII.", "2798": "Pompeius invaded Armenia at the invitation of young Tigranes,t who had now revolted from his father, and he met Pompeius near the river Araxes,‡ which rises in the same parts with the Euphrates, but turns to the east and enters the Caspian Sea.", "2799": "Pompeius and Tigranes received the submission of the cities as they advanced:", "2800": "but King Tigranes, who had been lately crushed by Lucullus, and heard that Pompeius was of a mild and gentle disposition, admitted a Roman garrison into his palace,§ and taking with him his friends and kinsmen advanced to surrender himself.", "2801": "As he ap­ proached the camp on horseback, two lictors of Pompeius came up to him and ordered him to dismount from his horse and to enter on foot:", "2802": "they told him that no man on horseback had ever been seen in a Roman camp.", "2803": "Tigranes obeyed their orders, and taking off his sword presented it to them;", "2804": "and finally, when Pompeius came towards him, pulling off his cittaris,|| he hastened to lay it before his feet, and what was most humiliating of all, to throw himself down at his knees.", "2805": "But Pompeius pre­ vented this by laying hold of his right hand and drawing the king towards him;", "2806": "he also seated Tigranes by his side, and his son on the other side, and said that Tigranes ought so far to blame Lucullus only, who had taken from him Syria, Phœnicia, Cilicia, Galatia, and Sophene,* but that what he had kept up to that time, he should still have, if he paid as a compensation to the Romans for his wrongful deeds six thousand talents, and his son should be King of Sophene.", "2807": "Tigranes assented to these terms, and being overjoyed by the Romans saluting him as king, he promised to give every soldier half a mina of silver,† to a centurion ten minæ, and to a tribune a talent.", "2808": "But his son took this ill, and on being invited to supper he said that he was not in want of Pompeius to show such honour as this, for he would find another Roman. ‡", "2809": "In con­ sequence of this he was put in chains and kept for the triumph.", "2810": "No long time after Phraates the Parthian sent to demand the young man, as his son-in-law, and to propose that the Euphrates should be the boundary of the two powers.", "2811": "Pompeius replied that Tigranes belonged to his father rather than to his father-in-law, and that as to a boundary he should determine that on the principles of justice.", "2812": "XXXIV.", "2813": "Leaving Afranius in care of Armenia, Pom­ peius advanced through the nations that dwell about the Caucasus,§ as of necessity he must do, in pursuit of Mithridates.", "2814": "The greatest of these nations are Albani and Iberians, of whom the Iberians extend to the Moschio mountains and the Pontus, and the Albani extend to the east and the Caspian Sea.", "2815": "The Albani at first allowed a free passage to Pompeius at his request;", "2816": "but as winter overtook the Romans in the country and they were occu­ pied with the festival of the Saturnalia,|| mustering to the number of forty thousand they attacked the Romans, after crossing the Cyrnus* river, which rising in the Iberian mountains and receiving the Araxes which comes down from Armenia, empties itself by twelve mouths into the Caspian.", "2817": "Others say that the Araxes does not join this stream, but that it has a separate outlet, though near to the other,-into the same sea.", "2818": "Pompeius, though he could have opposed the enemy while they were cross­ ing the river, let them cross quietly, and then he attacked and put them to flight and destroyed a great number.", "2819": "As the King begged for pardon, and sent ambassadors, Pompeius excused him for the wrong that he had done, and making a treaty with him, advanced against the Iberians, who were as numerous as the Albani and more warlike, and had a strong wish to please Mithridates and to repel Pompeius.", "2820": "For the Iberians had never submitted either to the Medes or the Persians,† and they had escaped the dominion of the Macedonians also, inasmuch as Alex­ ander soon quitted Hyrkania.", "2821": "However Pompeius routed the Iberians also in a great battle, in which nine thousand of them were killed and above ten thousand taken prisoners, and he entered Colchis;", "2822": "and on the Phasis ‡ he was met by Servilius with the vessels with which he was guarding the Pontus.", "2823": "XXXV.", "2824": "The pursuit of Mithridates was attended with great difficulties, as he had plunged among the nations around the Bosporus and the Maeotis;", "2825": "and intelligence reached Pompeius that the Albani had again revolted.", "2826": "Moved by passion and desire of revenge, Pompeius turned against the Albani.", "2827": "He again crossed the Cyrnus with difficulty and danger, for the river had been fenced off with stakes to a great extent by the barbarians;", "2828": "and as the passage of the river was succeeded by a long waterless and difficult march, he had ten thousand skins filled with water and then advanced against the enemy, whom he found posted on the river Abas * to the number of sixty thousand foot and twelve thousand cavalry, but poorly armed, and for the most part only with the skins of beasts.", "2829": "They were commanded by a brother of the king, named Kosis, who, when the two armies had come to close quarters, rushed against Pompeius and struck him with a javelin on the fold t of his breastplate, but Pompeius with his javelin in his hand pierced him through and killed him.", "2830": "In this battle it is said that Amazons t also fought on the side of the barbarians, and that they had come down hither from the mountains about the river Thermodon.", "2831": "For after the battle, when the Romans were stripping the barbarians, they found Amazonian shields and boots, but no body of a woman was seen.", "2832": "The Amazons inhabit those parts of the Caucasus which extend towards the Hyrcanian sea, but they do not border on the Albani, for Gelæ and Leges dwell between;", "2833": "and they cohabit with these people every year for two months, meeting them on the river Thermodon, after which they depart and live by themselves.", "2834": "XXXVI.", "2835": "After the battle Pompeius set out to advance to the Hyrkanian * and Caspian sea, but he was turned from his route by the number of deadly reptiles, when he was three days' march from it.", "2836": "He retired to the Less Armenia;", "2837": "and he returned a friendly answer to the Kings of the Elymæi † and Medes who sent ambassadors, but against the Parthian king who had invaded Gordyene and was plundering the people of Tigranes, he sent Afranius with a force who drove him out and pursued him as far as the territory of Arbela.", "2838": "Of all the concu­ bines of Mithridates who were brought to him, he knew not one, but sent all back to their parents and kin;", "2839": "for the greater part were the daughters and wives of generals and princes.", "2840": "Stratonike,t who was in the greatest repute and guarded the richest of the forts, was, it is said, the daughter of a harp-player, who was not rich and was an old man;", "2841": "and she made so sudden a conquest of With.", "2842": "ridates over his wine by her playing, that he kept the woman and went to bed with her, but sent away the old man much annoyed at not having been even civilly spoken to by the king.", "2843": "In the morning, however, when he got up and saw in his house tables loaded with silver and golden cups, and a great train of attendants, with eunuchs and boys bringing to him costly garments, and a. horse standing before the door equipped like those that carried the king's friends, thinking that this was all mockery and a joke he made an attempt to escape through the door.", "2844": "But when the slaves laid hold of him and told him that the king had made him a present of the large sub­ stance of a rich man who had just died, and that this was but a small foretaste and sample of other valuables and possessions that were to come, after this explanation hardly convinced he took the purple dress, and leaping on the horse rode through the city exclaiming, “All this is mine.\"", "2845": "To those who laughed at him he said, this was nothing strange, but it was rather strange that he did not pelt with stones those who came in his way, being mad with delight.", "2846": "Of this stock and blood was Stratonike.", "2847": "But she gave up this place to Pompeius, and also brought him many presents, of which he took only such as seemed suitable to decorate the temples and add splendour to his triumph, and he told her she was welcome to keep the rest.", "2848": "In like manner when the King of the Iberians sent him a couch and a table and a seat all of gold, and begged him to accept them, he delivered them also to the quæstors for the treasury.", "2849": "XXXVII.", "2850": "In the fort Kænum* Pompeius found also private writings of Mithridates, which he read through with some pleasure as they gave him a good opportunity of learning the man's character.", "2851": "They were memoirs,.", "2852": "from which it was discovered that he had taken off by poison t among many others his son Ariarathes and Alkæus of Sardis because he got the advantage over the King in riding racehorses.", "2853": "There were registered also in­ terpretations of dreams,‡ some of which he had seen himself, and others had been seen by some of his women;", "2854": "and there were lewd letters of Monime § to him and his answers to her.", "2855": "Theophanes says that there was also found an address of Rutilius", "2856": "It in which he urged the King to the massacre of the Romans in Asia.", "2857": "But most persons with good reason suppose this to be a malicious story of Theophanes, perhaps invented through hatred to Rutilius, who was a man totally unlike himself, or perchance to please Pompeius, whose father Rutilius in his historical writings had shown to be a thoroughly unprincipled fellow.", "2858": "XXXVIII.", "2859": "Thence Pompeius went to Amisus,* where his ambition led him to reprehensible measures.", "2860": "For though he had abused Lucullus greatly, because while the enemy was still alive, he published edicts for the settlement of the countries and distributed gifts and honours, things which victors are accustomed to do when a war is brought to a close and is ended, he himself, while Mithridates was still ruling in the Bosporus t and had got together a force sufficient to enable him to take the field again, just as if everything was finished, began to do the very things that Lucullus had done, settling the provinces, and distributing gifts, many commanders and princes, and twelve barbarous kings having come to him.", "2861": "Accordingly he did not even deign when writing in reply to the Parthian, ‡ as other persons did, to address him by the title of King of Kings, and he neglected to do this to please the other kings.", "2862": "He was also seized with a desire and a passion to get possession of Syria and to advance through Arabia to the Erythræan sea, § that in his victorious career he might reach the ocean that encompasses the world on all sides;", "2863": "for in Libya he was the first who advanced victoriously as far as the external sea, and again in Iberia he made the Atlantic sea the boundary of the Roman dominion ;", "2864": "and thirdly, in his recent pursuit of the Albani he came very near to reaching the Hyrkanian sea.", "2865": "Ac­ cordingly he now put his army in motion that he might connect the circuit of his military expeditions with the Erythræan sea;", "2866": "and besides, he saw that Mithridates was difficult to be caught by an armed force, and was a harder enemy to deal with when flying than when fighting.", "2867": "XXXIX.", "2868": "Wherefore, remarking that he would leave behind him for Mithridates an enemy stronger than himself, famine, he set vessels to keep a guard on the merchants who sailed to the Bosporus;", "2869": "and death was the penalty for those who were caught.", "2870": "Taking the great bulk of his army he advanced on his march, and falling in with the bodies still unburied of those who with Triarius * had fought unsuccessfully against Mithri­ dates and fallen in battle, he buried all with splendid ceremonial and due honours.", "2871": "It was the neglect of this which is considered to have been the chief cause of the hatred to Lucullus.", "2872": "After subduing by his legate Afranius the Arabs in the neighbourhood of the Amanus,t he descended into Syria, which he made a province and a possession of the Roman people on the ground that it had no legitimate kings;", "2873": "and he subdued Judæa t and took King Aristobulus prisoner.", "2874": "He built some cities, and he gave others their liberty and punished the tyrants in them.", "2875": "But he spent most time in judicial business, settling the disputes of cities and kings, and in those cases for which he had no leisure, sending his friends;", "2876": "as for instance to the Armenians and Parthians, who referred to him the decision as to the country § in dispute between them, he sent three judges and conciliators.", "2877": "For great was the fame of his power, and no less was the fame of his virtue and mildness;", "2878": "by reason of which he was enabled to veil most of the faults of his friends and intimates, for he did not possess the art of checking or punishing evil doers, but he so behaved towards those who had anything to do with him, that they patiently endured both the extortion and oppression of the others.", "2879": "XL.", "2880": "The person who had most influence with Pompeius was Demetrius, a freedman, a youth not without under­ standing, but who abused his good fortune.", "2881": "The following story is told of him.", "2882": "Cato the philosopher, who was still a young man, but had a great reputation and already showed a lofty spirit, went up to Antioch,.", "2883": "when Pompeius was not there, wishing to examine the city.", "2884": "Now Cato, as was his custom, walked on foot, but his friends who were journeying with him were on horseback.", "2885": "Observing before the gate a crowd of men in white vestments, and along the road, on one side the ephebi, and on the other the boys, in separate bodies, he was out of humour, supposing that this was done out of honour and respect to him who wanted nothing of the kind.", "2886": "However he bade his friends dismount and walk with him.", "2887": "As they came near, the man who was arranging and settling all this ceremony, with a crown on his head and a wand in his hand, met them and asked where they had left Demetrius and when he would arrive.", "2888": "Now the friends of Cato fell a-laughing, but Cato exclaimed, “0 wretched city,\" and passed by without making further answer.", "2889": "However Pompeius himself made Demetrius less an object of odium to others by submitting to his caprices without complaint.", "2890": "For it is said that frequently when Pompeius at entertainments was waiting for and receiving his guests, Demetrius would already have taken his place at the table, reclining with haughty air, and with his vest t over his ears hanging down.", "2891": "Before he had returned to Rome, Demetrius had got possession of the most agreeable places in the suburbs, and the finest pleasure-grounds and costly gardens were called Demetrian ;", "2892": "and yet up to his third triumph Pompeius was lodged in a moderate and simple manner.", "2893": "But afterwards when he was erecting for the Romans that beautiful and far-famed theatre,* he built, what may be compared to the small boat that is towed after a big vessel, close by a house more magnificent than he had before;", "2894": "and yet even this was so far from being such a building as to excite any jealousy that the person who became the owner of it after Pompeius, was surprised when he entered it, and he asked where Pompeius Magnus used to sup.", "2895": "Such is the story about these matters.", "2896": "XLI.", "2897": "The King of the Arabians in the neighbourhood of Petra t hitherto had not troubled himself at all about Plutarch seems to say that this impudent fellow would take his seat at the table before the guests had arrived and leave his master to receive them.", "2898": "the Romans, but now being much alarmed he wrote to say that he was ready to submit and to do anything.", "2899": "Pompeius wishing to confirm him in this disposition made an expedition against Petra, wherein he did not altogether escape censure from most people.", "2900": "For they considered that this was evading the pursuit of Mithri­ dates, and they urged him to turn against him who was his old antagonist and was fanning his flame and pre­ paring according to report to lead an army through the country of the Scythians and Pæonians* against Italy.", "2901": "But Pompeius thinking it would be easier to crush the forces of Mithridates in the field than to overtake him when he was flying, did not choose to exhaust himself to no purpose in a pursuit, and he contrived to find other occupations in the interval of the war and he protracted the time.", "2902": "Fortune, however, settled the difficulty;", "2903": "for when he was at no great distance from Petra, and had already pitched his camp for that day and was exercising himself with his horse around the camp, letter-bearers rode up from Pontus with good tidings.", "2904": "This was manifest at once by the points of their spears, for they were wreathed with bay.", "2905": "Pompeius at first wished to finish his exercises, but as the men called out and entreated him, he leapt from his horse and taking the letters ad­ vanced into the camp.", "2906": "But as there was no tribunal t and there had not been time to make even the kind cf tribunal that is used in the camp, which they are accustomed to form by digging out large lumps of earth and putting them together upon one another, in their then zeal and eagerness they piled together the loadings of the beasts of burden and raised an elevated place.", "2907": "Pompeius ascending this announced to the soldiers, that Mithridates was dead, having put an end to his own life because his son Pharnakes * rebelled against him, and Pharnakes had taken possession of everything in those parts, and put all under his own dominion and that of the Romans, as he said in his letter.", "2908": "XLII.", "2909": "Upon this the soldiers being delighted, as was natural, occupied themselves with sacrifices and entertain­ ments, considering that in the person of Mithridates ten thousand enemies had expired.", "2910": "Pompeius having brought his own undertakings and expeditions to a termination, which he had not anticipated could be so easily done, immediately retired from Arabia ;", "2911": "and quickly traversing the intermediate provinces he arrived at Amisus, where he found that many presents had been sent by Pharnakes and many corpses of members of the royal family, and the corpse of Mithridates also, which could not well be recog­ nised by the face (for those who had embalmed the body had neglected to destroy the brain);", "2912": "but those who wished to see the body, recognised it by the scars.", "2913": "Pom­ peius himself would not see the body, but fearing divine retribution t he sent it off to Sinope.‡", "2914": "He was amazed at the dress and armour of Mithridates, both at the size and splendour of what he saw;", "2915": "though the sword belt, which cost four hundred talents, Publius stole and sold to Ariarathes, and the cittaris, a piece of wonderful work­ manship, Gaius the foster-brother of Mithridates himself gave to Faustus the son of Bulla who asked for it.", "2916": "Pom­ peius did not know this at the time;", "2917": "but Pharnakes who afterwards discovered it punished the thieves.", "2918": "After Pompeius had arranged and settled affairs in those parts, he continued his march with more pomp.", "2919": "On arriving at Mitylene* he gave the city its freedom for the sake of Theophanes, and he witnessed the usual contest there among the poets, the sole subject being his own exploits.", "2920": "Being pleased with the theatre he had a sketch taken of it and a plan made, with the intention of making one like it in Rome, but larger and more splendid.", "2921": "When he was in Rhodes, he heard all the sophists and made each a present of a talent.", "2922": "Poseidonius t put in writing the dis­ course which he read before Pompeius in opposition to the rhetorician Hermagoras on the doctrine of general inven­ tion.", "2923": "In Athens Pompeius behaved in like manner to the philosophers, and after giving also to the city fifty talents towards its restoration, he was in hopes to set foot in Italy with a reputation above that of any man and to be received by his family with the same eagerness that he had to see them.", "2924": "But the Daemon ‡ who takes care always to mix some portion of ill with the great and glorious good things which come from Fortune, had long been lurking on the watch and preparing to make his return more pain­ ful to him.", "2925": "For during the absence of Pompeius his wife Mucia* had been incontinent.", "2926": "Indeed while Pompeius was at a distance he treated the report with contempt, but when he had come near to Italy, and had examined the charge with more deliberation, as it seems, he sent her notice of divorce, though neither then nor afterwards did he say for what reason he put her away :", "2927": "but the reason is mentioned in Cicero's letters.", "2928": "XLIII.", "2929": "All kinds of reports about Pompeius preceded his arrival at Rome, and there was great alarm, as it was supposed that he would forthwith lead his army against the city and that a monarchy t would be firmly established.", "2930": "Crassus taking his sons and his money secretly got away from Rome, whether it was that he really was afraid, or, what is more probable, he wished to give credibility to the calumny and to strengthen the odium against Pom­ peius.", "2931": "As soon, however, as Pompeius landed t in Italy, he summoned his soldiers to an assembly, and after saying what was suitable to the occasion and expressing his affectionate thanks to them, he bade them disperse among their several cities and each go to his home, remembering to meet again for his triumph.", "2932": "The army being thus dispersed, and the fact being generally known, a wonderful circumstance hap­ pened.", "2933": "For the cities seeing Pompeius Magnus unarmed and advancing with a few friends, as if he were returning from an ordinary journey, pouring forth through good will and forming an escort brought him into Rome with a larger force, so that if he had designed to make any change ar.d revolution at that time he would not have wanted the ai my which he had disbanded.", "2934": "XLIV.", "2935": "As the law did not allow a general to enter the city before his triumph, Pompeius sent to the Senate to request they would put off the consular elections and to grant him this favour, that he might in his own person assist Piso in his canvass.", "2936": "As Cato opposed his request, ho did not attain his object.", "2937": "But Pompeius admiring Cato's boldness of speech and the vigour which he alone openly displayed in behalf of the law, desired in some way or other to gain the man;", "2938": "and as Cato had two nieces, Pompeius wished to take one of them to wife and to marry the other to his son.", "2939": "Cato saw his object, which he viewed as a way of corrupting him and in a manner bribing him by a matrimonial alliance;", "2940": "but his sister and wife took it ill that he should reject an alliance with Pompeius Magnus.", "2941": "In the mean time Pompeius wishing to get Afranius* made consul, expended money on his behalf among the tribes, and the voters came down to the gardens of Pompeius where they received the money, so that the thing became notorious and Pompeius had an ill name for making that office which was the highest of all and which he obtained for his services, venal for those who were unable to attain to it by merit. “", "2942": "These reproaches however,\" said Cato to the women, \" we must take our share of, if we become allied to Pompeius.\"", "2943": "On hearing this the women agreed that he formed a better judgment than themselves as to what was proper.", "2944": "XLV.", "2945": "Though the triumph t was distributed over two days, such was its magnitude that the time was not sufficient, but much of the preparation was excluded from the spectacle, and enough for the splendour and ornament of another procession.", "2946": "The nations over which Pompeius triumphed were designated by titles placed in front.", "2947": "The nations were the following, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Media, Colchis, the Iberians, Albani, Syria, Cilicia, Mesopotamia, the parts about Phœnice and Pales­ tine, Judæa, Arabia, and the whole body of pirates by sea and land who had been subdued.", "2948": "Among these nations fortified places not fewer than a thousand were taken, and cities not far short of nine hundred, and eight hundred piratical ships;", "2949": "and cities forty save one were founded.", "2950": "Besides this it was shown on written tablets that 5000 myriads (fifty millions) were the produce of the taxes, while from the additions that he had made to the state they received 8500 myriads (eighty-five millions), and there were brought into the public treasury in coined money and vessels of gold and silver twenty thousand talents, not in­ cluding what had been given to the soldiers, of whom he who received the least according to his proportion received fifteen hundred drachmae.", "2951": "The captives who appeared in the procession, besides the chief pirates, were the son of Tigranes the Armenian with his wife and daughter, and Zosime a wife of King Tigranes, and Aristobulus King of the Jews, and a wife and five children of Mithridates, and Scythian women, and also hostages of the Albani and Iberians and of the King of Comma gene, and numerous trophies, equal in number to all the battles, which Pom­ peius had won himself or by his legati.", "2952": "But it was the chief thing towards his glory, and what had never hap­ pened before to any Roman, that he celebrated his third triumph over the third continent.", "2953": "For though others before him had triumphed three times, Pompeius by having gained his first triumph over Libya, his second over Europe, and this the last over Asia, seemed in a manner to have brought the whole world into his three triumphs.", "2954": "XLVI.", "2955": "At this time Pompeius was under four-and-thirty* years of age, as those affirm who in all respects compare him with Alexander and force a parallel, but in fact he was near forty.", "2956": "How happy would it have been if he had died at the time up to which he had the fortune of Alexander;", "2957": "but the period that followed brought to him good fortune accompanied with odium, and ill fortune that was past all cure.", "2958": "For the power which he got in the city by fair means, he employed on the behalf of others illegally;", "2959": "and as much strength as he gave to them, so much he took from his own reputation, and so he was overthrown by the strength and magnitude of his own power before he was aware of it.", "2960": "And as the strongest parts and places in cities, when the enemies have got possession of them, give to them their own strength, so Caesar being raised up through the power of Pompeius against the State, overthrew and cast down the man by whose help he became strong against others.", "2961": "And it was brought about thus.", "2962": "Immediately upon Lucullus return­ ing from Asia, where he had been treated with great contumely by Pompeius, the Senate gave him a splendid reception, and when Pompeius had arrived they urged Lucullus still more to take a part in public affairs, for the purpose of limiting the credit of Pompeius.", "2963": "Though Luoullus was in other matters now dull and chilled for all active life, having given himself up to the pleasures of ease and the enjoyment of wealth, yet he forthwith sprang up against Pompeius, and by a vigorous attack got a victory over him with respect to the arrangements of Lucullus that he had annulled, and had the advantage in the Senate with the co-operation of Cato.", "2964": "Pon peius, de­ feated and pressed on all sides, was compelled to fly to tribunes and to attach himself to young men, of whom the most scandalous and the most daring, Clodius, took up his cause, but threw him completely under the feet of the people;", "2965": "and by making him inconsistently with his station constantly frequent the Forum and carrying him about, he used him for the purpose of confirming everything that was said or proposed to please and flatter the people.", "2966": "Further, he asked of Pompeius for his reward, just as if entering on his forty-sixth year—Xylander (Holzmann) preferred to read ‘fifty ’ insead of ‘ forty.’", "2967": "he were not degrading him but were doing him a service, and he afterwards got what he asked, the betrayal of Cicero,.", "2968": "who was a friend of Pompeius and had served him in public matters more than any one else.", "2969": "For when Cicero was in danger and prayed for his aid, Pompeius would not even see him, but shut the front door upon those who came on Cicero's part and went out by another door.", "2970": "Cicero fearing the trial retired from Rome.", "2971": "XLVII.", "2972": "At this time Cæsar† returned from his govern­ ment and undertook a political measure, which brought him the greatest popularity for the present and power for the future, but did the greatest damage to Pompeius and the State.", "2973": "For he became a candidate for his first con­ sulship ;", "2974": "but seeing that while Crassus was at variance with Pompeius, if he attached himself to one of them he would have the other for his enemy, he applied himself to effect a reconciliation between them, a thing which in other respects was fair and useful to the State, but was managed by him for a bad reason and with a dexterity full of treacherous design.", "2975": "For the strength which kept the State, just as in the case of a vessel, in a condition of equilibrium and prevented it falling over to this side or that, when brought together and united caused it to incline to one side with an irresistible force that over­ powered and beat down everything.", "2976": "Accordingly Cato said that they were mistaken who affirmed that the State was overturned by the quarrel which afterwards broke out between Cæsar and Pompeius, for they laid the blame on the last events ;", "2977": "for it was not their disunion nor yet their enmity, but their union and concord which was the first and greatest misfortune that befel the State.", "2978": "Cæsar was elected consul, and forthwith he courted the needy and poor by proposing measures for the establishment of cities, and the division of lands, wherein he stepped beyond the proprieties of his office and in a manner made his consul­ ship into a tribunate.", "2979": "When his colleague Bibulus opposed him and Cato was prepared to support Bibulus most vigorously, Cæsar brought forward Pompeius on the Rostra, and put the question to him, “ If he approved of the proposed laws;", "2980": "\" upon Pompeius saying that he did, “ Will you not then,\" said Cæsar, \" if any one makes resistance to the laws, come forward before the people to maintain them ?” “ Certainly,\" said Pompeius, “ I will come against those who threaten swords, with sword and shield.”", "2981": "It was the general opinion that Pompeius up to that day had never said or done anything more arrogant, so that even his friends in his defence said that the words had escaped him at the moment.", "2982": "But yet it was clear from what followed that he had completely given himself up to Cæsar to do what he pleased with him:", "2983": "for contrary to all expectation Pompeius married Cæsar's daughter Julia, who had been betrothed to Cæpio and was going to be married to him within a few days;", "2984": "and to pacify Cæpio, Pompeius gave him his own daughter who was already promised to Faustus the son of Sulla.", "2985": "Caesar himself married Calpurnia the daughter of Pi so.XLVIII.", "2986": "After this Pompeius filled the city with soldiers and man a ged every thin g by force.", "2987": "For the soldiers suddenly fell on the consul Bibulus as he was going down to the Forum with Lucullus and Cato, and broke the fasces;", "2988": "and some one bedaubed Bibulus by throwing a basket of ordure over his head, and two of the tribunes who were conducting him were wounded.", "2989": "By these means they cleared the Forum of their opponents and then carried the law about the distribution of lands.", "2990": "The people being taken with this bait were now become tame and ready to support any project of theirs, giving no trouble at all, but silently voting for what was proposed to them.", "2991": "Accordingly the regulations of Pompeius as to which he was at variance with Lucullus were confirmed, and Cæsar received Gaul within and without the Alps and the province of Illyricum for five years with four complete le­ gions;", "2992": "and it was settled that the consuls for the next year should be Piso* the father-in-law of Cæsar, and Gabinius, who was the most extravagant of the flatterers of Pompeius.", "2993": "While this was going on, Bibulus shut himself up in his house and never went out for eight months, the remainder of the period of his consulship, but he sent out counter-edicts full of abuse and charges against both:", "2994": "Cato as if inspired and under divine influence foretold in the Senate what would happen to the city and to Pompeius;", "2995": "and Lucullus* renoun­ cing public life kept quiet, on the ground that his age disqualified him for political concerns, on which Pompeius observed that for an old man luxury was more unsuitable to his age than to mingle in affairs of state.", "2996": "However Pompeius himself also was soon rendered inactive through passion for his young wife, with whom he passed the chief part of his time, and lived in the country and his gardens, and he paid no attention to what was going on in the Forum, so that even Clodius, who was then tribune, despised Pompeius and engaged in the most daring measures.", "2997": "For after Clodius had ejected Cicero and sent off Cato to Cyprus t under colour of giving him a command, and Cæsar was gone to Gaul, and Clodius saw that the people were devoted to him as he was doing everything and framing all his measures to please them, he immediately attempted to repeal some of the regulations of Pompeius, and seizing the person of the captive Tigranes he kept him in his own house, and he instituted prosecutions against the friends of Pompeius, and so made trial of the power of Pompeius by attacking his friends.", "2998": "At last when Pompeius came forward upon the occasion of a certain trial, Clodius having with him a body of men filled with insolence and arrogance took his station in a conspicuous place and put to them the following questions:", "2999": "“ Who is Imperator unlimited ?", "3000": "what man seeks another man ?", "3001": "who scratches his head t with one finger ? \"", "3002": "The people like a Chorus trained to chant corresponding parts, while Clodius was shaking his toga,§ at every question with loud shouts replied, “ Pompeius.\"XLIX.", "3003": "Now this also annoyed Pompeius, who was unaccustomed to be abused and had no practice in this kind of warfare;", "3004": "but he was still more vexed when he perceived that the Senate were pleased at the insults offered to him and at his paying the penalty for his treachery to Cicero.", "3005": "But when it happened that they came to blows in the Forum and even proceeded so far as to wound one another, and a slave of Clodius was detected in the crowd stealing through the bystanders up to Pom­ peius with a dagger in his hand, Pompeius alleging these proceedings as his excuse, and besides that, being afraid of the insolence and abuse of Clodius, came no more into the Forum so long as Clodius was in office, but kept to his house and was planning with his friends how he could pacify the resentment of the Senate and the nobles towards him.", "3006": "However he would not listen to Culleo,* who advised him to put away Julia and giving up the friendship of Cæsar to pass over to the Senate, but he followed the advice of those who recommended that Cicero t should be restored, who was the greatest enemy of Clodius and most beloved by the Senate.", "3007": "Pompeius with a strong party accompanied Cicero'a brother who was going to make his entreaty to the people, and after some wounds had been inflicted in the Forum and some persons were killed, they got the advantage over Clodius.", "3008": "Cicero returning to the city in pursuance of a law immediately reconciled Pompeius to the Senate, and, by speaking in favour of the law relating to grain,t in a manner again made Pompeius master of all the land and sea that the Romans possessed.", "3009": "For under his control were placed harbours, places of trade, the disposal of produce, in a word, all the affairs of those who navigated the sea and cultivated the land.", "3010": "But Clodius complained that the law had not been made on account of the scarcity of grain, but that the scarcity of grain was caused in order that the law might be passed, and that Pompeius might again fan into a flame and recover his power, which was as it were wasting away through his want of spirit.", "3011": "Others explained this to have been a device of the consul Spinther, whose object was to engage Pompeius in a higher official employment, that himself might be sent out to support king Ptolemæus.*", "3012": "However Canidius the tribune pro­ posed a measure to the effect that Pompeius without an army and with two lictors should go to bring about a recon­ ciliation between the Alexandrians and the king.", "3013": "And indeed it was supposed that Pompeius was not displeased at the measure, but the Senate rejected it on the specious pretext that they feared for the safety of Pompeius.", "3014": "There were writings to be found scattered about the Forum and near the Senate-house, to the effect that Ptolemæus wished Pompeius to be given to him as general instead of Spinther.", "3015": "And Timagenes † says that Ptolemæus without any reason and without necessity had quitted Egypt and left it at the advice of Theophanes who was planning pro­ fitable occupation for Pompeius and a subject for a fresh command.", "3016": "But the villainy of Theophanes does not make this so probable, as the character of Pompeius makes it improbable, for he had no ambition of so mean and illiberal a kind.", "3017": "L. Pompeius being appointed to look after the manage­ ment and the supply of corn, sent his deputies and friends to many places, and he himself sailed to Sicily and Sar­ dinia and Libya and collected grain.", "3018": "When he was about to set sail, there was a violent wind on the sea, and the mas­ ters of the ships were unwilling to put out, but Pompeius embarking first and bidding them raise the anchor, cried, “ It is necessary to sail;", "3019": "there is no necessity to live.\"", "3020": "By such boldness and zeal, and the help of good fortune, Pompeius filled the markets with grain and the sea with ships, so that the superfluity of what he got together sufficed even for those who were without, and there was as from a spring an abundant overflowing for all.", "3021": "LI.", "3022": "During this time the Celtic wars.", "3023": "raised Cæsar to great distinction;", "3024": "and though he was considered to be a very long way from Rome, and to be occupied with Belgæ and Suevi and Britanni, he contrived, by his skilful management, without being perceived, in the midst of the popular assemblies, and in the most important matters, to frustrate the political measures of Pompeius.", "3025": "For Cæsar's military force was like a body that invested him, and he was training it to toil, and making it invincible and formidable, not to oppose the barbarians, but he was disciplining his men in these contests just as if it were merely hunting wild beasts and pursuing them with dogs ;", "3026": "and in the meantime he was sending to Rome gold and silver, and the rest of the spoil and wealth which he got in abundance from so many enemies, and by tempting people there with gifts, and assisting ædiles in their expenses, and generals and consuls and their wives, he was gaining over many of them;", "3027": "so that when he had crossed the Alps and was wintering in Luca, there was a great crowd of men and women who vied with one another in their eagerness to visit him, besides two hundred of the Senatorian class, among whom were Pompeius and Crassub, and one hundred and twenty fasces of proconsuls and præ­ tors were seen at Cæsar's doors.", "3028": "Now, after filling all the rest with hopes and money, he sent them off;", "3029": "but a com­ pact was made between him and Crassus and Pompeius, that they should be candidates for the consulship, and that Cæsar should help them by sending many of his soldiers to vote, and that as soon as they were elected, they should secure for themselves the command of pro­ vinces and armies, and should confirm Cæsar's provinces to him for another five years.", "3030": "Upon this being publicly known, the first men in the State were displeased, and Marcellinus coming forward before the popular assembly, asked both Crassus and Pompeius to their faces, if they would be candidates for the consulship.", "3031": "The assembly bade them give him an answer, on which Pompeius spoke first, and said, that perhaps he should and perhaps he should not.", "3032": "Crassus replied in a manner more befitting a citizen,.", "3033": "for he said that he would act either way, as he should think it best for the common weal.", "3034": "But when Marcellinus stuck close to Pompeius, and was considered to be speaking in violent terms, Pompeius said that Mar­ cellinus, of all men, showed the least regard to fair dealing, because he was not grateful to him in that he was the means of Marcellinus becoming eloquent, though he was formerly mute, and of now being so full as to vomit, though formerly he was starving of hunger.", "3035": "LII.", "3036": "However, though everybody else declined to become candidates for the consulship, Cato persuaded Lucius Do­ mitius,t and encouraged him not to give up, for he said the contest with the tyrants was not for power, but for liberty.", "3037": "But Pompeius and his partisans fearing the vigour of Cato, and lest, as he had all the Senate on his side, lie should draw away and change the minds of the sounder part of the people, would not allow Domitius to come down into the Forum, but they sent armed men and killed the linkbearer, who was advancing in front, and put the rest to flight.", "3038": "Cato was the last to retreat, after being wounded in the right arm while he was fighting in front of Domi­ tius.", "3039": "By such means they attained the consulship, nor did they conduct themselves in it with more decency.", "3040": "First of all, while the people were electing Cato prætor and giving their votes, Pompeius broke up the assembly, alleging that the omens were not favourable;", "3041": "and they had Vatinius* proclaimed in place of Cato by bribing the tribes.", "3042": "In the next place they introduced measures by means of Trebonius,t which gave to Cæsar, pursuant to the agreement, a second five years, to Crassus ‡ Syria and tho Parthian expedition, but to Pompeius all Libya, and both the provinces of Iberia and four legions, of which he lent two to Cæsar at his request for the war in Gaul.", "3043": "Now Crassus went out to his province, after giving up his consular functions;", "3044": "and Pompeius opened his theatre,§ and gave gymnastic and musical contests at the dedication of it, and fights of wild beasts, in which five hundred lions were killed;", "3045": "and at the end he exhibited an elephant- fight, a most astonishing spectacle.", "3046": "LIII.", "3047": "For all this Pompeius got admiration and love;", "3048": "but on the other hand he brought on himself no less odium by giving up the forces and the provinces to legati who were his friends, while himself in the places of amusement in Italy going about from one to another spent his time with his wife, either because he loved her, or because he could not bear to leave his wife who was attached to him;", "3049": "for this also is said.", "3050": "And the love of the young woman for her husband was much talked about, for her affection towards Pompeius was not what might have been expected considering his age;", "3051": "but the reason appears to have been the chaste conduct of her husband who knew only his married wife, and the dignity of his manners which were not austere but agreeable and particularly attractive to women, if we must not disbelieve the testimony even of Flora the courtezan.", "3052": "It happened that at the election of ædiles some men came to blows and no small number were killed near Pompeius, and as his garments were drenched with blood, he changed them.", "3053": "There was great confusion and hurrying to the house of the slaves who were carrying the vests;", "3054": "and it happened that Julia,* who was with child, saw the bloody toga, upon which she fainted and with difficulty recovered, and in consequence of that alarm and the excitement, she miscarried.", "3055": "Even those who found most fault with the alliance of Cæsar and Pompeius, could not blame the woman for her affection.", "3056": "She became pregnant a second time and brought forth a female child, but she died of the pains of labour and the child did not survive her many days.", "3057": "Pompeius made preparations to bury her in his Alban villa, but the people by force took the body and carried it down into the Field of Mars, more from pity for the young woman than to please Pompeius and Cæsar.", "3058": "But of the two, it was considered that the people gave a larger portion of the honour to Cæsar who was absent than to Pompeius who was present.", "3059": "But in the city the waves forthwith began to move and everything was tossed to and fro, and was the subject of conversation tending to a complete split, now that the marriage connection was ended which hitherto rather veiled than checked the ambition of the two men.", "3060": "After no long time news also arrived that Crassus had lost his life among the Parthians;", "3061": "and that which had been a great hindrance to the civil war break­ ing out was now removed, for both Cæsar and Pompeius feared Crassus, and accordingly to some extent confined themselves within limits in their behaviour towards one another.", "3062": "But when fortune had cut off the man who was keeping a watch over the struggle, forthwith the words of the comic poet became applicable :", "3063": "“Now each against the other smears his limbs, And strews his hands with dust.”", "3064": "So small a thing is fortune in comparison with men'is nature.", "3065": "For fortune cannot satisfy men's desires, since so great an amount of command and extent of wide-stretched territory put no check on the desires of two men, but though they heard and read that \" all things- were divided into three portions for the gods and each got his share of dominion,\" they thought the Roman empire was not enough for them who were only two.", "3066": "consulship of L. Domitius Ahenobarbus and Ap. Claudius Pulcher See the Life of Cæsar, c. 23.)", "3067": "Crassus lost his life B.C. 53.LIV.", "3068": "Yet Pompeius once said when he was addressing the people, that he had obtained every office sooner than he expected, and laid it down sooner than was expected.", "3069": "And in truth he had the disbandings of his forces a per­ petual testimony of the truth of what he said.", "3070": "But now being convinced that Cæsar would not give up his power, he sought by means of the functionaries of the state to strengthen himself against him, but he attempted no change of any kind and did not wish to be considered to dis­ trust Cæsar, but to disregard him rather and to despise him.", "3071": "However when he saw that the officers were not disposed of according to his judgment, the citizens being bribed, he allowed anarchy to spring up in the state ;", "3072": "and forthwith there was much talk about a dictator, whom Lucilius the tribune first ventured to mention by advising the people to choose Pompeius dictator.", "3073": "Cato attacked him for this, and Lucilius ran the risk of losing his tribunate, and many of the friends of Pompeius came forward to exculpate him and said that he did not seek that office or wish for it.", "3074": "Upon this Cato commended Pompeius and exhorted him to turn his attention to the establishment of order, and Pompeius then out of shame did turn his attention to it, and Domitius* and Messala were made consuls;", "3075": "but after­ wards there was again anarchy, and a greater number of persons now began to agitate the question of a dictator more boldly, and Cato and his partisans fearing that they should be forced to yield, determined to let Pompeius have a certain legalized authority for the purpose of diverting him from that pure tyrannical office.", "3076": "Bibulus, who was an enemy of Pompeius, was the first to propose in the Senate to choose Pompeius solo consul ;", "3077": "† and he said that the city would thus either be relieved from the present disorder, or they would be slaves to the best man among them.", "3078": "This opinion appeared strange from such a person, when Cato rising for the purpose as it was expected of speaking against Bibulus, as soon as there was silence, said that for his part he would not have introduced the proposed measure, but as it was introduced by another he advised that it should be adopted, for he preferred any government to no government, and he thought that nobody would administer affairs better than Pompeius at a time of such disorder.", "3079": "The Senate accepted the proposal and passed a decree that Pompeius if elected should be sole consul, and that if he wanted a colleague, he might choose any person whom he approved of, but not before two months had elapsed;", "3080": "and Pompeius being made consul on these terms and declared by Sulpicius the Interrex, addressed Cato in a friendly manner, admitting his great obligations to him and urging him to give him his advice as a private man in the discharge of his office.", "3081": "But Cato would not admit that Pompeius was under any obligations to him, for he had said nothing that he did say out of regard to him, but out of regard to the state:", "3082": "he added that he would give him his advice if he were privately applied to;", "3083": "and if Pompeius did not invite hint, he would publicly tell him his opinion.", "3084": "Such was Cato in every­ thing.", "3085": "LV.", "3086": "After entering the city, Pompeius married Cornelia,* a daughter of Metellus Scipio, who was not a virgin, but had lately been left a widow by Publius, the son of Crassus, who had lost his life among the Parthians, and whose virgin bride she was.", "3087": "The young woman possessed many charms besides her youthful beauty, for the was well instructed in letters, in playing on the lyre, and in geo­ metry, and she had been accustomed to listen to philoso­ phical discourses with profit.", "3088": "In addition to this she had a disposition free from all affectation and pedantic display, faults which such acquirements generally breed in women:", "3089": "her father also, both in respect to family and reputation, was above all imputation.", "3090": "Still the marriage did not please some people on account of the disparity of years;", "3091": "for the youth of Cornelia made her a fitter match for a son of Pompeius.", "3092": "But those who were more judicious considered that Pompeius had overlooked the state, which was in an unfortunate condition, to cure which the state had selected him for her physician, and put herself solely in his hands ;", "3093": "and he was wearing chaplets and celebrating a marriage, when he ought to have considered his consulship a cala­ mity, as it would not have been conferred on him so con­ trary to all constitutional practice, if his country were in a prosperous condition.", "3094": "However, he presided at the trials for corruption and bribery,.", "3095": "and drew up laws, pursuant to which the trials were conducted, and with the exception presently to be mentioned, he conducted all the proceedings with dignity and fairness, and he secured to the courts safety, order, and quiet, by taking his own place there with armed men;", "3096": "but when his father-in-law Scipio was under trial, he sent for the three hundred and sixty judices to his house and obtained their support for him, and the accuser gave up the prosecution when he saw Scipio conducted from the Forum by the ju dices.t", "3097": "This brought Pompeius again into bad report, which was still further increased when he came forward to speak in praise of Plancus,* though he had by special law put an end to encomiums on persons under trial.", "3098": "Cato, who happened to be one of the judices, stopped his ears with his hands, saying it was not right in him to listen to the encomiums which were contrary to law.", "3099": "In consequence of this Cato was rejected before the votes were given, but Plane us was convicted by the votes of the rest and to the shame of Pompeius.", "3100": "Now, a few days after, Hypsæus,† a consular man, who was under prosecution, watched for Pompeius as he was going to sup after taking the bath, and clasping his knees, suppliantly entreated him;", "3101": "but Pompeius passed by contemptuously, saying that Hypsæus was spoiling his supper, and doing nothing more.", "3102": "By showing himself thus partial he got blame.", "3103": "However, in every other respect he established good order, and took his father-in- law as his colleague for the remaining five months.", "3104": "A decree also was made that he should hold the provinces for another four years, and should receive yearly a thousand talents, out of which he was to feed and main­ tain his troops.", "3105": "LVI.", "3106": "Cæsar's friends taking advantage of this, claimed some notice for Cæsar also, who was fighting so many battles for the supremacy of Rome;", "3107": "they said that he deserved either another consulship, or to have a fresh period added to his command, during which no other should supersede him and carry off the glory due to his labours, but that he who had accomplished those things should hold the command and quietly enjoy the honour.", "3108": "A debate arose on these subjects, on which Pompeius, affecting to deprecate the odium against Cæsar out of regard to him, said that he had letters of Cæsar, who was willing to have a successor and to be relieved from service, but still Cæsar thought it fair that he should be allowed to be a candidate for the consulship though he was not at Rome.", "3109": "To this Cato made opposition, and said that Cæsar ought to become a private person and lay down his arms, and then get any favour that he could from the citizens;", "3110": "and when Pompeius did not prosecute the debate, but submitted as if he were worsted, his real opinions about Cæsar became more suspected.", "3111": "He also sent to Cæsar and demanded back the troops.", "3112": "which he had lent him, pre­ tending that he wanted them for the Parthian war.", "3113": "But Caesar, though he knew why ho was required to give up the troops, sent them back after handsomely rewarding them.", "3114": "LVII.", "3115": "After this Pompeius had a dangerous illness at Neapolis, from which he recovered.", "3116": "Upon the suggestion of Praxagoras, the people of Neapolis offered sacrifices for his restoration to health.", "3117": "The neighbouring people fol­ lowed their example, and the thing thus going the round of Italy, every city, small and great, celebrated a festival for several days.", "3118": "No place was large enough to contain the people, who flocked together from all parts, but the roads were filled and the villages and ports with the people rejoicing and sacrificing.", "3119": "Many persons also with chaplets on their heads and lighted torches received Pom­ peius, and accompanied him throwing flowers over him, so that his journey and progress was a most beautiful sight and very splendid.", "3120": "However, it is said that this circum­ stance contributed to bring about the war as much as anything else.", "3121": "For an arrogant feeling entered the mind of Pompeius, and, with the greatness of the rejoicing, carried off all reflection on the present state of affairs;", "3122": "and throwing away the caution which had always secured his good fortune and his measures, he fell into a state of such unmingled confidence and contempt of Cæsar's power, as to suppose that he would require neither arms to oppose him nor any troublesome preparation, but that he could put him down much easier than he had raised him.", "3123": "Be­ sides this, Appius came from Gaul with the troops which Pompeius had lent to Cæsar;", "3124": "and he greatly disparaged Cæsar's exploits there, and uttered much abuse against Cæsar;", "3125": "and he said that Pompeius did not know his own power and reputation, if he intended to strengthen himself against Cæsar by other troops, for that he could put down Caesar with Cæsar's own troops, as soon as he made his appearance;", "3126": "so great, as he said, was their hatred of Cæsar and their affection towards Pompeius.", "3127": "Accordingly Pompeius was so much elated, and through his confidence filled with such contempt, that he even ridiculed those who were afraid of the war;", "3128": "and to those who said that, if Cæsar advanced against the city, they saw no troops sufficient to repulse him, with smiling countenance and tranquil mien he bade them give themselves no trouble about that, \"for in whatever part of Italy,\" he said, \"I stamp the earth with my foot, there will spring up forces both men and horse.\"", "3129": "LVIII.",

centurions who had come from Cæsar, while standing near the Senate-house and hearing that the Senate were refusing to allow Cæsar a prolongation of his term of government, said as he struck his hand on his sword, “ But this will give it.\"", "3134": "And all that was doing and preparing had this design in view.", "3135": "Yet the claims and reasons urged by Curio in favour of Cæsar were of a more constitutional character.", "3136": "For ho asked one of two things, either that they should require Pompeius also to give up his force, or they should not take Cæsar's troops from him:", "3137": "he said, “ Whether they become private persons on fair terms or continued a match for one another by each keeping what he had, they would remain quiet;", "3138": "but he who proposed to weaken one of them would double the power which he feared.\"", "3139": "Upon this Marcel lus the consul called Cæsar a robber, and urged the Senate to vote him an enemy, if he should not lay down his arms.",

withdraw who were of opinion that both should lay down their arms and that neither should hold a command, only two-and-twenty were in favour of Pompeius, and all the rest were on the side of Curio.",

year.", "3152": "But when Pompeius began to raise recruits, some refused and a few came together tardily and with­ out any readiness, but the greater part cried out that some terms should be come

two legions with which he should hold Illyricum and wait for his second consulship.", "3157": "As Pompeius was dissatisfied with this, the friends of Cæsar so far yielded as to agree that Cæsar should dismiss one of these two legions;", "3158": "but as Lentulus made opposition and Cato called out that Pompeius was blundering again if he allowed himself to be deceived, the attempt at a settlement

"3161": "But this was false;", "3162": "for he was advancing with only three hundred horsemen and five thousand legionary soldiers, and he did not wait for the rest of his force which was beyond the Alps, choosing to fall upon his enemies when they were in confusion and did not expect him, rather than to give them time to prepare to fight with him.", "3163": "Upon reaching the river Rubico, which was the boundary of his province, he stood in silence and lingered, reflecting, as we may presume, on the magnitude of the risk.", "3164": "Then, like those who throw themselves into a huge abyss from a precipice, closing the eyes of calculation and wrapping himself up to meet the danger, he called out in Greek to those who were present these words only, “ Let the die be cast,\" and took his army over.", "3165": "As soon as the report reached Rome, and tumult and fear, such as were never known before, together with consternation filled the city, the Senate immediately hurried in a body to

the bold language of Cato, bade Pompeius strike the ground with his foot and call up the troops which he promised.", "3168": "Pompeius mildly submitted to this ill-timed sarcasm;", "3169": "and when Cato reminded him of what he had originally predicted to him about Caesar, Pompeius replied that what Cato had said was in truth more prophetic, but what he had done was of a more friendly character.", "3170": "LXI.", "3171": "Cato advised that Pompeius should be appointed general Imperator, adding, that it was the business of those who caused great mischief to put an end to it.", "3172": "Cato immediately left the city for Sicily, for he had obtained that island as his province;", "3173": "and of the rest each went to the province which had been assigned to him by lot.", "3174": "But as nearly all Italy was in commotion, the events that hap­ pened caused much perplexity;", "3175": "for those who were out of Rome hurried from all parts and crowded into the city, and the inhabitants of Rome hastened to leave the city, which in such tempest and confusion was weak in avail­ able means, but strong in insubordination and the difficulty that it caused to the magistrates.", "3176": "For it was not possible to allay the fear, nor did any one allow Pompeius to follow his own judgment, but in whatever way a man was affected, whether by fear, grief or perplexity, he carried it to Pompeius and filled him with it;", "3177": "and opposite measures prevailed in the same day, and it was impossible for Pompeius to get any true intelligence about the enemy, because there were many who reported anything that they chanced to hear, and were vexed if he did not believe them.", "3178": "Under these circumstances after declaring by an edict that he saw nothing but confusion, and bidding all the senators follow him, and giving notice that he should consider all who stayed behind as partisans of Cæsar, he left the city late in the evening;", "3179": "and the consuls fled without even making the sacrifices which were usual before wars.", "3180": "But even in the midst of danger Pompeius was fortunate in the general affection of the people, for though many blamed the generalship, there was not one who hated the general, but one might have found that those who were not willing to leave Pompeius were more numerous than those who left the city for the cause of liberty.", "3181": "LXII.", "3182": "A few days after, Cæsar entered and took pos­ session of Rome.*", "3183": "He behaved with moderation to all and pacified everybody, except Metellust one of the tribunes who attempted to hinder him from taking money out of the treasury, on which Cæsar threatened him with death and added to his threat still harsher words, for he said, That to say this was harder for him than to do it.", "3184": "Having thus put Metellus to flight and taken what ho wanted, Cæsar pursued Pompeius, being anxious to drive him out of Italy before his troops from Iberia arrived.", "3185": "Pompeius who had got possession of Brundisium and had plenty of ships, immediately put on board the consuls and with them thirty cohorts and sent them over before him to Dyrrachium:", "3186": "Scipio his father- in-law and his own son Cneius he sent to Syria to get a fleet ready.", "3187": "After barricading the gates and placing on the walls the soldiers who were most lightly armed, he ordered the people of Brundisium‡ to keep quiet in their houses, and he then broke up all the ground in the city and intersected it with ditches, and filled up all the streets with stakes except two through which he went down to the sea.", "3188": "On the third day he had already embarked at his leisure all the troops with the exception of those who were guarding the walls, to whom he suddenly gave a signal, upon which they all ran down quickly and being taken on board got out to sea.", "3189": "When Cæsar saw the walls deserted, he concluded that the enemy were making off, and in his pursuit of them he narrowly escaped getting involved among the stakes and trenches;", "3190": "but as the people of Brundisium gave him warning, he avoided the city and, making a circuit round it, he found that all had got under sail, except two vessels which contained only a few soldiers.", "3191": "LXIII.", "3192": "Now everybody else reckons the sailing away of Pompeius among the best military stratagems, but Cæsar* wondered that Pompeius, who was in possession of a strong city and was expecting his troops from Iberia and was master of the sea, should desert and abandon Italy.", "3193": "Cicero† also blames Pompeius for imitating the generalship of Themistokles rather than that of Perries, the circum­ stances being like those of Perikles and not those of Themistokles.", "3194": "And Cæsar showed by what he did that he was greatly afraid of time:", "3195": "‡ for when he had taken prisoner Numerius, a friend of Pompeius, he sent him to Brundisium with instructions to bring about a reconcili­ ation on fair terms ;", "3196": "but Numerius sailed off with Pom­ peius.", "3197": "Upon this Caesar, who in sixty days had become master of Italy without shedding any blood, was desirous of pursuing Pompeius immediately, but as he had no vessels, he turned about and marched to Iberia with the design of gaining over the troops there.", "3198": "LXIV.", "3199": "During this time Pompeius got together a great force:", "3200": "his naval power was completely irresistible, for the fighting ships were five hundred, and the number of Liburnian vessels* and other small craft was immense;", "3201": "the cavalry, the flower of the Romans and Italians, was seven thousand, distinguished by family, and wealth and courage;", "3202": "his infantry, which was a mixed body and required dis­ cipline, he exercised in Berœa,† not sitting still lazily, but practising himself in gymnastic exercises t as if he were still in the vigour of his age.", "3203": "And it was a great motive to confidence, when men saw Pompeius Magnus, who was now sixty years of age save two, exercising himself among the infantry under arms, then mounting his horse and drawing his sword without any trouble while his horse was galloping and easily sheathing it again;", "3204": "and in the throwing of his spear showing not only an exact­ ness of aim, but a strength of arm in the distance to which he sent it, which many of the young men could not surpass.", "3205": "Both kings of nations and governors came to him ;", "3206": "and of the men of rank about him from Rome there were sufficient to make up a complete Senate.§", "3207": "There cains also Labeo,* who left Cæsar though he had been his friend and had served with him in Gaul;", "3208": "and Brutus,† son of the Brutus who was put to death in Gaul, a man of noble spirit who had never yet spoken to Pompeius or saluted him because Pompeius had put his father to death, but now he took service under him as the liberator of Rome.", "3209": "Cicero,‡ though he had both in his writings and his speeches in the Senate recommended other measures, was ashamed not to join those who were fighting in defence of their country.", "3210": "There came also to Macedonia Tidius Sextius,§ a man of extreme old age, lame of one leg;", "3211": "and while others were laughing and jeering, Pompeius on seeing him rose up and ran to meet him, for he considered it a great testimony for men of advanced age and feeble strength to choose danger with him in preference to safety.", "3212": "LXV.", "3213": "A Senate being formed, upon the proposition of Cato they came to a resolution to put no Roman to death except in battle, and not to plunder any city that was subject to the Romans, which increased still further the popularity of the party of Pompeius;", "3214": "for those who were unconcerned about the war by reason of being far removed from it or who were disregarded on account of their weak­ ness, gave Pompeius the benefit of their good wishes at least, and as far as words could go contended on his behalf in favour of the right, considering every man an enemy to gods and to men who did not wish Pompeius to be victo­ i ious.", "3215": "Cæsar also showed much moderation in his success, for after he had captured and defeated the forces of Pom­ peius in Iberia,* he let the generals go and employed the troops.", "3216": "After crossing the Alps again and hurrying through Italy, he arrived at Brundisium about the winter solstice.", "3217": "He then crossed the sea and putting in at Oricum sent Jubius,t a friend of Pompeius, who was his prisoner, to Pompeius t to propose that they should both meet together on the third day, disband all their forces, and after being reconciled and confirming their union by oath, return to Italy.", "3218": "Pompeius again considered this to be an ambuscade, and hastily going down to the sea ho took possession of the posts and places which presented very strong positions for an army;", "3219": "he also seized the naval stations and landing places which were favourable for those who came by sea, so that every wind which blow brought to Pompeius corn or troops or money;", "3220": "but Cæsar being confined in straits both on the sea and land side was of necessity glad to fight, and he attacked the lines of Pompeius and continually provoked him to battle, in which Cæsar had generally the advantage and the su­ periority in the skirmishing.", "3221": "But on one occasion he narrowly escaped being completely crushed and losing his army, for Pompeius fought with great courage and routed all the enemy, who lost two thousand men;", "3222": "but he was either unable or was afraid to force his way into Cæsar's camp and to enter with the fugitives, which made Cæsar say to his friends, \" To-day the victory would have been with the enemy, if they had had a commander who knew how to conquer.\"", "3223": "LXVI.", "3224": "The partisans of Pompeius being greatly elated at this success were eager to have a decisive battle.", "3225": "Pompeius wrote to the distant kings and generals and cities to inform them that he was victorious, but he feared the risk of a battle, thinking that by delay and reducing the enemy to straits he should finally vanquish men who were invincible in arms and had long been accustomed to conquer together, but as to the other military duties, and marches, and change of position, and digging of trenches and building of walls, were not efficient by reason of age and on this account were eager to come to close fighting and to engage hand to hand.", "3226": "However, previous to the last contest Pompeius had been able in some degree to draw his men from their purpose by persuading them to keep quiet;", "3227": "but when Cæsar after the battle was com­ pelled by want of provisions to break up his camp, and began his march into Thessaly through the country of the Athamanes,* the confidence of the soldiers of Pompeius could no longer be kept in check, and calling out that Cæsar was flying, some were for following and pursuing him, and others for crossing over into Italy, and others were sending to Rome their slaves and friends to get possession of houses near the Forum, with the intention of forthwith becoming candidates for office.", "3228": "Many of their own accord sailed to Cornelia who was in Lesbos bearing the good tidings of the war being at an end;", "3229": "for Pompeius had sent her there out of the way of danger.", "3230": "The Senate being assembled, Afranius gave his opinion that they should stick to Italy, for Italy was the chief prize of the war, and would bring to those who were masters of it the possession of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Iberia, and all Gaul;", "3231": "and as to that which was the greatest concern to Pompeius, his native country who was stretching out her hands only at a short distance from them, it was not honourable to leave her to be insulted and enslaved by slaves and flatterers of tyrants.", "3232": "But Pompeius did not consider it to be consistent with his reputation to run away from Caesar a second time and to be pursued, when fortune gave him the opportunity of being the pursuer, nor did he think it consistent with his duty to desert Scipio* and the consular men in Hellas and Thessaly who would immediately fall into Cæsar's hands with their military chests and large forces ;", "3233": "he thought also that Rome was best cared for by fighting in her defence as far from her as possible, that she might wait for the conqueror without feeling or hear­ ing of any misfortunes.", "3234": "LXVII.", "3235": "Having come to this decision, Pompeius pursued Cæsar, resolved to avoid a battle, but by following close up to hem him in and wear him out by privation.", "3236": "He had other reasons for thinking this to be the best plan, and it also reached his ears that it was a subject of common conversation among the cavalry that they ought to defeat Cæsar as soon as they could and then put down Pompeius also.", "3237": "Some say that this was also the reason why Pompeius employed Catof in no matter of importance, but even when he was marching against Caesar left him on the coast to look after the stores, through fear that if Caesar were destroyed, Cato might forthwith compel him also to lay down his command.", "3238": "Accordingly as he followed the enemy leisurely he was much censured and there was a clamour against him, that his object was not to defeat Cæsar by his generalship, but his native country and the Senate, that he might always keep the command and never give over having as his attendants and guards those who considered themselves the masters of the world.", "3239": "Domitius Ahenobarbus also by always calling him Agamemnon and King of Kings made him odious.", "3240": "Favonius too made himself no less disagreeable by his, scoffing manner than others by the unseasonable freedom of their language, calling out, \" Men, we shall not eat figs in Tusculum* even this year!\"", "3241": "Lucius Afranius who had lost his forces in Iberia and on that account had fallen under the imputation of treachery, now seeing that Pompeius avoided a battle, said he was surprised that those who accused him did not advance and fight against the trafficker in provinces.", "3242": "By these and like expressions often repeated they at last prevailed over Pompeius, a man who was a slave to public fame and the opinion of his friends, and drew him on to follow their own hopes and impetuosity and to give up the best considered plans, a thing which would have been unbefitting even in the master of a vessel, to say nothing of the commander-in- chief of so many nations and forces.", "3243": "Pompeius approved of the physician who never gratifies the desires of his patients, and yet he yielded to military advisers who were in a diseased state, through fear of offending if he adopted healing measures.", "3244": "And how can one say those men were in a healthy state, some of whom were going about among the troops and already canvassing for consulships and prætorships, and Spinther and Domitiust and Scipio were disputing and quarrelling about the priesthood of Caesar and canvassing, just as if Tigranes the Armenian were encamped by them or the King of the Nabathæans, and not that Cæsar and that force with which he had taken a thousand cities by storm, and subdued above three hundred nations, and had fought with Germans and Gauls unvanquished in more battles than could be counted, and had taken a hundred times ten thousand prisoners, and had slaughtered as many after routing them in pitched battles.", "3245": "LXVIII.", "3246": "However, by importunity and agitation, after the army had descended into the plain of Pharsalus,* they compelled Pompeius to hold a council of war, in which Labienus, who was commander of the cavalry, got up first, and swore that he would not leave the battle till he had routed the enemy;", "3247": "and they all swore to the same effect.", "3248": "In the night Pompeius dreamed that as he was entering the theatre, the people clapped, and that he was decorating a temple of Venus the Victorious t with many spoils.", "3249": "And in some resp ects he was encouraged, but in others rather depressed by the dream, lest fame and glory should accrue from him to the race of Cæsar, which traced its descent from Venus;", "3250": "and certain panic alarms which were rushing through the camp aroused him.", "3251": "In the morning-watch a bright lightt shone forth above the camp of Cæsar, which was in a state of profound tranquillity, and a flame like torch springing from this light descended upon the camp of Pompeius;", "3252": "and Cæsar himself says that he witnessed this as he was visiting the watches.", "3253": "At daybreak, as Cæsar was going to move to Scotussa,§ and the soldiers were engaged in taking down the tents and sending forward the beasts and camp-followers, the scouts came with intel­ ligence that they spied many arms in the enemy's encamp­ ment moving backwards and forwards, and that there was a movement and noise as of men coming out to battle.", "3254": "After them others came announcing that the vanguard was already putting itself in battle order.", "3255": "Upon this, Cæsar observing that the expected day had arrived on which they would have to fight against men, and not against hunger and poverty, quickly gave orders to hang out in front of his tent the purple colours,* which is the signal for battle among the Romans.", "3256": "The soldiers at the sight of it left their tents with loud shouts and rejoicing and hurried to arms;", "3257": "as the centurions led them to their several ranks, every man, just as if he belonged to a chorus, without confusion, being well trained, quietly took his place.", "3258": "LXIX.", "3259": "Pompeius commanded the right wing, intending to oppose Antonius;", "3260": "in the centre he placed his father-in- law Scipio against Calvinus Lucius;", "3261": "t and the left was commanded by Lucius Domitius, and strengthened with the main body of the cavalry.", "3262": "For nearly all the horsemen had crowded to that point, with the design of overpowering Cæsar and cutting to pieces the tenth legion, which had a very great reputation for courage, and Cæsar was accus­ tomed to take his station in this legion when he fought a battle.", "3263": "But Cæsar, observing that the enemy's left wing was strengthened by so large a body of cavalry, and fearing their brilliant equipment, summoned six cohorts from the reserve, and placed them in the rear of the tenth legion, with orders to keep quiet and not let the enemy see them;", "3264": "but as soon as the cavalry advanced, they had orders to run forwards through the first ranks, and not to throw their javelins, as the bravest soldiers are used to do in their eagerness to get to fighting with the sword, but to push upwards and to wound the eyes and faces of the enemy, for these handsome, blooming pyrrichists would not keep their ground for fear of their beauty being spoiled, nor would they venture to look at the iron that was pushed right into their faces.", "3265": "Now Cæsar was thus employed.", "3266": "But Pompeius, who was examining the order of battle from his horse, observing that the enemy were quietly awaiting in their ranks the moment of attack, and tho greater part of his own army was not still, but was in wavelike motion through want of experience and in con­ fusion, was alarmed lest his troops should be completely separated at the beginning of the battle;", "3267": "and he commanded the front ranks to stand with their spears presented, and keeping their ground in compact order to receive the enemy's attack.", "3268": "But Cæsar finds fault- with this general­ ship of Pompeius;", "3269": "for he says that he thus weakened the force of the blows which a rapid assault produces;", "3270": "and the rush to meet the advancing ranks, which more than anything else fills the mass of the soldiers with enthusiasm and impetuosity in closing with the enemy, and combined with the shouts and running increases the courage—Pom­ peius, by depriving his men of this, fixed them to the ground and damped them.", "3271": "On Cæsar's side the numbers were twenty-two thousand;", "3272": "on the side of Pompeius the numbers † were somewhat more than double.", "3273": "LXX. ‡", "3274": "And now, when the signal was given on both sides, and the trumpet was beginning to urge them on to the conflict, every man of this great mass was busy in looking after himself;", "3275": "but a few of the Romans, the best, and some Greeks who were present, and not engaged in the battle, as the conflict drew near, began to reflect to what a condition ambition and rivalry had brought the Roman State.", "3276": "For kindred arms and brotherly battalions and common standards,* and the manhood and the might of a single state in such numbers, were closing in battle, self-matched against self, an example of the blindness of human nature and its madness, under the influence of passion.", "3277": "For if they had now been satisfied quietly to govern and enjoy what they had got, there was the largest and the best portion of the earth and of the sea subject to them;", "3278": "and if they still wished to gratify their love of trophies and of triumphs, and their thirst for them, they might have their fill of Parthian or German wars.", "3279": "Scythia, too, and the Indians were a labour in reserve, and ambition had a reasonable pretext for such undertaking, the civili­ zation of barbaric nations.", "3280": "And what Scythian horse, or Parthian arrows, or Indian wealth could have chocked seventy thousand Romans advancing in arms under Pom­ peius and Caesar, whose name these nations heard of long before they heard of the name of Rome ?", "3281": "Such unsociable, and various, and savage nations had they invaded and conquered.", "3282": "But now they engaged with one another in battle, without even feeling any compunction about their own glory, for which they spared not their native country, up to this day having always borne the name of invincible.", "3283": "For the relationship that had been made between them, and the charms of Julia, and that marriage, were from the very first only deceitful and suspected pledges of an alliance formed from interested motives, in which there was not a particle of true friendship.", "3284": "LXXI.", "3285": "Now when the plain of Pharsalus was filled with men and horses and arms, and the signal for battle was raised on both sides, the first to spring forward from the line of Cæsar was Caius Crassianust a centurion who had the command of one hundred and twenty men, and was now fulfilling a great promise to Caesar.", "3286": "For as Cæsar observed him to be the first that was quitting the camp, he spoke to him and asked what he thought of the battle;", "3287": "and Cragsianus stretching out his right hand replied with a loud voice, \"You shall have a splendid victory, Cæsar;", "3288": "and as to me, you shall praise me whether I survive the day or die.\"", "3289": "Remembering what he had said, he rushed forward and carrying many along with him fell on the centre of the enemy.", "3290": "The struggle was forthwith with the sword and many fell;", "3291": "but while Crassianus was pushing forwards and cutting down those who were in the front ranks, a soldier made a stand against him and drove his sword through his mouth so that the point came out at the back of the neck.", "3292": "When Crassianus had fallen, the battle was equally contested in this part of the field.", "3293": "Now Pompeius did not quickly lead on the right wing, but was looking at the opposite wing and lost time in waiting for the cavalry to get into action.", "3294": "The cavalry were now extending their companies with the view of surrounding Cæsar, and they drove Caesar's cavalry who were few in number upon the line in front of which they were stationed.", "3295": "But upon Caesar giving the signal, the cavalry retired, and the cohorts which had been reserved to meet the enemy's attempt to outflank them, rushed forward, three thousand in number, and met the enemy;", "3296": "then fixing themselves by the side of the horsemen, they pushed their spears upwards, as they had been instructed, against the horses, aiming at the faces of the riders.", "3297": "The horsemen, who were altogether inexperienced in fighting, and had never expected or heard of such a mode of attack, did not venture to stand or endure the blows aimed at their eyes and mouths, but turning their backs and holding their hands before their faces they ingloriously took to flight.", "3298": "The soldiers of Caesar leaving these fugitives to escape advanced against the infantry, and they made their attack at that point where the wing having lost the protection of the cavalry gave them the opportunity of outflanking and surrounding them.", "3299": "These men falling on the enemy in the flank and the tenth legion attacking them in front, the enemy did not stand their ground nor keep together, for they saw that while they were expecting to sur­ round the enemy, they were themselves surrounded.", "3300": "LXXII.", "3301": "After the infantry were routed, and Pompeius seeing the dust conjectured what had befallen the cavalry, what reflections passed in his mind, it is difficult to say ;", "3302": "but like a madman more than anything else and one whose reason was affected, without considering that he was Magnus Pompeius, without speaking a word to any one, he walked slowly back to his camp, so that one may properly apply to him the versos. :", "3303": "44 But lofty father Zeus struck fear in Ajax;", "3304": "He stood confounded, and behind him threw His shield of seven-ox-hide, and trembling look'd Towards the crowd.\"", "3305": "In this state Pompeius came to his tent and sat down without speaking, until many of the pursuers rushed into the camp with the fugitives;", "3306": "and then merely uttering these words, \" What, even to the camp!\" and nothing more, he rose and taking a dress suitable to his present condition made his way out.", "3307": "The rest of the legions also fled, and there was great slaughter in the camp of those who were left to guard the tents and of the slaves;", "3308": "but Asinius Polliot says that only six thousand soldiers fell, and Pollio fought in that battle on Cæsar's side.", "3309": "When Caesar's men took the camp, they saw evidence of the folly and frivolity of the enemy.", "3310": "For every tent was crowned with myrtle and furnished with flowered cover­ ings to the couches and tables loaded with cups;", "3311": "and bowls of wine were laid out, and there was the preparation and decoration of persons who had performed a sacrifice and were celebrating a festival, t rather than of men who were arming for battle.", "3312": "So blinded by their hopes, and so full of foolish confidence did they come out to war.", "3313": "LXXIII.", "3314": "Pompeius having proceeded a little way from the camp let his horse go, and with very few persons about him, went on slowly as no one pursued him, and with such thoughts, as would naturally arise in the mind of a man who for four-and-thirty years had been accus­ omed to conquer and to have the mastery in everything, and now for the first time in his old age experienced what defeat and flight were ;", "3315": "reflecting also that in a single battle he had lost the reputation and the power which were the fruit of so many struggles and wars, and while a little before he was protected by so many armed men and horses, and armaments, now he was retreating and had become so weak and humbled, as easily to escape the notice of his enemies who were looking for him.", "3316": "After passing Larissa* and arriving at Tempo, being thirsty he threw himself down on his face and drank of the river, and then rising up he pro­ ceeded through Tempo till he reached the sea.", "3317": "There he rested for the remainder of the night in a fisherman's hut, and at daybreak embarking on board of one of the river-boats and taking with him those of his followers who were freemen, and bidding his slaves go to Cæsar without any apprehension for their safety, he rowed along the coast till he saw a large merchant-ship pre­ paring to set sail, the master of which was a Roman, who had no intimacy with Pompeius, but knew him by sight:", "3318": "his name was Peticius.", "3319": "It happened the night before that Peticius saw Pompeius in a dream, not as he had often seen him, but humble and downcast, speaking to him.", "3320": "And it happened that he was telling his dream to his shipmates, as is usual with men in such weighty matters, who have nothing to do;", "3321": "when all at once one of the sailors called out that he spied a river-boat rowing from the land with men in it who were making signals with their clothes and stretching out their hands to them.", "3322": "Accordingly Peticius turning his eyes in that direction recognised Pompeius just as he had seen him in the dream, and striking his forehead he ordered the sailors to put the boat alongside, and he stretched out his right hand and called to Pompeius, already conjecturing from his appearance the fortune and the reverses of the man Upon which the master, without waiting to be entreated or addressed, took on board with him, all whom Pompeius chose (and these were the two Lentuli* and Favonius), and set sail;", "3323": "and shortly after seeing King Deiotarus making his way from the land as fast as he could they took him in also.", "3324": "When it was supper time and the master had made the best preparation that he could, Favonius observing that Pompeius had no domestics and was beginning to take off his shoes, ran up to him and loosed his shoes and helped him to anoint himself.", "3325": "And henceforward Favonius continued to wait on Pom­ peius and serve him, just as slaves do their master, even to the washing of his feet and preparing his meals, so that a witness of the free will of that service and the simplicity and absence of all affectation might have ex­ claimed \"", "3326": "To generous minds how noble every task.\"", "3327": "tLXXIV.", "3328": "In such wise Pompeius coasted to Amphipolis,t and thence crossed over to Mitylene, wishing to take up Cornelia and her son.", "3329": "Upon reaching the shore of the island he sent a message to the city, not such as Cornelia expected, for the pleasing intelligence that she had received both by report and by letter led her to hope that the war was terminated near Dyrrachium, and that all that remained for Pompeius was to pursue Cæsar.", "3330": "The mes­ senger, who found her in this state of expectation, did not venture to salute her, but indicating by tears more than words the chief and greatest of her misfortunes, he bade her hasten, if she wished to see Pompcius in a single vessel and that not his own.", "3331": "Cornelia, on hearing these words, threw herself on the ground, and lay there a long time without sense or speech, and with difficulty recover­ ing herself, and seeing that it was not a time for tears and lamentations, she ran through the city to the sea.", "3332": "Pompeius met and caught her in his arms as she was just ready to sink down and fall upon him, when Cornelia said, \" I see you, husband, not through your own fortune but mine, reduced to a single vessel, you who before your marriage with Cornelia sailed along this sea with five hundred ships.", "3333": "Why have you come to see me, and why did you not leave to her evil daemon one who has loaded you also with so much misfortune ?", "3334": "How happy a woman should I have been had I died before I heard that Publius, whose virgin bride I was, had perished by the Parthians;", "3335": "and how wise, if even after lie died I had put an end to my own life, as I attempted to do;", "3336": "but forsooth I have been kept alive to be the ruin of Pompeius Magnus also.", "3337": "\"LXXV.", "3338": "So it is said Cornelia spoke, and thus Pompeius replied:", "3339": "\" It is true, Cornelia, you have hitherto known only one fortune, and that the better;", "3340": "and perhaps it has deceived you too, in that it has abided with me longer than is wont.", "3341": "But as we are mortals, we must bear this change, and still try fortune;", "3342": "for it is not hopeless for a man to attempt from this condition to recover his former state who has come to this after being in that other.\"", "3343": "Accordingly Cornelia sent for her property and slaves from the city;", "3344": "and though the Mitylenæans came to pay their respects to Pompeius, and invited him to enter the city, he would not, but he exhorted them also to yield to the conqueror and to be of good heart, for Cæsar was merciful and of a humane disposition.", "3345": "But turning to Kratippus* the philosopher, for lie had come down from the city to him, Pompeius found fault with and in a few words expressed some doubts about Providence, Kratippus rather giving way to him and trying to lead him to better hopes, that he might not give him pain at so unseasonable a time by arguing against him;", "3346": "for Pompeius might have ques­ tioned him about Providence, and Kratippus might have shown that the state of affairs at Rome required a monarchy on account of the political disorder;", "3347": "and he might have asked Pompeius, \" How, Pompeius, and by what evidence shall we be persuaded that you would have used your fortune better than Cæsar, if you had been victorious ?\"", "3348": "But these matters that concern the gods we must leave as they are.", "3349": "LXXVI.", "3350": "Taking on board his wife and friends, Pom­ peius continued his voyage, only putting in at such ports as of necessity he must for water or provisions.", "3351": "The first city that he came to was Attaleia* of Pamphylia;", "3352": "and there some galleys from Cilicia met him, and some soldiers were collecting, and there were again about sixty senators about him.", "3353": "Hearing that his navy still kept together, and that Cato had recruited many soldiers and was passing over to Libya, he lamented to his friends and blamed him­ self for being forced to engage with his army only, and for not making any use of the force which was beyond all dispute superior to that of the enemy;", "3354": "and that his navy was not so stationed that if he were defeated by land he might forthwith have had what would have made him a match for the enemy, a strength and power so great by sea close at hand.", "3355": "Indeed Pompeius committed no greater fault, nor did Cæsar show any greater generalship, than in withdrawing the field of battle so far beyond the reach of assistance from the navy.", "3356": "However, being compelled in the present state of affairs to decide and do something, ho sent round to the cities, and himself sailing about to some, asked them for money, and began to man ships.", "3357": "But fearing the rapid movements and speed of his enemy, lest he should come upon him and take him before he was prepared, he looked about for a place of refuge for the present and a retreat.", "3358": "Now there appeared to them upon consideration to be no province to which they could safely fly;", "3359": "and as to the kingdoms, Pompeius gave it as his opinion that the Parthian * at the present was the best able to receive and protect them in their present weakness, and to strengthen them again and to send them forth with the largest force;", "3360": "of the rest, some turned their thoughts towards Libya and Juba,† but Theophanes of Lesbos pro­ nounced it madness to leave Egypt, which was only three days' sail distant, and Ptolemseus, ‡ who was still a youth, and indebted to Pompeius for the friendship and favour which his father had received from him, and to put him­ self in the hands of the Parthians, a most treacherous nation;", "3361": "and to be the first of all persons who did not choose to submit to a Roman who had been connected with him by marriage, nor to make trial of his moderation, and to put himself in the power of Arsakes,§ who was not able to take even Crassus so long as he was alive;", "3362": "and to carry a young wife of the family of Scipio among barbarians, who measured their power by their insolence and unbridled temper;", "3363": "and if no harm should befall Cornelia, and it should only be apprehended that she might suffer injury, it would be a sad thing for her to be in the power of those who wore able to do it.", "3364": "This alone, it is said, diverted Pompeius from proceeding to the Euphrates;", "3365": "if indeed any reflection still guided Pompeius, and he was not rather directed by a daemon to the way that he took.", "3366": "LXXVII.", "3367": "Accordingly when the proposal to fly to Egypt prevailed, Pompeius setting sail from Cyprus in a galley of Seleukeia* with his wife (and of the rest some accompanied him also in ships of war, and others in merchant vessels), crossed the sea safely;", "3368": "and hearing that Ptolemæus t was seated before Pelusium with his army, being engaged in war against his sister, he came to that part of the coast and sent forward a person to an­ nounce his arrival to the king and to pray for his pro­ tection.", "3369": "Now Ptolemæus was very young, and Potheinus who managed everything, summoned a council of the chief persons;", "3370": "and the chief persons were those whom he chose to make so, and he bade each man give his opinion.", "3371": "It was indeed a sad thing that such men should deliberate about Pompeius Magnus, as Potheinus the eunuch and Theodotus of Chios who was hired as a teacher of rhetoric and the Egyptian Achillas:", "3372": "for these were the chief advisers of the king among the eunuchs and others who had the care of his person;", "3373": "and such was the court whose decision Pompeius was waiting for at anchor some distance from the shore and tossed by the waves, he who thought it beneath him to be indebted to Caesar for his life.", "3374": "Now opinions among the rest were so far divided that some advised they should drive away Pompeius, and others, that they should invite and receive him :", "3375": "but Theodotus displaying his power in speech and his rhetorical art proved that neither of these courses was safe, but that if they received Pompeius, they would have Caesar for an enemy and Pompeius for their master, and if they drove him away, they would incur the displeasure of Pompeius for ejecting him and of Cæsar for the trouble of the pur­ suit ;", "3376": "it was therefore best to send for the man and kill him, for thus they would please Cæsar and have nothing to fear from Pompeius.", "3377": "And he concluded with a smile, as it is said.", "3378": "A dead man does not bite.", "3379": "LXXVIII.", "3380": "Having determined on this they intrust the execution to Achillas, who taking with him one Septimius who had a long time ago served under Pompeius as a centurion and Salvius another centurion and three or four slaves, put out towards the ship of Pompeius.", "3381": "It hap­ pened that all the most distinguished persons who accompanied Pompeius had come on board his ship to see what was going on.", "3382": "Accordingly when they raw a reception which was neither royal nor splendid nor corre­ sponding to the expectations of Theophanes, but a few men in a fishing-boat sailing towards them, this want of respect made them suspect treachery and they advised Pompeius to row back into the open sea, while they were still out of reach of missiles.", "3383": "In the mean time as the boat was nearing, Septimius was the first to rise and he addressed Pompeius as Imperator in the Roman language and Achillas saluting him in Greek invited him to enter the boat, because, as he said, the shallows were of great extent and the sea being rather sandy had not depth enough to float a trireme.", "3384": "At the same time it was observed that some of the king's ships were getting their men on board, and soldiers occupied the shore, so that it appeared impossible to escape even if they changed their minds and made the attempt;", "3385": "and besides, this want of con­ fidence would give the murderers some excuse for their crime.", "3386": "Accordingly, after embracing Cornelia who was an­ ticipating and bewailing his fate, he ordered two centurions to step into the boat before him, and Philippus one of his freedmen and a slave called Scythes, and while Achillas was offering him his hand out of the boat, he turned round to his wife and son and repeated the iambics of Sophocles, “ Whoever to a tyrant bends his way, Is made his slave, e'en if he goes a froeman.\"LXXIX*.", "3387": "These were the last words that he spoke to his friends before he entered the boat:", "3388": "and as it was a con­ siderable distance to the land from the galley, and none of those in the boat addressed any friendly conversation to him, looking at Septimius he said, “ I am not mistaken I think in recognising you as an old comrade of mine;", "3389": "” and Septimius nodded without making any reply or friendly acknowledgment.", "3390": "As there was again a pro­ found silence, Pompeius who had a small roll on which he had written a speech in Greek that he intended to address to Ptolemæus, began reading it.", "3391": "As they neared the land, Cornelia with her friends in great anxiety was watching the result from the galley, and she began to have good hopes when she saw some of the king's people collecting together at the landing as if to honor Pompeius and give him a reception.", "3392": "In the mean time, while Pom­ peius was taking the hand of Philippus that he might rise more easily, Septimius from behind was the first to transfix him with his sword;", "3393": "and Salvius, and after him Achillas drew their swords.", "3394": "Pompeius drawing his toga close with both hands over his face, without saying or doing anything unworthy of himself, but giving a groan only, submitted to the blows, being sixty years of age save one, and ending his life just one day after his birthday.", "3395": "LXXX.", "3396": "Those in the ships seeing the murder, uttered a shriek which could be heard even to the land, and quickly raising their anchors, took to flight:", "3397": "and a strong breeze aided them in their escape to the open sea, so that the Egyptians, though desirous of pursuing, turned back.", "3398": "They cut off the head of Pompeius, and throwing the body naked out of the boat, left it for those to gaze at who felt any curiosity.", "3399": "Philippus stayed by the body, till the people were satisfied with looking at it, and then washing it with sea-water he wrapped it up in a tunic of his own;", "3400": "and as ho had no other means, he looked about till he found tho wreck of a small fishing-boat, which was decayed indeed, but enough to make a funeral pile in case of need for a naked body, and that not an entire corpse.", "3401": "As he was collecting these fragments and putting them together, a Roman, now an old man*, who had served his first campaigns in his youth under Pompeius, stood by him and said:", "3402": "“Who are you, my friend, that are pre­ paring to perform the funeral rites to Pompeius Magnus ? \" Philippus replying that he was a freedman, the man said:", "3403": "“ But you shall not have this honour to yourself:", "3404": "allow me too to share in this pious piece of good fortune, that I may not altogether have to complain of being in a strange land, if in requital for many sufferings I get this honour at least, to touch and to tend with my hands the greatest of the Roman generals.\"", "3405": "Such were the obsequies of Pom­ peius.", "3406": "On the next day Lucius Lentulus who was on his voyage from Cyprus, not knowing what had happened, was coasting along the shore, when he saw the pile and Philippus standing by it before he was seen himself and said, “ Who is resting here after closing his career ? \" and after a slight interval, with a groan, he added, \"perhaps it is you, Pompeius Magnus.”", "3407": "Presently he landed, and being seized was put to death.", "3408": "This was the end of Pom­ peius.", "3409": "Not long after Cæsar arriving in Egypt, which was filled with this horrid deed, turned away from the man who brought him the head of Pompeius, as from a murderer, and when he received the seal of Pompeius, he shed tears;", "3410": "the device was a lion holding a sword.", "3411": "He put to death Achillas and Potheinus, and the king him­ self being defeated in battle was lost somewhere near the river.", "3412": "Theodotus the sophist escaped the vengeance of Cæsar, for he fled from Egypt and wandered about in a miserable state, the object of detestation;", "3413": "but Brutus Marcus, after he had killed Cæsar and got the power in his hands, finding Theodotus in Asia, put him to death with every circumstance of contumely.", "3414": "Cornelia obtained the remains of Pompeius and had them carried to his Alban villa and interred there.", "3415": "1.", "3416": "As both these men's lives are now before us, let us briefly recapitulate them, observing as we do so the points in which they differ from one another.", "3417": "These are as fol­ lows :", "3418": "-First, Pompeius obtained his power and renown by the most strictly legitimate means, chiefly by his own exertions when assisting Sulla in the liberation of Italy;", "3419": "while Agesilaus obtained the throne in defiance of both human and divine laws, for he declared Leotychides to be a bastard, although his brother had publicly recognised him as his own son, and he also by a quibble evaded the oracle about a lame reign.", "3420": "Secondly, Pompeius both respected Sulla while he lived, gave his body an honourable burial, in spite of Lepidus, when he died, and married Sulla's daughter to his own son Faustus;", "3421": "while Agesilaus, on a trifling pretext, dis­ graced and ruined Lysander.", "3422": "Yet Sulla gave Pompeius nothing more than he possessed himself, whereas Lysander made Agesilaus king of Sparta, and leader of the united armies of Greece.", "3423": "Thirdly, the political wrongdoings of Pompeius were chiefly committed to serve his relatives, Caesar and Scipio;", "3424": "while Agesilaus saved Sphodrias from the death which he deserved for his outrage upon the Athenians merely to please his son, and vigorously supported Phœbidas when he committed a similar breach of the peace against the Thebans.", "3425": "And generally, we may say that while Pom­ peius only injured the Romans through inability to refuse the demands of friends, or through ignorance, Agosilaus ruined the Lacedæmonians by plunging them into war with Thebes, to gratify his own angry and quarrelsome temper.", "3426": "II.", "3427": "If it be right to attribute the disasters which befel either of these men to some special ill-luck which attended them, the Romans had no reason whatever to suspect any such thing of Pompeius;", "3428": "but Agesilaus, although tho Lacedæmonians well knew the words of the oracle, yet would not allow them to avoid “ a lame reign.\"", "3429": "Even if Leotychides had been proved a thousand times to be a bastard, the family of Eurypon could have supplied Sparta with a legitimate and sound king, had not Lysander, for the Bake of Agesilaus, deceived them as to the true meaning of the oracle.", "3430": "On the other hand, we have no specimen of the political ingenuity of Pompeius which can be compared with that admirable device of Agesilaus, when he read­ mitted the survivors of the battle of Leuktra to the privi­ leges of Spartan citizens, by permitting the laws to sleep for one day.", "3431": "Pompeius did not even think it his duty to abide by the laws which he had himself enacted, but broke them to prove his great power to his friends.", "3432": "Agesilaus, when forced either to abolish the laws or to ruin his friends, discovered an expedient by which the laws did his friends no hurt, and yet had not to be abolished in order to save them.", "3433": "I also place to the credit of Agesilaus that unparalleled act of obedience, when on receiving a despatch from Sparta he abandoned the whole of his Asian enterprise.", "3434": "For Agesilaus did not, like Pompeius, enrich the state by his own exploits, but looking solely to the interests of his country, he gave up a position of greater glory and power than any Greek before or since ever held, with the single exception of Alexander.", "3435": "III.", "3436": "Looking at them from another point of view, I suppose that even Xenophon himself would not think of comparing the number of the victories won by Pompeius, the size of the armies which he commanded, and that of those which he defeated, with any of the victories of Age­ silaus ;", "3437": "although Xenophon has written so admirably upon other subjects, that he seems to think himself privileged to say whatever he pleases about the life of his favourite hero.", "3438": "I think also that the two men differ much in their treatment of their enemies.", "3439": "The Greek wished to sell the Thebans for slaves, and to drive the Messenians from their country, although Thebes was the mother city of Sparta, and the Messenians sprang from the same stock as the Lacedæmonians.", "3440": "In his attempts to effect this, he all but lost Sparta herself, and did lose the Spartan empire;", "3441": "while Pompeius even gave cities to be inhabited by such of the Mediterranean pirates as abandoned that mode of life;", "3442": "and when Tigranes the king of Armenia was in his power, he did not lead him in his triumph, but chose rather to make him an ally of Rome;", "3443": "observing, that he preferred an advantage which would last for all time to the glory which only endured for a single day.", "3444": "If, however, we place the chief glory of a general in feats of arms and strategy, the Laconian will be found greatly to excel the Roman.", "3445": "Agesilaus did not abandon Sparta even when it was attacked by seventy thousand men, when he had but few troops with which to defend it, and those too all disheartened by their recent defeat at Leuktra.", "3446": "Pompeius, on hearing that Cæsar, with only five thousand three hundred men, had taken a town in Italy, left Rome in terror, either yielding to this small force like a coward, or else falsely supposing it to be more numerous than it was.", "3447": "He carefully carried off his own wife and children, but left the families of his partizans unpro­ tected in Rome, when he ought either to have fought for the city against Cæsar, or else to have acknowledged him as his superior and submitted to him, for Cæsar was both his fellow-countryman and his relative.", "3448": "Yet, after having violently objected to the prorogation of Cæsar's term of office as consul, he put it in his power to capture Rome itself, and to say to Metellus that he regarded him and all the rest of the citizens as prisoners of war.", "3449": "IV.", "3450": "Agesilaus, when he was the stronger, always forced his enemy to fight, and when weaker, always avoided a battle.", "3451": "By always practicing this, tho highest art of a general, he passed through his life without a single defeat;", "3452": "whereas Pompeius was unable to make use of his superiority to Cæsar by sea, and was forced by him to hazard everything on the event of a land battle;", "3453": "for as soon as Cæsar had defeated him, he at once obtained pos­ session of all Pompeius's treasure, supplies, and command of the sea, without gaining which he must inevitably have been defeated, even without a battle.", "3454": "Pompeius's excuse for his conduct is, in truth, his severest condemnation.", "3455": "It is very natural and pardonable for a young general to be influenced by clamours and accusations of remissness and cowardice, so as to abandon the course which he had pre­ viously decided upon as the safest;", "3456": "but that the great Pompeius, of whom the Romans used to say that the camp was his home, and that he only made an occasional cam­ paign in the senate house, at a time when his followers called the consuls and generals of Rome traitors and rebels, and when they knew that he was in possession of absolute uncontrolled power, and had already conducted so many campaigns with such brilliant success as commander-in- chief-that he should be moved by the scoffs of a Favonius or a Domitius, and hazard his army and his life lest they should call him Agamemnon, is a most discreditable sup­ position.", "3457": "If he were so sensitive on the point of honour, he ought to have made a stand at the very beginning, and fought a battle in defence of Rome, not first to have retreated, giving out that he was acting with a subtlety worthy of Themistokles himself, and then to have regarded every day spent in Thessaly without fighting as a disgrace.", "3458": "The plain of Pharsalia was not specially appointed by heaven as the arena in which he was to contend with Cæsar for the empire of the world, nor was he summoned by the voice of a herald either to fight or to avow himself vanquished.", "3459": "There were many plains, and innumerable cities and countries which his command of the sea would have enabled him to reach, if he had wished to imitate Fabius Maximus, Marius, Lucullus, or Agesilaus himself, who resisted the same kind of clamour at Sparta, when his countrymen wished to fight the Thebans and protect their native land;", "3460": "while in Egypt he endured endless reproaches, abuse, and suspicion from Nektanebis because he forbade him to fight, and by consistently carrying out his own judicious policy saved the Egyptians against their will.", "3461": "He not only guided Sparta sately through that ter­ rible crisis, but was enabled to win a victory over the Thebans in the city itself, which he never could have done had he yielded to the entreaties of the Lacedæmo­ nians to fight when their country was first invaded.", "3462": "Thus it happened that Agesilaus was warmly praised by those whose opinions he had overruled, while Pompeius made mistakes to please his friends, and afterwards was re­ proached by them for what he had done.", "3463": "Some historians tell us, however, that he was deceived by his father-in- law, Scipio, who with the intention of embezzling and converting to his own use the greater part of the treasure which Pompeius brought from Asia, urged him to fight as soon as possible, as though there was likely to be a scarcity of money.", "3464": "In these respects, then, we have reviewed their respective characters.", "3465": "V.", "3466": "Pompeius went to Egypt of necessity, fleeing for his life;", "3467": "but Agesilaus went there with the dishonourable purpose of acting as general for the barbarians, in order that he might employ the money which he earned by that means in making war upon the Greeks.", "3468": "We blame the Egyptians for their conduct to Pompeius;", "3469": "but the Egyptians have equal reason to complain of the conduct of Agesilaus towards themselves;", "3470": "for though Pompeius trusted them and was betrayed, yet Agesilaus deserted the man who trusted him, and joined the enemies of those whom he went out to assist.", "3471": "IN writing the Lives of Alexander the Great and of Cæsar the conqueror of Pompeius, which are contained in this book, I have before me such an abundance of materials, that I shall make no other preface than to beg the reader, if he finds any of their famous exploits recorded imperfectly, and with large excisions, not to regard this as a fault.", "3472": "I am writing biography, not history;", "3473": "and often a man's most brilliant actions prove nothing as to his true character, while some trifling incident, some casual remark or jest, will throw more light upon what manner of man he was than the bloodiest battle, the greatest array of armies, or the most important siege.", "3474": "Therefore, just as portrait painters pay most attention to those peculiarities of the face and eyes, in which the likeness consists, and care but little for the rest of the figure, so it is my duty to dwell especially upon those actions which reveal the workings of my heroes' minds, and from these to construct the portraits of their respective lives, leaving their battles and their great deeds to be recorded by others.", "3475": "II.", "3476": "All are agreed that Alexander was descended on his fathers side from Herakles through Karanus, and on his mother's from Æakus through Neoptolemus.", "3477": "We are told that Philip and Olympias first met during their initiation into the sacred mysteries at Samothrace, and that he, while yet a boy, fell in love with the orphan girl, and persuaded her brother Arymbas to consent to their marriage.", "3478": "The bride, before she consorted with her husband, dreamed that she had been struck by a thunder­ bolt, from which a sheet of flame sprang out in every direction, and then suddenly died away.", "3479": "Philip himself some time after his marriage dreamed that he set a seal upon his wife's body, on which was engraved the figure of a lion.", "3480": "When he consulted the soothsayers as to what this meant, most of them declared the meaning to be, that his wife required more careful watching;", "3481": "but Aristander of Telmessus declared that she must be preg­ nant, because men do not seal up what is empty, and that she would bear a son of a spirited and lion-like disposition.", "3482": "Once Philip found his wife asleep, with a large tame snake stretched beside her ;", "3483": "and this, it is said, quite put an end to his passion for her, and made him avoid her society, either because he feared the magic arts of his wife, or else from a religious scruple, because his place was more worthily filled.", "3484": "Another version of this story is that the women of Macedonia have been from very ancient times subject to the Orphic and Bacchic frenzy (whence they were called Clodones and Mimallones), and perform the same rites as do the Edonians and the Thracian women about Mount Haemus, from which the word \" thres­ kenein\" has come to mean \" to be over-superstitious.\"", "3485": "Olympias, it is said, celebrated these rites with exceeding fervour, and in imitation of the Orientals, and to intro­ duce into the festal pro ession large tame serpents,.", "3486": "which struck terror into the men as they glided through the ivy wreaths and mystic baskets which the women carried on their heads.", "3487": "III.", "3488": "We are told that Philip after this portent sent Chairon of Megalopolis to Delphi, to consult the god there, and that he delivered an oracular response bidding him sacrifice to Zeus Ammon, and to pay especial reve­ rence to that god :", "3489": "warning him, moreover, that he would some day lose the sight of that eye with which, through the chink of the half-opened door, he had seen the god consorting with his wife in the form of a serpent.", "3490": "The historian Eratosthenes informs us that when Alexander was about to set out on his great expedition, Olympias told hint the secret of his birth, and bade him act worthily of his divine parentage.", "3491": "Other writers say that she scrupled to mention the subject, and was heard to say \"", "3492": "Why does Alexander make Hera jealous of me?", "3493": "\"Alexander was born on the sixth day of the month Hekatotombæon,* which the Macedonians call Lous, the same day on which the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was burned.", "3494": "This coincidence inspired Hegesias of Magnesia to construct a ponderous joke, dull enough to have put out the fire, which was, that it was no wonder that the temple of Artemis was burned, since she was away from it, attending to the birth of Alexander.", "3495": "†All the Persian magi who were in Ephesus at the time imagined that the destruction of the temple was but the forerunner of a greater disaster, and ran through the city beating their faces and shouting that on that day was born the destroyer of Asia.", "3496": "Philip, who had just captured the city of Potidæa, received at that time three messengers.", "3497": "The first announced that the Illyrians had been severely defeated by Parmenio ;", "3498": "the second that his racehorse had won a victory at Olympia, and the third, that Alexander was born.", "3499": "As one may well believe, he was delighted at such good news and was yet more overjoyed when the soothsayers told him that his son, whose birth coincided with three victories, would surely prove invincible.", "3500": "IV.", "3501": "His personal appearance is best shown by the statues of Lysippus, the only artist whom he allowed to represent him;", "3502": "in whose works we can clearly trace that slight droop of his head towards the left, and that keen glance of his eyes which formed his chief characteristics, and which were afterwards imitated by his friends and successors.", "3503": "Apelles, in his celebrated picture of Alexander wielding a thunderbolt, has not exactly copied the fresh tint of his flesh, but has made it darker and swarthier than it was, for we are told that his skin was remarkably fair, in­ clining to red about the face and breast.", "3504": "We learn from the memoirs of Aristoxenes, that his body diffused a rich perfume, which scented his clothes, and that his breath was remarkably sweet.", "3505": "This was possibly caused by the hot and fiery constitution of his body;", "3506": "for sweet scents are produced, according to Theophrastus, by heat acting upon moisture.", "3507": "For this reason the hottest and dries.", "3508": "regions of the earth produce the most aromatic perfumes, because the sun dries up that moisture which causes most substances to decay.", "3509": "Alexander's warm temperament of body seems to have rendered him fond of drinking, and fiery in disposition.", "3510": "As a youth he showed great power of self-control, by ab­ staining from all sensual pleasures in spite of his vehement and passionate nature;", "3511": "while his intense desire for fame rendered him serious and highminded beyond his years.", "3512": "For many kinds of glory, however, Alexander cared little;", "3513": "unlike his father Philip, who prided himself on his oratorical powers, and used to record his victories in the chariot races at Olympia upon his coins.", "3514": "Indeed, when Alexander's friends, to try him, asked him whether he would contend in the foot race at Olympia, for he was a remarkably swift runner, he answered, \" Yes, if I have kings to contend with.\"", "3515": "He seems to have been altogether indifferent to athletic exercises ;", "3516": "for though he gave more prizes than any one else to be contended for by dramatists, flute players, harp players, and even by rhapsodists,* and though he delighted in all manner of hunting and cudgel playing, he never seems to have taken any interest in the contests of boxing or the pankratium.", "3517": "tWhen ambassadors from the King of Persia arrived in Macedonia, Philip was absent, and Alexander entertained them.", "3518": "His engaging manners greatly charmed them, and he became their intimate friend.", "3519": "He never put any childish questions to them, but made many enquiries about the length of the journey from the sea coast to tho interior of Persia, about the roads which led thither, about the king, whether he was experienced in war or not, and about the resources and military strength of the Persian empire, so that the ambassadors were filled with admire tion, and declared that the boasted subtlety of Philip was nothing in comparison with the intellectual vigour and enlarged views of his son.", "3520": "Whenever he heard of Philip's having taken some city or won some famous victory, he used to look unhappy at the news,

pleasure or wealth, but only for honour and glory;", "3523": "and he imagined that the more territory he inherited from his father, the less would be left for him to conquer.", "3524": "He feared that his father's conquests would be so complete, as to leave him no more battles to fight, and he wished to succeed, not to a wealthy and luxurious, but to a military empire, at the head of which he might gratify his desire for war and adventure.", "3525": "His education was superintended by many nurses, peda­ gogues, and teachers, the chief of whom was Leonidas, a harsh-tempered man, who was nearly related to Olympias.", "3526": "He did not object to the title of pedagogue,.", "3527": "thinking that his duties are most valuable and honourable, but, on account of his high character and relationship to Alexander, was generally given the title of tutor by the others.", "3528": "The name and office of pedagogue was claimed by one Lysimachus, an Akarnanian by birth, and a dull man, but

unmanageable, for he allowed no one to mount him, and paid no attention to any man's voice, but refused to allow any one to approach him.", "3532": "On this Philip became angry, and bade them take the vicious intractable brute away.", "3533": "Alexander, who was present, said, \" What a fine horse they are ruining because they are too ignorant and cowardly to manage him.'", "3534": "Philip at first was silent, but when Alexander repeated this remark several times, and seemed greatly distressed, he said, \" Do you blame your elders, as if you know more than they, or were better able to manage a horse ?\" \"", "3535": "This horse, at any rate,\" answered Alexander, \" I could manage better than any one else.\" \"", "3536": "And if you cannot manage him,\" retorted his father, \" what penalty

restive.", "3540": "He then spoke gently to the horse, and patted him on the back with his hand, until he perceived that he no longer snorted so wildly, when, dropping his cloak, he lightly leaped upon his back.", "3541": "He now steadily reined him in, without violence or blows, and as he saw that the horse was no longer ill-tempered, but only eager to gallop, he let him go, boldly urging him to full speed with his voice and heel.", "3542": "Philip and his friends wore at first silent with terror;", "3543": "but when he wheeled the horse round, and rode up to them exulting in his success,

been sold for slaves, and bringing back those who were living in exile.", "3552": "For Alexander and Aristotle he appointed tho temple and grove of the nymphs, near the city of Mieza, as a school-house and dwelling ;", "3553": "and there to this day are shown the stone seat where Aristotle sat, and the shady avenues where he used to walk.", "3554": "It is thought that Alexander was

one else implanted a love of medicine in Alexander, who was not only fond of discussing the theory, but used to prescribe for his friends when they were sick, and order them to follow special courses of treatment and diet, as we gather from his letters.", "3565": "He was likewise fond of literature and of reading, and we are told by Onesikritus that he was wont to call the Iliad a complete manual of the military art, and that he always carried with him Aristotle's recension of Homer's poems, which is called ' the casket copy,* and placed it under his pillow together with his dagger.", "3566": "Being without books when in the interior of Asia, he ordered Harpalus to send him some.", "3567": "Harpalus sent him the histories of Philistus, several plays of Euripides, Sophokles, and Æschylus,

live, but that the former had taught him to live well.", "3569": "He afterwards suspected him somewhat;", "3570": "yet he never did him any injury, but only was not so friendly with him as he had been, whereby it was observed that he no longer bore him the good-will he was wont to do.", "3571": "Notwithstanding this, he never lost that interest, in philosophical speculation which he had acquired in his youth, as it proved by the honours which he paid to Anaxarchus, the fifty talents which he sent as a present to Xenokrates, and the protection and encouragement which he gave to Dandamris and Kalanus.", "3572": "IX.", "3573": "When Philip was besieging Byzantium he left to Alexander, who was then only sixteen years old, the sole charge of the administration of the kingdom of

marriages caused an estrangement between them, and the breach was widened by Olympias, a jealous and revengeful woman, who incensed Alexander against his father.", "3580": "But what especially moved Alexander was the conduct of Attalus at the marriage feast of his niece Kleopatra.", "3581": "Philip, who was now too old for marriage, had become enamoured of this girl, and after the wedding, Attalus in his cups called upon the Macedonians to pray to the gods that from the union of Philip and Kleopatra might be born a legitimate heir to the throne.", "3582": "Enraged at these words, Alexander exclaimed, \"You villain, am I then a bastard ? \" and threw a drinking cup at him.", "3583": "Philip, seeing this, rose and drew his sword to attack Alexander;", "3584": "but fortunately

as an ally, offered his eldest daughter in marriage to Arrhidæus, Philip's natural son, and sent Aristokrites to Macedonia to conduct the negotiations, Olympias and her friends again exasperated Alexander against his father by pointing out to him that Philip, by arranging this splendid marriage for Arrhidæus, and treating him as a person of such great importance, was endeavouring to accustom the Mace­ donians to regard him as the heir to the throne.", "3592": "Alex­ ander yielded to these representations sc far as to send Thessalus, the tragic actor, on a special mission to Pixo­ darus in Karia, to assure him that he ought to disregard Arrhidaeus, who was illegitimate, and foolish to boot, and that it was to Alexander that he ought to offer the hand of his daughter.", "3593": "Pixodarus was much more eager to accept this proposal than the former, but Philip one day hearing that Alex­ ander was alone in his chamber, went thither with Philotas, the son of Parmenio, an intimate friend, and bitterly reproached him, pointing out how unworthy it was of his high birth and glorious position to stoop to marry the daughter of a mere Karian,* and of a barbarian who was a subject of the King of Persia.", "3594": "Upon this he wrote to the Corinthians to send him Thessalus in chains, and also banished out of his kingdom Harpalus, Nearchus, Erigyius, and Ptolemæus, all

obtain amends for what he suffered, assassinated Philip.", "3596": "We are told that most men laid the blame of this murder upon Queen Olympias, who found the young man smarting from the outrage which had been committed upon him, and urged him to avenge himself, while some accused Alexander himself.", "3597": "It is said that when Pausanias came to him and complained of his treatment, Alexander answered him by quoting the line from the Medea of Euripides, in which she declares that she will be revenged upon \"The guardian, and the bridegroom, and the bride,\" alluding to Attalus, Philip, and Kleopatra.", "3598": "However this may be, it is certain that he sought out and punished all who were concerned in the plot, and he expressed his sorrow on discovering that during his own absence from

Alexander would refrain as far as possible from interfering in the affairs of Greece, deal gently with the insurgent chiefs of his barbarian subjects, and carefully guard against revolu­ tionary outbreaks.", "3605": "He, however, took quite a different view of the situation, conceiving it to be best to win safety by audacity, and carrying things with a high hand, thinking that if he showed the least sign of weak­ ness, his enemies would all set upon him at once.", "3606": "He crushed the risings of the barbarians by promptly march­ ing through their country as far as the river Danube, and by winning a signal victory over Syrmus, the King of the Triballi.", "3607": "After this, as he heard that the Thebans had revolted, and that the Athenians sympathised with them, he marched his army straight through Thermopylæ, with the remark that Demosthenes, who had called him a boy while he was fighting the lllyrians and Triballi, and a youth while he was marching through Thessaly, should find him a man when he saw him before the gates of Athens.", "3608": "When he reached Thebes, he gave the citizens an opportunity to repent of their conduct, only demanding Phoenix and

Chæronea.", "3624": "Alexander, struck by her answer, and admiring her exploit, gave orders that she and her children should be set at liberty.", "3625": "XIII.", "3626": "Alexander came to terms with the Athenians, although they had expressed the warmest sympathy for the Thebans, omitting the performance of the festival cf Demeter, out of respect for their misfortunes, and giving a kindly welcome to all the fugitives who reached Athens.", "3627": "Either he had had his fill of anger, like a sated lion, or possibly he wished to perform some signal act of mercy by way of contrast to his savage treatment of Thebes, Be this as it may, he not only informed the Athenians that he had no grounds of quarrel with them, but even went so far as to advise them to watch the course of events with care, since, if anything should happen to him, they might again become the ruling state in Greece.", "3628": "In after times, Alexander often grieved over his harsh treatment of the Thebans, and the recollection of what he had done made him much less severe to others.", "3629": "Indeed, lie always referred his unfortunate drunken quarrel with Kleitus, and the refusal of the Macedonian soldiers to in­ vade India, by which they rendered the glory of his great expedition incomplete, to the anger of Dionysius,* who desired to avenge the fate of his favourite city.", "3630": "More­ over, of the

Loibethra, which is made of cypress-wood, was observed to be covered with sweat.", "3645": "All were alarmed at this omen, but Aristander bade them take courage, as it portended that Alexander should

the generals of Darius had collected a large army, and posted it at the passage of the river Granikus, so that it was necessary for Alexander to fight a battle in order to effect so much as an entrance into Asia.", "3661": "Most of the Greek generals were alarmed at the depth and uneven bed of the river, and at the rugged and broken ground on the farther bank, which they would have to mount in the face of the enemy.", "3662": "Some also raised a religious scruple, averring that the Macedonian kings never made war during the month Daisius.", "3663": "Alexander said that this could be easily remedied, and ordered that the second month in the Macedonian calendar should henceforth be called Artemisium.", "3664": "When Parmenio besought him not to risk a battle, as the season was far advanced, he said that the Hellespont would blush for shame if he crossed it, and then feared to cross the Granikus, and at once plunged into the stream with thirteen squadrons of cavalry.", "3665":

array.", "3668": "The enemy came on with a shout, and rode straight up to the horses of the Macedonians, thrusting at them with spears, and using swords when their spears were broken.", "3669": "Many of them pressed round Alexander himself, who was made a conspicuous figure by his shield and the long white plume which hung down on each side of his helmet.", "3670": "He was struck by a javelin in

his spear against the breastplate of Rhœsakes, and was forced to betake him to his sword.", "3673": "No sooner had they closed together than Spithridates rode up beside him, and, standing up in his stirrups, dealt him such a blow with a battle-axe, as cut off one side of his plume, and pierced his helmet just so far as to reach his hair with the edge of the axe.", "3674": "While Spithridates was preparing for another blow, he was run through by black Kleitus with a lance, and at the same moment Alexander with his sword laid Rhœsakes dead at his feet During this fierce and perilous cavalry battle, the Macedonian phalanx * crossed the river, and engaged the enemy's infantry force, none of which offered much resistance except a body of mercenary Greeks in the pay of Persia.", "3675":

portent, he extended his conquests along the sea coast as far as Phoenicia and Kilikia.", "3692": "Many historians dwelt with admiration on the good fortune of Alexander, in meeting with such fair weather and such a smooth sea during his passage along the stormy shore of Pamphylia, and say that it was a miracle that the furious sea, which usually dashed against the highest rocks upon the cliffs, fell calm for him.", "3693": "Mcnander alludes to this in one of his plays.\"", "3694": "Like Alexander, if I wish to meet A man, at once I find him in the street;", "3695": "And, were I

philosopher, who had recently died, he made a procession to it one day after dinner, and crowned it with flowers, as a sportive recognition of what he owed to Theodektes, with whose philosophical writings Aristotle had made him familiar.", "3698": "XVIII.", "3699": "After this he put down a revolt among the Pisidians, and conquered the whole of Phrygia.", "3700": "On his at rival at Gordium,

it by pulling out of the pole the in to which the strap was fastened, and then drawing oft the yoke itself from the pole.", "3704": "He now prevailed upon the people of Paphlagonia and Kappadokia to join him, and also was encouraged in his design of proceeding farther into the interior by receiving intelligence of the death of Memnon, the general to whom Darius had entrusted the defence of the

also much encouraged by the long inaction of Alexander in Kilikia.", "3713": "This was caused by an illness, which some say arose from the hardships which he had undergone, and others tell us was the result of bathing in the icy waters of the Kydnus.", "3714": "No physician dared to attend him, for they all thought that he was past the reach of medicine, and dreaded the anger of the Mace­ donians if they proved unsuccessful.", "3715": "At last Philip, an Alvarnanian, seeing that he was dangerously ill, deter­ mined to run the risk, as he was his true friend, and thought it his duty to share all his dangers.", "3716": "He com­ pounded a draught for him, and persuaded him to drink it, by telling him that it would give him strength and enable him to take the field.", "3717": "At this time Parmenio sent him a letter from the camp, bidding him beware of Philip, who had been bribed to poison him by Darius with rich presents, and the offer of his own daughter in marriage.", "3718": "Alexander read the letter, and showed it to no one, but placed it under his pillow.", "3719": "At the appointed hour, Philip and his friends entered the room, bringing the medicine in a cup.", "3720": "Alexander took the cup from him, and gave him the letter to read, while he firmly and cheerfully drank it off.", "3721": "It was a strange and theatrical scene.", "3722": "When the one had read, and the other had drunk, they stared into each other's faces, Alexander with a cheerful expression of trust and kindly feeling towards Philip, while Philip, enraged at the calumny, first raised his hands to heaven, protesting his innocence, and then, cast­ ing himself upon his knees at the bed-side, besought Alex­ ander to be of good cheer and follow his advice.", "3723": "The effect of the drug at first was to produce extreme weak­ ness, for he became speechless and almost insensible.", "3724": "In a short time, however, by Philip's care, he recovered his strength, and showed himself publicly to the Macedonians, who were very anxious about him, and would not believe that he was better until they saw him.", "3725": "XX.", "3726": "There was in the camp of Darius a Macedonian refugee, named Amyntas, who was well acquainted with Alexander's character.", "3727": "This man, when he found that Darius wished to enter the hilly country to fight Alexander amongst its narrow valleys, besought him to remain where he was, upon the flat open plains, where the enormous numbers of his troops could be advantageously used against the small Macedonian army.", "3728": "When Darius answered that he feared Alexander and his men would escape unless he attacked, Amyntas said, “ 0 king, have no fears on that score;", "3729": "for he will come and fight you, and I warrant he is not far off now.\"", "3730": "However, Amyntas made no impression on Darius, who marched forward into Kilikia, while at the same time Alexander marched into Syria to meet him.", "3731": "During the night they missed one another, and each turned back, Alexander rejoicing at this incident, and hurrying to catch Darius in the narrow defile leading into Kilikia, while Darius was glad of the opportunity of recovering his former ground, and of disentangling his army from the narrow passes through the mountains.", "3732": "He already had perceived the mistake which he had committed in entering a country where the sea, the mountains, and the river Pyramus which ran between them, made it impossible for his army to act, while on the other hand it afforded great advantages to his enemies, who were mostly foot soldiers, and whose numbers were not so great as to encumber their movements.", "3733": "Fortune, no doubt, greatly favoured Alexander, but yet he owed much of his success to his excellent generalship ;", "3734": "for although enormously outnumbered by the enemy, he not only avoided being surrounded by them, but was able to outflank their left with his own right wing, and by this manoeuvre completely defeated the Persians.", "3735": "lie himself fought among the foremost, and, according to Chares, was wounded in the thigh by Darius himself.", "3736": "Alexander in the account of the battle which he de­ spatched to Antipater, does not mention the name of the man who wounded him, but states that he received a stab in the thigh with a dagger, and that the wound was not a dangerous one.", "3737": "He won a most decisive victory, and slew more than a hundred thousand of the enemy, but could not come up with Darius himself, as he gained a start of nearly a mile.", "3738": "He captured his chariot, however, and his bow and arrows, and on his return found the Macedonians revell­ ing in the rich plunder which they had won, although the Persians had been in light marching order, and had left most of their heavy baggage at Damascus.", "3739": "The royal pavilion of Darius himself, full of beautiful slaves, and rich furniture of every description, had been left un­ plundered, and was reserved for Alexander himself, who as soon as he had taken off his armour, proceeded to the bath, saying “", "3740": "Let me wash off the sweat of the battle in the bath of Darius.\"", "3741": "“ Nay,” answered one of his com­ panions, “ in that of Alexander;", "3742": "for the goods of the vanquished become the property of the victor.”", "3743": "When he entered the bath and saw that all the vessels for water, the bath itself, and the boxes of unguents were of pure gold, and smelt the delicious scent of the rich perfumes with which the whole pavilion was filled;", "3744": "and when he passed from the bath into a magnificent and lofty saloon where a splendid banquet was prepared, he looked at his friends and said \"This, then, it is to be a King indeed.”XXI.", "3745": "While he was dining it was told him that the mother and wife of Darius, and his two daughters, who were among the captives, had seen the chariot and bow of Darius, and were mourning for him, imagining him to be dead.", "3746": "Alexander when he heard this paused for a long time, being more affected by the grief of these ladies, than by the victory which he had won.", "3747": "He sent Leon­ natus to inform them, that they need neither mourn for Darius, nor fear Alexander;", "3748": "for he was fighting for the empire of Asia, not as a personal enemy of Darius, and would take care that they were treated with tho same honour and respect as before.", "3749": "This generous message to the captive princesses was followed by acts of still greater kindness;", "3750": "for he permitted them to bury whomsoever of the slain Persians they wished, and to use all their own apparel and furniture, which had been seized by the soldiers as plunder.", "3751": "He also allowed them to retain the regal title and state, and even increased their revenues.", "3752": "But the noblest and most truly royal part of his treat­ ment of these captive ladies was that he never permitted them to hear any coarse language, or imagine for a moment that they were likely to suffer violence or out­ rage ;", "3753": "so that they lived unseen and unmolested, more as though they were in some sacred retreat of holy virgins than in a camp.", "3754": "Yet the wife of Darius is said to have been the most beautiful princess of her age, just as Darius himself was the tallest and handsomest man in Asia, and their daughters are said to have resembled their parents in beauty.", "3755": "Alexander, it seems, thought it more kingly to restrain himself than to conquer the enemy, and never touched any of them, nor did he know any other before his marriage, except Barsine.", "3756": "This lady, after the death of her husband Memnon, remained at Damascus.", "3757": "She had received a Greek education, was naturally attractive, and was of royal descent, as her father was Artabazus, who married one of the king's daughters;", "3758": "which, added to the solicitations of Parmenio, as we are told by Aristobulus, made Alexander the more willing to attach himself to so beautiful and well-born a lady.", "3759": "When Alexander saw the beauty of the other captives, he said in jest, that the Persian ladies make men's eyes sore to behold them.", "3760": "Yet, in spite of their attractions, he was determined that his self-restraint should be as much admired as their beauty, and passed by them as if they had been images cut out of stone.", "3761": "XXII.", "3762": "Indeed, when Philoxenus, the commander of his fleet, wrote to inform him that a slave merchant of Tarentum, named Theodorus, had two beautiful slaves for sale, and desired to know whether he would buy them, Alexander was greatly incensed, and angrily demanded of his friends what signs of baseness Philoxenus could have observed in him that he should venture to make such disgraceful proposals to him.", "3763": "He sent a severe reprimand to Philoxenus, and ordered him to send Theo­ dorus and his merchandise to the devil.", "3764": "He also severely rebuked a young man named Hagnon for a similar offence.", "3765": "On another occasion, when he heard that two Macedo­ nians of Parmenio's regiment, named Damon and Timo­ theus,.", "3766": "had violently outraged the wives of some of the mercenary soldiers, he wrote to Parmenio, ordering him, if the charge were proved, to put them to death like mere brute beasts that prey upon mankind.", "3767": "And in that letter he wrote thus of himself.", "3768": "“ I have never seen, or desired to see the wife of Darius, and have not even allowed her beauty to be spoken of in may presence.", "3769": "\"He was wont to say that he was chiefly reminded that he was mortal by these two weaknesses, sleep and lust;", "3770": "thinking weariness and sensuality alike to be bodily weaknesses, He was also most temperate in eating, as was signally proved by his answer to the princess Ada, whom he adopted as his mother, and made Queen of Karia.", "3771": "She, in order to show her fondness for him, sent him every day many dainty dishes and sweetmeats, and at last presented him with her best cooks.", "3772": "He answered her that he needed them not, since he had been provided with much better relishes for his food by his tutor Leonidas, who had taught him to earn his breakfast by a night- march, and to obtain an appetite for his dinner by eating sparingly at breakfast.", "3773": "“ My tutor,\" he said, “ would often look into my chests of clothes, and of bedding, to make sure that my mother had not hidden any delicacies for me in them.", "3774": "”XXIIL", "3775": "He was less given to wine than he was com­ monly supposed to be.", "3776": "He was thought to be a great drinker because of the length of time which he would pass over each cup, in talking more than in drinking it, for he always held a long conversation while drinking, provided he was at leisure to do so.", "3777": "If anything had to be done, no wine, or desire of rest, no amusement, marriage, or spectacle could restrain him, as they did other generals.", "3778": "This is clearly shown by the shortness of his life, and the wonderful number of great deeds which he performed during the little time that he lived.", "3779": "When he was at leisure, he used to sacrifice to the gods immediately after rising in the morning, and then sit down to his breakfast.", "3780": "After breakfast, he would pass the day in hunting, de­ ciding disputes between his subjects, devising military manoeuvres, or reading.", "3781": "When on a journey, if he was not in any great hurry, he used, while on the road, to practice archery, or to dismount from a chariot which was being driven at full speed, and then again mount it.", "3782": "Frequently also he hunted foxes and shot birds for amuse­ ment, as we learn from his diaries.", "3783": "On arriving at the place where he intended to pass the night, he always bathed and anointed himself, and then asked his cooks what was being prepared for his dinner.", "3784": "He always dined late, just as it began to grow dark, and was very careful to have his table well provided, and to give each of his guests an equal share.", "3785": "He sat long over his wine, as we have said, because of his love of con­ versation.", "3786": "And although at all other times his society was most charming, and his manners gracious and pleasant beyond any other prince of his age, yet when he was drinking, his talk ran entirely upon military topics, and became offensively boastful, partly from his own natural disposition, and partly from the encouragement which he received from his flatterers.", "3787": "This often greatly embar­ rassed honest men, as they neither wished to vie with the flatterers in praising him to his face, nor yet to appear to grudge him his due share of admiration.", "3788": "To bestow such excessive praise seemed shameful, while to withhold it was dangerous.", "3789": "After a drinking bout, he would take a bath, and often slept until late in the following day;", "3790": "and sometimes he passed the whole day asleep.", "3791": "He cared but little for delicate food, and often when the rarest fruits and fish were sent to him from the sea-coast, he would distribute them so lavishly amongst his friends as to leave none for himself;", "3792": "yet his table was always magnificently served, and as his revenues became increased by his con­ quests, its expense rose to ten thousand drachmas a day.", "3793": "To this it was finally limited, and those who entertained Alexander were told that they must not expend more than that sum.", "3794": "XXIV.", "3795": "After the battle of Issus, he sent troops to Damascus, and captured all the treasure, the baggage, and the women and children of the Persian army.", "3796": "Those who chiefly benefited by this were the Thessalian cavalry, who had distinguished themselves in the battle, and had been purposely chosen for this service by Alexander as a reward for their bravery;", "3797": "yet all the camp was filled with riches, so great was the mass of plunder.", "3798": "Then did the Macedonians get their first taste of gold and silver, of Per­ sian luxury and of Persian women;", "3799": "and after this, like hounds opening upon a scent, they eagerly pressed forward on the track of the wealthy Persians.", "3800": "Alexander, how­ ever, thought it best, before proceeding further, to coin­ plete the conquest of the sea-coast.", "3801": "Cyprus was at once surrendered to him by its local kings, as was all Phœnicia, except Tyre.", "3802": "He besieged Tyre for seven months, with great mounds and siege artillery on the land side, while a fleet of two hundred triremes watched it by sea.", "3803": "During the seventh month of the siege he dreamed that Herakles greeted him in a friendly manner from the walls of Tyre, and called upon him to come in.", "3804": "Many of the Tyrians also dreamed that Apollo appeared to them, and said that he was going to Alexander, since what was being done in the city of Tyre did not please him.", "3805": "The Tyrians, upon this, treated the god as though he were a man caught in the act of deserting to Alexander, for they tied cords round his statue, nailed it down to its base, and called him Alexandristes, or follower of Alexander.", "3806": "Alexander now dreamed another dream, that a satyr appeared to him at a distance, and sported with him, but when he endeavoured to catch him, ran away, and that, at length, after much trouble, he caught him.", "3807": "This was very plausibly explained by the prophets to mean “ Sa Tyros \"—\" Tyre shall be thine,\" dividing the Greek word Satyros into two parts.", "3808": "A well is shown at the present day near which Alexandor saw the satyr in his dream.", "3809": "During the siege, Alexander made an expedition against the neighbouring Arab tribes, in which he fell into great danger through his old tutor Lysimachus, who insisted on accompanying him, declaring that he was no older and no less brave than Phoenix when he followed Achilles to Troy.", "3810": "When they reached the mountains, they wero forced to leave their horses and march on foot.", "3811": "The rest proceeded on their way, but Lysimachus could not keep up, although night was coming on and the enemy were near.", "3812": "Alexander would not leave him, but encouraged him and helped him along until he became separated from his army, and found himself almost alone.", "3813": "It was now dark, and bitterly cold.", "3814": "The country where they were was very rugged and mountainous, and in tho distance appeared many scattered watch-fires of tho enemy.", "3815": "Alexander, accustomed to rouse the disheartened Mace­ donians by his own personal exertions, and trusting to his swiftness of foot, ran up to the nearest fire, struck down with his sword two men who were watching beside it, and brought a burning firebrand back to his own party.", "3816": "They now made up an enormous fire, which terrified some of the enemy so much that they retreated, while others who had intended to attack them, halted and forbore to do so, thus enabling them to pass the night in safety.", "3817": "XXV.", "3818": "The siege of Tyre came to an end in the follow­ ing manner.", "3819": "The greater part of Alexander's troops were resting from their labours, but in order to occupy the attention of the enemy, he led a few men up to the city walls, while Aristander, the soothsayer, offered sacrifice.", "3820": "When he saw the victims, he boldly informed all who were present that during the current month, Tyre would be taken.", "3821": "All who heard him laughed him to scorn, as that day was the last of the month, but Alexander seeing him at his wits' end, being always eager to support the credit of prophecies, gave orders that that day should not be reckoned as the thirtieth of the month, but as the twenty-third.", "3822": "After this he bade the trumpets sound, and assaulted the walls much more vigorously than ho had originally intended.", "3823": "The attack succeeded, and as the rest of the army would no longer stay behind in the camp, but rushed to take their share in the assault, the Tyrians were overpowered, and their city taken on that very day.", "3824": "Afterwards, while Alexander was besieging Gaza, the largest city in Syria, a clod of earth was dropped upon his shoulder by a bird, which afterwards alighted upon one of the military engines, and became entangled in the network of ropes by which it was worked.", "3825": "This portent also was truly explained by Aristander;", "3826": "for the place was taken, and Alexander was wounded in the shoulder.", "3827": "He sent many of the spoils to Olympias, Kleopatra, and others of his friends, and sent his tutor Leonidas five hundred talents weight of frankincense, and a hundred talents of myrrh, to remind him of what he had said when a child.", "3828": "Leonidas once, when sacrificing, reproved Alexander for taking incense by handfuls to throw upon the victim when it was burning on the altar. \"", "3829": "When,\" he said, \" you have conquered the country from which incense comes, Alexander, then you may make such rich offerings as these;", "3830": "but at present you must use what we have sparingly.\"", "3831": "Alexander now wrote to him, \" We have sent you abundance of frankincense and myrrh, that you may no longer treat the gods so stingily.", "3832": "\"XXVI.", "3833": "When a certain casket was brought to him, which appeared to be the most valuable of all the treasures taken from Darius, he asked his friends what they thought he ought to keep in it as his own most precious possession.", "3834": "After they had suggested various different things, he said that he intended to keep his copy of the Iliad in it.", "3835": "This fact is mentioned by many historians;", "3836": "and if the legend which is current among the people of Alexandria, on the authority of Herakleides, be true, the poems of Homer were far from idle or useless companions to him, even when on a campaign.", "3837": "The story goes that after conquering Egypt, he desired to found a great and populous Grecian city, to be called after his own name, and that after he had fixed upon an excellent site, where in the opinion of the best architects, a city sur­ passing anything previously existing could be built, he dreamed that a man with long hair and venerable aspect appeared to him, and recited the following verses:", "3838": "“Hard by, an island in the stormy main Lies close to Egypt, Pharos is its nameAs soon as he woke, he proceeded to Pharos, which then was an island near the Canopio mouth of the Nile, though at the present day so much earth has been deposited by the river that it is joined to the mainland.", "3839": "When he saw the great advantages possessed by this place, which is a long strip of land, stretching between the sea and a large inland lake, with a large harbour at the end of it, he at once said that Homer, besides his other admirable qualities, was a splendid architect, and gave orders to his workmen to mark out a site for a city suitable to such a situation.", "3840": "There was no chalk or white earth, with which it is usual to mark the course of the walls, but they took barley-groats, and marked out a semicircular line with them upon the black earth, dividing it into equal seg­ ments by lines radiating from the centre, so that it looked like a Macedonian cloak, of which the walls formed the outer fringe.", "3841": "While the king was looking with satisfaction at the plan of the new city, suddenly from the lake and the river, innumerable aquatic birds of every kind flew like great clouds to the spot, and devoured all the barley.", "3842": "This omen greatly disturbed Alexander;", "3843": "however, the soothsayers bade him take courage, and interpreted it to mean that the place would become a very rich and populous city.", "3844": "Upon this he ordered the workmen at once to begin to build, while he himself started to visit the shrine and oracle of Zeus Ammon.", "3845": "This journey is tedious and difficult, and dangerous also, because the way lies over a waterless desert, where the traveller is exposed to violent storms of sand whenever the south wind blows.", "3846": "It was here that fifty thousand men of the army of Cambyses are said to have been overwhelmed by the sand, which rolled upon them in huge billows until they were completely ingulfed.", "3847": "All these perils were present to all men's minds, but it was hard to turn Alexander away from any project upon which he had once set his heart.", "3848": "The invariable good fortune which he had enjoyed confirmed his self-will, and his pride would not allow him to confess himself vanquished either by human enemies or natural obstacles.", "3849": "XXVII.", "3850": "During his journey, the signal assistance which he received from the gods in all his difficulties was more remarkable and more generally believed than the oracular response which he is said to have received, although these portents made men more inclined to believe in the oracle.", "3851": "In the first place, plentiful showers were sent, which quite dissipated any fears which the expedition had entertained about suffering from thirst, while the rain cooled the sand and thus tempered the hot air of the desert to a pleasant warmth.", "3852": "Next, when the guides lost their way, and all were wandering helplessly, birds appeared who guided them on the right path, flying before them and encouraging them to march, and waiting for those of them who fell behind wearied.", "3853": "We are even assured by Kallisthenes that, at night, the birds by their cries recalled stragglers, and kept all on the direct road,When Alexander had crossed the desert, and arrived at the temple, the priest of Ammon greeted him as the son of the god.", "3854": "He inquired whether anyone of his father's murderers had escaped, to which the priest answered that he must not ask such questions, for his father was more than man.", "3855": "Alexander now altered the form of his inquiry and asked whether he had punished all the murderers of Philip:", "3856": "and then he asked another question, about his empire, whether he was fated to conquer all mankind.", "3857": "On receiving as an answer that this would be granted to him and that Philip had been amply avenged, he made splendid presents to the god, and amply rewarded the priests.", "3858": "This is the account which most historians give about the response of the oracle;", "3859": "but in a letter to his mother, Alexander says that he received certain secret prophecies, which upon his return he would communicate to her alone.", "3860": "Some narrate that the priest, wishing to give him a friendly greeting in the Greek language, said “", "3861": "My son, but being a foreigner, mispronounced the words so as to say “ Son of Zeus,\" a mistake which delighted Alexander and caused men to say that the god himself had addressed him as \" Son of Zeus.\"", "3862": "We are told that while in Egypt, he attended the lectures of the philosopher Psammon, and was especially pleased when he pointed out that God is King over all men, because that which rules and conquers must be king.", "3863": "He himself thought that he had improved upon this by saying that although God is the common father of all men, yet that he makes the best men more peculiarly his own.", "3864": "XXVIII.", "3865": "In his dealings with Asiatics, he always acted and spoke with the greatest arrogance, and seemed firmly convinced of his own divine parentage, but he was careful not to make the same boast when among Greeks.", "3866": "On one occasion, indeed, he wrote to the Athenians the following letter about their possession of Samos.", "3867": "\"I,\" he said, “ should not have presented you with that free and glorious city;", "3868": "but it was presented to you by its former master, my reputed father Philip.", "3869": "\"Yet afterwards when he was wounded by an arrow and in great pain he said “", "3870": "This, my friends, is blood that runs from my wound, and not “Ichor, that courses through the veins of gods.", "3871": "\"Once when a great thunderstorm terrified every one, Anaxarchus the sophist, who was with him, said “ Son of Zeus, canst thou do as much?\"", "3872": "To this, Alexander answered with a smile, “ Nay, I love not to frighten my friends, as you would have me do, when you complained of my table, because fish was served upon it instead of princes' heads.\"", "3873": "Indeed we are told that once, when Alexander had sent some small fish to Hephæstion, Anaxarchus used this expression ironically disparaging those who undergo great toils and run great risks to obtain magnificent results which, after all, make them no happier or able to enjoy themselves than other men.", "3874": "From these anecdotes we see that Alexander himself did not put any belief in the story of his divine parentage, but that be used it as a means of imposing upon others.", "3875": "XXIX.", "3876": "From Egypt he returned to Phœnicia, and there offered magnificent sacrifices to the gods, with grand processions, cyclic choruses, and performances of tragic dramas.", "3877": "These last were especially remarkable, for the local kings of Cyprus acted as choragi, that is, supplied the chorus and paid all the expenses of putting the drama upon the stage, just as is done every year at Athens by the representatives of the tribes, and they exhibited wonderful emulation, desiring to outdo each other in the splendour of their shows.", "3878": "The contest between Niko­ kreon, King of Salamis, and Pasikrates, King of Soli, is especially memorable.", "3879": "These two had obtained by lot the two most celebrated actors of the day, who were named Athenodorus and Thessalus, to act in their plays.", "3880": "Of these, Athenodorus was assigned to Nikokreon, and Thessalus, in whose success Alexander himself was per­ sonally interested, to Pasikrates.", "3881": "Alexander, however, never allowed any word to escape him denoting his pre­ ference for one over the other until after the votes had been given, and Athenodorus had been proclaimed the winner, when, as he was going home, he said that he would willingly have given up a province of his kingdom to save Thessalus from being vanquished.", "3882": "As Athenodorus was fined by the Athenians for being absent from their Dionysian festival, in which he ought to have taken part, he begged Alexander to write them a letter to excuse him.", "3883": "Alexander refused to do this, but paid his fine himself.", "3884": "And when Lykon, of Skarphia, an excellent actor who had pleased Alexander well, inserted a verse into the comedy which he was acting, in which he begged to be given ten talents, Alexander laughed and gave them to him.", "3885": "Darius now sent an embassy to Alexander, bearing a letter, in which he offered to pay ten thousand talents as a ransom for his wife and children, and proposed that Alexander should receive all the territory west of the Euphrates, and become his ally and son-in-law.", "3886": "Alex­ ander laid this proposal before his friends, and when Par­ menio said, “ I should accept it, if I were Alexander.”— \" So would I,\" replied Alexander, “ if I were Parmenio.\"", "3887": "He wrote, however,

theless he granted her a magnificent funeral.", "3892": "We are told that one of the eunuchs attached to the royal harem, named Teireus, who had been captured with the ladies, made his escape shortly after the queen's death, rode straight to Darius, and informed him of what had hap­ pened.", "3893": "Darius, at this, beat his face and wept aloud, saying, \" Alas for the fortune of Persia!",

answered, “ You have no cause to lament the evil fortune of Persia on account of your wife's burial, or of any want of due respect to her.", "3896": "Our lady Statira, your children, and your mother, when alive wanted for nothing except the light of your countenance, which our lord Oromasdes will some day restore to them, nor was she treated without honour when she died, for her funeral was even graced by the tears of her enemies.", "3897": "Alexander is as gracious a conqueror as he is a terrible enemy.", "3898": "\"These words roused other suspicions in the mind of Darius:", "3899": "and,

Darius, tell me, I conjure you by the name of great Mithras our lord, and by the right hand of a king, which I give thee, do I lament over the least of Statira's misfortunes when I weep for her death, and did she not in her life make us more miserable by her dishonour, than if she had fallen into the hands of a cruel enemy ?", "3900": "For what honest communi­ cation can a young conqueror have with the wife of his enemy, and what can be the meaning of his showing such excessive honour to her after her death?”", "3901": "While Darius was yet speaking, Teireus threw himself at his feet, and besought him to be silent, and not to dishonour Alexander and his dead wife and sister by such suspicions, nor yet to take away from himself that thought which ought to be his greatest consolation in his misfortunes, which was that he had been conquered by one who was more than man.", "3902": "Rather ought he to admire Alexander, whose honourable treatment of the Persian women proved him to be even greater than did his bravery in vanquishing their men.", "3903": "These words the eunuch assured him, with many pro­ testations and oaths, were perfectly true.", "3904": "Darius, when he heard this, came out of his tent to his friends, and, raising his hands to heaven, said, “ Ye parent gods, who watch over the Persian throne, grant that I may again restore the fortune of Persia to its former state, in order that I may have an opportunity of repaying Alexander in person the kindness which he has shown to those whom I hold dearest;", "3905": "but if indeed the fated hour has arrived, and the Persian empire is doomed to perish, may no other conqueror than Alexander mount the throne of Cyrus.\"", "3906": "The above is the account given by most historians of what took place on this occasion.", "3907": "XXXI.", "3908": "Alexander, after conquering all the country on the higher bank of the Euphrates, marched to attack Darius, who was advancing to meet him with an army of a million fighting men.", "3909": "During this march, one of Alexander's friends told him as a joke, that the camp-followers had divided themselves into two bodies in sport, each of which was led by a general, the one called Alexander, and the other Darius ;", "3910": "and that after beginning to skirmish with one another by throwing clods of earth, they had come to blows of the fist, and had at length become so excited that they fought with sticks and stones, and that it was hard to part them.", "3911": "On hearing this, Alexander ordered the two leaders to fight in single combat:", "3912": "and he himself armed the one called Alexander, while Philotas armed the representative of Darius.", "3913": "The whole army looked on, thinking that the result would be ominous of their own success or failure.", "3914": "After a severe fight, the one called Alexander conquered, and was rewarded with twelve villages and the right of wearing the Persian garb.", "3915": "This we are told by Eratos­ thenes the historian.", "3916": "The decisive battle with Darius was fought at Gauga­ tnela, not at Arbela, as most writers tell us.", "3917": "It is said that this word signifies “ the house of the camel,\" and that one of the ancient Kings of Persia, whose life had been saved by the swiftness with which a camel bore him away from his enemies, lodged the animal there for the rest of its life, and assigned to it the revenues of several villages for its maintenance.", "3918": "During the month Boedromion, at the beginning of the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, there was an eclipse, of the moon:", "3919": "and on the eleventh day after the eclipse the two armies came within sight of one another.", "3920": "Darius kept his troops under arms, and inspected their ranks by torch-light, while Alexander allowed the Mace­ donians to take their rest, but himself with the soothsayer Aristander performed some mystical ceremonies in front of his tent, and offered sacrifice to Phœbus.", "3921": "When Parmenio and the elder officers of Alexander saw the entire plain between Mount Niphates and the confines of Gordyene covered with the watch fires of the Persians, and heard the vague, confused murmur of their army like the distant roar of the sea, they were astonished, and said to one another that it would indeed be a prodigious effort to fight such a mass of enemies by daylight in a pitched battle.", "3922": "As soon as Alexander had finished his sacrifice they went to him, and tried to persuade him to fall upon the Persians by night, as the darkness would prevent his troops from seeing the overwhelming numbers of the enemy.", "3923": "It was then that he made that memorable answer, “ I will not steal a victory,\" which some thought to show an over-boastful spirit, which could jest in the presence of such fearful danger;", "3924": "while others thought that it showed a steady confidence and true knowledge of what would happen on the morrow, and meant that he did not intend to give Darius, when vanquished, the consolation of attributing his defeat to the confusion of a night attack;", "3925": "for Darius had already explained his defeat at Issus to have been owing to the confined nature of the ground, and to his forces having been penned up between the mountains and the sea.", "3926": "It was not any want of men or of arms which would make Darius yield, when he had so vast a country and such great resources at his disposal:", "3927": "it was necessary to make pride and hope alike die within him, by inflicting upon him a crushing defeat in a fair field and in open daylight.", "3928": "XXXII.", "3929": "After his officers had retired, Alexander retired to his tent and is said to have slept more soundly than was his wont, which surprised the generals who came to wait upon him early in the morning.", "3930": "On their own responsibility they gave orders to the soldiers to prepare their breakfast;", "3931": "and then, as time pressed, Parmenio entered his tent, and standing by his bedside, twice or thrice called him loudly by name.", "3932": "When he was awake, Parmenio asked him why he slept so soundly, as if he had already won the victory instead of being just about to fight the most important of all his battles.", "3933": "Alexander answered with a smile;", "3934": "“ Do you not think we have already won the victory, now that we are no longer obliged to chase Darius over an enormous tract of wasted country ?", "3935": "Alexander both before the battle, and in the most dangerous crisis of the day proved himself truly great, always taking judicious measures, with a cheerful conn­ dence of success.", "3936": "His left wing was terribly shaken by a tumultuous charge of the Bactrian cavalry, who broke into the ranks of the Macedonians, while Mazæus sent some horsemen completely round the left wing, who fell upon the troops left to guard the baggage.", "3937": "Parmenio, finding his men thrown into confusion by these attacks, sent a message to Alexander, that his fortified camp and baggage would be lost, if he did not at once despatch a strong reinforcement to the rear.", "3938": "At the time when Alexander received this message, he was in the act of giving his own troops orders to attack, and he answered that Parmenio must, in his confusion, have forgotten that the victors win all the property of the vanquished, and that men who are defeated must not think about treasure or prisoners, but how to fight and die with honour.", "3939": "After sending back this answer to Parmenio, he put on his helmet;", "3940": "for he had left his tent fully armed at all other points, wearing a tunic of Sicilian manufacture closely girt round his waist, and over that a double-woven linen corslet, which had been among the spoils taken at Issus.", "3941": "His helmet was of steel, polished as bright as silver, and was wrought by Theophilus, while round his neck he wore a steel gorget, inlaid with precious stones.", "3942": "His sword, his favourite weapon, was a miracle of light­ ness and tempering, and had been presented to him by the King of Kitium in Cyprus.", "3943": "The cloak which hung from his shoulders was by far the most gorgeous of all his garments, and was the work of the ancient artist Helikon,* presented to Alexander by the city of Rhodes, and was worn by him in all his battles.", "3944": "While he was arraying his troops in order of battle, and giving final directions to his officers, he rode another horse to spare Boukephalus, who was now somewhat old.", "3945": "As soon as he was ready to begin the attack, he mounted Boukephalus and led on his army.", "3946": "XXXIII.", "3947": "Upon this occasion, after addressing the Thessalians and other Greek troops at considerable length, as they confidently shouted to him to lead them against the barbarians, we are told by Kallisthenes that he shifted his lance into his left hand, and raising his right hand to heaven, prayed to the gods that, if he really were the son of Zeus, they would assist and encourage the Greeks.", "3948": "The prophet Aristander, who rode by his side, dressed in a white robe, and with a crown of gold upon his head, now pointed out to him an eagle which rose over his head and directed its flight straight towards the enemy.", "3949": "This so greatly encouraged all who beheld it, that all the cavalry of Alexander's army at once set spurs to their horses and dashed forwards, followed by the phalanx.", "3950": "Before the first of them came to actual blows, the Persian line gave way, and terrible confusion took place, as Alexander drove the beaten troops before him, struggling to fight his way to the centre, where was Darius himself.", "3951": "Alexander had already noted the conspicuous figure of this tall, handsome prince, as he stood in his lofty chariot, surrounded by the royal body guard, a glittering mass of well-armed horsemen, behind the deep ranks of the Persian army.", "3952": "The onslaught of Alexander was so terrific that none could withstand him, and those whom he drove before him, in headlong flight, disordered the ranks which were yet unbroken, and caused a general rout.", "3953": "Yet the noblest and bravest of the Persians fought and died manfully in defence of their king, and, even when lying on the ground at their last gasp, seized the men and horses by the legs to prevent their pursuing him.", "3954": "Darius himself, seeing all these frightful disasters, when his first line was hurled back in ruin, would fain have turned his chariot and fled, but this was difficult, for the wheels were encumbered by the heaps of corpses, and the horses were so excited and restive that the charioteer was unable to manage them.", "3955": "Darius, we are told, left his chariot and his arms, mounted a mare which had recently foaled, and rode away.", "3956": "He would not have escaped even thus, had not mounted messengers just then arrived from Parmenio, begging Alexander to come to his aid, as he was engaged with a large body of the enemy upon which he could make no impression.", "3957": "Indeed, throughout this battle, Parmenio is said to have displayed great remissness and selfwill, either because his courage was damped by age, or because, as we are told by Kallis­ thenes, he envied Alexander's greatness and prosperity.", "3958": "Alexander was much vexed at the message, but without explaining to the soldiers what his real reasons were, ordered the trumpets to sound the recall, as though he were tired of slaughter, or because night was now coming on.", "3959": "He himself at once rode to the scene of danger, but on his way thither heard that the enemy had been completely defeated and put to flight.", "3960": "XXXIV.", "3961": "The result of this battle was the complete destruction of the Persian empire.", "3962": "Alexander was at once saluted King of Asia, and after a splendid sacrifice to the gods, distributed the treasures and provinces of that country among his friends.", "3963": "In the pride of his heart he now wrote to Greece, saying that all the despots must be driven out, and each city left independent with a consti­ tutional government, and gave orders for the rebuilding of the city of Platæa, because the ancestors of the citizens of Platæa gave their territory to be consecrated to the gods on behalf of the liberties of Greece.", "3964": "He also sent some part of the spoils to the citizens of Kroton, in Italy, to show his respect for the memory of Phayllus the athlete, who, during the Persian invasion, when all the other Greek cities in Italy deserted the cause of their country­ men in Greece, fitted out a ship of war at his own expense, and sailed to Salamis to take part in the battle there, and share in the dangers of the Greeks.", "3965": "Such honour did Alexander pay to personal prowess, for he loved to reward and to commemorate noble deeds.", "3966": "XXXV.", "3967": "Alexander now marched into the country of Babylonia, which at once yielded to him.", "3968": "As he drew near to Ekbatana he marvelled much at an opening in the earth, out of which poured fire, as if from a well.", "3969": "Close by, the naphtha which was poured out formed a large lake.", "3970": "This substance is like bitumen, and is so easy to set on fire, that without touching it with any flame, it will catch light from the rays which are sent forth from a fire, burning the air which is between both.", "3971": "The natives, in order to show Alexander the qualities of naphtha, lightly sprinkled with it the street which led to his quarters, and when it became dark applied a match to one end of the track which had been sprinkled with it.", "3972": "As soon as it was alight in one place, the fire ran all along, and as quick as thought the whole street was in flames.", "3973": "At this time Alexander was in his bath, and was waited upon by Stephanus, a hard-favoured page-boy, who had, however, a fine voice.", "3974": "Athenophanes, an Athenian, who always anointed and bathed King Alexander, now asked him if he would like to see the power of the naphtha tried upon Stephanus, saying that if it burned upon his body and did not go out, the force of it must indeed be marvellous.", "3975": "The boy himself was eager to make the trial, and was anointed with it and set on fire.", "3976": "He was at once en­ veloped in flame, and Alexander was terrified for him, fearing that he would be burned to death.", "3977": "Indeed, had it not chanced that several attendants with pitchers of water in their hands had just arrived, all help would have been too late.", "3978": "They poured water over the boy and extinguished the flames, but not before he had been badly burned, so that he was ill for some time after.", "3979": "Some writers, who are eager to prove the truth of ancient legends, say that this naphtha was truly the deadly drug used by Medea, with which she anointed the crown and robe spoken of in the tragedies:", "3980": "for flame could not be produced by them, nor of its own accord, but if fire were brought near to clothes steeped in naphtha they would at once burst into flame.", "3981": "The reason of this is that the rays which fire sends forth fall harmlessly upon all other bodies, merely imparting to them light and heat;", "3982": "but when they meet with such as have an oily, dry humour, and thereby have a sympathy with the nature of fire, they easily cause them to catch fire.", "3983": "It is a disputed question, however, how the naphtha is produced, though most writers conceive its combustible principle to be sup­ plied by the greasy and fiery nature of the soil;", "3984": "for all the district of Babylonia is fiery hot, so that often barley is cast up out of the ground in which it is sown, as if the earth throbbed and vibrated with the heat, and during the hottest part of summer the inhabitants are wont to sleep upon leathern bags filled with water for the sake of coolness.", "3985": "Harpalus, who was appointed governor of the district, took an especial delight in adorning the palace and the public walks with Greek flowers and shrubs;", "3986": "but although he found no difficulty with most of them, he was unable to induce ivy to grow, because ivy loves a cold soil, and the earth there is too hot for it.", "3987": "These digressions, provided they be not too lengthy, we hope will not be thought tedious by our readers.", "3988": "XXXVI.", "3989": "When Alexander made himself master of Susa, he found in the palace forty thousand talents worth of coined money, besides an immense mass of other valu­ able treasure.", "3990": "Here we are told was found five thousand talents weight of cloth dyed with Hermionio* purple cloth, which had been stored up there for a space of two hundred years save ten, and which nevertheless still kept its colour as brilliantly as ever.", "3991": "The reason of this is said to be that honey was originally used in dyeing the cloth purple, and white olive oil for such of it as was dyed white:", "3992": "for cloth of these two colours will preserve its lustre without fading for an equal period of time.", "3993": "Demon also informs us that amongst other things the Kings of Persia had water brought from the Nile and the Danube, and laid up in their treasury, as a confirmation of the greatness of their empire, and to prove that they were lords of all the world.", "3994": "XXXVII.", "3995": "As the district of Persis* was very hard to invade, both because of its being mountainous, and because it was defended by the noblest of the Persians (for Darius had fled thither for refuge), Alexander forced his way into it by a circuitous path, which was shown him by a native of the country, the son of a Lykian captive by a Persian mother, who was able to speak both the Greek and the Persian language.", "3996": "It is said that while Alexander was yet a child, the prophetess at the temple of Apollo at Delphi foretold that a wolft should some day serve him for a guide when he went to attack the Persians.", "3997": "When Persis was taken, a terrible slaughter was made of all the prisoners.", "3998": "A letter written by Alexander himself is still extant, in which he orders that they should all be put to the sword, thinking this to be the safest course.", "3999": "He is said to have found as much coined money heret as in Susa, and so much other trea­ sure that it required ten thousand carts, each drawn by a pair of mules, and five thousand camels, to carry it away.", "4000": "Alexander, observing a large statue of Xerxes which had been thrown down and was being carelessly trampled upon by the soldiers as they pressed into the royal palace, stopped, and addressed it as though it were alive.", "4001": "“ Shall we,\" said he, “ leave thee lying there, because of thy in­ vasion of Greece, or shall we set thee up again because of thy magnificence and greatness of soul ? \"", "4002": "He then stood musing for a long time, till at length he roused himself from his reverie and went his way.", "4003": "Being desirous of giving his soldiers some rest, as it was now winter, he remained in that country for four months.", "4004": "It is related that when he first took his seat upon the royal throne of Persia, under the golden canopy, Demaratus, an old friend and companion of Alexander, burst into tears, and ex­ claimed that the Greeks who had died before that day had lost the greatest of pleasures, because they had not seen Alexander seated on the throne of Darius.", "4005": "XXXVIII.", "4006": "After this, while he was engaged in pre­ paring to march in pursuit of Darius, he chanced to bo present at a banquet where his friends had brought their mistresses.", "4007": "Of these ladies the chief was the celebrated Thais, who afterwards became the mistress of King Ptolemy of Egypt, and who was of Attic parentage.", "4008": "She at first amused Alexander by her conversation, then adroitly flattered him, and at last, after he had been drinking for some time, began to speak in a lofty strain of patriotism which scarcely became such a person.", "4009": "She declared, that she was fully repaid for all the hardships which she had undergone while travelling through Asia with the army, now that she was able to revel in the palace of the haughty Kings of Persia;", "4010": "but that it would be yet sweeter to her to burn the house of Xerxes, who burned her native Athens, and to apply the torch with her own hand in the presence of Alexander, that it might be told among men that a woman who followed Alex­ ander's camp had taken a more noble revenge upon the Persians for the wrongs of Greece, than all the admirals and generals of former times had been able to do.", "4011": "This speech of hers was enthusiastically applauded, and all Alexander's friends pressed him to execute the design.", "4012": "Alexander leaped from his seat, and led the way, with a garland upon his head and a torch in his hand.", "4013": "The rest of the revellers followed, and surrounded the palace, while the remainder of the Macedonians, hearing what was going on, brought them torches, They did so the more readily because they thought that the destruction of the palace indicated an intention on Alexander's part to return home, and not to remain in Persia.", "4014": "Some historians say that this was how he came to burn the palace, while others say that he did it after mature deliberation:", "4015": "but all agree that he repented of what he had done, and gave orders to have the fire extinguished.", "4016": "XXXLX.", "4017": "His liberality and love of making presents Increased with his conquests:", "4018": "and his gifts were always bestowed in so gracious a manner as to double their value.", "4019": "I will now mention a few instances of this.", "4020": "Ariston, the leader of the Pæonians, having slain an enemy, brought his head and showed it to Alexander, saying, “ 0 king, in my country such a present as this is always rewarded with a gold cup.\"", "4021": "Alexander smiled, and said, \"Yes, with an empty cup:", "4022": "but I pledge you in this gold cup, full of good wine, and give you the cup besides.\"", "4023": "One of the common Macedonian soldiers was driving a mule laden with gold belonging to Alexander;", "4024": "but as the animal became too weary to carry it, he unloaded it, and carried the gold himself.", "4025": "When Alexander saw him toiling under his burden, and learned his story, he said, \" Be not weary yet, but carry it a little way farther, as far as your own tent;", "4026": "for I give it to you.\"", "4027": "He seemed to be more vexed with those who did not ask him for presents than with those who did so.", "4028": "He wrote a letter to Phokion, in which he declared that he would not any longer remain his friend, if Phokion refused all his presents.", "4029": "Serapion, a boy who served the ball to the players at tennis, had been given nothing by Alexander because he had never asked for anything.", "4030": "One day when Serapion was throw­ ing the ball to the players as usual, he omitted to do so to the king, and when Alexander asked why he did not give him the ball, answered “", "4031": "You do not ask me for it.\"", "4032": "At this, Alexander laughed and gave him many presents.", "4033": "Once he appeared to be seriously angry with one Proteus, a professed jester.", "4034": "The man's friends interceded for him, and he himself begged for pardon with tears in his eyes, until Alexander said that he forgave him. \" My king,\" said he \"will you not give me something by way of earnest, to assure me that I am in your favour.\"", "4035": "Upon this the king at once ordered him to be given five talents.", "4036": "The amount of money which he bestowed upon his friends and his body guard appears from a letter which his mother Olympias wrote to him, in which she said, “ It is right to benefit your friends and to show your esteem for them;", "4037": "but you are making them all as great as kings, so that they get many friends, and leave you alone without any.\"", "4038": "Olympias often wrote to him to this effect, but he kept all her letters secret, except one which Hephæstion, who was accustomed to read Alexander's letters, opened and read.", "4039": "Alexander did not prevent him, but took his own ring from his finger, and pressed the seal upon Hephæstion’s mouth.", "4040": "The son of Mazæus, who had been the chief man in the kingdom under Darius, was governor of a province, and Alexander added another larger one to it.", "4041": "The young nobleman refused to accept the gift, and said, \"My king, formerly there was only one Darius, but you now have made many Alexanders.", "4042": "\"", "4043": "He presented Parmenio with the house of Bagoas, in which it is said that property worth a thousand talents was found which had belonged to the people of Susa.", "4044": "He also sent word to Antipater, warning him to keep a guard always about his person, as a plot had been formed against his life.", "4045": "He sent many presents to his mother, but forbade her to interfere with the management of the kingdom.", "4046": "When she stormed at this decision of his, he patiently endured her anger;", "4047": "and once when Antipater wrote a long letter to him full of abuse of Olympias, he observed, after reading it, that Antipater did not know that one tear of his mother's eye would outweigh ten thousand such letters.", "4048": "XL.", "4049": "Alexander now observed that his friends were living in great luxury and extravagance;", "4050": "as for instance, Hagnon of Teos had his shoes fastened with silver nails;", "4051": "Leonnatus took about with him many camels, laden with dust,.", "4052": "from Egypt, to sprinkle his body with when he wrestled;", "4053": "Philotas had more than twelve miles of nets for hunting;", "4054": "and that all of them used richly perfumed unguents to anoint themselves with instead of plain oil, and were attended by a host of bathmen and chamber­ lains.", "4055": "He gently reproved them for this, saying that he was surprised that men who had fought so often and in such great battles, did not remember that the victors always sleep more sweetly than the vanquished, and that they did not perceive, when they imitated the luxury of the Persians, that indulgence is for slaves, but labour for princes.", "4056": "\" How,\" he asked, “ can a man attend to his horse,or clean his own lance and helmet, if he disdains to rub his own precious body with his hands ?", "4057": "And do you not know, that our career of conquest will come to an end on the day when we learn to live like those whom we have vanquished ? \"", "4058": "He himself, by way of setting an example, now exposed himself to greater fatigues and hardships than ever in his campaigns and hunting expe­ ditions, so that old Lakon, who was with him when he slew a great lion, said,\" Alexander, you fought well with the lion for his kingdom.\"", "4059": "This hunting scene was after­ wards represented by Kraterus at Delphi.", "4060": "He had figures made in bronze of Alexander and the hounds fighting with the lion, and of himself running to help him.", "4061": "Some of the figures were executed by the sculptor Lysippus, and some by Leochares.", "4062": "XLI.", "4063": "Thus did Alexander risk his life in the vain endeavour to teach his friends to live with simplicity and hardihood;", "4064": "but they, now that they had become rich and important personages, desired to enjoy themselves, and no longer cared for long marches and hard campaigns, so that at last they began to murmur against him, and speak ill of him.", "4065": "He bore this with great gentleness at first, saying that it was the part of a king to do his subjects good and to be ill-spoken of by them in return.", "4066": "Indeed, he used to take advantage of the most trifling incidents to show the esteem he had for his intimate friends, of which I will now give a few examples.", "4067": "Peukestas once was bitten by a bear, while hunting.", "4068": "He wrote and told his friends of his mishap, but kept it secret from Alexander.", "4069": "He, when he heard of it, wrote to Peukestas,

that she was a free-born Greek courtezan, he answered, \" I sympathise with your affection, Eurylochus ;", "4079": "but since Telesippa is a free-born woman, let us try if we cannot, either by presents or arguments, persuade her to remain with us.\"XLII.", "4080": "It is wonderful how many letters and about what trifling matters he found time to write to his friends.", "4081": "For instance, he sent a letter to Kilikia ordering search to be made for a slave boy belonging to Seleukus, who had run away, and praising Peukestas because he had captured Nikon, the runaway slave of Kraterus.", "4082": "He wrote also to Megabazus about a slave who had taken sanctuary in a temple, ordering him to catch him when outside of the temple, if possible, but not to lay hands on him within its precincts.", "4083": "We are told that when he was sitting as judge to hear men tried for their lives, he was wont to close one ear with his hand, while the prosecutor was speaking, in order that he might keep it unbiassed and impartial to listen to what the accused had to say in his defence.", "4084": "But later in his life, so many persons were accused before him, and so many of them truly, that his temper became soured and he inclined to believe them to be all alike guilty.", "4085": "And he was especially transported with rage, and made completely pitiless if any one spoke ill of him,

that Darius had been taken by the satrap Bessus, he dis­ missed all his Thessalian cavalry and sent them home, giving them a largess of two thousand talents over and above the pay which was due to them.", "4088": "He now set out on a long and toilsome journey in pursuit of Darius, for in eleven days he rode more than five hundred miles, so that his men were terribly distressed, especially by

heaps of gold and silver, and pursued a long line of waggons, full of women and children, which were proceeding along without any drivers, until they had reached the foremost of them, because they

off the limb to which it was attached.", "4108": "Alexander now had the corpse of Darius adorned as became a prince, and sent it to his mother, while he received his brother Exathres into the number of his intimate friends.", "4109": "XLIV.", "4110": "He himself, with a few picked troops, now invaded Hyrkania, where he discovered an arm of the sea, which appeared to be as large as the Euxine, or Black Sea, but not so salt.", "4111": "He was unable to obtain any certain information about it, but conjectured it to be a branch of the Mæotic lake.-", "4112": "Yet geographers, many years before

he first began to wear the Persian dress, eitbe.", "4118": "because he thought that he should more easily win the hearts of the natives by conforming to their fashion, or else in order to try the obedience of his Macedonian soldiers and see whether they might not, by degrees, be brought to pay him the same respect and observance which the kings of Persia used to exact from their subjects.", "4119": "He did not, however, completely adopt the Persian costume, which would have been utterly repug­ nant to Grecian ideas, and wore neither the trousers, the coat with long sleeves, nor the tiara, but his dress, though less simple than the Macedonian, was still far from being so magnificent or so effeminate as that of the Persians.", "4120": "He at first only wore this dress when giving audiences to the natives of the country, or when alone with his more intimate friends, but afterwards he fre­ quently both drove out publicly and transacted business in the Persian dress.", "4121":

other honourable wounds, he had only a short time before this been struck by an arrow in the calf of his leg, so that splinters of the bone came out, and also received such a blow upon his neck from a stone, that his eyesight was affected for a considerable time afterwards.", "4123": "Yet he did not cease to expose himself to danger, but crossed the river Orexartes, which he himself thought to be

Asiatics would attack them as boldly as if they were so many women.", "4136": "Yet he said, that he permitted those who desired it to leave his service and return home, merely protesting against being left, with only his personal friends and a few volunteers, to carry on the noble enterprise of making Macedonia mistress of the whole world.", "4137": "These are almost the exact words which he uses in a letter to Antipater, and he further says that when he had spoken thus, the soldiers burst into a universal shout, bidding him lead them whithersoever he would.", "4138": "After this experiment had succeeded with the select troops, it was no difficult matter to induce the remainder to follow him, but they came almost of their own accord.", "4139": "He now began to imitate the Asiatic habits more closely, and endeavoured to assimilate the Macedonian and Asiatic customs and manners, hoping that by this means his empire, during his absence, would rest upon a foundation of good will rather than of force.", "4140": "To further this object he selected thirty thousand native youths, whom he ordered to be taught to speak the Greek language and to use the same arms as the Macedonians;",

that, among his most intimate friends, Hephæstion encouraged him and furthered his designs, while Kraterus steadfastly adhered to the Mace­ donian customs, he made use of the latter in all trans­ actions with Asiatics, and of the former when dealing with Greeks and Macedonians.", "4145": "He loved Hephæstion, and respected Kraterus above all the rest of his friends, and was wont to say that

of the Macedonians were really due to the prowess of his father and himself, and that Alexander was merely a foolish boy, who owed his crown and his empire to their exertions.", "4165": "Antigone repeated these ex­ pressions to one of her friends, who, as was natural, did not keep them secret, so that at last they reached the ears of Kraterus.", "4166": "Kraterus privately introduced the woman

time, to himself.", "4168": "XLIX.", "4169": "Philotas had no idea that he was being spied upon in this manner, and in his conversation with Antigone frequently spoke insolently and slightingly of his sovereign.", "4170": "Alexander, although he had accumulated terrible proofs of treason against Philotas, nevertheless remained silent, either because he felt assured of the loyalty of Parmenio, or because he feared to attack a man of such power and importance.", "4171": "At length, however, a Macedonian of Cha­ lastra, named Simnus, formed a plot against Alexander's life, and invited a young man, named Nikomachus, his own intimate friend, to join him.", "4172": "Nikomachus refused compliance, and told the whole story of the plot to his brother, Kebalinus, who at once had an interview with Philotas, and bade him bring them at once to Alexander, as persons who had a most important communication to make to him.", "4173": "Philotas, however, for some reason or other, did not bring them before Alexander, but said that the king was not at leisure to hear them, as he was engaged in more important business.", "4174": "This he repeated on a second occasion;", "4175": "and as his behaviour made the two brothers suspect his loyalty, they communicated with another officer, and by his means obtained an audience.", "4176": "They now told Alexander about the design of Limnus, and

lost all clue to the plot.", "4179": "He now openly showed his displeasure with Philotas, and en­ couraged all his enemies to say boldly that it was folly of the king to imagine that an obscure man like Limnus would have venturned to form a conspiracy against his life, but that Limnus was merely a tool in the hands of some more powerful person;", "4180": "and that if he wished to discover the real authors of the plot, he must seek for them among those who would have been most benefited by its success.", "4181": "Finding that the king lent a ready ear to suggestions of this kind, they soon furnished hini with an overwhelming mass of evidence of the treasonable designs of Philotas.", "4182": "Philotas was at once arrested, and put to the tenure in the presence of the chief officers of the Macedonian army, while Alexander himself sat behind a curtain to hear what he would say.", "4183": "It is said that when Alexander heard Philotas piteously beg Hephæstion for mercy, he exclaimed aloud, “ Are you such a coward as this, Philotas, and yet contrive such daring plots?\"", "4184": "To be brief, Philotas was put to death, and immediately afterwards Alexander sent to Media and caused Parmenio to be assassinated, although he was a man who had performed the most important services for Philip, had, more than any other of the older Macedonians, encouraged Alexander to invade Asia, and had seen two of his three sons die in battle before he perished with the third.", "4185": "This cruelty made many of the friends of Alexander fear him, and especially Antipater,* who now formed a secret league with the Ætolians, who also feared Alexander because when ho heard of the destruction of the people of Œneadæ, he said that he himself, and not the sons of the people of Œneadæ, would be

Laconian.", "4195": "As they reported that this was an evil omen, he bade them at once offer an expiatory sacrifice on behalf of Kleitus;", "4196": "for ho himself, three days before, had dreamed a

been performed, he came to the banquet, before which Alexander himself had offered sacrifice to the Dioskuri.", "4198": "After all had drunk heavily, a song was sung which had been composed by one Pranichus, or Pierion according to some writers, in which the generals who had recently been defeated by the barbarians were held up to public shame and ridicule.", "4199": "The elder Macedonians were vexed at this, and blamed both the writer of the song and the man who sung it, but Alexander and his associates were much pleased with it, and bade the singer go on.", "4200": "Kleitus, who was now very much excited by drink and who was naturally of a fierce and independent temper, was especi­ ally annoyed, and said that it was not right for Mace­ donians to be thus insulted in the presence of enemies and barbarians, for that, in spite of their misfortune, they were far braver men than those who ridiculed them.", "4201": "Alexander answered that Kleitus, when he called cowar­ dice a misfortune, was no doubt pleading his own cause:", "4202": "at which reproach Kleitus sprang to his feet, and exclaimed, “ My cowardice at any rate saved the life of the son of the gods, when he turned his back to the sword of Spithridates;", "4203": "so that now, by the blood and wounds of the Macedonians, you have become so great a man that you pretend to be the child of Ammon, and disown

the Macedonians disaffected, and yet go unpunished ? \" “", "4206": "Too much are we punished,\" answered Kleitus, “when we see such a reward as this given us for all our hard service, but we congratulate those of us who are dead, because they died before they saw Macedonians beaten with Median rods, and begging Persian attendants to procure them an audience of their king.\"", "4207": "When Kleitus spoke his mind thus boldly, Alexander's intimate friends answered with bitter reproaches, but the older men endeavoured to pacify them.", "4208": "Alexander now turning to Xenodochus of Kardia and Astenius of Kolophon, asked, \" Do not the Greeks seem to you to treat the Macedonians as if they were beasts, and they themselves were more than mortal men?\"", "4209": "Kleitus, however, would not hold his peace, but went on to say that if Alexander could not bear to hear men speak their mind, he had better not invite free-born people to his table, and ought to confine himself to the society of barbarians and slaves who would pay respect to his Persian girdle and striped * tunic.", "4210": "At this speech Alexander could no longer restrain his passion, but seized an apple from the table, hurled it at Kleitus, and began to feel for his dagger.", "4211": "Aristophanes, one of his body-guard, had already secreted it, and the rest now pressed round him imploring him to be quiet.",

man hesitated and refused, struck him with his fist.", "4214": "This man afterwards gained great credit for his conduct, as it was thought that by it he had saved the whole camp from being thrown into an uproar.", "4215": "As Kleitus would not retract what he had said, his friends seized him and forced him out of the room.", "4216": "But he re-entered by another door, and in an offensive and insolent tone began to recite the passage from the Andromache of Euripides, which begins, “ Ah me in Greece an evil custom reigns,\" &c.Upon this Alexander snatched a lance from one of his guards, and ran Kleitus through the body with it, just as he was drawing aside the curtain and preparing to enter the room.", "4217": "Kleitus fell with a loud groan, and died on the spot.", "4218": "Alexander, when he came to himself, and saw his friends all standing round in mute reproach, snatched the spear out of the corpse, and would have thrust it into his own neck, but was forcibly witheld by his guards, who laid hold of him and carried him into his bed-chamber.", "4219": "LII.", "4220": "Alexander spent the whole night in tears, and on the next day was so exhausted by his agony of grief as to

consolation, but Anaxarchus, a man who had always pursued an original method of his own in philosophical speculations, and who was thought to be overbearing and harsh-tempered by his friends, as soon

rather to dictate to them what they should think right, as becomes the master of the world, and not to be influenced by their foolish opinions.", "4226": "Know you not,\" asked he \"that Law and Justice sit beside the throne of Zeus, and make every­ thing which is done by those in power to be lawful and right? \"", "4227": "By such discourse as this Anaxarchus assuaged Alexander's sorrow, but encouraged his savage and lawless disposition.", "4228": "He gained great favour for himself, and was able to influence Alexander against Kallisthenes, who was already no favourite with him on account of his upright, uncompromising spirit.", "4229": "It is related that once at table, when the conversation turned upon the seasons, and upon the climate of Asia, Kallisthenes argued that it was colder in the country where they were than in Greece;", "4230": "and when Anaxarchus vehemently contradicted this, he said, \"Why, you must admit that this country is the colder of the two;", "4231": "for in Greece you used to wear only one cloak all through the winter, whereas here you sit down to dinner wrapped in three Persian rugs.\"", "4232": "This reply made Anaxarchus more his enemy than before.",

“ I hate a philosopher who is not wise in his own interest.\"", "4237": "It is related that once at a great banquet, when sitting over their wine, Kallisthenes was asked to speak in praise of the Macedonians, and that he at once poured forth such a fluent and splendid eulogy that all the company rose, vehemently applauding, and threw their garlands to him.", "4238": "At this Alexander remarked that, as Euripides says, “ On noble subjects, all men can speak well.\"", "4239": "“ Now,\" said he, \" show us your ability by blaming the Macedonians, in order that they may be made better men by having their shortcomings pointed out.\"", "4240": "Kallisthenes hereupon began to speak in a depreciatory strain, and told many home-truths about the Macedonians, pointing out that Philip had become strong only because Greece was weakened by faction, and quoting the line, \"In times of trouble, bad men rise to fame.", "4241": "\"This speech caused the Macedonians to hate him most bitterly, and

one of his friends;", "4249": "and that he after receiving it, rose, stood by the hearth, and after drinking knelt before Alexander:", "4250": "after which he kissed him and resumed his seat.",

who accused Kallisthenes of giving himself great airs, as though he were a queller of despots, and said that he had a large following among the younger men, who looked up to him as being the only free man among so many myriads of people.", "4258": "These accusations were more easily believed to be true because at this time the plot of Hermolaus was discovered;", "4259": "and it was said that when Hermolaus enquired of Kallisthenes how one might become the most famous man in the world, he answered, “ By killing the most famous man in the world.\"", "4260": "He was even said to have encouraged

Attains, and Alketas im­ mediately after the discovery of the plot, states that the royal pages, when put to the torture, declared that they alone had conspired, and that they had no accomplices.",

cities men that plot against me.\"", "4264": "In these words he evidently alludes to Aristotle:", "4265": "for Kallisthenes was brought up in his house, being the son of Hero, Aristotle's first cousin.", "4266": "Some writers tell us that Kallisthenes was hanged by the orders of Alexander;", "4267": "others that he was thrown into chains and died of sickness.", "4268": "Chares informs us

remains were placed in a splendidly equipped four-horse chariot and sent back to the sea-coast.", "4276": "LVII.", "4277": "As Alexander was now about to invade India, and observed that his army had become unwieldy and difficult to move in consequence of the mass of plunder with which the soldiers were encumbered, he collected all the baggage-waggons together one morning at daybreak, and first burned his own and those of his companions, after which he ordered those of the Macedonians to be set on fire.", "4278": "This measure appears to have been more energetic than the occasion really required;", "4279": "and yet it proved more ruinous in the design than in the execution:", "4280": "for although some of the soldiers were vexed at the order, most of them with enthusiastic shouts distributed their most useful property among those who were in want, burning and destroying all the rest with a cheerful alacrity which raised Alexander's spirits to the highest pitch.", "4281": "Yet Alexander was terrible and pitiless in all cases of dereliction of duty..", "4282": "He put to death Menander, one of his personal friends, because he did not remain in a fort, where he had been

lamb, upon whose head was a tiara in shape and colour like that of the King of Persia, with stones hanging on each side of it.", "4285": "Alexander, much disturbed at this portent, was purified by the priests at Babylon, whom he was accustomed to make use of for this purpose, but told his friends that he was alarmed for their sake, and not for his own, as he feared that if he fell, heaven might transfer his crown to some unworthy and feeble successor.", "4286": "However, he was soon cheered by a better omen.", "4287": "The chief of Alexander's household servants, a Macedonian named Proxenus, while digging a place to pitch the royal tent near the river Oxus, discovered a well, full of a smooth, fatty liquid.", "4288": "When the upper layer was removed, there spouted forth a clear oil, exactly like olive oil in smell and taste, and in­ comparably bright and clear:", "4289": "and that, too, in a country where no olive trees grew.", "4290": "It is said that the water of the Oxus itself is very soft and pleasant, and that it causes the skin of those who bathe in it to become sleek and glossy.", "4291": "Alexander was greatly delighted with this discovery, as we learn from a letter which he wrote to Antipater, in which he speaks of this as being one of the most important and manifest signs of the divine favour which had ever been vouchsafed to him.", "4292": "The soothsayers held that the omen portended, that the campaign would be glorious, but laborious and difficult:", "4293": "for oil has been given by the gods to men to refresh them after labour.", "4294": "LVIII.", "4295": "Alexander when on this expedition ran terrible risks in battle, and was several times grievously wounded.", "4296": "His greatest losses were caused, however, by the want of provisions, and by the severity of the climate.", "4297": "He himself, striving to overcome fortune by valour, thought nothing impossible to a brave man, and believed that, while daring could surmount all obstacles, cowardice could not be safe behind any defences.", "4298": "We are told that when he was besieging the fortress of Sisymithres, which was placed upon a steep and inaccessible rock, his soldiers despaired of being able to take it.", "4299": "He asked Oxyartes what sort of a man Sisymithres himself was in respect of courage.", "4300": "When Oxyartes answered that he was the greatest coward in the world, Alexander said “", "4301": "You tell me, that the fortress can be taken;", "4302": "for its spirit is weak.\"", "4303": "And indeed he did take it, by playing upon the the fears of Sisymithres.", "4304": "Once he was attacking another fortress, also situated upon the top of a lofty rock.", "4305": "While he was addressing words of encouragement to the younger Macedonians, finding that one of them was named Alexander, he said “ You must this day prove yourself a brave man, if but for your name's sake.\"", "4306": "The youth fought most bravely, but fell, to the great grief of Alexander.", "4307": "When he reached the city named Nysa,* the Macedonians were unwilling to attack it, because a very deep river ran past its walls.", "4308": "“", "4309": "Unlucky that I am,\" exclaimed Alex­ ander, \" why did I never learn to swim ?”", "4310": "Saying thus, he prepared to cross the river just as he was, with his shield upon his left arm.", "4311": "After an unsuccessful assault, am­ bassadors were sent by the besieged, who were surprised to find Alexander dressed in his armour, covered with dust and blood.", "4312": "A cushion was now brought to him, and he bade the eldest of the ambassadors seat himself upon it.", "4313": "This man was named Akouphis:", "4314": "and he was so much struck with the splendid courtesy of Alexander, that he asked him what his countrymen must do, in order to make him their friend.", "4315": "Alexander replied that they must make Akouphis their chief, and send a hundred of their best men to him.", "4316": "Upon this Akouphis laughed, and answered:", "4317": "“ I shall rule them better, 0 King, if I send the worst men to you and not the best.\"", "4318": "LIX.", "4319": "There was one Taxiles,t who was said to be king of a part of India as large as Egypt, with a rich and fertile soil.", "4320": "He was also a shrewd man, and came and embraced Alexander, saying, “ Why should we two fight one another, Alexander, since you have not come to take away from us the water which we drink nor the food which we eat;", "4321": "and these are the only things about which it is worth while for sensible men to fight?", "4322": "As for all other kinds of property, if I have more than you, I am willing to bestow it upon you, or, if you are the richer, I would willingly be placed in your debt by receiving some from you.\"", "4323": "Alexander was delighted with these words, and giving him his right hand as a pledge of his friendship exclaimed, \"Perhaps you suppose that by this arrangement we shall become friends without a contest;", "4324": "but you are mistaken, for I will contend with you in good offices, and will take care that you do not overcome me.\"", "4325": "Saying thus, they exchanged presents, amongst which Alexander gave Taxiles a thousand talents of coined money.", "4326": "This conduct of his greatly vexed his friends;", "4327": "but caused him to be much more favourably regarded by many of the natives.", "4328": "After this, Alexander, who had suffered great losses from the Indian mercenary troops who flocked to defend the cities which he attacked, made a treaty of alliance with them in a certain town, and afterwards, as they were going away set upon them while they were on the road and killed them all.", "4329": "This is the greatest blot upon his fame;", "4330": "for in all the rest of his wars, he always acted with good faith as became a king.", "4331": "He was also much troubled by the philosophers who attended him, because they reproached those native princes who joined him, and encouraged the free states to revolt and regain their independence.", "4332": "For this reason, he caused not a few of them to be hanged.", "4333": "LX.", "4334": "His campaign against king Porus is described at length in his own letters.", "4335": "He tells us that the river Hydaspes* ran between the two camps, and that Porus with his elephants watched the further bank, and pre­ vented his crossing.", "4336": "Alexander himself every day caused a great noise and disturbance to be made in his camp, in order that the enemy might be led to disregard his move­ ments:", "4337": "and at last upon a dark and stormy night he took a division of infantry and the best of the cavalry, marched to a considerable distance from the enemy, and crossed over into an island of no great extent.", "4338": "Here he was exposed to a terrible storm of rain, with thunder and lightning;", "4339": "but, although several of his men were struck dead, he pressed on, crossed the island, and gained the furthermost bank of the river.", "4340": "The Hydaspes was flooded by the rain, and the stream ran fiercely down this second branch, while the Macedonians could with difficulty keep their footing upon this slippery and uneven bottom.", "4341": "Here it was that Alexander is said to have exclaimed, “ 0 ye Athenians, what toils do I undergo to obtain your praise.", "4342": "\"This, however, rests only on the authority of the his­ torian Oneskritus, for Alexander himself relates that they abandoned their rafts, and waded through this second torrent under arms, with the water up to their breasts.", "4343": "After crossing, he himself rode on some twenty furlongs in advance of the infantry, thinking that if the enemy met him with their cavalry alone, he would be able to rout them easily, and that, if they advanced their entire force, before a battle could be begun, he would be joined by his own infantry.", "4344": "And indeed he soon fell in with a thou­ sand horse and sixty war chariots of the enemy, which he routed, capturing all the chariots, and slaying four hun­ dred of the horsemen.", "4345": "Porus now perceived that Alexan­ der himself had crossed the river, and advanced to attack him with all his army, except only a detachment which he left to prevent the Macedonians from crossing the river at their camp.", "4346": "Alexander, alarmed at the great numbers of the enemy, and at their elephants, did not attack their centre, but charged them on the left wing, ordering Koinus to attack them on the right.", "4347": "The enemy on each wing were routed, but retired towards their main body, where the elephants stood.", "4348": "Here an obstinate and bloody contest took place, insomuch that it was the eighth hour of the day before the Indians were finally over­ come.", "4349": "These particulars we are told by the chief actor in the battle himself, in his letters.", "4350": "Most historians are agreed that Porus stood four cubits* and a span high, and was so big a man that when mounted on his elephant, although it was a very large one, he seemed as well pro­ portioned to the animal as an ordinary man is to a horse.", "4351": "This elephant showed wonderful sagacity and care for its king, as while he was still vigorous it charged the enemy and overthrew them, but when it perceived that he was fainting from his wounds, fearing that he might fall, it quietly knelt on the ground, and then gently drew the spears out of his body with its trunk.", "4352": "When Porus was captured, Alexander asked him how he wished to be treated.", "4353": "“ Like a king,\" answered Porus.", "4354": "Alexander then enquired if he had nothing else to ask about his treatment.", "4355": "“ Everything,\" answered Porus, \" is comprised in these words, like a king.\"", "4356": "Alexander now replaced Porus in his kingdom, with the title of satrap, and also added a large province to it, subduing the independent inhabitants.", "4357": "This country was said to have contained fifteen separate tribes, five thousand considerable cities and innumerable villages;", "4358": "besides another district three times as large, over which he appointed Philippus, one of his personal friends, to be satrap.", "4359": "LXI.", "4360": "After this battle with Porus, Alexander's horse Boukephalus died, not immediately, but some time after­ wards.", "4361": "Most historians say that he died of wounds received in the battle, but Onesikritus tells us that he died of old age and overwork, for he had reached his thirtieth year.", "4362": "Alexander was greatly grieved at his loss, and sorrowed for him as much as if he had lost one of his most intimate friends.", "4363": "He founded a city as a memorial of him upon the banks of the Hydaspes, which he named Boukephalia.", "4364": "It is also recorded that when he lost a favourite clog called Peritas, which he had brought up from a whelp, and of which he was very fond, he founded a city and called it by the dog's name.", "4365": "The historian Sotion tells us that he heard this from Potamon of Lesbos.", "4366": "LXII.", "4367": "The battle with King Porus made the Mace­ donians very unwilling to advance farther into India.", "4368": "They had overcome Porus with the greatest difficulty, as he brought against them a force of twenty thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and now offered the most violent opposition to Alexander, who wished to cross the river Ganges.", "4369": "This river, they heard, was thirty-two furlongs wide and a hundred cubits deep, while its fur­ ther banks were completely covered with armed men, horses and elephants, for it was said that the kings of the Gandaritæ and Præsiræ were awaiting his attack with an army of eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand foot soldiers, eight thousand war chariots, and six thousand elephants;", "4370": "nor was this any exaggeration, for not long afterwards Androkottus, the king of this country, pre­ sented five hundred elephants to Seleukus, and overran and subdued the whole of India with an army of six hundred thousand men.", "4371": "Alexander at first retired to his tent in a rage, and shut himself up there, not feeling any gratitude to those who had prevented his crossing the Ganges, but regarding a retreat as an acknowledgment of defeat.", "4372": "However, after his friends had argued with him, and his soldiers had come to the door of his tent, begging him with tears in their eyes to go no farther, he relented, and gave orders for a retreat, He now contrived many ingenious devices to impress the natives, as, for instance, he caused arms, and bridles and mangers for horses to be made of much more than the usual size, and left them scattered about.", "4373": "He also set up altars, which even to the present day are reverenced by the kings of the Praesim, who cross the river to them, and offer sacrifice upon them in the Greek fashion.", "4374": "Androkottus himself, who was then a lad, saw Alexander himself and afterwards used to declare that Alexander might easily have conquered the whole country, as the then king was hated by his subjects on account of his mean and wicked disposition.", "4375": "LXIII.", "4376": "After this, Alexander wishing to see the outer ocean,* caused many rafts and vessels managed with oars to be built, and proceeded in a leisurely manner down the Indus.", "4377": "His voyage, however, was not an idle one, nor was it unaccompanied with danger, for as he passed down the river, he disembarked, attacked the tribes on the banks, and subdued thorn all.", "4378": "When he was among the Malli, who are said to be the most warlike tribe in India, ho very nearly lost his life.", "4379": "He was besieging their chief city, and after tho garrison had been driven from the walls by volleys or missiles, he was the first man to ascend a scaling ladder and mount the walls", "4380": "The ladder now broke, so that no more could mount, and as the enemy began to assemble inside at the foot of the wall and shoot up at him from below, Alexander, alone against a host, leaped down amongst them, and by good luck, alighted on his feet.", "4381": "His armour rattled loudly as he leaped, and made the natives think that a bright light was emitted from his body;", "4382": "so that at first they gave way and fled from him.", "4383": "But when they saw that he was attended by only two followers, some of them attacked him at close quarters with swords and spears, while one standing a little way off shot an arrow at him with such force and with such good aim, that it passed through his corslet and imbedded itself in the bones of his breast.", "4384": "As he shrank back when the arrow struck him, the man who had shot it ran up to him with a drawn sword in his hand.", "4385": "Peukestas and Limnæus now stood before Alex­ ander to protect him.", "4386": "Both were wounded, Limnæus mortally;", "4387": "but Peukestas managed to stand firm, while Alexander despatched the Indian with his own hand.", "4388": "Alexander was wounded in many places, and at last re­ ceived a blow on the neck with a club, which forced him to lean his back against the wall, still facing the enemy.", "4389": "The Macedonians now swarmed round him, snatched him up just as he fainted away, and carried him insensible to his tent.", "4390": "A rumour now ran through the camp that ho was dead, and his attendants with great difficulty sawed through the wooden shaft of the arrow, and so got off his corslet.", "4391": "They next had to pluck out the barbed head of the arrow, which was firmly fixed in one of his ribs.", "4392": "This arrow-head is said to have measured four fingers­ breadths * in length, and three in width.", "4393": "When it was pulled out, he swooned away, so that he nearly died, but at length recovered his strength.", "4394": "When he was out of danger, though still very weak, as he had to keep him­ self under careful treatment for a long time, he heard a disturbance without, and learning that the Macedoniana were anxious to see him, took his cloak and went out to them.", "4395": "After sacrificing to the gods for the recovery of his health, he started again on his journey, and passed through a great extent of country and past many considerable cities, all of which he subdued.",

of his satraps and viceroys to act in an extremely arbitrary and despotic manner, so that his whole empire was in a most critical condition, and full of conspiracies and seditious risings, Olympias

tunics, and there with weeping and lamen­ tation offered themselves to him and bade him deal with them as with ungrateful and wicked men.", "4507": "Alexander, although he was now inclined to leniency, refused to receive them, but they would not go away, and remained for two days and nights at the door of his tent lamenting and calling him their sovereign.", "4508": "On the third day he came out, and when he saw them in such a pitiable state of abasement, he wept for some time.", "4509": "He then gently blamed them for their conduct, and spoke kindly to them.", "4510": "He gave splendid presents to all the invalids, and dis­ missed them, writing at the same time to Antipater with orders, that in every public spectacle these men should sit in the best places in the theatre or the circus with garlands on their heads.", "4511": "The orphan children of those who had fallen he took into his own service.", "4512": "LXXII.", "4513": "After Alexander was come to the city of Ekba­ tana in Media, and had despatched the most weighty part of his business there, he gave himself up entirely to de­ vising magnificent spectacles and entertainments, with the aid of three thousand workmen, whom he had sent for from Greece.", "4514": "During this time, Hephæstion fell sick of a fever, and being a young man, and accustomed to a soldier's life, did not put himself upon a strict diet and remain quiet as he ought to have done.", "4515": "As soon as Glaukus, his physician, left him to go to the theatre, ho ate a boiled fowl for his breakfast, and drank a large jar of cooled wine.", "4516": "Upon this he was immediately taken worse, and very shortly afterwards died.", "4517": "Alexander's grief for him exceeded all reasonable mea­ sure.", "4518": "He ordered the manes of all the horses and mules to be cut off in sign of mourning, he struck off the battle­ ments of all the neighbouring cities, crucified the unhappy physician, and would not permit the flute or any other musical instrument to be played throughout his camp, until a response came from the oracle of Ammon bidding him honour Hephæstion and offer sacrifice to him as to a hero.-", "4519": "To assuage his grief he took to war, and found consolation in fighting and man-hunting.", "4520": "He conquered the tribe called Kossæi, and slew their entire male popu­ lation, which passed for an acceptable offering to the manes of Hephæstion.", "4521": "He now determined to spend ten thousand talents † on the funeral and tomb of Hephæstion;", "4522": "and as he wished to exceed the cost by the ingenuity and brilliancy of invention shown in this spectacle, he chose Stasikrates out of all his mechanicians to arrange it, as he was thought to be able both to devise with grandeur and to execute with skill.", "4523": "He on one occasion before this, when conversing with Alexander, told him that of all mountains in the world Mount Athos in Thrace was that which could most easily be carved into the figure of a man;", "4524": "and that, if Alexander would give him the order, he would form Athos into the most magnificent and durable monument of him that the world had ever seen, as he would represent him as holding in his left hand the city of Myriandrus, and with his right pouring, as a libation, a copious river into the sea.", "4525": "Alexander would not, indeed, adopt this suggestion, but was fond of discussing much more wonderful and costly designs than this with his engineers.", "4526": "LXXIII.", "4527": "Just as Alexander was on the point of start­ ing for Babylon, Nearchus, who had returned with his fleet up the Euphrates, met him, and informed him that some Chaldæans had warned Alexander to avoid Babylon.", "4528": "He took no heed of this warning, but went his way.", "4529": "When he drew near the walls he saw many crows flying about and pecking at one another, some of whom fell to the ground close beside him.", "4530": "After this, as he heard that Apollodorus, the governor of Babylon, had sacrificed to the gods to know what would happen to Alexander, he sent for Pythagoras, the soothsayer, who had conducted the sacrifice, to know if this were true.", "4531": "The soothsayer admitted that it was, on which Alexander inquired what signs he had observed in the sacrifice.", "4532": "Pythagoras an­ swered that the victim's liver wanted one lobe.", "4533": "“ Indeed! \" exclaimed Alexander, “ that is a terrible omen.\"", "4534": "He did Pythagoras no hurt, but regretted that he had not listened to the warning of Nearchus, and spent most of his time in his camp outside the walls of Babylon, or in boats on the river Euphrates.", "4535": "Many unfavourable omens now depressed his spirit.", "4536": "A tame ass attacked and kicked to death the finest and largest lion that he kept;", "4537": "and one day, as he stripped to play at tennis, the young man with whom he played, when it was time to dress again, saw a man sitting on the king’s throne, wearing his diadem and royal robe.", "4538": "For a long time this man refused to speak, but at length said that he was a citizen of Messene, named Dionysius, who had been brought to Babylon and imprisoned on some charge or other, and that now the god Serapis had appeared to him, loosed his chains, and had brought him thither, where he had bidden him to put on the king's diadem and robe, seat himself on his throne, and remain silent.", "4539": "LXXIV.", "4540": "When Alexander heard this, he caused the man to be put to death, according to the advice of his soothsayers;", "4541": "but he himself was much cast down, and feared that the gods had forsaken him :", "4542": "he also grew sus­ picious of his friends.", "4543": "Above all he feared Antipater and his sons, one of whom, Iolas, was his chief cup-bearer, while the other, Kassander, had but recently arrived from Greece, and as he had been trained in the Greek fashion, and had never seen any Oriental customs before, he burst into a loud, insolent laugh, when he saw some of the natives doing homage to Alexander.", "4544": "Alexander was very angry, and seizing him by the hair with both hands, beat his head against the wall.", "4545": "Another time he stopped Kassander, when he was about to say something to some men who were accusing his father, Antipater. “", "4546": "Do you imagine \" said he, \" that these men would have journeyed so far merely in order to accuse a man falsely, if they had not been wronged by him ? \"", "4547": "When Kassander answered, that it looked very like a false accusation for a man to journey far from the place where his proofs lay, Alex­ ander said with a laugh, “ This is how Aristotle teaches his disciples to argue on either side of the question;", "4548": "but if any of you be proved to have wronged these men ever so little, you shall smart for it.\"", "4549": "It is related that after this, terror of Alexander became so rooted in the mind of Kassander, that many years afterwards, when Kassander was king of Macedonia, and lord of all Greece, he was walking about in Delphi looking at the statues, and that when he saw that of Alexander he was seized with a violent shuddering;", "4550": "his hair stood upright on his head, and his body quaked with fear, so that it was long before he regained his composure.", "4551": "LXXV.", "4552": "After Alexander had once lost his confidence and become suspicious and easily alarmed, there was no circumstance so trivial that he did not make an omen of it, and the palace was full of sacrifices, lustrations, and soothsayers.", "4553": "So terrible a thing is disbelief in the gods and contempt for them on the one hand, while superstition and excessive reverence for them presses on men's guilty consciences like a torrent of water- poured upon them.", "4554": "Thus was Alexander's mind filled with base and cowardly alarms.", "4555": "However when the oracular responses of the gods about Hephæstion were reported to him, he laid aside his grief somewhat, and again indulged in feasts and drinking bouts.", "4556": "He entertained Nearchus and his friends magnifi­ cently, after which he took a bath, and then, just as he was going to sleep, Medius invited him to a revel at his house.", "4557": "He drank there the whole of the following day, when he began to feel feverish :", "4558": "though he did not drink up the cup of Herakles at a draught, or suddenly feel a pain as of a spear piercing his body, as some historians have thought it necessary to write, in order to give a dramatic fitness and dignity to the end of so important a personage.", "4559": "Aristobulus tells us that he became delirious through fever, and drank wine to quench his thirst, after which he became raving mad, and died on the thirtieth day of the month Daisius.", "4560": "LXXVI.", "4561": "In his own diary his last illness is described thus:", "4562": "“ On the eighteenth day of Daisius he slept in the bath-room, because he was feverish.", "4563": "On the following day after bathing he came into his chamber and spent the day playing at dice with Medius.", "4564": "After this he bathed late in the evening, offered sacrifice to the gods, dined, and suffered from fever during the night.", "4565": "On the twen­ tieth he bathed and sacrificed as usual, and while reclining in his bath-room he conversed with Nearchus and his friends, listening to their account of their voyage, and of the Great Ocean.", "4566": "On the twenty-first he did the same, but his fever grew much worse, so that he suffered much during the night, and next day was very ill.", "4567": "On rising from his bed he lay beside the great plunge-bath, and conversed with his generals about certain posts which were vacant in his army, bidding them choose suitable persons to fill them.", "4568": "On the twenty-fourth, although very ill, he rose and offered sacrifice;", "4569": "and he ordered his chief officers to remain near him, and the commanders of brigades and regiments to pass the night at his gate.", "4570": "On the twenty-fifth he was carried over the river to the other palace, and slept a little, but the fever did not leave him.", "4571": "When his generals came to see him he was speechless, and remained so during the twenty-fifth, so that the Macedon­ ians thought that he was dead.", "4572": "They clamoured at his palace gates, and threatened the attendants until they forced their way in.", "4573": "When the gates were thrown open they all filed past his bed one by one, dressed only in their tunics.", "4574": "On this day Python and Seleukus, who had been to the temple of Serapis, enquired whether they should bring Alexander thither.", "4575": "The god answered that they must leave him alone.", "4576": "The eight and twentieth day of the month, towards evening, Alexander died.\"LXXVII.", "4577": "Most of the above is copied, word for word, from Alexander's household diary.", "4578": "No one had any suspicion of poison at the time;", "4579": "but it is said that six years after there appeared clear proof that he was poisoned, and that Olympias put many men to death, and caused the ashes of Iolas, who had died in the mean time, to be cast to the winds, as though he had administered the poison to Alexander.", "4580": "Some writers say that Antipater was advised by Aristotle to poison Alexander, and inform us that one Hagnothemis declared that he had been told as much by Antipater;", "4581": "and that the poison was as cold as ice, and was gathered like dew, from a certain rock near the city of Nonakris, and preserved in the hoof of an ass:", "4582": "for no other vessel could contain it, because it is so exceedingly cold and piercing.", "4583": "Most historians, however, think that the whole story of Alexander's being poisoned was a fiction;", "4584": "and this view is strongly supported by the fact, that as Alexander's generals began to fight one another im­ mediately after his death, his body lay for many days unheeded, in hot and close rooms, and yet showed no signs of decay, but remained sweet and fresh.", "4585": "Roxana, who was pregnant, was regarded with great respect by the Mace­ donians, and being jealous of Statira, she sent her a forged letter, purporting to come from Alexander and asking her to come to him.", "4586": "When Statira came, Roxana killed both her and her sister, cast their bodies down a well, and filled up the well with earth.", "4587": "Her accomplice in this crime was Perdikkas, who on the death of Alexander at once became a very powerful man.", "4588": "He sheltered his authority under the name of Arrhidæus, who became the nominal.", "4589": "while Perdikkas was the virtual king of Macedonia.", "4590": "This Arrhidaeus was the son of Philip by a low and dis­ reputable woman named Philinna, and was half-witted in consequence of some bodily disorder with which he was afflicted.", "4591": "This disease was not congenital nor produced by natural causes, for he had been a fine boy and showed considerable ability, but Olympias endeavoured to poison him, and destroyed his intellect by her drugs.", "4592": "L*", "4593": "When Bulla got possession of the supreme power, he confiscated the marriage portion of Cornelia t the daughter of Cinna t who had once enjoyed the supremacy in Rome, because he could not either by promises or threats induce Cæsar to part with her.", "4594": "The cause of the enmity between Cæsar and Sulla was Caesar's relationship to Marius;", "4595": "for the elder Marius was the husband of Julia the sister of Cæsar’s father, and Julia was the mother of the younger Marius, who was consequently Caesar's cousin.", "4596": "Cæsar was not content with being let alone by Sulla, who was at first fully occupied with the proscriptions and other matters, but he presented himself to the people as a candidate for a priesthood,.", "4597": "though he had hardly arrived at man's estate.", "4598": "But Sulla by his opposition contrived to exclude him from this office, and even thought of put­ ting him to death;", "4599": "and when some observed that there was no reason in putting to death such a youth, Sulla observed, that they had no sense if they did not see many Marii in this boy.", "4600": "These words were conveyed to Cæsar, who thereupon concealed himself by wandering about for some time in the Sabine country.", "4601": "On one occasion when he was changing his place of abode on account of sickness, he fell in by night with the soldiers of Sulla who were scouring those parts and seizing on those who were concealed.", "4602": "But Cæsar got away by giving Cornelius,t who was in command of the soldiers, two talents, and going straightway down to the coast he took ship and sailed to Bithynia to King Nicomedes,t with whom he stayed no long time.", "4603": "On his voyage from Bithynia, he was captured near the island Pharmacusa § by pirates, || who at that time were in possession of the seas with a powerful force and numerous ships.", "4604": "II.", "4605": "The pirates asked Cæsar twenty talents for his ransom, on which he laughed at them for not knowing who their prize was, and he promised to give them fifty talents.", "4606": "While he dispatched those about him to various cities to raise the money, he was left with one friend and two attendants among these Cilician pirates, who were notorious for their cruelty, yet he treated them with such contempt that whenever he was lying down to rest, he would send to them and order them to be quiet.", "4607": "He spent eight and thirty days among them, not so much like a prisoner as a prince surrounded by his guards, and he joined in their sports and exercises with perfect unconcern.", "4608": "He also wrote poems and some speeches which he read to them, and those who did not approve of his compositions he would call to their faces illiterate fellows and bar­ barians, and he would often tell them with a laugh that he would hang them all.", "4609": "The pirates were pleased with his manners, and attributed this freedom of speech to simplicity and a mirthful disposition.", "4610": "As soon as the ransom came from Miletus and Cæsar had paid it and was set at liberty, he manned some vessels in the port of Miletus and went after the pirates, whom he found still on the island, and he secured most of them.", "4611": "All their property he made his booty;", "4612": "but the pirates, he lodged in prison at Pergamum, and then went to Junius,* who, as governor of the provinces of Asia, was the proper person to punish the captives.", "4613": "But as the governor was casting a longing eye on the booty, which was valuable, and said he would take time to consider about the captives, Cæsar without more ado, left him and going straight to Pergamum took all the pirates out of prison and crucified them, as he had often told them he would do in the island when they thought he was merely jesting.", "4614": "III.", "4615": "Sulla's power was now declining, and Cæsar's friends in Rome recommended him to return.", "4616": "How­ ever, he first made a voyage to Rhodus in order to have the instruction of Apollonius the son of Molon,t of whom Cicero also was a hearer.", "4617": "This Apollonius was a distinguished rhetorician, and had the reputation of being a man of a good disposition.", "4618": "Cæsar is said to have had a great talent for the composition of discourses on political matters, and to have cultivated it most diligently, so as to obtain beyond dispute the second rank;", "4619": "his ambition to be first in power and arms, made him from want of leisure give up the first rank, to which his natural talents invited him, and consequently his attention to military matters and political affairs by which he got the supreme power, did not allow him to attain perfection in oratory.", "4620": "Accordingly at a later period, in his reply to Cicero about Cato,.", "4621": "he deprecates all comparison between the com­ position of a soldier and the eloquence of an accomplished orator who had plenty of leisure to prosecute his studies.", "4622": "IV.", "4623": "On his return to Rome he impeached t Dolabella t for maladministration in his province, and many of the cities of Greece gave evidence in support of the charge.", "4624": "Dolabella, indeed, was acquitted;", "4625": "but to make some return to the Greeks for their zeal in his behalf, Cæsar assisted them in their prosecution of Publius Antonius § for corruption before Marcus Lucullus, the governor of Macedonia;", "4626": "and his aid was so effectual that Antonius appealed to the tribunes, alleging that he had not a fair trial in Greece with the Greeks for his accusers.", "4627": "At Rome Cæsar got a brilliant popularity by aiding at trials with his eloquence;", "4628": "and he gained also much good will by his agreeable mode of saluting people and his pleasant manners, for he was more attentive to please than persons usually are at that age.", "4629": "He was also gradually acquiring political influence by the splendour of his entertainments and his table and of his general mode of living.", "4630": "At first those who envied him, thinking that when his resources failed his influence would soon go, did not concern them­ selves about his flourishing popularity :", "4631": "but at last when his political power had acquired strength and had become difficult to overthrow and was manifestly tending to bring about a complete revolution, they perceived that no beginnings should be considered too small to be capable of quickly becoming great by uninterrupted endurance and having no obstacle to their growth by reason of being despised.", "4632": "Cicero, who is considered to have been the first to suspect and to fear the smiling surface * of Caesar's policy, as a man would the smiling smoothness of a sea, and who observed the bold and determined character which was concealed under a friendly and joyous exterior, said that in all his designs and public measures he per­ ceived a tyrannical purpose;", "4633": "\"but on the other hand,\" said he, “ when I look at his hair, which is arranged with so much care, and see him scratching his head with one finger,t I cannot think that such a wicked purpose will ever enter into this man's mind as the overthrow of the Roman State.\"", "4634": "This, however, belongs to a later period.V.", "4635": "He received the first proof of the good will of the people towards him when he was a competitor against Caius Popilius for a military tribuneship,‡ and was pro­ claimed before him.", "4636": "He received a second and more con­ spicuous evidence of popular favour on the occasion of the death of Julia § the wife of Marius, when Caesar, who was her nephew, pronounced over her a splendid funeral oration in the Forum, and at the funeral ventured to exhibit the imagesll of Marius, which were then seen for the first time since the administration of Sulla, for Marius and his son had been adjudged enemies.", "4637": "Some voices were raised against Cæsar on account of this display, but the people responded by loud shouts, and received him with clapping of hands, and admiration, that he was bringing back as from the regions of Hades, after so long an interval, the glories of Marius to the city.", "4638": "Now it was an ancient Roman usage to pronounce funeral orations- over elderly women, but it was not customary to do it in the case of young women, and Caesar set the first example by pro­ nouncing a funeral oration over his deceased wife, which brought him some popularity and won the many by sym­ pathy to consider him a man of a kind disposition and full of feeling.", "4639": "After the funeral of his wife he went to Iberia as quæstor to the Prætor Vetus,t for whom he always showed great respect, and whose son he made his own quæstor when he filled the office of Prætor.", "4640": "After hi a quæstorship he married for his third wife Pompeia ‡ :", "4641": "he had by his wife Cornelia a daughter, who afterwards married Pompeius Magnus.", "4642": "Owing to his profuse expendi­ ture (and indeed men generally supposed that he was buying at a great cost a short-lived popularity, though in fact he was purchasing things of the highest value at a low price) it is said that before he attained any public office he was in debt to the amount of thirteen hundred talents.", "4643": "Upon being appointed curator of the Appian Road,§ he laid out upon it a large sum of his own;", "4644": "and during his ædileship* he exhibited three hundred and twenty pair of gladiators, and by his liberality and ex­ penditure on the theatrical exhibitions, the processions, and the public entertainments, he completely drowned all previous displays, and put the people in such a humour, that every man was seeking for new offices and new honours to requite him with.", "4645": "VI.", "4646": "There were at this time two parties in the State, that of Sulla, which was all-powerful, and that of Marius, which was cowed and divided and very feeble.", "4647": "It was Cæsar's object to strengthen and gain over the party of Marius, and accordingly, when the ambitious splendour of his ædileship was at its height, he had images of Marius secretly made, and triumphal Victories, which he took by night and set up on the Capitol.", "4648": "At daybreak the people seeing the images glittering with gold, and exqusitely laboured by art (and there were inscriptions also which declared the Cimbrian victories of Marius), were in admira­ tion at the boldness of him who had placed them there, for it was no secret who it was, and the report quickly circulating through the city, brought everybody to the spot to see.", "4649": "Some exclaimed that Caesar had a design to make himself tyrant, which appeared by his reviving those testimonials of honour which had been buried in the earth by laws and decrees of the senate, and that it was done to try if the people, who were already tampered with, were tamed to his purpose by his splendid exhibitions, and would allow him to venture on such tricks and innova­ tions.", "4650": "But the partisans of Marius, encouraging one another, soon collected in surprising numbers, and filled the Capitol with their noise.", "4651": "Many also shed tears of joy at seeing the likeness of Marius, and Cæsar was highly extolled as the only man worthy to be a kinsman of Marius.", "4652": "The senate being assembled about these matters, Catulus Lutatius, who had at that time the greatest name of any man in Rome, got up, and charging Cæsar, uttered that memoiable expression:", "4653": "\" Caesar, no longer are yon taking the state by underground approaches, but by storming engines.\"", "4654": "Cæsar spoke in reply to this charge, and satis­ fled the senate, on which his admirers were still more elated, and urged him not to abate of his pretensions for any one:", "4655": "with the favour of the people, they said, he would soon get the better of all, and be the first man in the State.", "4656": "VII.", "4657": "About this time Metellus,* the Pontifex Maximus.", "4658": "died, and though Isauricus and Catulus were candidates for the priesthood, which was a great object of ambition, and were men of the highest rank and greatest influence in the senate, Caesar would not give way to them, but ho presented himself to the people as a competitor.", "4659": "The favour of the people appearing equally divided, Catulus, as the more distinguished candidate, being more afraid of the uncertainty of the event, sent and offered Cæsar a large sum of money if he would retire from his canvass;", "4660": "but Cæsar replied that he would stand it out even if he had to borrow still more.", "4661": "On the day of the election, his mother, with tears, accompanied him to the door, when Caesar embracing her, said, \" Mother, to-day you shall see your son either Pontifex Maximus, or an exile.\"", "4662": "After the voting was over, which was conducted with great spirit, Caesar prevailed, a circumstance which alarmed the senate and the nobles, who feared that he would lead on the people to the boldest measures.", "4663": "Accordingly, Piso and Catulus blamed Cicero for having spared Cæsar, who, in the matter of Catiline's † conspiracy, had given him a handle.", "4664": "Now Catiline designed not only to alter the form of government, but to subvert the whole Commonwealth and throw all into confusion, but he was ejected from the city on being convicted of some minor charges, and before the extent of his designs was discovered.", "4665": "He left behind him in the city Lentulus and Cethegus, to carry his plans into execution.", "4666": "It is uncertain if Cæsar secretly lent them any countenance and aid, but when they were completely convicted in the senate, and Cicero the consul put it to each senator to give his opinion on their punishment, all who spoke declared for death till it came to Caesar's turn to speak.", "4667": "Cæsar rose and delivered a studied oration, to the effect that it was not consistent with the constitution, nor was it just to put to death without a trial men dis­ tinguished for their high character and their family, unless there was the most urgent necessity;", "4668": "and he added that, if they were imprisoned in the Italian cities which Cicero himself might choose, until the war against Cati­ line was brought to an end, the senate might have time to deliberate on the case of each prisoner when peace was restored.", "4669": "VIII.", "4670": "This proposal appeared so humane, and was sup­ poited by so powerful a speech, that not only those who rose after Caesar sided with him, but many of those who had already spoken changed their opinions and went over to that of Caesar, till it came to the turn of Cato and Catulus to speak.", "4671": "After they had made a vigorous opposition, and Cato in his speech had also urged suspicious matter against Cæsar and strongly argued against him, the conspirators were handed over to the executioner, and as Caesar was leaving the Senate many of the young men who then acted as a guard to Cicero, crowded together and threatened Cæsar with their naked swords.-", "4672": "But Curio 0 is said to have thrown his toga round Cæsar, and to have carried him off;", "4673": "and Cicero also, when the young men looked to him, is said to have checked them by a motion, either through fear of the people or because he thought that the death of Cæsar would be most unjust and a violation of law.", "4674": "If this is true, I cannot conceive why Cicero said nothing about it in the book on his Consulship ;", "4675": "† but Cicero was blamed afterwards for not having taken advantage of so favourable an opportunity to get rid of Cæsar, and for having feared the people, who were extravagantly attached to Cæsar.", "4676": "And indeed a few days after, when Cæsar had gone to the Senate and defended himself in a speech against the imputations that had been cast on him, and his speech was received with loud marks of disapprobation and the sitting of the Senate was lasting longer than usual, the people came with loud cries and surrounded the Senate-house calling for Cæsar and bidding the Senate let him go.", "4677": "Accordingly, Cato apprehending danger mainly from some movement of the needy part of the people, who were like a firebrand among the rest of the citizens, as they had all their hopes in Cæsar, prevailed on the Senate to give them a monthly allow­ ance of corn, which produced an addition to the rest of the expenditure of seven millions‡ five hundred thousands.", "4678": "However, the immediate alarm was manifestly quenched by this measure, which snapped off the best part of Cæsar's influence and scattered it, at a time when he was going to enter on his office of Prætor which made him more formidable.", "4679": "IX.", "4680": "No tumults occurred in Cæsar's Prætorship,* but a disagreeable incident happened in his family.", "4681": "Publius Clodius.† a man of Patrician rank, was distinguished both by wealth and eloquence, but in arrogance and impudence he was not inferior to the most notorious scoundrels in Rome.", "4682": "Clodius was in love with Pompeia, Cæsar's wife, and Pompeia was in no way averse to him.", "4683": "But a strict watch was kept over the woman's apartment, and Aurelia, Cæsar's mother, who was a prudent woman, by always observing Pompeia, made it difficult and hazardous for the lovers to have an interview.", "4684": "Now the Romans have a goddess whom they call Bona, as the Greeks have a Gynæceia.", "4685": "The Phrygians, who claim this goddess, say she was the mother of King Midas;", "4686": "the Romans say she was a Dryad and the wife of Faunus;", "4687": "but the Greeks say she is one of the mothers of Dionysus, whose name must not be uttered;", "4688": "and this is the reason why they cover the tents with vine-leaves during the celebration of her fes­ tival, and a sacred serpent sits by the goddess according to the my thus.", "4689": "No man is allowed to approach the festival, nor to be in the house during the celebration of the rites;", "4690": "but the women by themselves are said to per­ form many rites similar to the Orphic in the celebration.", "4691": "Accordingly when the season of the festival is come, the husband, if he be consul or prætor, leaves the house and every male also quits it;", "4692": "and the wife taking possession of the house makes all arrangements, and the chief cere­ monies are celebrated by night, the evening festival being accompanied with mirth and much music.", "4693": "X.", "4694": "While Pompeia* was now celebrating this festival, Clodius, who was not yet bearded, and for this reason thought that he should not be discovered, assumed tho dress and equipment of a female lute-player and went to the house looking just like a young woman.", "4695": "Finding the door open, he was safely let in by a female slave who was in the secret, and who forthwith ran off to tell Pom­ peia.", "4696": "As there was some delay and Clodius was too im­ patient to wait where the woman had left him, but was rambling about the house, which was large, and trying to avoid the lights, Aurelia's waiting-woman, as was natural for one woman with another, challenged him to a little mirthful sport, and as he declined the invitations, she pulled him forward and asked who he was and where he came from.", "4697": "Clodius replied that he was waiting for Abra the maid of Pompeia, for that was the woman's name, but his voice be­ trayed him, and the waiting-woman l'an with a loud cry to the lights and the rest of the company, calling out that she had discovered a man.", "4698": "All the women were in the greatest alarm, and Aurelia stopped the celebration of the rites and covered up the sacred things:", "4699": "she also ordered the doors to be closed and went about the house with the lights to look for Clodius.", "4700": "He was discovered lurking in the chamber of the girl who had let him in, and on being recognised by the women was turned out of doors.", "4701": "The women went straightway, though it was night, to their husbands to tell them what had happened;", "4702": "and as soon as it was day, the talk went through Rome of the desecration of the sacred rites by Clodius, and how ho ought to be punished for his behaviour, not only to the persons whom he had insulted, but to the city and the gods.", "4703": "Accordingly one of the tribunes instituted a prosecution against Clodius for an offence against religion, and the most powerful of the senators combined against him, charging him, among other abominations, with adultery with his sister, who was the wife of Lucullus.", "4704": "The people set themselves in opposition to their exertions and supported Clodius, and were of great service to him with the judices, who were terror-struck and afraid of the people.", "4705": "Caesar immediately divorced Pompeia, and when he was sum­ moned as a witness on the trial, he said he knew nothing about the matters that Clodius was charged with.", "4706": "This answer appearing strange, the accuser asked him, \" Why have you put away your wife ? \" to which Cæsar replied, \" Because I considered that my wife ought not even to be suspected.\"", "4707": "Some say that this was the real expression of Cæsar's opinion, but others affirm that it was done to please the people who were bent on saving Clodius.", "4708": "However this may be, Clodius was acquitted, for the majority of the judices gave in their votes.", "4709": "written con­ fusedly,

received Iberia † for his province, but as he had a difficulty about arranging matters with his creditors, who put obstructions in the way of his leaving Rome, and were clamorous, he applied to Crassus, then the richest man in Rome, who stood in need of the vigour and impetuosity of Caesar to support him in his political hostility to Pompeius.", "4712": "Crassus undertook to satisfy the most importunate and unrelenting of the creditors, and having become security for Cæsar to the amount of eight hundred and thirty talents, thus enabled him to set out for his province.", "4713": "There is a story that as Caesar was crossing the Alps, he passed by a small barbarian town which had very few inhabitants and was a miserable place, on which his companions jocosely observed, \" They did not suppose there were any contests for honors in such a place as that, and struggles for the first rank and mutual jealousy of the chief persons:", "4714": "\" on which Cæsar earnestly remarked, \" I would rather bo the first man here than the second at Rome.\"", "4715": "Again in Spain, when he had some leisure and was reading the history of Alexander,* he was for a long time in deep thought, and

hitherto had paid no obedience to Rome.", "4719": "After his military success, he was equally fortunate in settling the civil administration by establishing friendly relations among the different states, and particularly by healing the differences between debtors and creditors ;", "4720": "‡ for which purpose he determined that the creditor should annually take two-thirds of the debtor's income, and that tho owner should take the other third, which arrangement was to continue till the debt was paid.", "4721": "By these measures he gained a good reputation, and he retired from the province with the acquisition of a large fortune, having enriched his soldiers also by his campaigns and been saluted by them Imperator.", "4722": "XIII.", "4723": "As it was the law at Rome that those who were soliciting a triumph should stay outside the city, and that those who were candidates for the consulship should be present in the city, Cæsar finding himself in this difficulty, and

time and wasting the day in talking, till at last Cæsar determined to give up the triumph and to secure the consulship.", "4725": "As soon as he entered the city, he adopted a policy which deceived everybody except Cato;", "4726": "and this was the bringing about of a reconciliation between Pompeius and Crassus, the two most powerful men in Rome, whom Cæsar reconciled from their dif­ ferences, and centering in himself the united strength of the two by an act that had a friendly appearance, changed the form of government without its being observed.", "4727": "For it was not, as most people suppose, the enmity of Cæsar and Pompeius which produced the civil wars, but their friendship rather, inasmuch as they first combined to depress the nobility and then quarrelled with one another.",

introduced measures for certain allotments and divisions of land.†", "4732": "But ho met with opposition in the Senate from the good and honourable among them, and as he had long been looking for a pretext, he exclaimed with solemn adjurations, that he was driven against his will to court the favour of the people by the arrogance and obstinacy of the Senate, and accordingly he hurried to the popular assembly and placing Crassus on one side of him and Pompeius on the other, he asked them if they approved of his legislative measures.", "4733": "Upon their expressing their approbation, he entreated them to give him their aid against those who threatened to oppose him with their swords.", "4734": "Pompeius and Crassus promised their assistance, and Pompeius added, that he would oppose

Cæsar's colleague, found it useless to oppose Caesar's measures, and he and Cato several times narrowly escaped with their lives in the Forum, whereupon Bibulus shut himself up at home for the remainder of his consulship.", "4741": "Immediately after his marriage Pompeius filled the Forum with armed men, and supported the people in passing Caesar's laws and in giving him for five years Gaul on both sides of the Alps with the addition of Illyricum and four legions.", "4742": "Upon Cato's venturing to speak against these measures, Caesar ordered him to be carried off to prison, thinking

soldiers.", "4747": "\"", "4748": "Why don't you then stay at home for the same reason?\" replied Cæsar, to which Considius rejoined, \"My age makes me fearless, for the little of life that remains

expedition by which he subdued Gaul, is just like a now beginning in his career and the commencement of a new course of life and action, in which he showed himself as a soldier and a general inferior to none who have gained admiration as leaders and been the greatest men :", "4753": "for whether we com­ pare Caesar's exploits with those of the Fabii, Scipios, and Metelli, or with those of his contemporaries or immediate predecessors, Sulla and Marius and both the Luculli or even Pompeius himself, whose fame, high as the heavens, was blossoming at that time in every kind of military virtue, Caesar will be found to surpass them all-his supe­ riority over one appearing in the difficulties of the country in which he carried on his campaigns, over another in the extent of country subdued, over a third in the number and courage of the enemy whom he defeated, over another again in the savage manners and treacherous character of the nations that he brought to civility, over a fourth in his clemency and mildness to the conquered, over another again in his donations and liberality to his soldiers;", "4754": "and in fine his superiority over all other generals appears by the numbers of battles that he fought and of enemies that he slew.", "4755": "For in somewhat less than ten years during which he carried on his campaign in Gaul he took by storm above eight hundred cities, and subdued three hundred nations, and fought with three millions of men at different times, of whom he destroyed one million in battle and took as many prisoners.", "4756": "XVI.t", "4757": "So great were the good-will and devotion of Cæsar's soldiers to him, that those who under other generals were in no way superior to ordinary soldiers, were invincible and irresistible and ready to meet any danger for Cæsar's glory.", "4758": "An instance of this is Acilius, who in the sea-fight of Massalia* boarded one of the enemy's ships and had his right hand cut off with a sword, but he still kept hold of his shield with the left hand and striking at the faces of the enemy drove all to flight and got possession of the vessel.", "4759": "Another instance was Cassius Scæva, † who in the fight at Dyrrachium had one eye de­ stroyed by an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one javelin and his thigh with another, and on his shield he had received the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles.",

the other in the face, put him to flight, and finally he escaped himself with the aid of his friends.", "4761": "In Britannia on one occasion the natives had attacked the foremost centurions who had got into a marshy spot full of water, upon which, in the presence of Cæsar who was viewing the contest, a soldier rushed into the midst of the enemy, and after performing many con­ spicuous acts of valour, rescued the centurions from the barbarians, who took to flight.", "4762": "The soldier, with difficulty attempting to cross after all the rest, plunged into the muddy stream, and with great trouble and the loss of his shield, sometimes swimming, sometimes walking, he got safe over.", "4763": "While those who were about Caesar were admiring his conduct and coming to receive him with congratulations and shouts, the soldier, with the greatest marks of dejection and tears in his eyes, fell down at Cæsar's feet and begged pardon for the loss of his shield.", "4764": "Again, in Libya,

up with him as the common reward of courage, and that he was rich only in proportion as he rewarded deserving soldiers ;", "4768": "and in the next place by readily undergoing every danger and never shrinking from any toil.", "4769": "Now they did not so much ad­ mire Cæsar's courage, knowing his love of glory ;", "4770": "but his endurance of labour beyond his body's apparent power of sustaining it, was a matter of astonishment, for he was of a spare habit, and had a white and soft skin, and was subject to complaints in the head and to epileptic fits, which, as it is said, first attacked him at Corduba ;", "4771": "* not­ withstanding all this, he did not make his feeble health an excuse for indulgence, but he made military service the means of his cure, by unwearied journeying, frugal diet, and by constantly keeping in the open air and enduring fatigue, struggling with his malady and keeping his body proof against its attacks.", "4772": "He generally slept in chariots or in litters, making even his repose a kind of action;", "4773": "and in the daytime he used to ride in a vehicle to the garrisons, cities and camps, with a slave by his side, one of those who were expert

in eight days.", "4775": "From his boyhood he was a good horseman, for he had been accustomed to place his hands behind him and, holding them close together on his back, to put the horse to his full speed.", "4776": "In that campaign he also prac­ tised himself in dictating letters as he was riding and thus giving employment to two scribes, and as Oppius * says, to more.", "4777": "He is said also to have introduced the practice of communicating with his friends by letters, as there was no time for personal interviews on urgent affairs, owing to the amount of business and the size of the city.", "4778": "This anecdote also is cited as a proof of his indifference as to diet.", "4779": "On one occasion when he was entertained at supper by his host Valerius Leo t in Medio­ lanum, asparagus was served up with myrum poured on it instead of oil, which Cæsar ate without taking any notice of it, and reproved his friends who were out of humour on the occasion. \"", "4780": "You

tenth legion sent a deputation of their body to thank him, but the rest of the legions abused their own officers, and the whole army, full of impetuosity and eagerness, all followed Cæsar, marching for many days, till they encamped within two hundred stadia of the enemy.", "4804": "The courage of Ariovistus was somewhat broken by the bare approach of the Humans;", "4805": "for as he had supposed

was advantageous to one who had to contend against many with a small force, he fortified his camp, and kept his men altogether from fighting;", "4869": "and he made them increase the height of the ramparts and build up the gates as if they were afraid, his manoeuvre being to make the enemy despise him, till at last when they made their assault in scattered bodies, urged by self­ confidence, sallying out he put them to flight and killed many of them.", "4870": "XXV.*", "4871": "The frequent defections of the Gauls in those parts were thus quieted, and also by Caesar during the winter moving about in all directions and carefully watching disturbances.", "4872": "For there had come to him from Italy three legions to replace those that had perished, Pompeius having lent him two of those which were under his command, and one legion having been newly raised in Gaul upon the Padus.", "4873": "But in the course of time there showed themselves, what had long in secret been planted and spread abroad by the most powerful men among the most warlike tribes, the elements of the greatest and the most dangerous of all the wars in Gaul, strengthened by a numerous body of young men armed and collected from all quarters, and by great stores brought together, and fortified cities, and countries difficult of access.", "4874": "And at that time, during the winter, frozen rivers and forests buried in snow, and plains overflowed by winter torrents, and in some parts paths that could not be discovered for the depth of the snow, and in other parts the great uncer­ tainty of a march through marshes and streams diverted from their course, seemed to place the proceedings of the insurgents altogether beyond any attempt on the part of Cæsar.", "4875": "Accordingly many tribes had revolted, but the leaders of the revolt were the Arvenni and the Car­ nuntini ;", "4876": "Vergentorix was elected to the supreme direction ofthe war, he whose father the Gauls had put to death on the ground of aiming at a tyranny.", "4877": "XXVI.", "4878": "Vergentorix,* dividing his force into many parts, and placing over them many commanders, began to gain over all the surrounding country as far as those who bordered on the Arar, it being his design, as Cæsar's enemies in Rome were combining against him, to rouse all Gaul to war.", "4879": "If he had attempted this a little later, when Caesar was engaged in the civil war, alarms no less than those from the invasion of the Cimbri would have seized on Italy.", "4880": "But now Cæsar, who appears to have had the talent for making the best use of all opportunities in war, and particularly critical seasons, as soon as he heard of the rising, set out on his march, by the very roadst that he traversed, and the impetuosity and rapidity of his march in so severe a winter letting the barbarians see that an invincible and unvanquished army was coming against them.", "4881": "For where no one believed that a messenger or a letter-carrier from him could make his way in a long time, there was Caesar seen with all his army, at once ravaging their lands, and destroying the forts, taking cities, and receiving those who changed sides and came over to him, till at last even the nation of the Edui ‡ declared against him, who up to this time had called them­ selves brothers of the Romans, and had received signal distinction, but now by joining the insurgents they greatly dispirited Cæsar's troops.", "4882": "In consequence of this, Caesar moved from those parts, and passed over the territory of the Lingones,* wishing to join the Sequani, who were friends, and formed a bulwark in front of Italy against the rest of Gaul.", "4883": "There the enemy fell upon him and hemmed him in with many ten thousands, upon which Cæsar resolved to fight a decisive battle against the com­ bined forces, and after a great contest, he gained a victory at last, and with great slaughter, routed the barbarians;", "4884": "but at first it appears that he sustained some loss, and the Aruveni show a daggert suspended in a temple, which they say was taken from Caesar.", "4885": "Cæsar himself after­ wards saw it, and smiled;", "4886": "and when his friends urged him to take it down, he would not, because he considered it consecrated.", "4887": "XXVII.", "4888": "However, the chief part of those who then escaped, fled with the king to the city of Alesia. ‡", "4889": "And while Cæsar was besieging this city, which was considered to be impregnable by reason of the strength of the walls and the number of the defenders, there fell upon him from without a danger great beyond all expectation.", "4890": "For the strength of all the nations in Gaul assembling in arms came against Alesia, to the number of three hundred thou­ sand ;", "4891": "and the fighting men in the city were not fewer than one hundred and seventy thousand;", "4892": "so that Cæsar being caught between two such forces and blockaded, was compelled to form two walls for his protection, the one towards the city, and the other opposite those who had come upon him, since, if these forces should unite, his affairs would be entirely ruined.", "4893": "On many accounts then, and with good reason, the hazard before the walls of Alesia was famed abroad, as having produced deeds of daring and skill such as no other struggle had done;", "4894": "but it is most worthy of admiration that Cæsar engaged with so many thousands outside of the town and defeated them without it being known to those in the city;", "4895": "and still more admirable, that this was also unknown to the Romans who were guarding the wall towards the city.", "4896": "For they knew nothing of the victory till they heard the weeping of the men in Alesia and the wailing of the women, when they saw on the other side many shields adorned with silver and gold, and many breastplates smeared with blood, and also cups and Gallic tents conveyed by the Romans to their camp.", "4897": "So quickly did so mighty a force, like a phantom or a dream, vanish out of sight and dis­ perse, the greater part of the men having fallen in battle.", "4898": "But those who held Alesia, after giving no small trouble to themselves and to Caesar, at last surrendered;", "4899": "and the leader of the whole war, Vergentorix, putting on his best armour, and equipping his horse, came out through the gates, and riding round Cæsar who was seated, and then leaping down from his horse, he threw off his complete armour, and seating himself at Caesar's flet, he re- maired ed there till he was delivered up to be kept for the triumph.", "4900": "XXVIII.*", "4901": "Cæsar had long ago resolved to put down Pompeius, as Pompeius also had fully resolved to do towards him.", "4902": "For now that Crassus had lost his life among the Parthians, who kept a watch over both of them, it remained for one of them, in order to be the chief, to put down him who was, and to him who was the chief, to take off the man whom he feared, in order that this might not befall him.", "4903": "But it had only recently occurred to Pompeius to take alarm, and hitherto he had despised Cæsar, thinking it would be no difficult thing for the man whom he had elevated to be again depressed by him;", "4904": "but Cæsar, who had formed his design from the beginning, like an athlete, removed himself to a distance from his antagonists, and exercised himself in the Celtic wars, and thus disciplined his troops and increased his reputation, being elevated by his exploits to an equality with the victories of Pompeius;", "4905": "also laying hold of pretexts, some furnished by the conduct of Pompeius himself, and others by the times and the disordered state of the administration at Rome, owing to which, those who were candidates for magistracies placed tables in public and shamelessly bribed the masses, and the people being hired went down to show their partisan­ ship not with votes on behalf of their briber, but with bows and swords and slings.", "4906": "And after polluting the Rostra with blood and dead bodies, they separated, leaving the city to anarchy, like a ship carried along without a pilot, so that sensible men were well content if matters should result in nothing worse than a monarchy after such madness and such tempest.", "4907": "And there were many who even ventured to say publicly that the state of affairs could only be remedied by a monarchy, and that they ought to submit to this remedy when applied by the mildest of physicians, hinting at Pompeius.", "4908": "But when Pompeius in what he said affected to decline the honour, though in fact he was more than anything else labouring to bring about his appointment as dictator, Cato, who saw through his intention, persuaded the Senate to appoint him sole consul.", "4909": "that he might not by violent means get himself made dictator, and might be contented with a mere constitutional monarchy.", "4910": "They also decreed an additional period for his provinces:", "4911": "and he had two, Iberia * and all Libya, which he administered by sending Legati and maintaining armies, for which he received out of the public treasury a thousand talents every year.", "4912": "XXIX.", "4913": "Upon this, Cæsar began to canvass for a con­ sulship by sending persons to Rome, and also for a pro­ rogation of the government of his provinces.", "4914": "At first Pompeius kept silent, but Marcellus t and Lentulus opposed his claim, for they hated Cæsar on other grounds, and they added to what was necessary what was not necessary, to dishonour and insult him.", "4915": "For they deprived of the citizenship the inhabitants of Novum Comum ‡ a colony lately settled by Caesar in Gaul;", "4916": "and Marcellus, who was consul, punished with stripes one of the Senators of Novum Comum who had come to Rome, and added too this insult,\" That he put these marks upon him to show that he was not a Roman,\" and he told him to go and show them to Cæsar.", "4917": "After the consulship of Marcellus, when Cæsar had now profusely poured forth his Gallic wealth for all those engaged in public life to draw from, and had released Curio § the tribune from many debts, and given to Paulus the consul fifteen hundred talents, out of which he do­ corated the Forum with the Basilica, a famous monument which he built in place of the old one called Fulvia;", "4918": "-under these circumstances, Pompeius, fearing cabal, both openly himself and by means of his friends exerted him­ self to have a successor appointed to Caesar in his govern­ ment, and he sent and demanded back of him the soldiers", "4919": "If which he had lent to Cæsar for the Gallic wars.", "4920": "Caesar sent the men back after giving each of them a present cf two hundred and fifty drachmae.", "4921": "The officers who led these troops to Pompeius, spread abroad among the people reports about Caesar which were neither decent nor honest;", "4922": "and they misled Pompeius by ill-founded hopes, telling him that the army of Cæsar longed to see him, and that while he with difficulty directed affairs at Rome owing to the odium produced by secret intrigues, the force with Cæsar was all ready for him, and that if Cæsar's soldiers should only cross over to Italy, they would forthwith be on his side:", "4923": "so hateful, they said, had Cæsar become to them on account of his numerous campaigns, and so suspected owing to their fear of monarchy.", "4924": "With all this Pompeius was inflated, and he neglected to get soldiers in readiness, as if he were under no apprehension;", "4925": "but by words and resolution he was overpowering Cæsar, as he supposed, by carrying decrees against him, which Cæsar cared not for at all.", "4926": "It is even said that one of the centurions who had been sent by him to Rome, while standing in front of the Senate-house, on hearing that the Senate would not give Cæsar a longer term in his govern­ ment. \"", "4927": "But this,\" he said, “shall give it,\" striking the hilt of his sword with his hand.", "4928": "XXX.", "4929": "However, the claim of Cæsar at least had a strik­ ing show of equity.", "4930": "For he proposed that he should lay down his arms and that when Pompeius had done the same and both had become private persons, they should get what favours they could from the citizens;", "4931": "and he argued that if they took from him his power and con­ firmed to Pompeius what he had, they would be stigma­ tizing one as a tyrant and making the other a tyrant in fact.", "4932": "When Curio made this proposal before the people on behalf of Cæsar, he was loudly applauded;", "4933": "and some even threw chaplets of flowers upon him as on a victorious athlete.", "4934": "Antonius, who was tribune, produced to the people a letter * of Cæsar's on this subject which he had received, and he read it in spite of the consuls.", "4935": "But in the Senate, Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius, made a motion, that if Cæsar did not lay down his arms on a certain day, he should be declared an enemy.", "4936": "Upon the consuls putting the question, whether they were of opinion that Pompeius should dismiss his troops, and again, whether Cæsar should, very few voted in favour of the former question, and all but a few voted in favour of the latter;", "4937": "but when Antonius * on his side moved that both should dismiss their troops, all unanimously were in favour of that opinion.", "4938": "Scipio made a violent opposition, and Lentulus, the consul, called out that they needed arms to oppose a robber, and not votes, on which the Senate broke up and the Senators changed their dress as a sign of lamentation on account of the dissension.", "4939": "XXXI.", "4940": "But when letters had come from Cæsar by which he appeared to moderate his demands, for he proposed to surrender everything else except Gaul within the Alps and Illyricum with two legions, which should be given to him to hold till he was a candidate for a second consulship, and Cicero the orator, who had just returned from Cilicia and was labouring at a reconciliation, was inducing Pompeius to relent, and Pompeius was ready to yield in everything else except as to the soldiers, whom he still insisted on taking from Cæsar, Cicero urged the friends of Cæsar to give in and to come to a settlement on the terms of the above-mentioned provinces and the allowance of six thousand soldiers, only to Cæsar.", "4941": "Pom­ pcius was ready to yield and to give way;", "4942": "but the consul Lentulus would not let him, and he went so far as to insult and drive with dishonour from the Senate both Curio and Antonius, thus himself contriving for Cæsar the most specious of all pretexts, by tho aid of which indeed Caesar mainly excited the passions of his men, pointing out to them that men of distinction and magistrates had made their escape in hired vehicles in the dress of slaves.", "4943": "For, putting on this guise through fear, they had stolen out of Rome.", "4944": "XXXII.", "4945": "Now Cæsar had about him no more than three hundred horse and five thousand legionary soldiers;", "4946": "for the rest of his army, which had been left beyond the Alps, was to be conducted by those whom he sent for that purpose.", "4947": "Seeing that the commencement of his under- taking and the onset did not so much require a large force at the present, but were to be effected by the alarm which a bold stroke would create and by quickly seizing his opportunity, for he concluded that he should strike terror by his unexpected movement more easily than he could overpower his enemies by attacking them with all his force, he ordered his superior officers and centurions with their swords alone and without any other weapons to take Ariminum, a large city of Gaul, avoiding all bloodshed and confusion as much as possible;", "4948": "and he intrusted the force to Hortensius.*", "4949": "Cæsar himself passed the day in public, standing by some gladiators who were exercising, and looking on;", "4950": "and a little before evening after attending to his person and going into the mess-room and staying awhile with those who were invited to supper, just as it was growing dark he rose, and courteously addressing the guests, told them to wait for his return, but he had previously given notice to a few of his friends to follow him, not all by the same route, but by different directions.", "4951": "Mounting one of the hired vehicles, he drove at first along another road, and then turning towards Ariminium, when he came to the stream which divides Gaul within the Alps from the rest of Italy (it is called Rubico †), and he began to calculate as he approached nearer to the danger, and was agitated by the magnitude of the hazard, he checked his speed;", "4952": "and halting he considered about many things with himself in silence, his mind moving from one side to the other, and his will then underwent many changes;", "4953": "and he also discussed at length with his friends who were present, of whom Pollio Asinius * was one, all the difficulties, and enumerated the evils which would ensue to all mankind from his passage of the river, and how great a report of it they would leave to posterity.", "4954": "At last, with a kind of passion, as if he were throwing himself out of reflection into the future, and uttering what is the usual expression with which men preface their entry upon desperate enterprises and daring, “ Let the die be cast,\" he hurried to cross the river;", "4955": "and thence advancing at full speed, he attacked Ariminum before daybreak and took it.", "4956": "It is said that on the night before the passage of the river, he had an impure dream,t for he dreamed that he was in unlawful commerce with his mother.", "4957": "XXXIII.", "4958": "But when Ariminum was taken, as if the war had been let loose through wide gates over all the earth and sea at once, and the laws of the state were confounded together with the limits of the province, one would not have supposed that men and women only, as on other occasions, in alarm were hurrying through Italy, but that the cities themselves, rising from their foundations, were rushing in flight one through another;", "4959": "and Rome herself, as if she were deluged by torrents, owing to the crowding of the people from the neighbour­ ing towns and their removal, could neither easily be pacified by magistrate nor kept in order by words, and in the midst of the mighty swell and the tossing of the tempest, narrowly escaped being overturned by her own agitation.", "4960": "For contending emotions and violent movements occupied every place.", "4961": "Neither did those who rejoiced keep quiet, but in many places, as one might expect in a large city, coming into collision with those who were alarmed and sorrowing, and being full of confidence as to the future, they fell to wrangling with them;", "4962": "and people from various quarters assailed Pompeius, who was terror-struck and had to endure the censure of one party for strengthening Cæsar against himself and the supremacy of Rome, while others charged him with inciting Lentulus to insult Cæsar who was ready tc give way and was proposing fair terms of accomodation.", "4963": "Favonius bade him stamp on the ground with his foot;", "4964": "for Pompeius on one occasion in an arrogant address to the Senate, told them not to be concerned or trouble them­ selves about preparations for war ;", "4965": "when Cæsar advanced, lie would stamp upon the earth with his foot and fill Italy with armies.", "4966": "However, even then Pompeius had the advantage over Caesar in amount of forces :", "4967": "but nobody would let the man follow his own judgment;", "4968": "and giving way to the many false reports and alarms, that the war was now close at hand and the enemy in possession of everything, and carried away by the general movement, he declared by an edict that he saw there was tumult, and he left the city after giving his commands to the Senate to follow, and that no one should stay who pre­ ferred his country and freedom to tyranny.", "4969": "XXXIV.*", "4970": "Accordingly the consuls fled without even making the sacrifices which it was usual to make before quitting the city;", "4971": "and most of the senators also took to flight, in a manner as if they were robbing, each snatching of his own what first came to hand as if it belonged to another.", "4972": "There were some also who, though they had hitherto vehemently supported the party of Cæsar, through alarm at that time lost their presence of mind, and without any necessity for it were carried along with the current of that great movement.", "4973": "A most piteous sight was the city, when so great a storm was coming on, left like a ship whose helmsman had given her up, to be carried along and dashed against anything that lay in her way.", "4974": "But though this desertion of the city was so piteous a thing, men for the sake of Pompeius considered the flight to be their country, and they were quitting Rome as if it were the camp of Cæsar ;", "4975": "for even Labienus,* one of Cæsar's greatest friends, who had been his legatus and had fought with him most gallantly in all the Gallic wars, then fled away from Cæsar and came to Pompeius.", "4976": "But Cæsar sent to Labienus both his property and his baggage;", "4977": "and advancing he pitched his camp close by Domitius, who with thirty cohorts held Corfinium.t Domitius despairing of himself asked his physician, who was a slave, for poison, and taking what was given, he drank it, intending to die.", "4978": "Shortly after, hearing that Cæsar showed wonderful clemency towards his prisoners, he bewailed his fate and blamed the rash­ ness of his resolution.", "4979": "But on the physician assuring him that what he had taken was only a sleeping potion and not deadly, he sprung up overjoyed, and going to Cæsar, received his right hand, and yet he afterwards went over again to Pompeius, This intelligence being carried to Home made people more tranquil, and some who had fled, returned.", "4980": "XXXV", "4981": "Cæsar took the troops of Domitius into his service, as well as the soldiers that were raising for Pompeius whom he surprised in the cities;", "4982": "and having now got a numerous and formidable army, he advanced against Pompeius.", "4983": "Pompeius did not await his approach, but fled to Brundisium, and sending the consuls over before him with a force to Dyrrachium,* himself shortly after sailed from Brundisium upon the approach of Cæsar, as will be told more particularly in the Life of Pompeius.", "4984": "†", "4985": "Though Cæsar wished to pursue immediately, he was prevented by want of ships, and he turned back to Rome, having in sixty days without bloodshed become master of Italy.", "4986": "Finding the city more tranquil than he ex­ pected and many of the Senators in it, he addressed them in moderate and constitutional language, ‡ urging them to send persons to Pompeius with suitable terms of accom­ modation;", "4987": "but no one listened to his proposal, either because they feared Pompeius, whom they had deserted, or supposed that Cæsar did not really mean what he said, and merely used specious words.", "4988": "When the tribune Metellus§ attempted to prevent him from taking money from the reserved treasurer and alleged certain laws, Caesar replied, “ That the same circumstances did not suit arms and laws:", "4989": "but do you, if you don't like what is doing, get out of the way, for war needs not bold words;", "4990": "when we have laid down our arms after coming to terms, then you may come forward and make your speeches to the people.\" “", "4991": "And in saying this,\" he continued, \" I waive part of my rights, for you are mine, and all are mine, who have com­ billed against me, now that I have caught them.\"", "4992": "Having thus spoken to Metellus he walked to the doors of the trea­ sury ;", "4993": "but as the keys were not found, he sent for smiths and ordered them to break the locks.", "4994": "Metellus again opposed him, and some commended him for it, but Cæsar, raising his voice, threatened to kill him, if he did not stop his oppo­ sition, “And this,\" said he, \" young man, you well know, is more painful for me to have said than to do.\"", "4995": "These words alarmed Metellus and made him retire, and also caused everything else to be supplied to Cæsar for the war without further trouble, and with speed.", "4996": "XXXVI.", "4997": "He marched against Iberia,* having first determined to drive out Afranius and Varro, the legati of Pompeius, and having got into his power the forces and the provinces in those parts, then to advance against Pompeius without leaving any enemy in his rear.", "4998": "After having often been exposed to risk in his own person from ambuscades, and with his army chiefly from want of pro­ visions, he never gave up pursuing, challenging to battle and hemming in the enemy with his lines, till he had made himself master of their camps and forces.", "4999": "The generals escaped to Pompeius.", "5000": "XXXVII.", "5001": "On his return to Rome, Piso, the father-in- law of Caesar, advised that they should send commis­ sioners to Pompeius to treat of terms, but Isauricus opposed the measure to please Cæsar.", "5002": "Being chosen Dictator by the Senate, he restored the exiles, and the children of those who had suffered in the times of Sulla,* he reinstated in their civil rights, and he relieved the debtors by a certain abatement of the interest, and took in hand other measures of the like kind, not many in number;", "5003": "but in eleven days, he abdicated the monarchy, and declaring himself and Servilius Isauricus consuls t set out on his expedition.", "5004": "The rest of his forces he passed by on his hurried march, and with six hundred picked horsemen and five legions, the time being the winter solstice and the commencement of January (and this pretty nearly corresponds to the Poseideon of the Athenians), he put to sea, and crossing the Ionian gulf he took Oricum and Apollonia;", "5005": "but he sent back his ships to Brundisium for the soldiers whom he had left behind on his march.", "5006": "But while the men were still on the road, as they were already passed the vigour of their age and worn out by the number of their campaigns, they mur­ mured against Cæsar, “ Whither now will he lead us and where will this man at last carry us to, hurrying us about and treating us as if we could never be worn out and as if we were inanimate things?", "5007": "even the sword is at last exhausted by blows, and shield and breastplate need to be spared a little after so long use.", "5008": "Even our wounds do not make Cæsar consider that he commands perishable bodies, and that we are but mortal towards endurance and pain;", "5009": "and the winter season and the storms of the sea even a god cannot command ;", "5010": "but this man runs all risks, as if he were not pursuing his enemies, but flying from them.\"", "5011": "With such words as these they marched slowly towards Brundisium.", "5012": "But when they found that Caesar had embarked, then quickly changing their temper, they reproached themselves as traitors to their Imperator;", "5013": "and they abused their officers also for not hastening the march.", "5014": "Sitting on the heights, they looked towards the sea and towards Epirus for the ships which were to carry them over to their commander.", "5015": "XXXVIII.", "5016": "At Apollonia, as Cæsar had not a force sufficient to oppose the enemy, and the delay of the troops from Italy put him in perplexity and much uneasiness, he formed a desperate design, without communicating it to any one, to embark in a twelve-oared boat and go over to Brundisium, though the sea was commanded by so many ships of the enemy.*", "5017": "Accordingly, disguising himself in a slave's dress, he went on board by night, and throwing himself down as a person of no importance, he lay quiet.", "5018": "While the river Anius t was carrying down the boat towards the sea, the morning breeze, which at that time generally made the water smooth at the outlet of the river by driving the waves before it, was beaten down by a strong wind which blew all night over the sea;", "5019": "and the river, chafing at the swell of the sea and the opposition of the waves, was becoming rough, being driven back by the huge blows and violent eddies, so that it was impossible for the master of the boat to make head against it;", "5020": "on which he ordered the men to change about, intending to turn the boat round.", "5021": "Cæsar perceiving this, discovered himself, and taking the master by the hand, who was alarmed at the sight of him, said, “ Come, my good man, have courage and fear nothing;", "5022": "you carry Cæsar and the fortune of Cæsar in your boat.\"", "5023": "The sailors now forgot the storm, and sticking to their oars, worked with all their force to get out of the river.", "5024": "But as it was impos­ sible to get on, after taking in much water and running great risk at the mouth of the river, Cæsar very un­ willingly consented that the master should put back.", "5025": "On his return, the soldiers met him in crowds, and blamed him much and complained that he did not feel confident of victory even with them alone, but was vexed and exposed himself to risk on account of the absent, as if he distrusted those who were present.", "5026": "XXXIX.", "5027": "Shortly after Antonius arrived from Brun­ disium with the troops;", "5028": "and Caesar, being now confident, offered battle to Pompeius, who was well posted and had sufficient supplies both from land and sea, while Cæsar at first had no abundance, and afterwards was hard pressed for want of provisions;", "5029": "but the soldiers cut up a certain root.", "5030": "and mixing it with milk, ate it.", "5031": "And once, having made loaves of it, they ran up to the enemies' outposts, threw the bread into the camp, and pitched it about, adding, that so long as the earth produces such roots, they will never stop besieging Pompeius.", "5032": "Pompeius, however, would not let either the matter of the loaves or these words be made known to the mass of the army;", "5033": "for his soldiers were dispirited and dreaded the savage temper and endurance of the enemy as if they were wild beasts.", "5034": "There were continually skirmishes about the fortifications of Pompeius, and Caesar had the advantage in all except one, in which there was a great rout of his troops and he was in danger of losing his camp.", "5035": "For when Pompeius made an onset, no one stood the attack, but the trenches were filled with the dying, and Cæsar's men were falling about their own ramparts and bulwarks, being driven in disorderly flight.", "5036": "Though Caesar met the fugitives and endeavoured to turn them, he had no success, and when he laid hold of the colours, those who were carrying them threw them down, so that the enemy took two and thirty, and Cæsar himself had a narrow escape with his life.", "5037": "A tall, strong man was running away past by Caesar, who putting his hand upon him, ordered him to stand and face the enemy;", "5038": "but the man,who was completely confounded by the danger, raised his sword to strike him, on which Cæsar's shield-bearer struck the man first and cut off his shoulder.", "5039": "Cæsar had so completely given up his cause as lost, that when Pompeius either through caution or from some accident did not put the finishing stroke to his great success, but retreated after shutting up the fugitives within their ramparts, Caesar said to his friends as he was retiring, To-day the victory would be with the enemy, if they had a commander who knew how to conquer.", "5040": "Going into his tent and lying down, Cæsar spent that night of all nights in the greatest agony and perplexity, consider­ ing that his generalship had been bad, in that while a fertile country lay near him and the rich cities of Mace­ donia and

the enemy in siege by his arms.", "5041": "Accordingly, after passing a restless night, full of uneasiness at the difficulty and danger of his present position, he broke up his camp with the determi­ nation of leading his troops into Macedonia to oppose Scipio, for he concluded that either he should draw Pompeius after him to a country where he would fight without the advantage of having the same supplies from the sea, or that he would defeat Scipio if he were left to himself.", "5042": "XL.", "5043": "This encouraged the army of Pompeius and the officers about him to stick close to Cæsar, whom they con­ sidered to have been defeated and to be making his escape;", "5044": "though Pompeius himself was cautious about hazarding a battle for so great a stake, and, as he was excellently furnished with everything for prolonging the war, he thought it best to wear out and weaken the vigour of the enemy, which could not be long sustained.", "5045": "For the best fighting men in Cæsar's army possessed experience and irresistible courage in battle;", "5046": "but in marchings and making encampments and assaulting fortifications and watching by night, they gave way by reason of their age, and their bodies were unwieldy for labour, and owing to weakness, had lost their alacrity.", "5047": "It was also reported that a pestilential disease was prevalent in Cæsar's army, which had originated in the want of proper food;", "5048": "and, what was chief of all, as Cæsar was neither well sup­ plied with money nor provisions, it might be expected that in a short time his army would be broken up of itself.", "5049": "XLI.", "5050": "For these reasons Pompeius did not wish to fight, and Cato alone commended his design, because he wished to spare the citizens ;", "5051": "for after seeing those who had fallen in the battle to the number of a thousand, he wrapped up his face and went away with tears in his eyes.", "5052": "But all the rest abused Pompeius for avoiding a battle, and tried to urge him on by calling him Agamemnon and King of Kings, by which they implied that he was unwilling to lay down the sole command, and was proud at having so many officers under his orders and coming to his tent, Favonius, who aped Cato's freedom of speech, raved because they should not be able even that year to enjoy the figs of Tusculum owing to Pompeius being so fond of command;", "5053": "and Afranius (for he had just arrived from Iberia, where he had shown himself a bad general), being charged with betraying his army for a bribe, asked why they did not fight with the merchant who had bought the provinces of him.", "5054": "Pressed by all this importunity, Pom­ peius pursued Cæsar with the intention of fighting, though contrary to his wish.", "5055": "Cæsar accomplished his march with difficulty, as no one would supply him with provisions and be was universally despised on account of his recent defeat;", "5056": "however, after taking Gomphi,\" a Thessalian city, he had not only provisions for his army, but his men were unexpectedly relieved from their disease.", "5057": "For they fell in with abundance of wine, of which they drank plentifully, and revelling and riot­ ing on their march, by means of their drunkenness, they threw off and got rid of their complaint in consequence of their bodies being brought into a different habit.", "5058": "XLII.", "5059": "When the two armies had entered the plain of Pharsalus and pitched their camps, Pompeius again fell back into his former opinion, and there were also unlucky appearances and a vision in his sleep.t", "5060": "He dreamed that he saw himself in the theatre, applauded by the Romans.", "5061": "But those about him were so confident, and so fully anticipated a victory, that Domitius and Scipio and Spinther were disputing and bestirring themselves against one another about the priesthood of Cæsar, and many persons sent to Rome to hire and get possession of houses that were suitable for consuls and prætors, expecting to be elected to magistracies immediately after the war.", "5062": "But the cavalry showed most impatience for the battle, being sumptuously equipped with splendid armour, and priding themselves on their well-fed horses and fine persons, and on their numbers also, for they were seven thousand against Cæsar's thousand.", "5063": "The number of the infantry also was unequal, there being forty-five thousand matched against twenty-two thousand.", "5064": "XLIII.", "5065": "Cæsar, calling his soldiers together and telling them that Corfinius ‡ was close at hand with two legions, and that other cohorts to the number of fifteen under Calenus were encamped near Megara and Athens, asked if they would wait for them or hazard a battle by them­ selves.", "5066": "The soldiers cried out aloud that they did not wish him to wait, but rather to contrive and so manage his operations that they might soonest come to a battle with their enemies.", "5067": "While he was performing a lustration of the army, as soon as he had sacrificed the first victim, the soothsayer said that within three days there would be a decisive battle with the enemy.", "5068": "Upon Caesar asking him, if he saw any favourable sign in the victims as to the result of the battle also, he replied, \" You can answer this better for yourself the gods indicate a great change and revolution of the actual state of things to a contrary state, so that if you think yourself prosperous in your present condition, expect the worst fortune;", "5069": "but if you do not, expect the better.\"", "5070": "As Cæsar was taking his round to inspect the watches the night before the battle about mid­ night, there was seen in the heavens a fiery torch, which seemed to pass over Cæsar's camp and assuming a bright and flamelike appearance to fall down upon the camp of Pompous.", "5071": "In the morning watch they perceived that there was also a panic confusion among the enemy.", "5072": "However, as Cæsar did not expect that the enemy would fight on that day, he began to break up his camp with the intention of marching to Scotussa.", "5073": "XLIV.", "5074": "The tents were already taken down when the scouts rode up to him with intelligence that the enemy were coming down to battle, whereupon Caesar was over­ joyed, and after praying to the gods he arranged his battle in three divisions.", "5075": "He placed Domitius Calvinus in command of the centre, Antonius had the left wing, and he commanded the right, intending to fight in the lenth legion.", "5076": "Observing that the cavalry of the enemy were posting themselves opposite to this wing and fearing their splendid appearance and their numbers, he ordered six cohorts to come round to him from the last line without being observed and he placed them in the rear of the right wing with orders what to do when the enemy's cavalry made their attack.", "5077": "Pompeius commanded his own right, and Domitius the left, and the centre was under Scipio, his father-in-law.", "5078": "But all the cavalry crowded to the left, intending to surround the right wing of the enemy and to make a complete rout of the men who were stationed about the general;", "5079": "for they believed that no legionary phalanx, however deep, could resist, but that their opponents would be completely crushed and broken to pieces by an attack of so many cavalry at once.", "5080": "When the signal for attack was going to be given on both sides, Pompeius ordered the legionary soldiers to stand with their spears presented and in close order to wait the attack of the enemy till they were within a spear'is throw.", "5081": "But Cæsar says that here also Pompeius made a mistake, not knowing that the first onset, accom­ panied with running and impetuosity, gives force to the blows, and at the same time fires the courage, which is thus fanned in every way.", "5082": "As Cæsar was about to move his phalanx and was going into action, the first centurion that he spied was a mail who was faithful to him and experienced in war, and was encouraging those under his command and urging them to vigorous exertion.", "5083": "Cæsar addressing him by name said, \"What hopes have we Caius Crassinius,* and how are our men as to courage ? \" Crassinius stretching out his right hand and calling out aloud, said, \" We shall have a splendid victory, Cæsar;", "5084": "and you shall praise me whether I survive the day or die.\"", "5085": "Saying this, he was the first to fall on the enemy at his full speed and carrying with him the hundred and twenty soldiers who were under his command.", "5086": "Having cut through the first rank, he was advancing with great slaughter of the enemy and was driving them from their ground,

being engaged in the struggle, the cavalry of Pompeius proudly advanced from the wing, extending their companies to enclose Cæsar's right;", "5089": "but before they fell upon the enemy, the cohorts sprang forward from among Cæsar's troops, not, according to the usual fashion of war, throwing their spears nor yet holding them in their hands and aiming at the thighs and legs of the enemy, but pushing them against their eyes and wound­ ing them in the face;", "5090": "and they had been instructed to do this by Cæsar, who was confident that men who had no great familiarity with battles or wounds, and were young and very proud of their beauty and youth, would dread such wounds and would not keep their ground both through fear of the present danger and the future dis­ figurement.", "5091": "And it turned out so;", "5092": "for they could not stand the spears being pushed up at them nor did they venture to look at the iron that was presented against their eyes, but they turned away and covered their faces to save them;", "5093": "and at last, having thus thrown themselves into confusion, they turned to flight most disgracefully and ruined the whole cause.", "5094": "For those who had defeated the cavalry, immediately surrounded the infantry and falling on them in the rear began to cut them down.", "5095": "But when Pompeius saw from the other wing the cavalry dispersed in flight, he was no longer the same, nor did he recollect that he was Pompeius Magnus, but more like a man who was deprived of his understanding by the god than anything else,.", "5096":

them.", "5097": "Then, as if he had recovered his senses and uttering only these words, as it is reported, \"What even to the ram­ parts !\" he put off his military and general's dress, and taking one

have gone out of office.\"", "5226": "Cæsar's great success did not divert his natural inclination for great deeds and his ambition to the enjoyment of that for which he had laboured, but serving as fuel and incentives to the future bred in him designs of greater things and love of new glory, as if he had used up what he had already acquired;", "5227": "and the passion was nothing else than emulation of himself as if he were another person, and a kind of rivalry between what he intended and what he had accomplished;", "5228": "and his pro­ positions and designs were to march against the Parthians,‡ and after subduing them and marching through Hyrkania and along the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus, and so encompassing the Euxine, to invade Scythia, and after having overrun the countries bordering on the Germans and Germany itself to return through Gaul to Italy, and so to complete his circle of the empire which would be bounded on all sides by the ocean.", "5229": "During this expedition he intended also to dig through the Corinthian Isthmus,* and he had already commissioned Anienus to superintend the work;", "5230": "and to receive the Tibert immediately below the city in a deep cut, and giving it a bend towards Circæum to make it enter the sea by Tarracina, with the view of giving security and facility to those who came to Rome for the purpose of trade :", "5231": "besides this he designed to draw off the water from the marshes about Pomentium and Setia,t and to make them solid ground, which would employ many thousands of men in the cultivation;", "5232": "and where the sea was nearest to Rome he designed to place barriers to it by means of moles, and after clearing away the hidden rocks and dangerous places on the shore of Ostia * to make harbours and naval stations which should give security to the extensive shipping.", "5233": "And all these things were in preparation.", "5234": "LIX.", "5235": "But the arrangement of the Kalendar t and the correction of the irregularity in the reckoning of time were handled by him skilfully, and being completed were of the most varied utility.", "5236": "For it was not only in very ancient times that the Romans had the periods of the moon in confusion with respect to the year, so that the feasts and festivals gradually changing at last fell out in opposite seasons of the year, but even with respect to the solar year at that time nobody kept any reckoning except the priests, who, as they alone knew the proper time, all of a sudden and when nobody expected it, would insert the intercalary month named Mercedonius, which King Numa is said to have been the first to intercalate, thereby devising a remedy, which was slight and would extend to no great period, for the irregularity in the recurrence of the times, as I have explained in the Life of Numa.", "5237": "But Caesar laying the problem before the ablest philo­ sophers and mathematicians, from the methods that were laid before him compounded a correction of his own which was more exact, which the Romans use to the present time, and are considered to be in less error than other nations as to the inequality.", "5238": "However, even this fur­ nished matter for complaint to those who envied him and disliked his power;", "5239": "for Cicero, the orator, as it is said, when some observed that Lyra would rise to-morrow, “Yes,” he replied, \"pursuant to the Edict,\" meaning that men admitted even this by compulsion.", "5240": "LX.", "5241": "But the most manifest and deadly hatred towards him was produced by his desire of kingly power, which to the many was the first, and to those who had long nourished a secret hatred of him the most specious, cause.", "5242": "And indeed those who were contriving this honour for Cæsar spread about a certain report among the people, that according to the Sibylline writings * it appeared that Parthia could be conquered by the Romans if they advanced against it with a king, but otherwise could not be assailed.", "5243": "And as Caesar was going down from Alba to the city, they ventured to salute him as King, but as the people showed their dissatisfaction, Cæsar was dis­ turbed and said that he was not called King but Cæsar;", "5244": "and as hereupon there was.", "5245": "a general silence, he passed along with no great cheerfulness nor good humour on his countenance.", "5246": "When some extravagant honours had been decreed to him in the Senate, it happened that he was sitting above the Rostra,t and when the consuls and prætors approached with all the Senate behind them, without rising from his seat, but just as if he were trans- acting business with private persons, he answered that the honours required rather to be contracted than enlarged.", "5247": "This annoyed not the Senate only, but the people also, who considered that the State was insulted in the persons of the Senate;", "5248": "and those who were not obliged to stay went away forthwith with countenance greatly downcast, so that Cæsar perceiving it forthwith went home, and as he threw his cloak from his shoulders he called out to his friends, that he was ready to offer his throat to anyone who wished to kill him;", "5249": "but afterwards he alleged his disease as an excuse for his behaviour, saying that persons who are so affected cannot usually keep their senses steady when they address a multitude standing, but that the senses being speedily convulsed and whirling about bring on giddiness and are overpowered.", "5250": "However, the fact was not so, for it is said that he was very desirous to rise up when the Senate came, but was checked by one of his friends, or rather one of his flatterers, Cornelius Balbus,‡ who said,“Will you not remember that you are Cæsar, and will you not allow yourself to be honoured as a superior?”LXI.", "5251": "There was added to these causes of offence the insult offered to the tribunes.", "5252": "It was the festival of the Lupercalia,* about which many writers say that it was originally a festival of the shepherds and had also some relationship to the Arcadian Lykæa.", "5253": "On this occasion many of the young nobles and magistrates run through the city without their toga, and for sport and to make laughter strike those whom they meet with strips of hide that have the hair on;", "5254": "many women of rank also purposely put themselves in the way and present their hands to be struck like children at school, being persuaded that this is favourable to easy parturition for those who are preg­ nant, and to conception for those who are barren.", "5255": "Cæsar was a spectator, being seated at the Rostra on a golden chair in a triumphal robe;", "5256": "and Antonius was one of those who ran in the sacred race, for he was consul.", "5257": "Accord­ ingly, when he entered the Forum and the crowd made way for him, he presented to Cæsar a diadem t which he carried surrounded with a crown of bay;", "5258": "and there was a clapping of hands, not loud, but slight, which had been already concerted.", "5259": "When Cæsar put away the diadem from him all the people clapped their hands, and when Antonius presented it again, only a few clapped;", "5260": "but when Cæsar declined to receive it, again all the people applauded.", "5261": "The experiment having thus failed, Cæsar rose and ordered the crown to be carried to the Capitol.", "5262": "But as Cæsar’s statues were seen crowned with royal diadems, two of the tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went up to them and pulled off the diadems, and having dis­ covered those who had been the first to salute Caesar as king they led them off to prison.", "5263": "The people followed clapping their hands and calling the tribunes Bruti, because it was Brutus who put down the kingly power and placed the sovereignty in the Senate and people instead of its being in the hands of one man.", "5264": "Cæsar being irritated at this deprived Flavius and Marullus of their office, and while rating them he also insulted the people by frequently calling the tribunes Bruti and Cumæi.", "5265": "*LXII.", "5266": "In this state of affairs the many turned to Marcus Brutus,t who on his father's side was considered to be a descendant of the ancient Brutus, and on his mother's side belonged to the Servilii, another distin­ guished house, and he was the son-in-law and nephew of Cato.", "5267": "The honours and favours which Brutus had received from Cæsar dulled him towards attempting of his own proper motion the overthrow of the monarchical power;", "5268": "for not only was his life saved at the battle of Pharsalus after the rout of Pompeius, and many of his friends also at his entreaty, but besides this he had great credit with Cæsar.", "5269": "He had also received among those who then held the praetorship t the chief office, and he was to be consul in the fourth year from that time, having been preferred to Cassius who was a rival candidate.", "5270": "For it is said that Caesar observed that Cassius urged better grounds of preference, but that he could not pass over Brutus.", "5271": "And on one occasion when some persons were calumniating Brutus to him, at a time when the con­ spiracy was really forming, he would not listen to them, but touching his body with his hand he said to the accusers, “Brutus waits * for this dry skin,\" by which he intended to signify that Brutus was worthy of the power for his merits, but for the sake of the power would not be un­ grateful and a villain.", "5272": "Now, those who were eager for the change and who looked up to him alone, or him as the chief person, did not venture to speak with him on the subject, but by night they used to fill the tribunal and the seat on which he sat when discharging his functions as prætor with writings, most of which were to this purport, “You are asleep, Brutus,\" and “You are not Brutus.\"", "5273": "By which Cassius,t perceiving that his ambition was somewhat stirred, urged him more than he had done before, and pricked him on ;", "5274": "and Cassius himself had also a private grudge against Cæsar for the reasons which I have mentioned in the Life of Brutus.", "5275": "Indeed Cæsar suspected Cassius, and he once said to his friends, “What think ye is Cassius aiming at ? for my part, I liko him not over much, for he is over pale.\"", "5276": "On the other hand it is said that when a rumour reached him, that Antonius and Dolabella were plotting, he said, “I am not much afraid of these well-fed, ‡ long-haired fellows, but I rather fear those others, the pale and thin,\" meaning Cassius and Brutus.▶", "5277": "LXIII.", "5278": "But it appears that destiny is not so much a thing that gives no warning as a thing that cannot be avoided, for they say that wondrous signs and appear­ ances presented themselves.", "5279": "Now, as to lights in the skies and sounds by night moving in various directions and solitary birds descending into the Forum, it is perhaps not worth while recording these with reference to so important an event:", "5280": "but Strabo * the Philosopher relates that many men all of fire were seen contending against one another, and that a soldier's slave emitted a great flame from his hand and appeared to the spectators to be burning, but when the flame went out, the man had sustained no harm;", "5281": "and while Cæsar himself was sacri­ ficing the heart of the victim could not be found, and this was considered a bad omen, for naturally an animal without a heart cannot exist.", "5282": "The following stories also are told by many;", "5283": "that a certain seer warned him to be on his guard against great danger on that day of the month of March, which the Romans call the Ides;", "5284": "t and when the day had arrived, as Caesar was going to the Senate-house, he saluted the seer and jeered him saying, \" Well, the Ides of March are come;", "5285": "\" but the seer mildly replied, “Yes, they are come, but they are not yet over.\"", "5286": "The day before, when Marcus Lepidus was entertaining him, he chanced to be signing some letters, according to his habit, while he was reclining at table;", "5287": "and the con­ versation having turned on what kind of death was the best, before any one could give an opinion he called out, \" That which is unexpected!”", "5288": "After this, while he was sleeping, as he was accustomed to do, by the side of his wife, all the doors and windows in the house flew open at once, and being startled by the noise and the brightness of the moon which was shining down upon him, he observed that Calpurnia‡ was in a deep slumber, but was uttering indistinct words and inarticulate groans in the midst of her sleep;", "5289": "and indeed she was dreaming that she held her murdered husband in her arms and was weeping over him.", "5290": "Others say this was not the vision that Calpurnia had, but the following:", "5291": "there was attached to Cæsar’s house by way of ornament and distinction pur­ suant to a vote of the Senate an acroterium,* as Livius says, and Calpurnia in her dream seeing this tumbling down lamented and wept.", "5292": "When day came accordingly she entreated Cæsar, if it were possible, not to go out, and to put off the meeting of the Senate;", "5293": "but if he paid no regard to her dreams, she urged him to inquire by other modes of divination and by sacrifices about the future.", "5294": "Cæsar also, as it seems, had some suspicion and fear;", "5295": "for he had never before detected in Calpurnia any womanish superstition, and now he saw that she was much disturbed.", "5296": "And when the seers also after sacrificing many victims reported to him that the omens were unfavourable, he determined to send Antonius to dismiss the Senate.", "5297": "LXIV.", "5298": "In the mean time Deoimus Brutus,t surnamed Albinus, who was in such favour with Cæsar that he was made in his will his second heir,.", "5299": "but was engaged in the conspiracy with the other Brutus and Cassius, being afraid that if Cæsar escaped that day, the affair might become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for giving cause for blame and censure to the Senate who would consider themselves insulted:", "5300": "he said, “That the Senate had met at his bidding and that they were all ready to pass a decree, that he should be proclaimed King of the provinces out of Italy and should wear a diadem whenever he visited the rest of the earth and sea;", "5301": "but if any one shall tell them when they are taking their seats, to be gone now and to come again, when Calpurnia shall have had better dreams, what may we not expect to be said by those who envy you ?", "5302": "or who will listen to your friends when they say that this is not slavery and tyranny;", "5303": "but if,\" he continued, \" you are fully resolved to consider the day inauspicious, it is better for you to go yourself and address the Senate and then to adjourn the business.\"", "5304": "As he said this, Brutus took Caesar by tho hand and began to lead him forth:", "5305": "and he had gone but a little way from the door, when a slave belonging to another person, who was eager to get at Cæsar but was prevented by the press and numbers about him, rushing into the house delivered himself up to Calpurnia and told her to keep him till Cæsar returned, for he had important things to communicate to him.", "5306": "LXV.", "5307": "Artemidorus,† a Knidian by birth, and a pro­ fessor of Greek philosophy, which had brought him into the familiarity of some of those who belonged to the party of Brutus, so that he knew the greater part of what was going on, came and brought in a small roll the informa­ tion which he intended to communicate;", "5308": "but observing that Cæsar gave each roll as he received it to the attend­ ants about him, he came very near, and said, \" This you alone should read, Cæsar, and read it soon;", "5309": "for it is about weighty matters which concern you.\"", "5310": "Accordingly Caesar received the roll, but he was prevented from read­ ing it by the number of people who came in his way, though he made several attempts, and he entered the Senate holding that roll in his hand and retaining that alone among all that had been presented to him.", "5311": "Some say that it was another person who gave him this roll, and that Artemidorus did not even approach him, but was kept from him all the way by the pressure of the crowd.", "5312": "LXVI.", "5313": "Now these things perchance may be brought about by mere spontaneity;", "5314": "but the spot that was the scene of that murder and struggle, wherein the Senate was then assembled, which contained the statue of Pom­ peius * and was a dedication by Pompeius and one of the ornaments that he added to his theatre, completely proved that it was the work of some daemon to guide and call the execution of the deed to that place.", "5315": "It is said also that Cassius t looked towards the statue of Pompeius before the deed was begun and silently invoked it, though he was not averse to the philosophy of Epikurus;", "5316": "but tho critical moment for the bold attempt which was now come probably produced in him enthusiasm and feeling in place of his former principles.", "5317": "Now Antonius,‡ who was faith­ ful to Cæsar and a robust man, was kept on the outside by Brutus Albinus, who purposely engaged him in a long conversation.", "5318": "When Caesar entered, the Senate rose to do him honour, and some of the party of Brutus stood around his chair at the back, and others presented themselves before him, a s if their purpose was to support the prayer of Tillius Cimber * on behalf of his exiled brother, and they all join ed in entreaty, following Cæsar as far as his seat.", "5319": "When he had taken his seat and was rejecting their entreaties, and, as they urged them still more strongly, began to show displeasure towards them individually, Tillius taking hold of his toga with both his hands pulled it downwards from the neck, which was the signal for the attack.", "5320": "Casca t was the first to strike him on the neck with his sword, a blow neither mortal nor severe, for as was natural at the beginning of so bold a deed he was confused, and Cæsar turning round seized the dagger and held it fast.", "5321": "And it happened that at the same moment he who was struck cried out in the Roman language, “You villain, Casca, what are you doing?\" and he who had given the blow cried out to his brother in Greek, “Brother, help.\"", "5322": "Such being the beginning, those who were not privy to the conspiracy were prevented by con­ sternation and horror at what was going on either from flying or going to aid, and they did not even venture to utter a word.", "5323": "And now each of the conspirators bared his sword, and Cæsar, being hemmed in all round, in whatever direction he turned meeting blows and swords aimed against his eyes and face, driven about like a wild beast, was caught in the hands of his enemies;", "5324": "for it was arranged that all of them should take a part in and tasto of the deed of blood.", "5325": "Accordingly Brutus t also gave him one blow in the groin.", "5326": "It is said by some authorities, that he defended himself against the rest, moving about his body hither and thither and calling out, till he saw that Brutus had drawn his sword, when he pulled his toga over his face and offered no further resistance, having been driven either by chance or by the conspirators to the base on which the statue of Pompeius stood.", "5327": "And the base was drenched with blood, as if Pompeius was directing the vengeance upon his enemy who was stretched beneath his feet and writhing under his many wounds;", "5328": "for he is said to have received three and twenty wounds.", "5329": "Many of the conspirators were wounded by one another, while they were aiming so many blows against one body.", "5330": "LXVII.", "5331": "After Cæsar was killed, though Brutus came forward as if he was going to say something about the deed, the Senators,* without waiting to listen, rushed through the door and making their escape filled the people with confusion and indescribable alarm, so that some closed their houses, and others left their tables and places of business, and while some ran to the place to see what had happened, others who had seen it ran away.", "5332": "But Antonius and Lepidus,t who were the chief friends of Cæsar, stole away and fled for refuge to the houses of other persons.", "5333": "The partizans of Brutus, just as they were, warm from the slaughter, and showing their bare swords, advanced all in a body from the Senate-house to the Capitol, not like men who were flying, but exultant and confident, calling the people to liberty and joined by the nobles who met them.", "5334": "Some even went up to the Capitol with them and mingled with them as if they had partici­ pated in the deed, and claimed the credit of it, among whom were Caius Octavius and Lentulus Spinther.*", "5335": "But they afterwards paid the penalty of their vanity, for they were put to death by Antonius and the young Cæsar, without having enjoyed even the reputation of that for which they lost their lives, for nobody believed that they had a share in the deed.", "5336": "For neither did those who put them to death, punish them for what they did, but for what they wished to do.", "5337": "On the next day Brutus came down and addressed the people, who listened without ex­ pressing disapprobation or approbation of what had been done, but they indicated by their deep silence that they pitied Cæsar and respected Brutus.", "5338": "The Senate, with the view of making an amnesty and conciliating all parties, decreed that Cæsar should be honoured as a god and that not the smallest thing should be disturbed which he had settled while he was in power;", "5339": "and they distributed among the partisans of Brutus provinces and suitable honours, so that all people supposed that affairs were quieted and had been settled in the best way.", "5340": "LXVIII.", "5341": "But when the will- of Cæsar was opened and it was discovered that he had given to every Roman a handsome present, and they saw the body, as it was carried through the Forum, disfigured with the wounds, the multitude, no longer kept within the bounds of pro­ priety and order, but heaping about the corpse benches, lattices and tables taken from the Forum, they set fire to it on the spot and burnt it;", "5342": "then taking the flaming pieces of wood they ran to the houses of the conspirators to fire them, and others ran about the city in all directions seeking for the men to seize and tear them in pieces.", "5343": "But none of the conspirators came in their way, and they were all well protected.", "5344": "One Cinna,t however, a friend of Cæsar, hap­ pened, as it is said, to have had a strange dream the night before;", "5345": "for he dreamed that he was invited by Cæsar to sup with him, and when he excused himself, he was dragged along by Cæsar by the hand, against his will and making re­ sistance the while.", "5346": "Now, when he heard that the body of Cæsar was burning in the Forum, he got up and went there out of respect, though he was somewhat alarmed at his dream and had a fever on him.", "5347": "One of the multitude who saw Cinna told his name to another who was inquiring of him, and he again told it to a third, and immediately it spread through the crowd that this man was one of those who had killed Cæsar;", "5348": "and indeed there was one of the conspirators who was named Cinna:", "5349": "and taking this man to be him the people forthwith rushed upon him and tore him in pieces on the spot.", "5350": "It was principally through alarm at this that the partisans of Brutus and Cassius after a few days left the city.", "5351": "But what they did and suffered before they died is told in the Life of Brutus.", "5352": "*LXIX.", "5353": "At the time of his death Cæsar was full fifty-six years old, having survived Pompeius not much more than four years, and of the power and dominion which all through his life he pursued at so great risk and barely got at last, having reaped the fruit in name only, and with the glory of it the odium of the citizens.", "5354": "Yet his great daemon,t which accompanied him through life, followed him even when he was dead, the avenger of his murder, through every land and sea hunting and tracking out his murderers till not one of them was left, and pursuing even those who in any way whatever had either put their hand to the deed or been participators in the plot.", "5355": "Among human events the strangest was that which befell Cassius, for after his defeat at Philippi he killed himself with the same dagger that he had employed against Cæsar;", "5356": "and among signs from heaven, there was the great comet, which appeared conspicuous for seven nights after Cæsar’s assassination and then disappeared, and the obscuration of the splendour of the sun.", "5357": "For during all that year the circle of the sun rose pale and without rays, and the warmth that came down from it was weak and feeble, so that the air as it moved was dark and heavy owing to the feebleness of the warmth which penetrated it, and the fruits withered and fell off when they were half ripened and imperfect on account of the coldness of the at­ mosphere.", "5358": "But chief of all, the phantom that appeared to Brutus showed that Cæsar’s murder was not pleasing to the gods;", "5359": "and it was after this manner.", "5360": "When Brutus was going to take his army over from Abydus* to the other continent, he was lying down by night, as his wont was, in his tent, not asleep, but thinking about the future;", "5361": "for it is said that Brutus of all generals was least given to sleep, and had naturally the power of keeping awake longer than any other person.", "5362": "Thinking that he heard a noise near the door, he looked towards the light of the lamp which was already sinking down, and saw a frightful vision of a man of unusual size and savage coun­ tenance.", "5363": "At first he was startled, but observing that the figure neither moved nor spoke, but was standing silent by the bed, he asked him who he was.", "5364": "The phantom replied,\" Thy bad daemon, Brutus;", "5365": "and thou shalt see me at Philippic Upon which Brutus boldly replied, “ I shall see;", "5366": "\" and the daemon immediately disappeared.", "5367": "In course of time having engaged with Antonius and Cæsar at Philippi, in the first battle he was victorious, and after routing that part of the army which was opposed to him he followed up his success and plundered Caesaris camp.", "5368": "As he was preparing to fight the second battle, the same phantom appeared again by night, without speaking to him, but Brutus, who perceived what his fate was, threw himself headlong into the midst of the danger.", "5369": "How­ ever he did not fall in the battle, but when the rout took place, he fled to a precipitous spot, and throwing himself with his breast on his bare sword, a friend also, as it is said, giving strength to the blow, he died.**", "5370": "It has been already remarked that Niebuhr is of opinion that the introduction to the Life of Cæsar is lost.", "5371": "This opinion will not appear well founded to those who have got a right conception of the dramatic form in which Plutarch has cast most of his Lives, and more particularly this of Cæsar.", "5372": "He begins by representing him as re­ sisting the tyrant Sulla when others yielded, and then making his way through a long series of events to the supreme power, which he had no sooner attained than he lost it.", "5373": "But his fortune survived him, and the faithless men, his murderers,

which he was led by the instigation of others, only renders the Monarchy inevitable and necessary.", "5412": "But if the play is faulty in construction, as I venture to think it is, it has other merits of the highest order, which place it in some respects among the best works of the great master of dramatic art.", "5413": "THE orator Demades, who became one of the chief men in Athens by his subservience to the Macedonians and Anti­ pater, and who was forced to say and to write much that was derogatory to the glory and contrary to the tradi­ tional policy of Athens, used to excuse himself by pleading that he did not come to the helm before the vessel of the State was an utter wreck.", "5414": "This expression, which seems a bold one when used by Demades, might with great truth have been applied to the policy of Phokion.", "5415": "Indeed De­ mades himself wrecked Athens by his licentious life and policy, and when he was an old man Antipater said of him that he was like a victim which has been cut up for sacrifice, for there was nothing left of him but his tongue and his paunch;", "5416": "while the true virtue of Phokion was obscured by the evil days for Greece during which he lived, which prevented his obtaining the distinction which he deserved.", "5417": "We must not believe Sophokles, when he says that virtue is feeble and dies out in mens “", "5418": "Why, not the very mind that's born with man, When he's unfortunate, remains the same.", "5419": "\"Yet we must admit that fortune has so much power even over good men, that it has sometimes withheld from them their due meed of esteem and praise, has sullied their reputations with unworthy calumnies, and made it difficult for the world to believe in their virtue.", "5420": "II.", "5421": "It would seem that democracies, when elated by success, are especially prone to break out into wanton maltreatment of their greatest men;", "5422": "and this is also true in the opposite case:", "5423": "for misfortunes render popular assemblies harsh, irritable, and uncertain in temper, so that it becomes a dangerous matter to address them, be­ cause they take offence at any speaker who gives them wholesome counsel.", "5424": "When he blames them for their mis­ takes, they think that he is reproaching them with their misfortunes, and when he speaks his mind freely about their condition, they imagine that he is insulting them.", "5425": "Just as honey irritates wounds and sores, so does true and sensible advice exasperate the unfortunate, if it be not of a gentle and soothing nature:", "5426": "exactly as the poet calls sweet things agreeable, because they agree with the taste, and do not oppose or fight against it.", "5427": "An inflamed eye prefers the shade, and shuns strong lights:", "5428": "and a city, when involved in misfortunes, becomes timid and weak through its inability to endure plain speaking at a time when it especially needs it, as otherwise its mistakes cannot be repaired.", "5429": "For this reason the position of a statesman in a democracy must always be full of peril;", "5430": "for if he tries merely to please the people he will share their ruin.", "5431": "while if he thwarts them he will be destroyed by them.", "5432": "Astronomers teach us that the sun does not move in exactly the same course as the stars, and yet not in one which is opposed to them, but by revolving in an inclined and oblique orbit performs an easy and excellent circuit through them all, by which means everything is kept in its place, and its elements combined in the most admir­ able manner.", "5433": "So too in political matters, the man who takes too high a tone, and opposes the popular will in all cases, must be thought harsh and morose, while on the other hand he who always follows the people and shares in all their mistakes pursues a dangerous and ruinous policy.", "5434": "The art of government by which states are made great consists in sometimes making concessions to the people, and gratifying them when they are obedient to authority, and at the same time insisting upon salutary measures.", "5435": "Men willingly obey and support such a ruler if he does not act in a harsh and tyrannical fashion:", "5436": "but he has a very difficult and laborious part to play, and it is hard for him to combine the sternness of a sovereign with the gentleness of a popular leader, If, however, he succeed in combining these qualities, they produce the truest and noblest harmony, like that by which God is said to regulate the universe, as everything is brought about by gentle persuasion, and not by violence.", "5437": "In.", "5438": "All this was exemplified in the case of the younger Cato:", "5439": "for he had not the art of persuasion and was un­ acceptable to the people, nor did he rise to eminence by the popular favour, but Cicero * says that he lost his con­ sulship because he acted as if he were living in the Republic of Plato, and not in the dregs of Romulus.", "5440": "Such men seem to me to resemble fruits which grow out of season:", "5441": "for men gaze upon them with wonder, but do not eat them:", "5442": "and the stern antique virtue of Cato, displayed as it was in a corrupt and dissolute age, long after the season for it had gone by, gained him great glory and renown, but proved totally useless, as it was of too exalted a type to suit the political exigencies of the day.", "5443": "When Cato began his career, his country was not already ruined, as was that of Phokion.", "5444": "The ship of the state was indeed labouring heavily in the storm, but Cato, although he was not permitted to take the helm and guide the vessel, exerted himself so manfully, and gave so much assistance to those who were more powerful than himself, that he all but triumphed over fortune.", "5445": "The constitution was, no doubt, finally overthrown;", "5446": "but its ruin was due to others, and only took place after a long and severe struggle, during which Cato very nearly succeeded in saving it.", "5447": "I have chosen Phokion to compare with him, not because of the general resemblance of their characters as good and statesmanlike men, for a man may possess the same quality in various forms, as, for example, the courage of Alkibiades was of a different kind to that of Epameinondas;", "5448": "the ability of Themistokles was different to that of Aristeides;", "5449": "and the justice of Numa Pompilius was different to that of Agesilaus.", "5450": "But in the case of Phokion and Cato, their virtues bore the same stamp, form, and ethical complexion down to the most minute particulars.", "5451": "Both alike possessed the same mixture of kindness and severity, of caution and daring:", "5452": "both alike cared for the safety of others and neglected their own:", "5453": "both alike shrank from baseness, and were zealous for the right;", "5454": "so that one would have to use a very nice discrimination to discover the points of difference between their respective dispositions.", "5455": "IV.", "5456": "Cato is admitted by all writers to have been a man of noble descent, as will be explained in his life:", "5457": "and I imagine that the family of Phokion was not altogether mean and contemptible.", "5458": "If his father had really been a pestle maker, as we are told by Idomeneus, we may be sure that Glaukippus, the son of Hypereides, who collected and flung at him such a mass of abuse, would not have omitted to mention his low birth, nor would he have been so well brought up as to have been a scholar of Plato while a lad, and afterwards to have studied under Xeno­ krates in the Academy;", "5459": "while from his youth up he always took an interest in liberal branches of learning.", "5460": "We are told by the historian Douris that scarcely any Athenian ever saw Phokion laughing or weeping, or bath­ ing in the public baths, or with his hand outside of his cloak, when he wore one.", "5461": "Indeed when he was in the country or on a campaign he always went barefooted and wore only his tunic, unless the cold was excessively severe;", "5462": "so that the soldiers used to say in jest that it was a sign of wintry weather to see Phokion wearing his cloak.", "5463": "V.", "5464": "Though one of the kindest and most affable of men, he was of a forbidding and severe countenance, so that men who did not know him well feared to address him when alone.", "5465": "Once when Chares in a speech mentioned Phokion's gloomy brow, the Athenians began to laugh. “ Yet,\" said he, “ his brow has never harmed you:", "5466": "but the laughter of these men has brought great sorrow upon the state.\"", "5467": "In like manner also the oratory of Phokion was most valuable, as it incited his countrymen to win brilliant successes, and to form lofty aspirations.", "5468": "He spoke in a brief, harsh, commanding style, without any attempt to flatter or please his audience.", "5469": "Just as Zeno says that a philosopher ought to steep his words in mean­ ing, so Phokion's speeches conveyed the greatest possible amount of meaning in the smallest compass.", "5470": "It is pro­ bably in allusion to this that Polyeuktus* of Sphettus said that Demosthenes was the best orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful speaker.", "5471": "As the smallest coins are those which have the greatest intrinsic value, so Phokion in his speeches seemed to say much with few words.", "5472": "We are told that once while the people were flocking into the theatre Phokion was walking up and down near the stage, plunged in thought.", "5473": "“ You seem meditative, Phokion,\" said one of his friends. “ Yes, by Zeus,\" answered he, “I am considering whether I can shorten the speech which I am going to make to the Athenians.\"", "5474": "Demosthenes himself, who despised the other orators, when Phokion rose used to whisper to his friends, “ Here comes the cleaver of my harangues.\"", "5475": "Much of his influence, however, must be ascribed to his personal character;", "5476": "since a word or a gesture of a truly good man carries more weight than ten thousand eloquently argued speeches.", "5477": "VI.", "5478": "While yet a youth Phokion especially attached himself to the general Chabrias, and followed him in his campaigns, in which he gained considerable military experience, and in some instances was able to correct the strange inequalities of his commander's temperament.", "5479": "Chabrias, usually sluggish and hard to rouse, when in action became vehemently excited, and tried to outdo the boldest of his followers in acts of daring:", "5480": "indeed he lost his life at Chios by being the first to run his ship on shore and to try to effect a landing in the face of the enemy.", "5481": "Phokion, who was a man of action, and cautious neverthe­ less, proved most useful in stirring up Chabrias when sluggish, and again in moderating his eagerness when roused.", "5482": "In consequence of this, Chabrias, who was of a kindly and noble disposition, loved Phokion and promoted him to many responsible posts, so that his name became well known throughout Greece, as Chabrias entrusted him with the management of the most important military operations.", "5483": "At the battle of Naxos he enabled Phokion to win great glory, by placing him in command of the left wing, where the most important struggle took place, and where the victory was finally decided, As this was the first sea fight, since the capture and ruin of Athens, which the Athenians won by themselves, without allies, over other Greeks, they were greatly pleased with Chabrias, and Phokion was henceforth spoken of as a man of military genius.", "5484": "The battle was won during the per­ formance of the Great Mysteries at Eleusis;", "5485": "and every year afterwards, on the sixteenth day of the month Böedromion, Chabrias used to entertain the Athenians, and offer libations of wine to the gods.", "5486": "VII.", "5487": "After this Chabrias sent Phokion to visit the islands and exact tribute from them, giving him an escort of twenty ships of war:", "5488": "upon which Phokion is said to have remarked, that if he was sent to fight the islanders, he should require a larger force, but that if he was going to the allies of Athens, one ship would suffice for him.", "5489": "He sailed in his own trireme, visited all the states, simply and unassumingly explained the objects of his mission to their leading men, and returned home with a large fleet, which the allies despatched to convey their tribute safe to Athens.", "5490": "He not only esteemed and looked up to Chabrias while he lived, but after his death he took care of his family, and endeavoured to make a good man of his son Ktesippus;", "5491": "and though he found this youth stupid and unmanage­ able, he never ceased his efforts to amend his character and to conceal his faults.", "5492": "Once only we are told that when on some campaign the young man was tormenting him with unreasonable questions, and offering him advice as though he were appointed assistant-general, Phokion exclaimed, \"0 Chabrias, Chabrias, I do indeed prove myself grateful for your friendship for me, by enduring this from your son!”", "5493": "Observing that the public men of the day had, as if by lot, divided the duties of the war-office and of the public assembly amongst themselves, so that Eubulus, Aristophon, Demosthenes, Lykurgus, and Hype­ reides did nothing except make speeches to the people and bring forward bills, while Diopeithes, Menestheus, Leosthenes, and Chares rose entirely by acting as generals and by making war, Phokion wished to restore the era of Perikles, Aristeides, and Solon, statesmen who were able to manage both of these branches of the administra­ tion with equal success.", "5494": "Each one of those great men seemed to him, in the words of Archilochus, to have been It A man, who served the grisly god of arms, Yet well could comprehend the Muses’a charms.", "5495": "\"The tutelary goddess of Athens herself, he remarked, presided equally over war and over domestic administra­ tion, and was worshipped under both attributes.", "5496": "VIII.", "5497": "With this object in view Phokion invariably used his political influence in favour of peace, but never­ theless was elected general * more times not only than any of his contemporaries, but also than any of his prede­ cessors :", "5498": "yet he never canvassed his countrymen or made any effort to obtain the office, though he did not refuse to fill it at his country's bidding.", "5499": "All historians admit that he was elected general five-and-forty times, and never once missed being elected, since even when he was absent the Athenians used to send for him to come home and be elected;", "5500": "so that his enemies used to wonder that Phokion, who always thwarted the Athenians and never flattered them either by word or deed, should be favoured by them, and were wont to say that the Athenians in their hours of relaxation used to amuse themselves by listening to the speeches of their more lively and brilliant orators, just as royal personages are said to amuse themselves with their favourites after dinner, but that they made their appointments to public offices in a sober and earnest spirit, choosing for that purpose the most severe and sensible man in Athens, and the one too, who alone, or at any rate more than any one else, was in the habit of opposing their impulses and wishes.", "5501": "When an oracle was brought from Delphi and read before the assembly, which said that when all the Athenians were of one mind, one man would be opposed to the state, Phokion rose and said that he was the man in question, for he disap­ proved of the whole of their policy.", "5502": "And once when he made some remark in a speech which was vociferously applauded, and he saw the whole assembly unanimous in its approval of his words, he turned to some of his friends and said, “ Have I inadvertently said something bad?", "5503": "IX.", "5504": "Once when the Athenians were asking for sub­ scriptions for some festival, and all the others had paid their subscriptions, Phokion, after he had been frequently asked to subscribe, answered, “Ask these rich men:", "5505": "for my part I should be ashamed of myself if I were to give money to you, and not pay what I owe to this man here,\" pointing to Kallikles the money-lender.", "5506": "As the people did not cease shouting and abusing him, he told them a fable:", "5507": "“ A cowardly man went to the wars, and when he heard the cawing of the crows, he laid down his arms and sat still.", "5508": "Then he took up his arms and marched on on, and they again began to caw, so he halted again.", "5509": "At last he said, ‘ You may caw as loud as you please, but you shall never make a meal of me.'", "5510": "\"", "5511": "On another occasion when the Athenians wished to send him to meet the enemy, and when he refused, called him a coward, ho said, “ You are not able to make me brave, nor am I able to make you cowards.", "5512": "However, we understand one another.\"", "5513": "At some dangerous crisis the people were greatly enraged wjth him, and demanded an account of his conduct as general.", "5514": "“ I hope,\" said he, “ my good friends, that you will save yourselves first.\"", "5515": "As the Athenians, when at war, were humble-spirited, and full of fears, but after peace was made became bold, and re­ proached Phokion for having lost them their chance of victory, he said, You are fortunate in having a general who understands you;", "5516": "for if you had not, you would long ago have been ruined.\"", "5517": "When the Athenians wished to decide some dispute about territory by arms instead of by arbitration, Phokion advised them to fight the Bœotians with words, in which they were superior, not with arms, in which they were inferior to them.", "5518": "Once when they would not attend to his words, or listen to him, he said, “ You are able to force me to do what I do not wish, but you shall never force me to counsel what I do not approve.\"", "5519": "When Demosthenes, one of the orators of the opposite party, said to him, “ Phokion, the Athenians will kill you, if they lose their senses.\"", "5520": "He answered, “ Yes, but they will kill you, if they regain them.\"", "5521": "When he saw Poly euktus of Sphettus in a great heat urging the Athenians to go to war with Philip, panting and sweating pro­ fusely, as he was a very fat man, and drinking great draughts of water, he said, “ Ought you to believe what this man says, and vote for war ?",

There was one Archibiades, who was surnamed the Laconizer, who grew a great beard, wore a Spartan cloak, and affected a stern demeanour like a Spartan.", "5524": "Once when Phokion was being violently attacked in the assembly he called upon this man to bear witness to the truth of what he said, and to assist him.", "5525": "Archibiades now rose and said what he thought would please the Athenians,

people to action, came to be enrolled on the list for active service leaning on a stick, with his legs bandaged, Phokion, catching sight of him from the tribune where he stood, called out..", "5526":

their anger, or their ambition.", "5532": "Phokion never harmed any Athenian because he disliked him, and never accounted any man his enemy, but merely showed himself stern and inexorable to those who opposed his efforts to save his country, while in the rest of his life he was so kind and amiable to all men, that he often helped his opponents, and came to the aid of his political antagonists when they were in difficulties.", "5533": "Once when his friends reproached him for having inter­ ceded in court for some worthless man who was being tried, he answered that good men do not need any inter­

character, was so happy in his remarks that he entirely appeased his anger, and even led him to say that the Athenians must watch the progress of events with care, since, if anything were to happen to him, it would be their duty to take the lead in Greece.", "5614": "Alexander singled out Phokion in a special manner as his guest and friend, and treated him with a degree of respect which he showed to few even of his own companions.", "5615": "The historian Douris tells us in con­ firmation of this that after Alexander had conquered Darius, and had become a great man, he omitted the usual words

treasure followed him into his house, and saw its frugal arrangements, and his wife making bread, while Phokion with his own hands drew water from the well and washed their feet, they pressed the money upon him yet more earnestly, and expressed their disappointment at his refusal, saying that it was a shameful thing for a friend of King Alexander to live so poorly.", "5622": "Phokion, seeing a poor old man walk by clad in a ragged cloak, asked them whether they thought him to be a worse man than that.", "5623": "They begged him not to say such things, but he answered. \"", "5624": "And yet

exiled citizens returned, and when the informers and mob orators again occupied the bema.", "5781": "As the Athenians were excited at this intelli­ gence, Nikanor desired to discuss the matter with them, and appeared at a conference held in Peiraeus, having received from Phokion a pledge for his personal safety.", "5782": "Derkyllus, the local commander, tried to seize him, but Nikanor escaped, and at once began to take measures for the defence of Peiraeus against the Athenians.", "5783": "Phokion, when blamed for having permitted Nikanor to escape, answered that he felt confidence in Nikanor, and did not expect that he would do any harm;", "5784": "and even if he did, he preferred suffering wrong to doing it.", "5785": "This was no doubt a most magnanimous sentiment;", "5786": "but when a man on such grounds risks the freedom of his country, especi­ ally when he is acting as general, I am inclined to think that he breaks an older and more important law, that, namely, of his duty to his fellow-citizens.", "5787": "We cannot argue that Phokion refrained from seizing Nikanor because he feared to involve his country in war, and it was absurd of him to plead that good faith and justice demanded that Nikanor should be left alone, on the understanding that he would feel bound to abstain from any acts of violence.", "5788": "The real truth seems to have been that Phokion had a firm belief in Nikanor's honesty, since he refused to believe those who told him that Nikanor was plotting the capture of Peiræus, and had sent Macedonian soldiers into Salamis, and had even corrupted some of the inhabitants in Peiraeus itself.", "5789": "Even when Philomelus of Lamptra moved a resolution that all Athenians should get under arms and be ready to follow their general Phokion, he refused to act, until Nikanor marched his troops out of Munychia and fortified Peiraeus with a trench and palisade.", "5790": "XXXIII.", "5791": "When this took place Phokion, who was now quite willing, to lead the Athenians to attack Nikanor, was insulted and treated with contempt;", "5792": "and now Alexander the son of Polysperchon arrived with a military force, nominally with the intention of assisting the citizens against Nikanor, but really meaning if possible to make himself master of the city while it was divided against itself.", "5793": "The exiled Athenians who accom­ panied him at once entered the city, and as the disfran­ chised inhabitants joined them, a disorderly and informal assembly was held, in which Phokion was removed from his office, and other men were appointed generals.", "5794": "Had it not been that Alexander and Nikanor were observed to hold frequent conferences together alone outside the walls, the city could not have been saved.", "5795": "Hagnonides the informer now at once began to accuse Phokion and his party of treason ;", "5796": "upon which Charikles and Kalli­ medon left the city in terror, while Phokion and those of his friends who stood by him proceeded to Polysperchon himself.", "5797": "They were accompanied, out of regard for Phokion, by Solon of Platæa and Deinarchus of Corinth, who were thought to be intimate friends of Polysperchon.", "5798": "As Deinarchus was sick, they waited for some days at Elatea, and in the meantime, at the instigation of Hagno­ nides, although Arohestratus brought forward the motion for it in the assembly, the Athenians sent an embassy to the court of Macedonia to accuse Phokion of treason.", "5799": "Both met Polysperchon at the same time, as he with the king * was passing through a village of Phokis named Pharyges, which lies at the foot of the Akrousian mountain, now called Galate.", "5800": "Here Polysperchon set up the throne with the gilt ceiling, under which he placed the king and his friends.", "5801": "He ordered Deinarchus at once to be seized, tortured, and put to death, but he allowed the Athenians to plead their cause before him.", "5802": "They however made a great disturbance by contradicting and abusing one another, so that Hagnonides said, “ Pack us all into one cage and send us back to Athens to be tried.\"", "5803": "At this the king laughed, but the Macedonians and others who were present wished to hear what each side had to say, and bade the two embassies state their case.", "5804": "They were not, however, fairly treated, for Polysperchon several times interrupted Phokion during his speech, until at last he struck the ground with his staff in a rage and held his peace.", "5805": "When Hegemon t too said that Polysperchon himself knew him to be a friend to the people of Athens, Polysper­ chon angrily exclaimed “", "5806": "Do not slander me to the king.\"", "5807": "At this the king himself leaped to his feet, and would have struck Hegemon with a spear, but was quickly seized by Polysperchon, upon which the court broke up.", "5808": "XXXIV.", "5809": "Phokion and his companions were now taken into custody :", "5810": "upon which such of his friends as saw this from a distance covered their faces with their cloaks and made their escape.", "5811": "Kleitus conducted the prisoners back to Athens, nominally to be tried there, but really already under sentence of death.", "5812": "The procession was a sad one, as they were brought in carts through the Kerameikus to the theatre, where Kleitus kept them until the archons had convened the assembly.", "5813": "From this assembly neither slaves, foreigners, nor disfranchised citizens were excluded, but every one, men and women alike, were allowed to be present and to address the people.", "5814": "After the king's letter was read, in which he said that he was con­ vinced that these men were traitors, but sent them to Athens for trial because that city was free and independent, Kleitus brought in the prisoners.", "5815": "At the sight of Phokion the better class of citizens covered their faces and silently wept, and one of them had the courage to rise and say that, as the king had allowed the Athenian people to conduct so important a trial, all slaves and foreigners ought to leave the assembly.", "5816": "The populace, however, would not hear of this, but cried, “ Down with the oligarchs who hate the people.”", "5817": "As no other friend of Phokion dared to speak, he himself, after obtaining a hearing with difficulty, asked “", "5818": "Do you wish to condemn us to death justly or unjustly ? \"", "5819": "As some answered “ justly,\" he said, “ How can you be sure of this, if you will not hear us ? \"", "5820": "As however the people paid no more attention to him, he came nearer to them and said, “ For my own part, I admit that I have done wrong, and I consider that my political acts deserve to be punished with death ;", "5821": "but, men of Athens, why will you kill these others, who have done no wrong ? \"", "5822": "When many voices answered, “ Because they are your friends,\" Phokion retired and held his peace.", "5823": "Hagnonides now read the motion which he was about to put to the meeting which called upon the people to decide by a show of hands whether the men were guilty or not;", "5824": "and in case they were found guilty, to put them to death.", "5825": "XXXV.", "5826": "When this decree was read some wished to add to it that they should be put to death with torture, and bade Hagnonides send for the rack and the executioners;", "5827": "but Hagnonides, seeing that even the Macedonian Kleitus was disgusted at this proposal, and thought it a savage and wicked action, said, “ Men of Athens, when we catch the villain Kallimedon, we will put him to the torture;", "5828": "but I will make no such proposal in the case of Phokion.\"", "5829": "Upon this one of the better class cried out, “ And quite right too;", "5830": "for if we torture Phokion, what shall we do to you ?\"", "5831": "When the decree was passed by show of hands, no one sat still, but the whole people, many of them wearing garlands of flowers, rose and voted for the death of the accused.", "5832": "These, besides Phokion, consisted of Nikokles, Thodippus, Hegemon, and Pythokles:", "5833": "while sentence of death in their absence was passed against Demetrius Phalereus, Kallimedon, Charikles, and some others.", "5834": "XXXVI.", "5835": "When after the assembly broke up the con­ demned men were being taken to prison, the others threw themselves into the arms of their friends and relations, and walked along with tears and lamentations ;", "5836": "but when they saw that the countenance of Phokion was as calm as when he used as general to be conducted in state out of the assembly, they wondered at his composure and great­ ness of soul.", "5837": "His enemies accompanied him and abused him, and one even came up to him and spat in his face.", "5838": "At this outrage it is said that Phokion looked towards the archons, and said, “ Will no one make this fellow behave himself?\"", "5839": "As Thodippus in prison, when he saw the hemlock being prepared, bewailed his fate, and said that he did not deserve to perish with Phokion, Phokion said, \" Are you not satisfied then to die in Phokion's company ? \"", "5840": "When one of his friends asked him if he had any message for his son Phokus, he answered, \" Yes, tell him not to bear any malice against the Athenians.\"", "5841": "When Nikokles, the most trusty of his friends, begged to be allowed to drink the poison before him, he answered, \" Your request is one which it grieves me to grant;", "5842": "but, as I have never refused you anything in your life, I agree even to this.\"", "5843": "When all his friends had drunk, the poison ran short, and the executioner refused to prepare any more unless he were paid twelve drachmas, the price of that weight of hemlock.", "5844": "After a long delay, Phokion called one of his friends to him, and, saying that it was hard if a man could not even die gratis at Athens, bade him give the man the money he wanted.", "5845": "XXXVII.", "5846": "The day of Phokion's death was the nine­ teenth of the month Munychion,* and the knights rode past the prison in solemn procession to the temple of Zeus.", "5847": "Some of them took off their garlands from their heads, while others came in tears to the gates of the prison and looked in.", "5848": "All whose better feelings were not utterly overpowered by passion and hatred agreed in thinking it a very indecent proceeding not to have waited one day for the execution, and so to have avoided the pollution of the festival by the death of the prisoners.", "5849": "Moreover, the enemies of Phokion, as if they had not even yet satisfied their spite, passed a decree excluding his body from burial, and forbidding any Athenian to furnish fire to burn it.", "5850": "In consequence of this, no one of his friends dared to touch the body, but one Konopion, a man who was accustomed to deal with such cases for hire, conveyed the body beyond Eleusis, obtained fire from Megara over the Attic frontier, and burned it.", "5851": "Phokion's wife, who was present with her maids, raised an empty tomb - on the spot, placed the bones in her bosom, and carried them by night into her own house, where she buried them beside the hearth, saying, “ To thee, dear hearth, I entrust these remains of a good man;", "5852": "do you restore them to his fathers' tomb when the Athenians recover their senses.", "5853": "\"XXXVIII.", "5854": "After a short time, however, when circum­ stances had taught them what a protector and guardian of virtue they had lost, the Athenians set up a brazen statue of Phokion, and gave his remains a public burial.", "5855": "They themselves condemned and executed Hagnonides, while Phokion's son followed Epikurus and Demophilus, who fled the country, discovered their place of refuge, and avenged himself upon them.", "5856": "He is said to have been far from respectable in character;", "5857": "and once, when attached to a common prostitute, who was the slave of a brothel­ keeper, he happened to attend one of the lectures of Theo­ dorus, who was surnamed “ the atheist,\" in the Lyceum.", "5858": "As he heard him say that if it be noble to ransom one's male friends from captivity, it must be equally so to ransom one's female friends;", "5859": "and that, if it be right for a man to set free the man whom he loves, it must be his duty to do likewise to the woman whom he loves,\" he determined to use this argument for the gratification of his own passion, and to conclude that the philosopher bade him purchase the freedom of his mistress.", "5860": "The treatment of Phokion reminded the Greeks of that of Sokrates, as both the crime and the misfortune of the city in both cases was almost exactly the same.", "5861": "CATO'S family derived the origin of its splendour and reputation from his great-grandfather * Cato, a man who had reputation and power chief among the Romans by reason of his merit, as it has been written in his Life.", "5862": "Cato was left an orphan with his brother Cæpio and a sister Porcia.", "5863": "Servilia also was a sister of Cato by the same mother.", "5864": "All of them were brought up and lived with Livius Drusus,t their mother's uncle, who was then the chief political leader;", "5865": "for he was a most powerful speaker, and also a man of the best regulated habits, and in lofty bearing inferior to no Roman.", "5866": "It is said that Cato from his childhood both in his voice and the expres­ sion of his countenance and even in his amusements gave indication of a character immovable and impassive and firm in everything.", "5867": "His purposes displayed a strength", "5868": "In accomplishing his ends which was above his age:", "5869": "and while he was rough and stubborn towards those who attempted to flatter him, still more did he show his mastery over all who would try to terrify him by threats.", "5870": "He was also difficult to move to laughter, and his coun­ tenance was seldom relaxed even into a smile;", "5871": "he was not quick nor prone to anger, but when he had been moved to anger, he was hard to pacify.", "5872": "Accordingly when he began to learn, he was dull and slow to conceive, but when he had conceived, he held fast and remembered well.", "5873": "And it is generally the case that those who have a good natural capacity are more ready at recollection,.", "5874": "but those have a strong memory who learn with labour and trouble;", "5875": "for all learning is in a manner a branding on the mind.", "5876": "It appears too that Cato's difficulty of persuasion made learning a matter of more labour to him;", "5877": "for learn­ ing is in truth a kind of passive condition, and to be easily persuaded is incident to those who have less power of resistance.", "5878": "It is for this reason that young men are more easily persuaded than old men, and sick persons than those who are whole;", "5879": "and generally, with those in whom the doubting faculty is weakest, that which is proposed meets the readiest acceptance.", "5880": "However, they say that Cato was obedient to his pædagogus and did everything that he was bid, but he would ask for the reason of everything, and inquire the Why.", "5881": "His pæda­ gogus also was a good-tempered man, and was readier at a reason than a blow:", "5882": "his name was Sarpedon.", "5883": "II.", "5884": "While Cato was still a boy, the Allies t of the Romans were agitating to obtain the Roman franchise;", "5885": "and a certain Pompædius Sillo,‡ a man of military talent and of the highest repute, and a friend of Drusus, lodged with him several days, during which he became familiar with the youths, and he said, \"Come now, pray your uncle on our behalf to exert himself to get the franchise for us.” ' Now, Cæpio with a smile nodded assent, but as Cato made no answer and looked on the strangers steadily and sternly, Pompædius said, “ But Jon, young man, what reply have you for us ?", "5886": "Can you not help the strangers with your uncle, like your brother ? \"", "5887": "As Cato still would not speak, but by his silence and his expression showed that he rejected their entreaty, Pompædius took him up and holding him through the window as if he intended to drop him down, told him either to assent or he would let him fall, and at the same time he assumed an angry tone and several times he swung the boy backwards and for­ wards as he held him in his hands.", "5888": "Now, when Cato had borne this for some time, unmoved and fearless, Pompæ­ dius gently putting him down said to his friends, “ What a blessing * to Italy that he is a child;", "5889": "for if he were a man, I do not think we should have a single vote among the people.\"", "5890": "On another occasion when a kinsman on his birthday invited to supper other boys and Cato with them, in order to pass the time they played in a part of the house by themselves, younger and older mixed together;", "5891": "and the game consisted of trials, and accusations, and carrying off those who were convicted.", "5892": "Now, one of the boys convicted, who was of a handsome presence, being dragged off by an older boy to a chamber and shut up, called on Cato for aid.", "5893": "Cato soon perceiving what was going on came to the door, and pushing through those who were standing before it and endeavouring to stop him, took the boy out;", "5894": "and in a passion he went off home with him and other boys accompanied him.", "5895": "III.", "5896": "Cato was so much talked off that when Bulla was preparing for exhibition the sacred horse race called Troja,t in which youths are the actors, and had got to­ gether the boys of noble birth and appointed two captains, the boys submitted to the one for his mother's sake, for he was a son of Metella, Sulla's wife;", "5897": "but the other, who was a nephew of Pompeius and named Sextus, they would not have, nor would they go through their exercise nor follow him;", "5898": "and on Sulla asking whom they would have, they all called out “ Cato,\" and Sextus himself gave way and yielded the honour to Cato as his better.", "5899": "It happened that Sulla was an old friend of Cato's family, and some­ times he had the children brought to him and talked with them, a kind of friendship which he showed to few, by reason of the weight and state of the office and power that he held.", "5900": "Sarpedon considering this a great matter both as regarded the honour and security of the youth, constantly took Cato to pay his respects to Sulla at his house, which at that time to all outward appearance dif­ fered not from a place of torture for criminals, * so great was the number of those who were dragged there and put to the rack.", "5901": "Cato was at this time in his fourteenth year, and seeing the heads of persons who were said to be men of distinction brought out, and those who were present lamenting inwardly, he asked his pædagogus why nobody killed this man.", "5902": "Sarpedon replied, \"Because they fear him, child, more than they hate him.\" “", "5903": "Why, then,\" said Cato, “ do you not give me a sword that I might kill him, and so free my country from slavery?\"", "5904": "Hearing these words and at the same time observing his eyes and countenance to be filled with passion and resolve, Sarpedon was so afraid that henceforward he kept a close look and watch upon him, that he should not venture on any des­ perate measure.", "5905": "Now when he was still a little boy, and some persons asked him whom he loved most, he replied his brother;", "5906": "when he was asked whom he loved next, ho gave the same answer, his brother;", "5907": "and so on to the third question, until the questioner was tired out by always getting the same answer.", "5908": "When he arrived at man's estate, he strengthened still more his affection to his brother;", "5909": "for when he was twenty years of age he never supped, he never went abroad, never came into the Forum without Cæpio.", "5910": "When Cæpio used perfumes, Cato would not have them;", "5911": "and in all other respects he was strict and frugal in his way of living.", "5912": "Accordingly Cæpio, who was admired for his temperance and moderation, admitted that he was indeed temperate and moderate when contrasted with others, \" but,\" said he, “ when I compare my life with Cato's, I seem to myself to differ not at all from Sippius;", "5913": "” which was the name of a man notorious at that time for luxury and effeminacy.", "5914": "IV.", "5915": "After Cato obtained the priesthood * of Apollo, he changed his residence, and taking his portion of his paternal property, which portion was a hundred and twenty talents, he contracted his style of living still further, and making his companion of Antipater † of Tyrus, a Stoic, he attached himself mainly to Ethical and Political studies, occupying himself with every virtue as if he were possessed by some divine influence;", "5916": "but above all that part of the beautiful which consists in steady adherence to justice and in inflexibility towards partiality or favour was his great delight.", "5917": "He disci­ plined himself also in the kind of speaking which works upon numbers, considering that, as in a great state, so in political philosophy, there should be nurtured with it something of the contentious quality.", "5918": "Yet he did not practise his exercises in company with others, nor did any one hear him when he was declaiming;", "5919": "but to one of his companions who observed, “ Men find fault, Cato, with your silence,\" he replied, “ I only hope they may not find fault with ray life.", "5920": "But I

straightforward, full to overflowing, and rough.", "5925": "However there was diffused over the roughness of the sentiments a charm which led the ear, and his own character intermingled with if gave

multitude, and it had a strength and tone which could neither be broken nor tired;", "5927": "for he often spoke for a whole day without being wearied.", "5928": "On this occasion he got the better in the matter in dispute, and then again wrapped himself up in silence and his discipline.", "5929": "He used to harden his body by vigorous exercises, training himself to endure both heat and snow with uncovered head, and to walk along the roads in all seasons without a vehicle.", "5930": "His friends who used to accompany him on his journeys employed horses, and Cato would often go side by side with each of them in turns, and talk to them, himself walking while they rode.", "5931": "He showed in his complaints also wonderful endurance and self-denial;", "5932": "for when he had a fever, he

cast lots for the parts, and if he failed, and his friends urged him to begin first, he would say that it was not right to do so against the will of Venus.*", "5935": "And at first he would get up from supper after drinking once, but in course of time he stuck to drinking more than anybody, so that he often continued over his wine till daybreak.", "5936": "His friends said that the cause of this was the administration and public affairs, in which Cato being engaged all day and hindered from literary pursuits, associated with philosophers during the night and over his cups.", "5937":

bright was much in fashion, he himself wore the dark.", "5939": "He would go into public with­ out shoes and tunic after dinner, not seeking for reputa­ tion by the strangeness of the practice, but habituating himself to be ashamed only of what was shameful, and to despise everything else as indifferent.", "5940": "The inheritance of his cousin Cato of the value of a hundred talents having been added to his property, he turned it into money and let any of his friends make use of it who needed, without paying interest.", "5941": "Some also pledged to the treasury both lands and slaves of his,

appointed to the command of one legion by the general, he considered the display of his own merit, being only one thing, as a small matter and nothing kingly, but being chiefly ambitious to make those

Stoic philosophy, was living at Pergamus, being now an old man, and having most resolutely resisted all intimacy and friendship with governors and kings, Cato thought that ho should get nothing by

chase.", "5971": "After discoursing with Athenodorus and getting the victory over him and drawing him from his settled purpose, he returned with him to the camp, overjoyed and greatly elated at having

still engaged in the service, his brother, who was on his road to Asia, fell sick at Ænus,* in Thrace;", "5974": "and a letter immediately came to Cato, and though the sea was very stormy, and there was no vessel at hand of sufficient size, taking only two friends with him and three slaves, he set sail from Thessalonike in a small trading ship.", "5975": "After narrowly escaping being drowned at sea, he was saved by unexpected good luck, but he found Cæpio already dead.", "5976": "He was considered to have borne the misfortune with more of passion than philosophy, not only in his lamentations and his embrac­ ings of the dead body and the heaviness of his grief, but also in his expenditure about the interment, and the trouble that he took about fragrant spices and costly vests which were burnt with the body, and a monument of polished Thasian stone of the cost of eight talents which was constructed in the Agora of Ænus.", "5977": "These things there were some who found fault with by comparison with Cato's freedom from all display in other matters, not seeing how much mildness and affection there was in the man who was inflexible and firm against pleasures and fears and shameless entreaties.", "5978": "For the celebration of the funeral both cities and princes offered to send him many things to do honour to the dead, from none of whom however would he receive valuables, but he accepted fragrant spices and vests, paying the price to those who sent the things.", "5979": "Though the succession came to him and the young daughter of Cæpio, he did not claim back in the division of the property any thing that he had ex­ pended about the funeral.", "5980": "And though he did such things as these and continued to do such, there was one * who wrote, that he passed the ashes of the dead through a sieve and sifted them to search for the gold that was burnt.", "5981": "So far did the writer allow, not to his sword only, but also to his stilus, irresponsibility and exemption from all account.", "5982": "XII.", "5983": "When the time of Cato's service was at an end, he was attended on his departure, not with good wishes, which is usual, nor yet with praises, but with tears and never-satisfied embraces, the soldiers placing their gar­ ments under his feet on the way by which he went and kissing his hands, which the Romans of that day hardly ever did to any of their Imperators.", "5984": "As he wished, before engaging in public affairs, at the same time to travel about to make himself acquainted with Asia, and to see with his own eyes the customs and mode of living and power of each province, and at the same time not to give any offence to the Galatian Deiotarus,t who prayed Cato to come to him on account of the ancient ties of hos­ pitality and friendship that subsisted between him and Cato's family, he made his sojourning after this fashion.", "5985": "At daybreak he used to send forward his bread-maker and cook to the place where he intended to lodge;", "5986": "and it was their practice to enter the city with great decorum and no stir, and if there happened to be no ancient friend of Cato's family there or no acquaintance, they would pre­ pare for his reception in an inn without troubling any­ body ;", "5987": "and if there was no inn, they would in that case apply to the magistrates and gladly accept what accom­ modation was offered.", "5988": "And oftentimes getting no credit, and being neglected because they did not apply to the magistrates about these matters with noise or threats, Cato came upon them before they had accomplished their business, and when he was seen, he was still more de­ spised ;", "5989": "and because he would sit silently on the baggage, he gave them the notion of being a person of mean con­ dition and a very timid man.", "5990": "However Cato would call them to him, and would say, “ Ye miserable wretches, lay aside this inhospitable practice.", "5991": "All those who come to you will not be Catos.", "5992": "Dull by your kind reception the power of those who only want a pretext to take by force what they cannot get from you with your consent.", "5993": "\"XIII.", "5994": "In Syria * a laughable incident is said to have happened to him.", "5995": "For as he was walking to Antiocheia, he saw near the gates on the outside a number of men arranged on each side of the road, among whom young men by themselves in cloaks and boys on the other side stood in orderly wise, and some had white vests and crowns, and these were priests of the gods or magistrates.", "5996": "Now Cato, being quite sure that some honourable recep­ tion was preparing for him by the city, was angry with those of his own people who had been sent on, for not having prevented this, and he bade his friends get off their horses and he proceeded with them on foot.", "5997": "But when they came near, he who was arranging all this ceremony and setting the folk in order, a man somewhat advanced in years, holding a rod in his hand and a chaplet, advanced in front of the rest, and meeting Cato, without even saluting him, asked where they had left Demetrius and when he would be there.", "5998": "Demetrius had been a slave of Pompeius, but at this time, as all the world, so to speak, had their eyes on Pompeius, Demetrius was courted above his merits on account of his great influence with Pompeius.", "5999": "Now the friends of Cato were seized with such a fit of laughter that they could not contain themselves as they walked through the crowd, but Cato, who at the time was vehemently disconcerted, uttered the words, “ 0 ill-fated city,\" and nothing more;", "6000": "afterwards however he was accustomed to laugh at the matter himself both when he told the story and when he thought of it.", "6001": "XIV.", "6002": "However Pompeius himself reproved those who thus misbehaved themselves towards Cato in their igno­ rance.", "6003": "For when Cato on his arrival at Ephesus went to pay his respects to Pompeius as his elder, and much his superior in reputation and then at the bead of the greatest armies, Pompeius observing him did not wait or allow Cato to approach him as he was seated, but spring­ ing up as to a man of superior rank, he met him and gave him his right hand.", "6004": "And Pompeius passed many en­ comiums on the merit of Cato while treating him as a friend and showing him attention during his stay, and still more when he had departed, so that all persons being admonished and now directing their observation to Cato admired him for the things for which he was despised, and studied his mildness and magnanimity.", "6005": "Yet it did not escape notice that the great attention of Pompeius to him proceeded more from respect than from love, and people discerned that Pompeius honoured him while he was present, and was glad when he went away.", "6006": "For the other young men who came to him, he was ambitious to keep with him, and he wished them to stay, but he asked of Cato nothing of the kind, and as if he were not commander with irresponsible power while Cato was there, he was glad to get rid of him;", "6007": "and yet he was almost the only person among those who were sailing to Rome to whom Pompeius commended his children and wife, who however were connected with Cato by kinship.", "6008": "In consequence of this there was high regard and great exertion and emulation in the cities towards Cato, and suppers and invitations, wherein Cato bade his friends keep a watch upon him, lest he should unawares make good what Curio * had said.", "6009": "For Curio, who was an­ noyed at the austerity of Cato, who was his friend and intimate, asked him if he should like to visit Asia after he had served his time in the army.", "6010": "And on Cato saying that he should like it very much, \" You say well,\" replied Curio, \" for you will be more agreeable when you return thence, and tamer,” using some such words as these.", "6011": "XV. Deiotarus the Galatian, who was now an old man, sent for Cato, wishing to intrust to him his children and his family;", "6012": "and on his arrival he offered him all manner of presents, and tried and entreated him in every way till he so irritated Cato, that after arriving in the evening and staying all night, he set off on the following day about the third hour.", "6013": "However when he had advanced one day's journey, he found in Pessinus * more presents than before awaiting him there, and letters from the Galatian begging hint to receive them;", "6014": "and if he should not be disposed to take them, to let his friends at least receive favours on his account, as they well deserved it, and Cato had not much of his own.", "6015": "But Cato did not give in even to these arguments, though he saw that some of his friends were beginning to be softened and were inclined to blame him ;", "6016": "but observing that all receiving of gifts might find a good excuse, and his friends should share in all that he got honourably and justly, he sent back the presents to Deiotarus.", "6017": "As he was about to set sail to Brundisium, his friends thought that they ought to put the ashes of Cæpio in another vessel, but Cato, saying that he would rather part with his life than the ashes of his brother, set sail.", "6018": "And indeed it is said that it chanced that he had a very dangerous passage, though the rest got to Brundisium with little difficulty.", "6019": "XVI.", "6020": "On his return to Rome he spent his time either at home in the company of Athenodorus, or in the Forum assisting his friends, Though the office of Quæstor f was now open to him, he did not become a candidate for it till he had read the laws relating to the quæstorship, and had learned all particulars from the experienced, and had comprehended the powers of the office in a certain shape.", "6021": "Accordingly as soon as he was established in the office, he made a great change in the servants and clerks about the treasury, for as they constantly had in hand the public accounts and the laws, and had young superiors who, by reason of their inexperience and ignorance, in fact re­ quired others to teach and direct them, they did not allow their superiors to have any power, but were the superior officers themselves, until Cato vigorously applied himself to the business, not having the name only and the honour of a magistrate, but understanding and judgment and apt expression;", "6022": "and he resolved to make the clerks into servants as they really were, in some things detecting their evil doings, and in others correcting their errors which arose from inexperience.", "6023": "But as the clerks wero insolent, and attempted to ingratiate themselves with and to flatter the other quæstors, and resisted him, he expelled from the treasury the first among them whom he had detected in knavish dealings in a matter of trust concern­ ing an inheritance, and he brought another to trial for dishonesty.", "6024": "This second person Catulus Lutatius* the censor came forward to defend, a man who had great dignity from his office, and the greatest from his merit, being considered superior to all the Romans in integrity and temperance ;", "6025": "and he was also an admirer and intimate friend of Cato all through his life.", "6026": "Now, when Catulus found that the justice of the case was against him and openly asked to have the man acquitted for his sake, Cato would not allow him to act so:", "6027": "and when he still continued to urge his request, Cato said, \"It were a scandalous thing, Catulus, for you, who are the censor, and whose duty it is to examine into our lives, to be turned out † by our officers.\"", "6028": "When Cato had uttered these words, Catulus looked at him as if he were going to reply, but he said nothing, and either being angry or ashamed he went away in silence and perplexed.", "6029": "However the man was not convicted, for when the votes for condemna­ tion had exceeded those for acquittal by a single vote, and Lollius Marcus, one of the colleagues of Cato, owing to sickness had not attended at the trial, Catulus sent to him and prayed him to give his support to the man;", "6030": "and he was carried thither in a litter after the trial and gave the vote which acquitted.", "6031": "However Cato did not employ the clerk nor give him his pay, nor did he take any reckoning at all of the vote of Lollius.", "6032": "XVII.", "6033": "Having thus humbled the clerks and reduced them to obedience, by managing the accounts in his own way, he made the treasury in a short time more respected than the Senate, so that every body said and considered that Cato had surrounded the quæstorship with the dig­ nity of the consulship.", "6034": "For in the first place finding that many persons owed old debts to the state and that the state was indebted to many, he at the same time put an end to the state being wronged and wronging others, by demanding the money from those who owed it vigorously and without relenting at all, and paying the creditors speedily and readily, so that the people respected him when they saw those pay who expected to defraud the state, and those recover who never expected it.", "6035": "In the next place, it was the general practice to bring in writings without observing the proper forms, and previous quæstors used to receive false decrees to please persons, and at their request.", "6036": "Cato however let nothing of this kind escape his notice, and on one occasion being in doubt about a decree, whether it was really ratified, though many persons testified to the fact, he would not trust them, nor did he allow it to be deposited until the consuls came and by oath confirmed its genuineness.", "6037": "Now there were many whom Sulla had rewarded for killing proscribed persons at the rate of twelve thousand drachmæ a-piece, and though all detested them as accursed and abominable wretches, no one ventured to bring them to punishment;", "6038": "but Cato, calling to account every man who had public money by unfair means, made him give it up and at the same time upbraided him for his unholy and illegal acts with passion and argument.", "6039": "Those whom this betel were immediately charged with murder and were brought before the judices in a manner piejudged, and were punished, to the joy of all who considered that the tyranny of those farmer times was at the same time blotted out and that they witnessed Bulla himself punished.", "6040": "XVIII.", "6041": "The many were captivated by his persevering and unwearied industry:", "6042": "for none of his colleagues went up earlier to the treasury or came away after him.", "6043": "He never omitted attending any meeting of the people and of the Senate, for he feared and kept a watch on those who were ready to vote for remissions of debts and taxes and for gifts in favour of any body.", "6044": "By proving that the treasury was inaccessible and free from intrigues, and full of money, he showed that they could be rich without doing wrong.", "6045": "Though at first he appeared to be disliked by and odious to some of his colleagues, he afterwards gained their goodwill by subjecting himself on behalf of them all to the hatred that was incurred by not giving away the public money and by not deciding dishonestly, and by furnishing them with an answer to those who preferred their requests and urged them, that nothing could be done if Cato did not consent.", "6046": "On the last day of his office when he had been accompanied to his house by almost all the citizens, he heard that many who were intimate with Marcellus,* and men of influence, had fallen upon him at the treasury and having got round him were forcing him to sign a certain payment of money that was due.", "6047": "Marcellus from his boyhood had been a friend of Cato and together with him had been a most excellent magistrate, but by himself he was easily led by others through false shame, and was ready to oblige any body.", "6048": "Accordingly Cato immediately returned to the treasury, and finding that Marcellus had been prevailed upon to sign the payment asked for the tablets and erased what was written, while Marcellus stood by and said not a word.", "6049": "Having done this Cato conducted him down from the treasury and put him in his house;", "6050": "and Marcellus neither then nor afterwards found fault with Cato, but continued on intimate terms with him all along.", "6051": "Nor did Cato when he had quitted the treasury leave it destitute of protection, but slaves of his were there daily who copied out the transactions, and he himself purchased for five talents books which contained the public accounts from the times of Sulla to his own quæstorship, and he always had them in his hands.", "6052": "XIX.", "6053": "He used to go into the Senate house the first, and ho was the last to come away;", "6054": "and often while the rest were slowly assembling, he would sit and read quietly, holding his toga before the book.", "6055": "He never went abroad when there was to be a meeting of the Senate;", "6056": "but after­ wards who n Pompeius saw that Cato could not be prevailed upon, and could never be brought to comply with the unjust measures on which he was intent, he used to contrive to engage him in giving his aid to some friend in a matter before the courts, or in arbitrations, or in discharging some business.", "6057": "But Cato quickly perceiving his design, refused all such engagements and made it a rule to do nothing else while the Senate was assembled.", "6058": "For it was neither for the sake of reputation, nor self-aggrandisement, nor by a kind of spontaneous movement, nor by chance, like some others, that he was thrown into the manage­ ment of state affairs, but he selected a public career as the proper labour of a good man, and thought that ho ought to attend to public concerns more than the bee to its cells, inasmuch as he made it his business to have the affairs of the provinces and decrees and trials and the most important measures communicated to him by his connec­ tions and friends in every place.", "6059": "On one occasion by opposing Clodius the demagogue, who was making a disturbance and laying the foundation for great charges, and calumniating to the people the priests and priestesses, among whom was also Fabia,* the sister of Terentia, Cicero'a wife, he was in great danger, but he involved Clodius in disgrace and compelled him to withdraw from the city;", "6060": "and when Cicero thanked him, Cato said that he ought to reserve his gratitude for the state, as it was for the sake of the state that he did every thing and directed his political measures.", "6061": "In consequence of this there was a high opinion of him, so that an orator said to the judices on a certain trial when the evidence of a single person was produced, that it was not right to believe a single witness even if he was Cato;", "6062": "and many persons now were used to say when speaking of things incredible and contrary to all probability, as by way of proverb, that this could not be believed even if Cato said it.", "6063": "And when a man of bad character and great expense delivered a discourse in the senate in favour of frugality and temper­ ance, Amnaeus * rose up and said, \" My man, who will endure you, you who sup like Crassus, and build like Lucullus, and harangue us like Cato.\"", "6064": "Others also who were people of bad character and intemperate, but in theii language dignified and severe, they used to call by way of mockery, Catos.", "6065": "XX.", "6066": "Though many invited him to the tribuneship, he did not think it well to expend the power of a great office and magistracy, no more than that of a strong medicine, on matters wherein it was not required.", "6067": "At the same time as he had leisure from public affairs, he took books and philosophers with him and set out for Lucania, for he had lands there on which there was no unseemly residence.", "6068": "On the road he met with many beasts of burden and bag­ gage and slaves, and learning that Nepos Metellus † was returning to Rome for the purpose of being a candidate for the tribuneship, he halted without speaking, and after a short interval ordered his people to turn back.", "6069": "His friends wondering at this, he said, \" Don't you know that even of himself Metellus is a formidable man by reason of his violence ;", "6070": "and now that he has come upon the motion of Pompeius, he will fall upon the state like a thunderbolt and put all in confusion ?", "6071": "It is therefore not a time for leisure or going from home, but we must get the better of the man or die nobly in defence of liberty.\"", "6072": "However at the urgency of his friends he went first to visit his estates, and after staying no long time he returned to the city.", "6073": "He arrived in the evening, and as soon as day dawned, he went down into the Forum to be a candidate for the tribuneship and to oppose Metellus.", "6074": "For this magistracy gives more power to check than to act;", "6075": "and even if all the rest of the tribunes save one should assent to a measure, the power lies with him who does not consent or permit.", "6076": "XXI.", "6077": "At first there were few of Cato's friends about him, but when his views became public, in a short time all the people of character and distinction crowded to­ gether and cheered and encouraged him, for they said it was no favour that he was receiving, but he was conferring the greatest favour on his country and the most honest of the citizens, for that when it was often in his power to hold a magistracy without any trouble, he now came down to contend on behalf of freedom and the constitution, not without danger.", "6078": "It is said that owing to many persons through zeal and friendly disposition crowding towards him he was in some danger, and with difficulty on account of the crowd he made his way to the Forum.", "6079": "Being elected tribune with others and with Metellus, and observing that the consular comitia were accompanied with bribery, he rated the people, and at the close of his speech he swore that he would prosecute the bliber, whoever he might be, with the exception of Silanus,* on account of his connection with him;", "6080": "for Silanus had to wife Servilia, a sister of Cato.", "6081": "For this reason he passed over Silanus, but he pro­ secuted Lucius Murena,t on the charge of having secured his election with Silanus by bribery.", "6082": "There was a law according to which the accused had always the power to appoint a person to watch the accuser, in order that it might not be unknown what he was getting together and preparing to support the prosecution.", "6083": "Now he who was appointed by Murena to watch Cato used to accompany him and observe his conduct, and when he saw that Cato was doing nothing with unfair design or contrary to equity, but honourably and in a kindly spirit was going a simple and straightforward course towards the prosecu­ tion, he had such admiration of his noble bearing and morality that he would come up to Cato in the Forum, or go to his door and ask, whether he intended that day to attend to any matters that concerned the prosecution, and if he said that he did not, he would take his word and go away.", "6084": "When the trial came on, Cicero, who was then consul and one of the advocates of Murena, on account of Cato's connection with the Stoics, ridiculed and mocked these philosophers and their so-called paradoxes, and thus made the judices laugh.", "6085": "On which it is said that Cato, with a smile, observed to those who were present, “ My friends, what a ridiculous consul we have.\"", "6086": "Murena, who was acquitted, did not display towards", "6087": "Cato the temper of a bad or a foolish man, for in his consulship he used to ask his advice in the most important affairs, and all along in every other matter showed him respect and confidence.", "6088": "Cato's own conduct was the cause of this, for while he was severe and terrible on the judgment seat and in the Senate on behalf of justice, he was benevolent and friendly in all his social intercourse.", "6089": "XXII.", "6090": "Before Cato entered on the tribuneship, during Cicero's consulship he supported his administration in many other difficulties, and he put the finishing stroke to the measures relating to Catiline,* which were the most important and glorious of all.", "6091": "Catiline himself, who was designing to effect a pernicious and complete change in the Roman state, and was at the same time stirring up insurrection and war, being convicted by Cicero, fled from the city;", "6092": "but Lentulus and Cethegus and many others with them, who had taken up the conspiracy, up­ braiding Catiline with cowardice and want of spirit in his designs, were plotting to destroy the city with fire, and to subvert the supremacy of Rome by the revolt of nations and by foreign wars.", "6093": "Their schemes having been dis­ covered in the manner told in the Life of Cicero, he laid the matter before the Senate for their deliberation, where­ upon Silanus, who spoke first, gave his opinion that the men ought to suffer the extreme punishment, and those who followed him spoke to the same effect, till it came to Cæsar's turn.", "6094": "Cæsar now rose, and as he was a powerful speaker and wished rather to increase all change and disturbance in the state than to allow it to be quenched, considering it as the stuff for his own designs to work upon, he urged many arguments of a persuasive and humane kind to the effect that the men ought not to be put to death without trial, and he advised that they should be confined in prison:", "6095": "and he wrought so great a change in the opinion of the Senate, who were afraid of the people, that even Silanus retracted what he had said, and affirmed that neither had he recommended that they should be put to death, but that they should be im­ prisoned ;", "6096": "for to a Roman this was the extreme of punishment.", "6097": "XXIII.", "6098": "Such had been the change, and all the Senators in a body had gone over to the milder and more humane proposal, when Cato rising to deliver his opinion, com­ menced his speech in anger and passion, abusing Silanus for changing his mind, and attacking Cæsar, whom he charged with a design to overturn the State under a popular guise and pretext of humanity, and with making the Senate alarmed at things at which he himself ought to be alarmed, and therewith well content, if he escaped unharmed on account of what had passed and without suspicion, when he was so openly and audaciously endea­ vouring to rescue the common enemies of all, and admit­ ting that he had no pity for the state, such and so great though it was, and though it had so narrowly escaped destruction, but was shedding tears and lamenting because those who ought never to have existed or been born would by their death release the state from great blood­ shed and danger.", "6099": "They say that this is the only speech of Cato which is preserved, and that it was owing to Cicero the consul, who had previously instructed those clerks who surpassed the rest in quick writing in the use of certain signs which comprehended in their small and brief marks the force of many characters and had placed them in different parts of the Senate house.", "6100": "For the Romans at this time were not used to employ nor did they possess what are called note-writers,.", "6101": "but it was on this occasion, as they say, that they were first established in a certain form.", "6102": "However, Cato prevailed and changed the opinion of the Senate, who condemned the men to death.", "6103": "XXIV.", "6104": "Now as we perhaps ought not to omit even the slight tokens of character when we are delineating as it were a likeness of the soul, it is reported that on this occasion when Cæsar was making much exertion and a great struggle against Cato, and the attention of the Senate was fixed on both of them, a small letter was brought in for Cæsar from the outside.", "6105": "Cato attempted to fix suspicion on this matter, and alleged that some of the senators were disturbed at it and he bade him read the writing, on which Cæsar handed the letter to Cato who was standing near him.", "6106": "Cato read the letter, which was an amatory epistle addressed to Cæsar by his sister Servilia† who was enamoured of Caesar and had been de­ bauched by him, and throwing it at Cæsar he said, “ Take it, drunkard,\" and so resumed his speech.", "6107": "Indeed in the female part of his family Cato appears to have always been unlucky.", "6108": "For this sister had a bad report in respect of Cæsar ;", "6109": "and the conduct of the other Servilia, also a sister of Cato, was still more unseemly.", "6110": "For though she was married to Lucullus, a man who was among the first of the Romans in reputation, and bore him a child, she was driven from his house for incontinence.", "6111": "And what was most scandalous of all, even Cato'is wife Atilia was not free from such vices, for though he had two children by her, he was compelled to put her away for her unseemly behaviour.", "6112": "XXV.", "6113": "Cato then married Marcia, a daughter of Philip­ pus,* who had the character of being an honest woman, and about whom a good deal is said;", "6114": "but just as in a drama, this part of Cato's life is a difficult and perplexed matter.", "6115": "However it was after the following manner, as Thraseat writes, who refers as his authority to Munatius, a companion and intimate associate of Cato.", "6116": "Among the numerous friends and admirers of Cato there were some more conspicuous and distinguished than others, of whom one was Quintus Hortensius,‡ a man of splendid reputa­ tion and honest morals.", "6117": "Now as Hortensius was desirous to be not merely an intimate friend and companion of Cato, but in a manner to unite in kinship and community the whole family and stock, he endeavoured to persuade Cato, whose daughter Porcia was the wife of Bibulus and had born him two sons, to give her in turn to him as a fertile soil to beget children in.", "6118": "He said that according to men's opinion such a thing was strange, but that ac­ cording to nature it was good and for the advantage of states, that a woman who was in her youth and perfection should neither lie idle and check her procreative power, nor yet should by breeding more children than enough cause trouble to her husband and impoverish him when he wanted no more children ;", "6119": "but that if there was a com­ munity of offspring among worthy men, it would make virtue abundant and widely diffused among families, and would mingle the state with itself by these family rela­ tionships.", "6120": "If Bibulus, he said, was greatly attached to his wife, he would return her as soon as she had born a child, and he had become more closely united both with Bibulus and Cato by a community of children.", "6121": "Cato replied that he loved Hortensius and valued his kinship, but he considered it strange for Hortensius to speak about the marriage of his daughter who had been given to another;", "6122": "on which Hortensius changing his proposal and disclosing himself did not hesitate to ask the wife of Cato, who was still young enough to bear children, while Cato himself had children enough.", "6123": "And it cannot be said that Hortensius did this because he knew that Cato paid no attention to Marcia, for they say that she happened to be with child at the time.", "6124": "Accordingly Cato seeing the earnestness and eagerness of Hortensius did not refuse, but he said that Philippus the father of Marcia must also approve of it.", "6125": "When they had seen Philippus and in­ formed him of the agreement, he did not give Marcia in marriage, except in the presence of Cato, and Cato joined in giving her away.", "6126": "Though this took place later, it seemed convenient to me to anticipate the time as I had made mention of the female part of Cato'is family.", "6127": "XXVI.", "6128": "When Lentulus and his associates had been executed, and Caesar, on account of the charges and insinua­ tions made against him before the Senate, betook himself to the people for protection and was stirring up the nuserous diseased and corrupted members of the state and collecting them about him, Cato, being alarmed, persuaded the Senate to relieve the crowd of poor who had no property by an allowance of grain, the expenditure for which purpose was to the amount of twelve hundred and fifty talents * annually;", "6129": "and the threats of Cæsar were manifestly rendered futile by this liberality and bounty.", "6130": "After this, Metellus, as soon as he had entered on the tribuneship, got together tumultuous meetings and proposed a law that Pompeius Magnus t should hasten to Italy with his forces and should undertake the protection of the city, which it was alleged was in danger from Catiline.", "6131": "This was in appearance a specious proposal, but the real object and end of the law was to put affairs in the hands of Pompeius and to surrender to him the supremacy.", "6132": "When the Senate was assembled and Cato did not in his usual way fall violently on Metellus, but advised him with much forbearance and moderation, and at last even betook himself to entreaty and praised the family of the Metelli for having always been aristocratic, Metellus becoming much emboldened and despising Cato, whom he supposed to be giving way and cowering, broke out in extravagant threats and arrogant expressions, as if he would accom­ plish every thing in spite of the Senate.", "6133": "On this Cato, changing his attitude and tone and language, and con­ cluding all that he said with a vehement affirmation that so long as he lived Pompeius should not come into the city with his soldiers, brought the Senate to this opinion, that neither he nor Metellus was in a sober mind and that neither of them was guided by sound considerations, but that the measures of Metellus were madness which from excess of depravity was leading to the destruction and confusion of every thing, and those of Cato an enthusiasm of virtue struggling in behalf of honour and justice.", "6134": "XXVII.", "6135": "But when the people were going to vote on the law, and armed strangers and gladiators and slaves had come to the Forum arrayed to support Metellus, and that part of the people which longed for Pompeius from desire of change was not small, and there was also great support from Cæsar who was then prætor, and the first men of the citizens rather shared in the indignation and wrongs of Cato than joined him in making resistance, and great depression and alarm prevailed in his family, so that some of his friends taking no food watched all night with one another in perplexed deliberation on his behalf, and his wife and sisters also were lamenting and weeping, Cato himself displayed a fearless and confident behaviour to all, and cheered them, and he took his supper, as usual, and after resting all night was roused from a deep sleep by Minucius Thermus one of his colleagues;", "6136": "and they went down to the Forum with a few persons accompanying them, though many met them and urged them to be on their guard.", "6137": "When Cato stopped and saw the temple of the Dioscuri * surrounded by armed men and the steps guarded by gladiators, and Metellus himself with Cæsar sitting above, he turned to his friends and said, \" 0 the daring and cowardly men, to collect such a force of soldiery against a single man un­ armed and defenceless.\"", "6138": "Saying this he advanced straight forwards with Thermus;", "6139": "and those who occupied the steps made way for them but they let nobody else pass, except that Cato with difficulty pulled Munatius by the hand and got him up, and then advancing right onwards, he flung himself between Metellus and Cæsar and there took his seat, and so out off their communications.", "6140": "Caesar and Metellus were disconcerted, but the better part of the people seeing and admiring the noble bearing and spirit of Cato came nearer, and with shouts encouraged Cato to be of good heart, and they urged one another to stay and keep close together and not to betray their liberty and the man who was contending in defence of it.", "6141": "XXVIII.", "6142": "The clerk now produced the law, but Cato would not let him read it, and when Metellus took it and began to read, Cato snatched the writing from him ;", "6143": "and when Metellus who knew the law by heart was beginning to declare it orally, Thermus held his mouth with his hand and stopped his voice, till at last Metellus seeing that the men were making an opposition which he could not resist and that the people were beginning to give way to what was best and to change, he ordered armed men to hurry thither from his house * with threats and shouts.", "6144": "This being done, and all having been dispersed except Cato, who stood there, though he was pelted with stones and pieces of wood from above, Murena, who had been brought to trial and prosecuted by Cato, did not remain indifferent, but holding his toga in front of him and calling out to those who were throwing missiles, to stop, and finally persuading Cato himself and taking him in his arms, led him off to the temple of the Dioscuri.", "6145": "Now when Metellus saw that all was clear about the Rostra, and that his opponents were flying through the Forum, being quite confident that he had got the victory, he ordered the armed men to go away, and coming forward in an orderly manner he attempted to conduct the proceedings about the Jaw.", "6146": "But his opponents quickly recovering themselves from their rout again advanced with loud and confident shouts, so that the partizans of Metellus were seized with confusion and fear, for they thought that their opponents were falling on them with arms which they had provided themselves with from some place or other, and not one of them stood his ground, but all ran away from the Rostra.", "6147": "When they were thus dispersed, and Cato coming forward partly commended and partly encouraged the people, the people prepared themselves to put down Metellus by every means, and the Senate assembling declared anew that they would support Cato and resist the law, which they considered to be introducing discord and civil war into Rome.", "6148": "XXIX.", "6149": "Metellus himself was unmoved from his purpose and still bold.", "6150": "but seeing that his partizans were struck with great terror at Cato, and considered him invincible and that it was impossible to overpower him, he suddenly hurried out to the Forum, and assemb­ ling the people he said many things calculated to bring odium on Cato, and crying out that he was flying from his tyranny and the conspiracy against Pompeius, for which the city would speedily repent and for their dis­ gracing so great a man, he forthwith set out to Asia to lay all these charges before Pompeius.", "6151": "Now the fame of Cato was great inasmuch as he had eased the state of the no small burden of the tribuneship, and in a manner had put down the power of Pompeius in the person of Metellus ;", "6152": "but he got still more credit by not consenting that the Senate, who were minded to do it, should degrade Metellus, and by opposing the measure and praying them not to pass it.", "6153": "For the majority considered it a token of a humane and moderate temper not to trample on his enemy nor insult him after he had got the victory;", "6154": "and to the prudent it appeared wise and politic in him not to irritate Pompeius.", "6155": "After this, Lucullus,* who had returned from his campaign, the conclusion and the glory of which Pompeius was considered to have snatched from him, ran the risk of not having a triumph, owing to Caius Memmius stirring up the people and bringing charges against him, rather to please Pompeius than out of any private ill-will.", "6156": "But Cato, being connected with Lucullus by Lucullus having married Cato's sister Servilia, and also thinking it a scandalous affair, resisted Memmius and exposed himself to much calumny and many imputations.", "6157": "Finally an attempt being made to eject Cato from his office, on the ground that he was exercising tyrannical power, he so far prevailed as to compel Memmius himself to desist from his prosecution and to give up the contest.", "6158": "Lucullus accordingly had a triumph, in consideration of which he stuck still more closely to the friendship of Cato, which was to him a protection and bulwark against the power of Pompeius.", "6159": "XXX.", "6160": "Pompeius† returning from his military command with great reputation, and relying on the splendour and heartiness of his reception for getting everything from the citizens that he asked for, sent a message to the Senate before his arrival at Rome, to ask them to put off the Comitia, that he might be present to assist Piso at his canvass.", "6161": "The majority were ready to give way, but Cato who did not consider the putting off the Comitia as the chief matter, and wished to cut short the attempts and the hopes of Pompeius, opposed the request and induced the Senate to change their mind and reject it.", "6162": "This gave Pompeius no little uneasiness, and considering that ho should find no slight obstacle in Cato, if he did not make him his friend, he sent for Munatius,* an intimate of Cato, and as Cato had two marriageable nieces, he asked for the elder for his own wife, and the younger for his son.", "6163": "Some say that the suit was not for the nieces, but the daughters of Cato.", "6164": "When Munatius made the proposal to Cato and his wife and sisters, the women were delighted above measure at the prospect of the alliance by reason of the greatness and reputation of the man;", "6165": "but Cato, with­ out pause or deliberation, with passion forthwith replied, it Go, Munatius, go, and tell Pompeius, that Cato is not to be caught by approaching him through the women's chamber, but that he is well content to have the friend­ ship of Pompeius, and if Pompeius will act rightly, Cato will show him a friendship more sure than any marriage connection, but he will not give up hostages to the reputation of Pompeius contrary to the interests of his country.\"", "6166": "The women were vexed at these words, and Cato'is friends blamed his answer as both rude and insolent.", "6167": "The next thing, however, was that Pompeius while trying to secure the consulship for one of his friends, sent money for the tribes, and the bribery!", "6168": "was notorious, the money being counted out in his gardens.", "6169": "Accordingly when Cato observed to the women, that he who was connected with Pompeius by marriage, must of necessity participate in such measures and be loaded with the disgrace of them, they admitted that he had judged better in rejecting the alliance of Pompeius.", "6170": "But if we may judge by the result, Cato appears to have made a complete mistake in not accepting the proposed alliance with Pompeius, and allowing him to turn to Cæsar and to contract a marriage, which, by uniting the power of Pompeius and Cæsar, nearly overthrew the Roman state and did destroy the constitution, nothing of which probably would have happened if Cato had not, through fear of the small errors of Pompeius, overlooked the greatest, which was the allowing him to increase the power of another.", "6171": "XXXI.", "6172": "These things, however, were still in the future.", "6173": "Now when Lucullus was engaged in a contest with Pom­ peius respecting the arrangements made in Pontus, for each of them wished his own arrangements to be con­ firmed, and Cato gave his aid to Lucullus, who was mani­ festly wronged, Pompeius being worsted in the Senate and seeking to make himself popular, proposed a division of lands among the soldiery.", "6174": "But when Cato opposed him in this measure also and frustrated the law, Pompeius next attached himself to Clodius, the boldest of the dema­ gogues at that time, and gained over Cæsar,* to which Cato in a manner gave occasion.", "6175": "For Caesar, who had returned from his prætorship in Iberia, at the same time wished to be a candidate for the consulship and asked for a triumph.", "6176": "But as it was the law that those who were candidates for a magistracy should be present, and those who were going to have a triumph should stay outside the walls, Cæsar asked permission of the Senate to solicit the office through means of others.", "6177": "Many were willing to consent, but Cato spoke against it, and when he saw that the Senators were ready to oblige Cæsar, he took up the whole day in talking, and thus frustrated the designs of the Senate.", "6178": "Caesar accordingly giving up his hopes of a triumph, entered the city, and immediately attached himself to Pompeius, and sought the consulship.", "6179": "Being elected consul, Cæsar gave Julia in marriage to Pompeius, and the two now coalescing against the state, the ohe introduced laws for giving to the poor allotments and a distribution of land, and the other assisted in supporting these measures.", "6180": "But Lucullus and Cicero siding with Bibulus, the other consul, opposed the measures, and Cato most of all, who already suspected that the friendship and combination of Cæsar and Pompeius had no just object, and said that he was not afraid of the distribution of the land, but of the reward for it which those would claim who were gratifying the multitude, and alluring them by this bait.", "6181": "XXXII.", "6182": "By these arguments Cato brought the Senate to an unanimous opinion;", "6183": "and of those without the Senate no small number supported the senators, being annoyed at the unusual measures of Cæsar :", "6184": "for what the boldest and most reckless tribunes were used to propose for popu­ larity's sake, these very measures Cæsar in the possession of consular power adopted, basely and meanly endeavour­ ing to ingratiate himself with the people.", "6185": "Cæsar's party, therefore, being alarmed, had recourse to violence, and first of all a basket of ordure was thrown upon Bibulus as he was going down to the Forum, and then the people fell on his lictors and broke the fasces;", "6186": "finally missiles being thrown about, and many being wounded, all the rest ran away from the Forum except Cato, who walked away slowly, every now and then turning round and cursing the citizens.", "6187": "Accordingly Cæsar's partisans not only passed the law for the distribution of land,.", "6188": "but they added to it a clause to compel all the Senate to swear that they would maintain the law, and give their aid against any one who should act contrary to it, and they enacted heavy penalties against those who did not swear.", "6189": "All swore to maintain the law under compulsion, bearing in mind what befell Metellus of old, whom the people allowed to be driven from t Italy because he would not swear to observe a like enactment.", "6190": "For this reason the women of Cato's family with tears earnestly entreated him to yield and take the oath, and also his friends and intimate acquaintance.", "6191": "But the person who most persuaded and induced Cato to take the oath was Cicero the orator, who argued and urged that perhaps it was not even right for him to think that he was the only man who ought to refuse obedience to what had been determined by the common voice;", "6192": "and when it was impossible to undo what had been done, it was altogether senseless and mad to have no regard for himself;", "6193": "and of all evils, he argued, it was the greatest to give up and surrender the state, to the interests of which all his actions were directed, to those who were plotting against it, as if he were glad to be released from all struggles in its behalf;", "6194": "for if Cato did not stand in need of Rome, Rome stood in need of Cato, and all his friends also did;", "6195": "and among them Cicero said that he was the first, being the object of the designs of Clodius, who was clearly proceeding to attack him by means of the tribunitian office.", "6196": "By these and the like arguments and entreaties, both at home and in the Forum, it is said that Cato was induced to relent, and was pre­ vailed upon with difficulty, and that he came forward to take the oath last of all, except Favonius, one of his friends and intimates.", "6197": "XXXIII.", "6198": "Caesar being encouraged, introduced another law for the division of nearly the whole of Campania among the poor and needy.", "6199": "Nobody spoke against it except Cato;", "6200": "and him Caesar caused to be dragged from the Rostra to prison, Cato the while remitting nothing of his freedom of speech, but as he went along, at the same time speaking about the law and advising them to cease attempting such political measures.", "6201": "The Senate followed with downcast countenances, and the best part of the people, much annoyed and troubled, though they said nothing, so that Cæsar did not fail to see that they were displeased;", "6202": "but out of self-will and expectation that Cato would appeal and have recourse to entreaties, he continued leading him to prison, But when it was plain that Cato intended to do nothing at all, Cæsar, overcome by shame and the ill opinion of the thing, privately per­ suaded one of the tribunes to rescue Cato.", "6203": "By these however, and these grants of land, they so cajoled the people, that they voted to Cæsar the government of Illy­ ricum and all Gaul with four legions for five years, though Cato warned them that they would by their own votes plant the tyrant in the Acropolis;", "6204": "and they transferred by illegal means Publius Clodius from the patrician order to the plebeians, and made the man a tribune, who was willing to do anything in his public capacity to serve them, on condition that they would let Cicero be driven out;", "6205": "and they made consuls Piso* Calpurnius, the father of Cæsar's wife, and Gabinius Aulus, a man from the lap of Pompeius, as those say who were acquainted with his habits and life.", "6206": "XXXIV.", "6207": "But though Cæsar and his party had thus violently got possession of the power, and had one part of the citizens at their command through their grants, and another part through fear, they still dreaded Cato.", "6208": "For even when they did get the advantage over him, the fact that it was with difficulty and labour, and not without shame and exposure that they hardly forced their purpose, was annoying and vexatious.", "6209": "Clodius, indeed, did not expect to be able to put down Cicero so long as Cato was at Rome, and as he was contriving how to effect this, he sent for Cato as soon as he was in his office, and addressed him to the effect that he considered Cato to be the purest man of all the Romans, and he was ready to prove the sincerity of his opinion by his acts, and he said that though many persons were soliciting the commission to Cyprus and Ptolemæus,† and asking to be sent, he thought Cato alone worthy of it, and that he gladly offered him the favour.", "6210": "On Cato crying out that the thing was a snare and insult and not a favour, Clodius replied in an insolent and contemptuous manner, \"Well, if you don't like it, you shall make the voyage against your liking and immediately going before the people he got the mission of Cato confirmed by a law.", "6211": "When Cato was leaving Rome, Clodius allowed him neither ship nor soldier nor attendant except two clerks, one of whom was a thief and a thorough knave, and the other was a client of Clodius.", "6212": "And as if he had given him but small occupa­ tionis with the affairs of Cyprus and Ptolemæus, Clodius commissioned him also to restore the Byzantine fugitives, his wish being that Cato should be as long as possible from Rome during his tribuneship.", "6213": "XXXV.", "6214": "Being under such compulsion, Cato advised Cicero, who was pressed by his enemies, not to raise any commotion nor to involve the city in a contest and blood­ shed, but by yielding to the times to be again the saviour of his country;", "6215": "and sending forward to Cyprus Canidius,* one of his friends, he prevailed on Ptolemæus t to yield without a struggle, assuring him that he should want neither money nor respect, for that the people would give him the priesthood of the goddess at Paphos.‡", "6216": "Cato him­ self stayed in Rhodes making preparation and waiting for the answers.", "6217": "In the meantime Ptolemæus,§ King of Egypt, left Alexandria in anger after quarrelling with the citizens, and set sail for Rome in the hope that Cæsar and Pompeius would restore him with a military force;", "6218": "and as he wished to see Cato he sent a message, expecting that Cato would come to him.", "6219": "Cato happened to be then undergoing a purging,.", "6220": "and he answered that Ptolemæus must come, if he wished to see him;", "6221": "and when the king did come, Cato neither advanced to meet him nor rose, but saluted him as one of his ordinary visitors and bade him be seated;", "6222": "and by this behaviour the king was at first disturbed, and was amazed at the contrast between Gato's haughty behaviour and rough manners, and the meanness and simplicity of the man's attire.", "6223": "But when he had begun to talk with him about his own affairs, and listened to words full of wisdom and plain-speaking, for Cato reproved him and showed what a happy condition he had left and to what servitude and toils and corruption and love of aggrandisement in the chief men of the Romans he was subjecting himself, whom scarcely Egypt would satisfy if it were all turned into silver, and Cato advised the king to return and be reconciled to his people, and said that he was ready to sail with him and assist in bringing about an accommodation, the king, as if he had been brought to his senses from some madness or delirium by the words of Cato, and perceiving the integrity and judgment of the man, was resolved to follow his advice.", "6224": "However, the king was again turned by his friends to his original design, but as soon as he was in Rome and was approaching the door of one of the magistrates, he groaned over his ill resolve, as if he had rejected, not the advice of a good man, but the prophetic warning of a deity.", "6225": "XXXVI.", "6226": "The Ptolemaeus in Cyprus, to Cato's good luck, poisoned himself;", "6227": "and as it was said that he had left a large sum of money, Cato determined to go to Byzantium himself, and he sent his nephew Brutus f to Cyprus, because he did not altogether trust Canidius.", "6228": "After bringing the exiles to terms with their fellow- citizens and leaving Byzantium at peace with itself, he sailed to Cyprus.", "6229": "Now as there was a great quantity of movables, such as suited a royal household, consisting of cups, tables, precious stones and purple all which was to be sold and turned into money, Cato being desirous to do everything with the greatest exactness and to bring up everything to the highest price, and to be present every­ where and to apply the strictest reckoning, would not trust even to the usages of the market, but suspecting all alike, assistants, criers, purchasers and friends, in fine, by talking to the purchasers singly and urging them to bid, he in this way got most of the things sold that were put up for sale.", "6230": "Cato thus offended the rest of his friends by showing that he did not trust them, and Munatius, the most intimate of all, he put into a state of resentment that was well nigh past cure ;", "6231": "so that when Cæsar was writing his book against Cato, this passage in the charges against him furnished matter for the most bitter invective.", "6232": "XXXVII.", "6233": "Munatius, however, states that his anger against Cato arose not by reason of Cato's distrust of him, but his contemptuous behaviour, and a certain jealousy of his own in regard to Canidius;", "6234": "for Munatius also pub­ lished a book about Cato, which Thrasea chiefly followed.", "6235": "He says that he arrived after the rest in Cyprus and found very poor accommodation prepared for him;", "6236": "and that on going to Cato's door he was repulsed, because Cato was engaged about some matters in the house with Canidius, and when he complained of this in reasonable terms, he got an answer which was not reasonable and to the effect:", "6237": "That excessive affection, as Theophrastus says, is in danger of often becoming the cause of hatred, \" for,\" continued Cato, \" you, by reason of your very great affection for me, are vexed when you suppose that you receive less respect than is your due.", "6238": "But I employ Canidius because I have made trial of him and trust him more than others, for he came at the first and has shown himself to be an honest man.\"", "6239": "This, says Munatius, Cato said to him, when they two were alone, but that Cato afterwards told it to Canidius ;", "6240": "and accordingly ,'.heu Munatius heard of it, as he says, he did not go to Cato'a table nor to his counsels when he was invited;", "6241": "and when Cato threatened that he would take pledges * from him, which the Romans do in the case of those who refuse to obey a command, that without caring for Cato's threats he sailed away from Cyprus and for a long time con­ tinued to be angry with him.", "6242": "That afterwards Marcia, for she was still the wife of Cato, having spoken with Cato, both Cato and he happened to be invited to supper by Barcas;", "6243": "t and Cato, who came in after the guests were seated, asked where he should recline.", "6244": "Upon Barcas answering, \" Where he pleased,\" Cato looking about him said he would take his place near Munatius;", "6245": "and going round he did take his place near him, but showed him no other sign of friendly feeling during the supper.", "6246": "However, upon Marcia preferring a second request, Cato wrote to him to say that he wished to see him on some matter, and that he went early in the morning to the house and was detained by Marcia till all the rest went away, when Cato came in and throwing both his arms round him saluted and received him with all signs of friendship.", "6247": "Now I have told this at some length, because I consider such things to contain a certain evidence for the exhibition and perception of character no less than public and great acts.", "6248": "XXXVIII.", "6249": "Cato ‡ got together nearly seven thousand talents of silver, and being afraid of the length of the voyage, he had many vessels made, each of which con­ tained two talents and five hundred drachmas, and lie fastened to each vessel a long rope, to the end of which was attached a very large piece of cork, with the view, that if the ship were wrecked, the cork holding the vessels suspended in the deep sea might indicate the place.", "6250": "Now the money, with the exception of a small part.", "6251": "was safely conveyed;", "6252": "but though he had accounts of all his administration carefully drawn up in two books, he saved neither of them.", "6253": "One of them was in the care of his freedman Philargyros, who set sail from Kenchreæ,* but was wrecked, and lost the book and all the cargo with it:", "6254": "the other he had safely carried as far as Corcyra, where he pitched his tent in the Agora;", "6255": "but the sailors on account of the cold having lighted many fires, the tents were burnt in the night, and the book was de­ stroyed.", "6256": "The king's managers who were present were ready to stop the mouths of the enemies and detractors of Cato;", "6257": "but the matter gave him annoyance for other reasons.", "6258": "For it was not to prove his own integrity, but to set an example of exact dealing to others that he was ambitious to produce his accounts, and this was the cause of his vexation.", "6259": "XXXIX.", "6260": "Cato's arrival with the ships did not pass unobserved by the Romans, for all the magistrates and priests, and all the Senate and a great part of the people met him at the river, so that both the banks were covered, and Cato's voyage upwards was not inferior to a triumph in show and splendour.", "6261": "Yet it seemed to some to be a perverse and stubborn thing, that though the consuls and prætors were present, Cato neither landed to meet them nor stopped his course, but sweeping along the shore in a royal galley of six banks, he never stopped till he had moored his ships in the dockyard.", "6262": "However, when the money was carried along through the Forum, the people were amazed t at the quantity, and the Senate assembling voted together with suitable thanks that an extraordinary prætorship t should be given to Cato, and that he should wear a dress with a purple border when he was present at the public spectacles.", "6263": "Cato protested against both these distinctions, but he recommended the Senate to emancipate Nikias, the king's steward, to whose care and integrity he bore testimony.", "6264": "At that time Philippus, the father of Marcia, was consul, and in a manner the dignity and power of the office were transferred to Cato, for the colleague of Philippus.", "6265": "paid no less respect to Cato on account of his merit than on account of his relationship to Philippus.", "6266": "XL.", "6267": "When Cicero t had returned from the exile into which he was driven by Clodius, and was now a powerful man, he forcibly pulled down and destroyed in the absence of Clodius, the tribunitian tablets which Clodius had re­ corded and placed in the Capitol;", "6268": "and the Senate having been assembled about this business, and Clodius making it a matter of accusation, Cicero said that inasmuch as Clodius had been made tribune in an illegal manner, all that had been done during his tribunate and recorded ought to be ineffectual and invalid.", "6269": "But Cato took ex­ ception to what Cicero said, and at length he rose and declared, that he was of opinion that there was nothing sound or good in any degree in the administration of Clodius, but that if any man was for rescinding all that Clodius had done in his tribunate, all his own measures relating to Cyprus were thereby rescinded, and his mission had not been legal, having been proposed by a man who was not legally tribune:", "6270": "he maintained that Clodius had not been illegally elected tribune by virtue of being adopted out of the patrician body into a plebeian family, for the law allowed this;", "6271": "but if he had been a bad magistrate, like others, it was fitting to call to account the man who had done wrong, and not to annul the office which had been wronged also.", "6272": "In consequence of this, Cicero was angry with Cato, and for a long time ceased all friendly intercourse with him:", "6273": "however, they were afterwards reconciled.", "6274": "XLI.", "6275": "After this Pompeius and Crassus.", "6276": "had a meeting with Cæsar, who had come across the Alps, in which they agreed that they should seek a second consulship;", "6277": "and when they were established in it, they should cause another period in Caesar's government as long as the first to be given him by the vote of the people, and to themselves the chief of the provinces and money and military forces:", "6278": "the which was a conspiracy for the division of the supreme power and the destruction of the constitution.", "6279": "Now though many honest men were at this time preparing to be candidates for the consulship, they were deterred by seeing Pompeius and Crassus can­ vassing;", "6280": "but Lucius Domitius alone, the husband of Porcia, the sister of Cato, was induced by Cato not to give way or to yield, as the contest was not for office but for the liberty of Rome.", "6281": "And indeed it was currently said among that part of the citizens who were still of sober thoughts, that they ought not to allow the consular office to become completely overbearing and oppressive by per­ mitting the power of Crassus and Pompeius to be combined, but that they should deprive one of them of the office.", "6282": "And they ranged themselves on the side of Domitius, urging and encouraging him to keep to his purpose;", "6283": "for many, they argued, even of those who said nothing by reason of fear, would help him with their votes.", "6284": "The party of Pompeius and Crassus fearing this, laid an ambuscade for Domitius as he was going down to the Campus Martius early in the morning, by torchlight.", "6285": "First of all the man who was lighting Domitius and stand­ ing close by him was struck and fell down dead;", "6286": "and after him others also being wounded, there was a general flight of all except Cato and Domitius;", "6287": "for Cato held Domitius though he himself was wounded in the arm, and urged him to stay and so long as there was breath in them, not to give up the struggle for liberty against the tyrants who showed how they would use their power, y making their way to it through such acts of wrong.", "6288": "XLII Domitius, however, did not face the danger, but fled to his house, upon which Pompeius and Crassus,* were elected.", "6289": "Yet Cato did not give up the contest, but came forward as a candidate for a prætorship, because he wished to have a strong position in his struggles with them and not to be himself a private man while he was opposing those who were in office.", "6290": "Pompeius and Crassus being afraid of this, and considering that the prætorship by reason of Cato would become a match for the consulship, in the first place on a sudden and without the knowledge of many of the body, summoned the Senate, and got a vote passed that those who were elected prætors should enter on office forthwith and should not let the time fixed by law intervene, during which time prosecutions were allowed of those who had bribed the people.", "6291": "In the next place, now that they had by the vote of the Senate made bribery free from all responsibility, they brought forward their own tools and friends as candidates for the prætorship, themselves giving the bribe-money, and themselves stand­ ing by while the voting was going on.", "6292": "But when the merit and good name of Cato were getting the superiority even over all this, the many for very shame considering it a great crime by their votes to sell Cato, whom it were even honourable to purchase for the state as prætor, and the tribe which was first called voted for him, Pompeius all at once, falsely saying he had heard thunder, dissolved the assembly, for it was the custom of the Romans to view such tokens as inauspicious, and not to ratify anything when there had been signs from heaven.", "6293": "Thereafter, by employing excessive bribery and driving all the honest folks from the Campus they brought about by violence that Vatinius should be elected prætor instead of Cato.", "6294": "Upon this it is said that those who had given their votes thus illegally and dishonestly, forthwith skulked away;", "6295": "and a certain tribune forming on the spot a meeting of those who were assembling together and expressing their dis­ satisfaction, Cato came before them, and as if inspired by the gods, foretold everything that would happen to the state, and urged the citizens to oppose Pompeius and Crassus as being privy to such measures and engaging in a course of policy, on account of which they feared Cato lest, if he were prætor, he should get the advantage over them.", "6296": "And finally as he went home, he was attended by such a crowd as not even all the prætoris together, who were elected, had to accompany them,XLIII.", "6297": "When Caius Trebonius * drew up a law for the division of the provinces between the consuls, to the effect that one of them should have the government of Iberia and Libya, and the other Syria and Egypt, to attack and carry on war against whom they pleased with naval and military forces, the rest despairing of all opposition and hindrance even desisted from speaking against the measure, and when Cato got up on the Rostra before the question was put to the vote, and expressed a wish to speak, he with difficulty obtained leave to speak for two hours.t", "6298": "After Cato had occupied this time with much speaking, and alleging of arguments and prophetic warnings, they would not let him speak longer, but an officer went up and pulled him down while he was still keeping his place on the Rostra.", "6299": "But inasmuch as be continued to cry out from the place where he was stand­ ing below, and had persons to listen to him and join in his dissatisfaction, the officer again laid hold of him and taking him away, put him out of the Forum.", "6300": "But scarcely was he let loose when he returned and made his way to the Rostra with loud shouts, urging the citizens to aid him.", "6301": "This being repeated several times, Trebonius in a passion ordered him to be led to prison, and the crowd followed listening to him talking as he went along, so that Trebonius was afraid and let him go.", "6302": "In this manner Cato took up all that day:", "6303": "but on the following days by terrifying some of the citizens and gaining oVet others by favours and by bribes, and with armed men preventing Aquilius * one of the tribunes from coming out of the senate house, and by ejecting from the Forum Cato himself, who called out that there had been thunder, and by wounding no small number, and even killing some, they forcibly carried the law, in consequence of which many persons in passion crowded together and pelted the statues of Pompeius.", "6304": "Cato, however, who came up to them stopped this;", "6305": "and further, when a law was pro­ posed respecting the provinces and armies of Caesar, Cato no longer addressed himself to the people, but turning to Pompeius himself he adjured and forewarned him, that he did not see that he was now taking up Cæsar on his shoulders, but that when he began to feel the weight of his burden and to be mastered by it, having neither power to rid himself of it nor strength to bear it, he would fall with it upon the state, and then he would remember Cato'a advice and see that it concerned no less the interests of Pompeius than honour and justice.", "6306": "Though Pompeius heard this often, he cared not for it and let it pass, not believing there would be any change in Cæsar, because he trusted in his own good fortune and power,XLIV.", "6307": "For the following year Cato was chosen prætor,† but he was considered not to add so much dignity and honour to the office by his good administration, as to detract from it and bring it into disrepute by often going to the Rostra without his shoes and his tunic, and in this attire presiding at trials of men of rank in matters of life and death.", "6308": "Some also say that even after dinner, when he had drunk wine, he would transact business;", "6309": "but this at least is untruly said.", "6310": "The people being now corrupted by the bribery of those who were ambitious of office, and the majority being accustomed to receive money for their votes as if in the way of a regular trade, Cato wishing to eradicate completely this disease in the state, persuaded the Senate to make a decree, that if those who were elected magistrates should have none ready to accuse them, they should themselves be compelled to come forward before a sworn court and give an account of their election.", "6311": "The candidates for magistracies were vexed at this, and still more vexed were the mass who received the bribe-money.", "6312": "Accordingly in the morning when Cato had gone to the tribunal, the people in a body pressing upon him, cried out, abused him, and pelted him so that every person fled from the tribunal, and Cato himself being shoved from his place by the crowd and carried along with it, with difficulty laid hold of the Rostra.", "6313": "Thereupon getting up, by the boldness and firmness of his demeanour, Cato forthwith mastered the tumult, and stopped the shouting, and after saying what was suitable to the occasion and being listened to with perfect quiet, he put an end to the dis­ turbance.", "6314": "When the Senate were bestowing praise upon him, he said, \" But I cannot praise you, who left a prætor in danger and did not come to his help.\"", "6315": "But of the candidates for magistracies every man felt himself in a difficult position, being afraid to give bribes himself, and being afraid that he should lose the office if another did it.", "6316": "Accordingly it was agreed among them that they should come together to one place, and each lay down one hundred and twenty-five thousand drachmae of silver, and all should then seek the office in a right and just way, and that he who broke the terms and employed bribery, should lose his money.", "6317": "Having agreed to these terms they chose Cato as depositary and umpire and witness, and bringing the money, they offered to place it with him;", "6318": "and they had the terms of the agreement drawn up before him, but Cato took sureties instead of ihe money, and would not receive the money itself.", "6319": "When the day for the election came, Cato taking his place by the presiding tribune and watching the vote, discovered that one of those who had entered into the engagement, was playing foul, and he ordered him to pay the money to the rest.", "6320": "But they, commending his up­ rightness and admiring it, waived the penalty, considering that they had sufficient satisfaction from the wrong-doer;", "6321": "but Cato offended all the rest and got very great odium from this, it being as if he assumed to himself the power of the Senate and of the courts of justice and of the magistrates.", "6322": "For the opinion and the credit of no one virtue makes people more envious than that of justice,­ because both power and credit among the many follow it chiefly.", "6323": "For people do not merely honour the just, as they do the brave, nor do they admire them, as they do the wise, but they even love the just, and have confidence in them and give them credit.", "6324": "But as to the brave and wise, they fear the one, and give no credit to the other;", "6325": "and besides this, they think that the brave and the wise excel by nature rather than by their own will;", "6326": "and with respect to courage and wisdom, they consider the one to be a certain sharpness, and the other a firmness of soul;", "6327": "but inasmuch as any man who chooses, has it in his power to be just, they have most abhorrence of injustice as badness that is without excuse.", "6328": "XLV.", "6329": "Wherefore all the great were enemies of Cato, as being reproved by his conduct:", "6330": "and as Pompeius viewed Cato'is reputation even as a nullification of his own power, he was continually setting persons on to abuse him, among whom Clodius also was one, the demagogue, who had again insensibly attached himself to Pompeius, and was crying out against Cato on the ground that he had ap­ propriated to his own purposes much money in Cyprus, and was hostile to Pompeius because Pompeius had rejected a marriage with Cato's daughter.", "6331": "Cato replied that he had brought to the city from Cyprus, without the aid of a single horse or soldier, more money than Pompeius had brought back from so many wars and triumphs after dis­ turbing the habitable world, and that he never chose Pompeius to make a marriage alliance with, not because he considered Pompeius unworthy, but because he saw the difference between his polity and that of Pompeius. \"", "6332": "For my part,\" continued Cato, \" I declined a province when it was offered to me after my prætorship, but Pom­ peius has got some provinces, and he also offers some to others;", "6333": "and now, last of all, ho has lent to Cæsar a force of six thousand legionary soldiers for Gaul, which neither did Caesar ask of you, nor did Pompeius give with your assent;", "6334": "but forces to such an amount and arms and horses are gifts from private persons and things of mutual ex­ change.", "6335": "And being called Imperator and governor he has given up to others the armies and the provinces, and he himself sits down close to the city raising commotions at the elections and contriving disturbances, from which it is manifest that he is intriguing to get by means of anarchy a monarchy for himself.", "6336": "\"", "6337": "XLVI.", "6338": "In this fashion Cato defended himself against Pompeius.", "6339": "But Marcus Favonius, an intimate friend and admirer of Cato, just as Apollodorus * of Phalerum is said to have been of Socrates of old, being a passionate man and one who was violently moved by his principles, did not with any temper or moderation, but intemperately attack Pompeius, like a man under the influence of drink and somewhat mad.", "6340": "Favonius was a candidate for the ædileship and was losing his election, when Cato, who was present, observed that the voting tablets were written in one hand, and so proved the knavery, and by appealing to the tribunes stopped the return.", "6341": "Afterwards when Favonius was made sedile, Cato both administered the other duties of the ædileship, and superintended the ex­ hibitions in the theatre, giving to the actors not crowns of gold, but as is the fashion of Olympia, crowns of wild olive, and instead of costly presents, giving to the Greeks, turnips and lettuces and radishes and parsley ;", "6342": "t and to the Romans, earthen jars of wine, and hogs' flesh, and figs and gourds, and bundles of wood, at the thrift of which gifts some laughed, but others treated the matter in a respectful way, seeing the austere and serious countenance of Cato im­ perceptibly assuming a pleasant expression.", "6343": "Finally, Favonius, mingling with the crowd and sitting among the spectators, applauded Cato, and called out to him to give to those who were distinguishing themselves, and to honour them, and he urged the spectators to the same effect, inasmuch as he had surrendered all his authority to Cato.", "6344": "Now in the other theatre, Curio, the colleague of Favonius, was conducting the celebration in splendid style, but still the people left him to go to the other place, and they readily joined in the amusement of Favonius playing a private part and Cato the part of the superintendent of the exhibitions.", "6345": "And Cato did this to disparage the thing and to show that when a man is in sport he should use sportive ways, and accompany it with unpretending kind­ ness rather than with much preparation and great cost, bestowing great care and trouble on things of no value.", "6346": "XLVII.", "6347": "Now when Scipio and Hypsæus and Milo * were candidates for the consulship, and were employing not merely those wrongful ways that were now familiar and had become usual in matters political, the giving of gifts and bribery, but were plainly pushing on through arms and slaughter to civil war, in their daring and mad­ ness, and some persons were urging Pompeius to preside over the comitia, Cato at first opposed this and said, that the laws should not owe their maintenance to Pompeius, but that Pompeius should owe his security to the laws.", "6348": "However, when there had been an anarchy for some time, and three armies were occupying the Forum daily, and the mischief had well nigh become past checking, he determined in favour of putting affairs in the hands of Pompeius before the extreme necessity arrived, by the voluntary favour of the Senate, and by employing the most moderate of unconstitutional means as a healing measure for the the settlement of what was most impor­ taut, to bring on the monarchy rather than to let the civil dissensions result in a monarchy.", "6349": "Accordingly Bibulus, who was a friend of Cato, proposed that they ought to elect Pompeius sole consul, for that either matters would be put into a good condition by his settle­ ment of them, or that the state would be enslaved by the best man in it.", "6350": "Cato rose and spoke in favour of the pro­ posal, which nobody could have expected, and recom­ mended any government as better than no government:", "6351": "and he added, that he expected that Pompeius would manage present affairs best, and would protect the state with which he was intrusted.", "6352": "XLVIII.", "6353": "Pompeius * being thus declared consul prayed Cato to come to him to the suburbs:", "6354": "and on his arrival Pompeius received him in a friendly manner with salutations and pressing of hands, and after acknowledging his obligations he entreated Cato to be his adviser and his assessor in the consulship.", "6355": "But Cato replied, that neither had he said what he first said out of evil disposi.", "6356": "tion towards Pompeius, nor had he said what he last said in order to win his favour, but everything for the interest of the state;", "6357": "accordingly he observed that he would give Pompeius his advice when he was privately invited, but that in public, even if he should not be in­ vited, he would certainly say what he thought.", "6358": "And he did as he said.", "6359": "In the first place, when Pompeius was proposing laws with new penalties and severe proceedings against those who had already bribed the people, Cato advised him not to care about the past, but to attend to the future, for he said, it was not easy to determine at what point the inquiry into past offences should stop, and if penalties be imposed after the offences, those would be hardly dealt with who were punished by a law which they were not breaking at the time of their wrong-doing.", "6360": "In the next place, when many men of rank were under trial, some of whom were friends and relations of Pom­ peius, Cato observing that Pompeius was giving way to the greater part of them and yielding, rebuked him firmly and roused him up.", "6361": "Though Pompeius himself had caused a law to be passed which did not allow the panegyrics which used to be pronounced on those who were under trial, ho wrote a panegyric on Munatius Plancus * on the occasion of his trial and handed it in, but Cato by stop­ ping his ears with his hands, for he happened to be one of the judices, prevented the testimonial from being read.", "6362": "Plancus challenged Cato as one of the judices after the speeches, but nevertheless he was convicted.", "6363": "And altogether Cato was a kind of thing difficult and un­ manageable for persons accused, as they were neither willing to have him to be a judex, nor could they venture to challenge him.", "6364": "For not a few were convicted because, by being unwilling to have Cato for one of their judices, they were considered to show that they had no confidence in the justice of their cause;", "6365": "and their revilers even charged it upon some as matter of great reproach that they would not have Cato as one of their judices when he was proposed.", "6366": "XLIX.", "6367": "Now when Cæsar, though he kept close to his armies in Gaul and stuck to arms, was still employing gifts and money and friends to secure his power in the city, Cato's admonitions roused Pompeius from his former long continued state of incredulity, and he began to be afraid of the danger;", "6368": "but as he was somewhat hesita­ ting and spiritlessly procrastinating all attempts at pre­ vention, Cato resolved to be a candidate for the consul­ ship with the view of either forthwith wresting Cæsar's arms from him or demonstrating his designs.", "6369": "But the rival candidates were both popular men:", "6370": "and Sulpiciust had already derived much advantage from Cato's reputa­ tion in the state and his influence.", "6371": "He therefore seemed to be doing what was neither just nor grateful, but yet Cato found no fault with him. \"", "6372": "What is it strange,\" said he, \"if a man does not give up to another the thing which he thinks to be the greatest of goods?\"", "6373": "But Cato by persuading the Senate to pass a Consultum that those who were candidates for the office should canvass the people themselves, and should not solicit through any other person, not even by such person going about to see the citizens on their behalf, still more irritated the citizens, in that by depriving them not only of the opportunity of receiving money, but even of conferring a favour, he rendered the people at once poor and dishonoured.", "6374": "In addition to this, as Cato had neither any persuasive manners in canvassing for himself, but wished to main­ tain the dignity of his life in his character rather than to add to it that of the consulship by shaking hands with the electors, and as he would not allow his friends to do the things by which the mass are taken and gained over, he lost the office.", "6375": "L.", "6376": "Though the matter caused not only to those who failed, but to their friends and kin a certain degree of shame and depression and sorrow for many days, Cato bore what had happened with so little concern, that after anointing himself in the Campus he exercised at ball, and again after dinner, according to his wont, he went down into the Forum without his shoes and tunic, and walked about with his intimates.", "6377": "But Cicero blames him, that when the times required such a magistrate, he used no exertion nor tried to gain the favour of the people by friendly intercourse with them, but for the future ceased to make any effort and gave up the contest, though he was again a candidate for the prætorship.", "6378": "Cato, however, said, that he lost the prætorship not by the real will of the majority, but because they were forced or corrupted;", "6379": "whereas in the voting for the consulship, in which there was no foul play, he further perceived that he had dis­ pleased the people by his manners, which it was not the part of a man of sense to change in order to please others, nor, if he still kept to the like manners, to subject himself to the like treatment.", "6380": "LI.", "6381": "When Caesar had attacked warlike nations and had conquered them with great hazard, and when it was the opinion that he had fallen upon the Germans even after a truce had been made, and had destroyed three hundred thousand- of them, the rest indeed were promising to the people to offer sacrifices for the victory, but Cato urged that they should give up Cæsar to those who had been wronged, and should not turn the guilt upon themselves nor allow it to fall on the state.", "6382": "“", "6383": "However,\" said he, “ let us still sacrifice to the gods, that they do not turn their vengeance for the madness and desperation of the commander upon the soldiers, and that they spare the city.\"", "6384": "Upon this Cæsar wrote and sent a letter to the Senate;", "6385": "and when the letter had been read, which con­ tained much abuse of Cato and many charges against him, Cato got up, and not under the influence of passion or personal animosity, but as if it were on good consideration and due preparation, showed that the charges against him were in the nature of abuse and insult, and were pure trifling and mockery on Cæsar’s part.", "6386": "Then taking hold of all Cæsar’s measures from the first, and unveiling all his plans, not as if he were an enemy, but a fellow con­ spirator and participator, he proved to them that they had no reason to fear the sons of the Britons nor yet the Celts, but Cæsar himself, if they were prudent;", "6387": "and he so worked on and excited them that the friends of Cæsar repented of having read the letter in the Senate, and so given Cato an opportunity of making a fair statement and true charges.", "6388": "Nothing, however, was done, but it was merely said that it would be well for a successor to Cæsar to be appointed.", "6389": "But when Cæsar's friends required that Pompeius also should lay down his arms and give up his provinces, or that Cæsar should not, Cato cried out, that now what he foretold them had come to pass, and that the man was having recourse to force and was openly employ­ ing the power which he had got by deceiving and gulling the estate ;", "6390": "yet Cato could do nothing out of doors, because the people all along wished Cæsar to have the chief power, and he found the Senate ready to assent to his measures, but afraid of the people.", "6391": "LII.", "6392": "But when Ariminum * was captured, and news came that Cæsar with his army was advancing against the city, then indeed all men turned their eyes on Cato, both the people and Pompeius, as the only man who from the first had foreseen and who had first clearly shown the designs of Cæsar.", "6393": "Accordingly Cato said, “ Men, if any among you had listened to what I had all along been foretelling and advising, you would neither have to fear a single man now, nor would you have to rest all your hopes on a single man.\"", "6394": "Upon Pompeius saying that Cato had indeed spoken more like a prophet, but that he had acted more like a friend, Cato advised the Senate to place affairs in the hands of Pompeius alone, for it was the business of those who caused great evils to put an end to them.", "6395": "Now as Pompeius had not a force in readi­ ness, and he saw that the troops which he was then levy­ ing had no zeal, he left Rome.", "6396": "Cato having determined to follow Pompeius in his flight, sent his younger son into the country of the Bruttii † to Munatius for safe keeping, but the elder he took with him.", "6397": "And as his household and daughters required some one to look after them, he took again Marcia, who was now a widow with a large estate, for Hortensius at his death had made her his heir.", "6398": "It was with reference to this that Caesar vented most abuse on Cato, and charged him with covet­ ousness and making a traffic of his marriage;", "6399": "for why should he give up his wife, said Cæsar, if he still wanted one, or why should he take her back, if he did not want one ?", "6400": "if it was not that from the first * the woman was put as a bait in the way of Hortensius, and Cato gave her up when she was young that he might have her back when she was rich.", "6401": "Now, in reply to these charges, this from Euripides suffices:", "6402": "— \"First then what can't be said, for of this kind I deem thy so oall'd cowardice, 0 Hercules.", "6403": "\"For to accuse Cato of filthy lucre is like upbraiding Hercules with cowardice.", "6404": "But whether the matter of the marriage was not well in other respects is a thing for inquiry.", "6405": "However, Cato did espouse Marcia, and intrusting to her his family and daughters, hurried after Pompeius.", "6406": "LIII.", "6407": "From that day it is said that Cato never cut the hair of his head or beard, nor put on a chaplet, but main­ tained till his death the same outward signs of sorrow and depression of spirits and grief over the misfortunes of his country, just the same when his party was victorious and when it was vanquished.", "6408": "At that time having got by lot Sicily as his province, he crossed over to Syracuso, and on hearing that Asinius Pollio t had arrived from the enemy with a largs force at Messene, he sent to him to demand the reason of his coming.", "6409": "But Cato in turn being asked for the reason of the change in affairs, and having heard that Pompeius had completely deserted Italy and was encamped in Dyrrachium, he said that there was great perplexity and uncertainty in matters appertaining to the gods.", "6410": "Pompeius, who had always been invincible while he was doing what was not honest or just, now when he wished to save his country and fight in defence of liberty, was deserted by his good fortune.", "6411": "As to Asinius, he said that he was able to drive him out of Sicily, but as another greater force was coming against him, he did not choose to ruin the island by a war;", "6412": "and after advising the Syracusans to join the victorious party and to take care of themselves, he sailed away.", "6413": "When he came to Pompeius, he kept steadily to one opinion, to prolong the war, for he expected some terms of reconciliation and did not wish that the state should be worsted in a battle and suffer from itself the extreme of sufferings by having its fate determined by the sword.", "6414": "And he persuaded Pompeius and his council to other determinations akin to these, neither to plunder any city that was subject to the Romans, nor to put to death any Roman except on the field of battle;", "6415": "and he gained good opinion and brought over many to the side of Pompeius, who were pleased with his moderation and mildness.", "6416": "LIV.", "6417": "Being sent to Asia to help those there who were collecting vessels and an army, he took with him his sister Servilia and her young child by Lucullus.", "6418": "For Servilia, who was now a widow, followed Cato, and she removed much of the evil report about her licentious conduct by voluntarily subjecting herself to the guardian­ ship of Cato and his wanderings and mode of life.", "6419": "But Caesar * did not spare his abuse of Cato even with respect to Servilia.", "6420": "However as it seems the generals of Pompeius did not want the assistance of Cato at all;", "6421": "and after persuading the Rhodians to join the side of Pompeius and leaving Servilia and the child there, he returned to Pompeius, who had already a splendid military force and a naval power with him.", "6422": "Here indeed Pompeius appeared most clearly to show his mind;", "6423": "for at first he intended to give to Cato the command of the ships, and the fighting vessels were not fewer than five hundred, and the Liburnian and spy ships and open boats were very numerous:", "6424": "but having soon perceived, or it having been hinted to him by his friends, that it was the one chief thing in all the policy of Cato to liberate his country, and that if he should have the command of so great a force, the very day on which they should defeat Cæsar, Cato would require Pompeius also to lay down his arms and to follow the laws, he changed his mind though he had already spoken with him, and he appointed Bibulus commander of the ships.", "6425": "Yet he found not Cato's zeal dulled by this;", "6426": "for it is told that when Pompeius was urging his troops to a battle before Dyrrachium and bidding each of the commanders say something and to encourage the men, the soldiers heard them with listlessness and silence;", "6427": "but when Cato, after the rest, had gone through all the topics derived from philosophy that were suitable to the occasion to be said about liberty and virtue, and death and good fame, with great emotion on his part, and finally addressed himself to invoke the gods as being there present and watching over the struggle on behalf of their country, there was so loud an acclamation and so great a movement in the whole army thus excited, that all the commanders hastened to the contest full of hopes.", "6428": "The soldiers of Pompeius routed and defeated the enemy, but the dæmon of Cæsar prevented the completion of the victory by taking advantage of the caution of Pompeius and his want of confidence in his success.", "6429": "Now this is told in the Life of Pompeius.*", "6430": "But while all were rejoicing and magnifying the victory, Cato wept for his country and bewailed the love of power that brought destruction and misfortune with it, when he saw that many brave citizens had fallen by the hands of one another.", "6431": "LV.", "6432": "When Pompeius in order to pursue Cæsar broke up his camp to march into Thessaly, he left at Dyrrachium a great quantity of arms and stores, and many kinsmen and friends, and he appointed Cato commander and guardian over all with fifteen cohorts, both because he trusted and feared the man.", "6433": "For if he were defeated, he considered that Cato would be his surest support;", "6434": "but that if he were victorious, Cato would not, if he were present, let him manage matters as he chose.", "6435": "Many men of rank also were left behind in Dyrrachium with Cato.", "6436": "When the defeat at Pharsalus took place, Cato resolved that if Pompeius were dead, he would take over to Italy those who were with him, and himself would live an exile as far from the tyranny as possible;", "6437": "but if Pompeius were alive, that he would by all means keep together the force for him.", "6438": "Accordingly having crossed over to Cercyra, where the navy was, he proposed to give up the command to Cicero, who was a consular, while he was only of praetorian tank ;", "6439": "but when Cicero would not accept the command and set off for Italy, Cato observing that Pompeius* through his stubborn self-will and unreasonable temper was desirous of punishing those who were sailing away, privately admonished and pacified him, by which Cato manifestly saved Cicero from death and secured the safety of the rest.", "6440": "LVI.", "6441": "Conjecturing that Pompeius Magnus would make his escape to Egypt or to Libya, and being in haste to join him, Cato with all whom he had about him weighed anchor and set sail after permitting all those to go away or stay behind who were not ready to accompany him.", "6442": "He reached Libya, and coasting along he fell in with Sextus,t the younger son of Pompeius, who reported to him his father's death in Egypt.", "6443": "Now they were all much troubled, and no one after the death of Pompeius would obey any other commander while Cato was present.", "6444": "Wherefore Cato, out of respect to those who were with him, and because he had not heart to desert and leave in difficulties the brave men who had given proof of their fidelity, undertook the command and went along the coast till he came to Cyrene;", "6445": "for the people received him though a few days before they had shut out Labienus.", "6446": "Upon hearing that Scipio, the father-in-law of Pompeius, had been well received by King Juba, and that Varus Attius, who had been appointed governor of Libya by Pompeius, was with them with a force, he set out by land in the winter season, having got together a number of asses to carry water, and driving along with him a quantity of cattle, and also taking chariots and the people called Psylli,‡ who cure the bites of serpents by sucking out the poison with their mouths, and deaden and soothe the serpents themselves by charming them with music.", "6447": "Though the march was seven days in succession, Cato led at the head of his men without using horse or beast of burden.", "6448": "And he continued to sup in a sitting posture from the day that he heard of the defeat at Pharsalus, and he added this further sign of his sorrow, never to lie down except when he was sleeping.", "6449": "Having spent the winter in Libya * he led forth his army;", "6450": "and the men were near ten thousand.", "6451": "LVII.", "6452": "Matters were in bad plight between Scipio and Varus, for in consequence of their disagreement and dis­ union they were secretly trying to win the favour of Juba,t who was intolerable for the arrogance of his temper and his haughtiness by reason of his wealth and power.", "6453": "When he was going to have his first interview with Cato, Juba placed his seat between the seats of Scipio and Cato.", "6454": "However, when Cato observed it, he took up his seat and moved it to the other side so as to leave Scipio in the middle, though Scipio was his enemy, and had published a certain writing which contained abuse of Cato.", "6455": "This, indeed, people make no account of;", "6456": "but they blame Cato that in Sicily he placed Philostratus t in the middle, as he was walking about with him, to do honour to philosophy.", "6457": "On this occasion, however, he checked Juba, who had all but made Scipio and Varus his satraps, and he reconciled them.", "6458": "Though all invited Cato to the command, and Scipio and Varus were the first to surrender and give it up to him, he said that he would not break the laws in defence of which they were fight­ ing against him who broke them, nor would he place himself, who was a proprætor, before a proconsul who was present.", "6459": "For Scipio had been appointed proconsul, and the majority, on account of the name, had confidence that they should be successful, if a Scipio commanded in Libya.", "6460": "LVIII.", "6461": "However when Scipio* immediately on receiv­ ing the command, wished to please Juba by putting to death all the people of Utica who were capable of bear­ ing arms, and to dig down the city, because it favoured Cæsar, Cato would not endure this, but with adjurations and loud cries in the council and by appealing to the gods he with difficulty rescued the people from their cruelty;", "6462": "and partly at the request of the citizens of Utica t and partly at the instance of Scipio, he undertook to keep guard in the city, that it should not either involuntarily or voluntarily join Cæsar.", "6463": "For the place was in all respects advantageous, and defensible by those who held it;", "6464": "and it was strengthened still more by Cato.", "6465": "For he brought abundance of corn into the city, and he strength­ ened the walls by raising towers, and making strong ditches and palisado-work in front of the city.", "6466": "To the people of Utica who were able to bear arms he assigned the palisado-work as their quarter, and made them give up their arms to him ;", "6467": "but he kept the rest in the city, and took great care that they should not be wronged and should suffer no harm from the Romans.", "6468": "He also sent out a groat quantity of arms, supplies and grain to those in camp, and altogether he made the city the storehouse for the war.", "6469": "But the advice which he gave Pompeius before, and gave Scipio then, not to fight with a man of a warlike turn and great ability, but to take advantage of time which wastes all the vigour wherein the strength of tyranny lies, Scipio through self-will despised;", "6470": "and on one occasion he wrote to Cato upbraiding him with cowardice, in that he was not content to sit down within a city and walls, but would not even let others boldly use their own judgment as opportunity offered.", "6471": "To this Cato replied, that he was ready to take the legionary soldiers and horsemen whom he had brought into Libya, and carry them over to Italy, and so make Cæsar change his place and to turn him from them to himself.", "6472": "And when Scipio mocked at this also, it was clear that Cato was much annoyed that he had declined the command, for he saw that Scipio would neither conduct the war well, nor, if he should succeed contrary to expectation, would he behave with moderation to the citizens in his victory.", "6473": "Accordingly Cato formed the opinion and men­ tioned it to some of his friends, that he had no good hopes of the war on account of the inexperience and confidence of the commanders, but if there should be any good fortune, and Cæsar should be worsted, he would not stay in Rome, and would fly from the harshness and cruelty of Scipio, who was even then uttering dreadful and extravagant threats against many.", "6474": "But it turned out worse than he expected;", "6475": "and late in the evening there arrived a messenger from the camp who had been three days on the road, with the news that a great battle had been fought at Thapsus * in which their affairs were entirely ruined, that Cæsar was in possession of the camps, Scipio and Juba had escaped with a few men, and the rest of the army was destroyed.", "6476": "LIX.", "6477": "On the arrival of this intelligence, the city, as was natural on the receipt of such news by night and in time of war, nearly lost its reason, and hardly contained itself within the walls;", "6478": "but Cato coming forward, when­ ever he met with any one running about and calling out, laid hold of him, and cheering him took away the excessive fright and confusion of his alarm, by saying that matters perchance were not so bad as they had been reported, but were magnified by rumour;", "6479": "and so he stayed the tumult.", "6480": "At daybreak he made proclamation that the three hundred, whom he had as a Senate, and these were Romans, and were carrying on business in Libya as merchants and money-lenders, should assemble at the temple of Jupiter, and also all the Roman senators who were present and their sons.", "6481": "While they were still assembling, Cato ad­ vanced, without hurry and with a tranquil countenance, as if nothing new had happened, holding a book in his hand, which he was reading;", "6482": "and this was a register of the military engines, arms, corn, bows, and legionary soldiers.", "6483": "When they had come together, beginning with the three hundred, and commending at some length the zeal and fidelity which they had displayed in aiding with their means and persons and advice, he exhorted them not to let their hopes be destroyed, and not severally to pro­ vide for their flight or escape.", "6484": "For, he said, that if they would keep together, Cæsar would despise them less if they made resistance, and would spare them more if they asked his mercy.", "6485": "And he urged them to deliberate about themselves, and that he would not find fault with their deciding either way, and if they should be disposed to turn to the fortunate side, he should attribute the change to necessity;", "6486": "but if they preferred to oppose the danger and to undertake the hazard in defence of liberty, he should not only commend them, but admire their virtue, and make himself their commander and fellow-combatant, till they had tried the last fortune of their country, which was not Utica or Adrumetum only, but Rome, that had often by her might recovered from greater falls.", "6487": "And they had many grounds for safety and security;", "6488": "and chief of all, that they were warring against a man who was pulled in many directions by the circumstances of the times, for Iberia had gone over to Pompeius the young, and Rome herself had not yet altogether received the bit for want of being used to it, but was impatient of suffering and ready to rise up collected upon every change, and danger was not a thing to fly from, but they should take as a pattern the enemy, who was not sparing of his life for accomplishing the greatest wrongs, and for whom the uncertainty of the war had not the same result as for them, to whom it would bring the happiest life, if they were successful, and the most glorious death if they failed.", "6489": "However, he said they ought to deliberate by themselves, and he joined them in praying that in consideration of their former virtue and zeal what they resolved might be for the best.", "6490": "LX.", "6491": "When Cato had spoken to this effect, some of them indeed were brought to confidence by his words;", "6492": "but the greater part seeing his fearlessness and noble and generous temper, nearly forgot present circumstances, and considering him alone as an invincible leader and superior to all fortune, prayed him to use their persons and pro­ perty and arms as he judged best, for they said it was better to die in obedience to him than to save their lives by betraying such virtue.", "6493": "On a certain person observing that they should declare freedom to the slaves, and most of them assenting to this, Cato said he would not do so, for it was not lawful nor yet right;", "6494": "but if the masters were ready to give up their slaves, they should receive those who were of military age.", "6495": "Many offers were made, and Cato, after telling them to enrol every man who was willing, retired.", "6496": "Shortly after there came to him letters from Juba and Scipio;", "6497": "from Juba, who was hid in a mountain with a few men, asking him what he had re­ solved to do ;", "6498": "and that if Cato left Utica he would wait for him, and if he stood a siege he would come to aid him with an army;", "6499": "from Scipio, who was in a vessel off a certain point not far from Utica, and waiting with the same views.", "6500": "LXI.", "6501": "Accordingly Cato determined to detain the letter- carriers till he had confirmed the resolution of the three hundred.", "6502": "For the senators were zealous, and immediately manumitted their slaves, and set about arming them.", "6503": "But with respect to the three hundred, inasmuch as they were men engaged in maritime affairs and money lending, and had the chief part of their substance in slaves, the words of Catestood no long time in them, but oozed out, just as bodies which have a great degree of rarity easily receive heat and again part with it, being cooled when the fire is removed;", "6504": "in like manner Cato, while they saw him, fanned the flame and warmed those men;", "6505": "but when they began to reflect by themselves, the fear of Caesar drove out of them all regard to Cato and to honour.", "6506": "“", "6507": "Who are we,\" said they, “ and who is the man whose commands we are refusing to obey ?", "6508": "Is not this Cæsar, to whom the whole power of the Romans has been transferred?", "6509": "and not one of us is a Scipio, nor a Pompeius, nor a Cato.", "6510": "But at a time when all men by reason of fear are humbled in mind more than is fitting, at such a time shall we fight in defence of the liberty of the Romans, and contend in Utica against a man before whom Cato with Pompeius Magnus fled and gave up Italy;", "6511": "and shall we manumit our slaves to oppose Cæsar, we who have only as much free­ dom as he shall choose to give ?", "6512": "No, even yet, miserable wretches, let us know our own weakness, and deprecate the conqueror, and send persons to supplicate him.\"", "6513": "This was what the most moderate among the three hundred recommended;", "6514": "but the majority were forming a design on the senatorial class, with the hope that, if they seized them, they would pacify Cæsar's rage against themselves.", "6515": "LXII.", "6516": "Though Cato suspected the change, he took no notice of it.", "6517": "However he wrote to Scipio and Juba to tell them to keep away from Utica, because he distrusted the three hundred, and he sent off the letter-carriers.", "6518": "But the horsemen who had escaped from the battle, no contemptible number, riding up to Utica, sent to Cato three men, who did not bring the same message from all;", "6519": "for one party was bent on going to Juba, another wished to join Cato, and a third was afraid of entering Utica.", "6520": "Cato on hearing this ordered Marcus Rubrius to observe the three hundred and quietly to receive the registrations of those who manumitted their slaves without forcing any one;", "6521": "and himself taking the senatorial men went out of Utica, and meeting with the commanders of the cavalry he besought them not to betray so many Roman senators, nor to choose Juba for their commander in place of Cato but to secure their own safety and that of the rest by coming into a city which could not be taken by storm, and contained both corn and other resources for many years.", "6522": "The senatorial men joined in this prayer and wept;", "6523": "and the commanders conferred with the cavalry, while Cato sat down on a mound with the senatorial men and waited for the answer.", "6524": "LXIII.", "6525": "In the meantime Rubrius came in a passion, charging the three hundred with great disorder and tumult, inasmuch, as they were falling off and disturbing the city.", "6526": "On which the rest, altogether despairing, fell to weeping and lamentation, but Cato attempted to cheer them, and sent to the three hundred and bade them wait.", "6527": "But the representatives on the part of the horsemen came with no reasonable requisitions:", "6528": "for they said that they neither wanted Juba for their pay-master, nor were they afraid of Cæsar if they had Cato to command them, but it was a dangerous thing to shut themselves up with the citizens of Utica, who were Phœnicians and an inconstant people;", "6529": "and if they should keep quiet now, they would set upon them and betray them, when Cæsar came.", "6530": "If then any man wanted their aid in war and their presence, he must eject or kill all the people of Utica, and then invite them into a city free from enemies and barbarians.", "6531": "Cato considered this to be an excessively savage and barbarous proposal, but he answered mildly and said that he would consult with the three hundred.", "6532": "When he had returned into the city he found the men no longer making pretexts or evasions out of respect to him, but openly complaining that any one should force them to fight with Cæsar when they were neither able nor willing.", "6533": "Some even whispered with respect to the senatorial men, that they ought to keep them in the city, since Cæsar was near.", "6534": "Cato let this pass as if he did not hear it, and indeed he was some­ what deaf;", "6535": "but when one came up to him and reported that the horsemen were going away, Cato, fearing that the three hundred might do something desperate to the sena­ torial men, got up with his friends and set out walking;", "6536": "but observing that they had already advanced some dis­ tance, he seized a horse and rode to them.", "6537": "The horsemen were glad to see him approach, and received him and urged him to save himself with them.", "6538": "Then it is said that Uato even shed tears, beseeching on behalf of the senatorial men and holding forth his hands, and turning back the horses of some and laying hold of their arms, until he prevailed on them to abide there for that day at least, and secure the senatorial men in their flight.", "6539": "LXIV.", "6540": "When Cato arrived with the horsemen, and had posted some at the gates, and had delivered the citadel to others to watch, the three hundred, who were afraid that they should be punished for their change, sent to Cato and prayed him by all means to come to them.", "6541": "But the senatorial men crowding round him would not let him go, and they declared that they would not give up their guardian and saviour to faithless men and traitors.", "6542": "For a most lively perception, as it appears, and affection and admiration of Cato's virtue had been implanted in all alike who were in Utica, inasmuch as nothing spurious or deceitful was mingled with what he did.", "6543": "And as the man had long resolved to kill himself, he laboured with prodigious toil, and had care and pain on behalf of others, in order that after placing all in safety he might be released from life.", "6544": "For his resolution to die was no secret, though he said nothing.", "6545": "Accord­ ingly he complied with the wish of the three hundred after comforting the senatorial men, and he went alone to the three hundred, who thanked him, and prayed him to employ them and trust them in everything else, and if they are not Catos, and not capable of the lofty mind of Cato, he should have pity on their weakness;", "6546": "and as they had determined to supplicate Cæsar and to send to him, on Cato'is behalf chiefly and for him first of all they would prefer their prayer;", "6547": "and if they could not prevail on Cæsar, neither would they receive the grace if it were offered to themselves, but so long as they breathed would fight for him.", "6548": "In reply to this Cato commended their good intentions, but said that they ought for their own safety'is sake to send quickly, and not to offer any petition on his behalf, for entreaty belonged to the vanquished, and deprecation of vengeance to those who were wrongdoers;", "6549": "that he had not only been unvanquished all through life, but that he was victorious as far as he chose to be, and had the superiority over Cæsar in things honourable and just, and that Cæsar was the party who was captured and conquered;", "6550": "for what he used to deny that he was doing against his country long ago, he was now convicted of and detected therein.", "6551": "LXV.", "6552": "Having thus spoken to the three hundred he went away, and hearing that Cæsar at the head of all his army was already on his march, “ Ha!", "6553": "” said he, \" he considers that lie has to deal with men;", "6554": "\" and turning to the senators he urged them not to delay, but to make their escape while the horsemen were still staying there.", "6555": "He also closed the gates, except one that led to the sea, where he assigned vessels to those under his command and preserved order by stopping wrong- doing and settling disturbances, and supplying with stores those who were ill provided.", "6556": "And when Marcus Octavius * with two legions had encamped near, and had sent a message to Cato, in which he called on Cato to come to some terms with him about the command, Cato gave him no answer, but he said to his friends, “ Do wo wonder why our affairs are ruined, when we see that love of power abides among us even when we are in tho midst of ruin?\"", "6557": "In the mean time hearing that the horsemen, as they were leaving the city, were pillaging and plundering the people of Utica, as if their property was booty, Cato hurried to them as fast as he could run, and took the plunder from the first that he met with, and the rest made haste to throw it away or set it down on tho ground, and all of them for very shame retired in silence and with downcast looks.", "6558": "Cato having called together the people of Utica in the city, entreated them not to irritate Cæsar against the three hundred, but to unite altogether to secure their safety.", "6559": "Then again betaking himself to the sea he inspected the persons who were embarking, and all his friends and acquaintance whom he could persuade to go away, he embraced and accompanied to the shore.", "6560": "But he did not recommend his son to take shipping, nor did he think it his duty to turn him from his purpose of sticking to his father.", "6561": "There was one Statyllius, in years a young man, but one who aimed at being resolute in character and an imitator of the indiffei ence of Cato.", "6562": "This man Cato entreated to embark, for he was noto­ riously a hater of Caesar;", "6563": "and when he would not go, Cato looking on Apollonides the Stoic and Demetrius the Peri­ patetic said—“", "6564": "It is your business to soften this stubborn man and to fashion him to his own interests.\"", "6565": "But Cato himself was busied all the night and the greatest part of the following day in assisting the rest in making their escape and helping those who wanted his aid.", "6566": "LXVI.", "6567": "When Lucius Cæsar,* who was a kinsman of Cæsar, and about to go to him as ambassador on behalf of the three hundred, urged Cato to help him in devising some plausible speech which he should employ on behalf of the three hundred, “ for on thy behalf,\" he continued, “ it is becoming for me to touch the hands and to fall down at the knees of Cæsar,” Cato would not allow him to do this, and said, “ For my part, if I wished to save my life by Caesar's favour, I ought to go to him myself.", "6568": "But I do not choose to thank a tyrant for his illegal acts;", "6569": "and he acts illegally in sparing as master those whom he has no right to lord it over.", "6570": "However, if you please, let us consider how you shall get pardon for the three hundred.”", "6571": "After talking with Lucius on this matter he presented his son and his friends to him as he was departing, and after accompanying him some distance and taking leave of him he returned home, and then calling together his son and his friends he spoke on many subjects, among which he forbade his son to meddle in political matters, for, he said, circumstances no longer allowed him to act as befitted a Cato, and to act otherwise was base.", "6572": "At evening he went to the bath.", "6573": "While he was bathing, he remembered Statyllius, and calling out aloud he said, “ Apollonides, have you sent Statyllius away, and brought him down from his stubborn temper, and has the man gone without even taking leave of us ? \" “ By no means.” replied Apollonides, “ though we said much to him, but he is lofty and immovable and says he will stay and do whatever you do.\"", "6574": "On this they say that Cato smiled and replied, “ Well, this will soon be shown.\"LXVII.", "6575": "After taking the bath he supped in much company, still sitting as his fashion had been since the battle, for he never reclined except when he was sleeping;", "6576": "and there were at supper with him all his friends and the magistrates of Utica.", "6577": "After supper the drinking went on with much gaiety and enjoyment, one philosophical sub­ ject after another taking its turn, till at last the enquiry came round to the so-called paradoxes of the Stoics, that the good man alone is free, and that all the bad are slaves.", "6578": "Hereupon the Peripatetic making objections, as one might expect, Cato broke in with great vehemence, and with a loud tone and harsh voice maintained his discourse at great length, and displayed wonderful energy, so that no one failed to observe that he had resolved to end his life and relieve himself from present troubles.", "6579": "Wherefore as there was silence and depression of spirits among all the company, after he had done speaking, with the view of cheering them up and diverting their suspicions, Cato again begun to put questions and to express anxiety about the state of affairs, and his fears for those who had sailed away, and also for those who were going through a water­ less and barbarian desert.", "6580": "LXVIII.", "6581": "At the end of the entertainment he took his usual walk with his friends after supper, and after giving the officers of the watch the proper orders, he retired to his chamber, but he first embraced his son and his friends with more than his usual expression of kindness, which again made them suspect what was going to happen.", "6582": "On entering his chamber and lying down he took Plato's dialogue on the Soul,* and when he had gone through the greater part of it, he looked up over his head, and not seeing his sword hanging there, for his son had caused it to be taken away while he was at supper, he called a slave and asked who had taken his sword.", "6583": "The slave made no answer and Cato was again at the book, but after a short interval, as if he were in no haste or hurry, and was merely looking for his sword, he bade the slave bring it.", "6584": "As there was some delay and nobody brought it, alter having read the dialogue through he again called his slaves one by one, and raising his voice demanded his sword;", "6585": "and striking the mouth of one of them with his fist he bruised his hand, being in a great passion and calling out aloud that he was surrendered defenceless to the enemy by his son and his slaves, till at last his son ran in weeping with his friends, and embracing him fell to lamentations and entreaties.", "6586": "But Cato rising up looked sternly and said, “ When and where have I been proved, and without knowing it, to have lost my reason, that no one instructs me or teaches me in the matters wherein I air- judged to have determined ill, but I am hindered from using my own reasonings and am deprived of my weapons ?", "6587": "Why don't you put your father in chains also, generous son, and his hands behind his back, till Caesar shall come and find me unable even to defend myself?", "6588": "For I need not a sword to kill myself, when it is in my power to die by holding my breath for a short time and giving my head a single blow against the wall.", "6589": "\"LXIX.", "6590": "As he said this the youth went out weeping, and all the rest, except Demetrius and Apollonides, to whom when they were left by themselves Cato began to speak in milder terms, and said, “ I suppose you too have resolved by force to keep alive a man of my age and to sit here in silence and to watch him, or are you come to prove that it is neither a shocking nor a shameful thing for Cato, when he has no other way to save his life, to wait for mercy from his enemy ?", "6591": "Why then do you not speak and convince me of this and teach me a new doctrine, that we may cast away those former opinions and reasons in which we lived together, and being made wiser through Caesar owe him the greater thanks for it ?", "6592": "And yet for my part I have come to no resolve about myself, but it is necessary that when I have resolved I have power to do what I have determined.", "6593": "And I will deliberate in a manner together with you, deliberating with the reasons which even you in your philosophy follow.", "6594": "Go away then in good heart and tell my son not to force his father when he cannot persuade him.\"LXX.", "6595": "Upon this Demetrius and Apollonides without making any reply retired weeping.", "6596": "The sword was sent in by a child, and when Cato received it he drew it and looked at it.", "6597": "Seeing that the point was entire and the edge preserved, he said, \"Now I am my own master,\" and laying the sword down, he began reading the book again, and he is said to have read it through twice.-", "6598": "He then fell into so sound a sleep that those who were out­ side the chamber were aware of it, and about midnight he called his freedmen Cleanthes the physician and Butas whom he employed chief of all in public matters.", "6599": "He sent Butas to the sea to examine if all had set sail and to report to him, and he presented his hand to the phy­ sician to tie it up, as it was inflamed from the blow which he gave the slave.", "6600": "And this made them all more cheerful, for they thought that Cato was inclined to live.", "6601": "In a little time Butas came and reported that all had set sail except Crassus,t who was detained by some business, and that even he was now all but on board, and that a violent storm and wind prevailed at sea.", "6602": "Cato hearing this groaned for pity of those who were at sea and he sent Butas again to the sea, to learn if any one were driven back and waited any necessaries, and to let him know.", "6603": "And now the birds were beginning to sing,* and he sank asleep again for a while.", "6604": "When Butas had returned and reported that all was quiet about the ports, Cato, bidding him close the door, threw himself on the bed as if he were going to sleep for the rest of the night.", "6605": "When Butas had gone out, he drew the sword and thrust it beneath his chest, but as he used his hand with less effect owing to the inflammation, he did not immediately despatch him­ self, and having some difficulty in dying he fell from the bed and made a noise by overturning a little abacus of the geometrical kind that stood by, which his attendants per­ ceiving called out and his son and his friends immediately ran in.", "6606": "Seeing him smeared with blood and the greater part of his bowels protruding, though he was still alive and his eyes were open, they were all dreadfully alarmed, and the physician going up to him attempted to replace his bowels, which remained uninjured, and to sew up the wound.", "6607": "But when Cato recovered and saw this, he pushed the physician away, and tearing the bowels with his hands and at the same time rending the wound he died.", "6608": "†LXXI.", "6609": "In a space of time which one would not have thought enough for all in the house to have heard of the event, there were present at the door the three hundred, and soon after the people of Utica were assembled, with one voice calling Cato benefactor and saviour and the only free man, the only un vanquished.", "6610": "And this they did though it was told that Cæsar was advancing;", "6611": "but neither fear nor subserviency towards the conqueror nor their mutual differences and quarrels dulled them towards doing honour to Cato.", "6612": "They decorated the body in splendid style, and made a pompous proces­ sion and interred him near the sea, where a statue of him now stands with a sword in his hand, and then they began to think how they should save themselves and their city.", "6613": "LXXII.", "6614": "Cæsar hearing from those who came to him that Cato was staying in Utica and not flying away, and that he was sending off the rest, while himself and his companions and his son were fearlessly going about, thought it difficult to ascertain the intentions of the man, but as he made most account of him he advanced with his force by quick marches.", "6615": "When he heard of his death, it is reported that he said this, “ Cato, I grudge thee thy death, for thou hast grudged me thy safety.\"", "6616": "For in fact if Cato had submitted to receive his life from Cæsar, he would not have been considered to have lowered his own fame so much as to have added to the splendour of Cæsar’s.", "6617": "What would have been done is uncertain, but with respect to Cæsar
