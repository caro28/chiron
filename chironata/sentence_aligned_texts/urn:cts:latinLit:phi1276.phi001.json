38.2", "1": "He was either the son, or the foster-son, of a wealthy freedman, who gave him a liberal education.", "2": "From the period of his birth, till he had attained the age of forty, nothing more is known of him than that he continued to perfect himself in the study of eloquence, by declaiming, according to the practice of those days ;", "3": "yet more for his own amusement, than from any intention to prepare himself either for the schools or the courts of law.", "4": "About this time he seems to have discovered his true bent, and be­ taken himself to poetry.", "5": "Domitian was now at the head of the government, and showed symptoms of reviving that system of favouritism which had nearly ruined the empire under Claudius, by his unbounded partiality for a young pantomime dancer of the name of Paris.", "6": "Against this minion, Juvenal seems to have directed the first shafts of that satire which was destined to make the most powerful vices tremble, and shake .", "7": "the masters of the world on their thrones.", "8": "He composed a few lines1 on the influence of Paris, with considerable success, which encouraged him to cultivate this kind of poetry :", "9": "he had the prudence, however, not to trust himself to an auditory, in a reign which swarmed with informers ;", "10": "and his compositions were, therefore, secretly handed about amongst his friends.", "11": "1", "12": "By degrees he grew bolder;", "13": "and, having made many large additions to his first sketch, or perhaps re-cast it, produced what is now called his Seventh Satire, which he recited to a numerous assemblage.", "14": "The consequences were such as he had probably anticipated:", "15": "Paris, informed of the part which he bore in it, was seriously offended, and complained to the emperor, who, as the old account has it, sent the author, by an easy kind of punishment, into Egypt with a military com­ mand.", "16": "To remove such a man from his court must undoubt­ edly have been desirable to Domitian ;", "17": "and, as he was spoken of with kindness in the same Satire, which is entirely free from political allusions, the \" facetiousness \" of the punishment (though Domitian's was not a facetious reign) renders the fact not altogether improbable.", "18": "Yet, when we consider that these reflections on Paris could scarcely have been published before LXXXIV., and that the favourite was disgraced and put to death almost immediately after, we shall be inclined to doubt whether his banishment actually took place;", "19": "or, if it did, whether it was of any long duration.", "20": "That Juvenal was in Egypt is certain ;", "21": "but he might have gone there from motives of personal safety, or, as Salmasius has it, of curiosity.", "22": "How­ ever this may be, it does not appear that he was ever long absent from Rome, where a thousand internal marks clearly show that all his Satires were written.", "23": "But whatever punish­ ment might have followed the complaint of Paris, 1 it had no other effect on our author, than that of increasing his hatred of tyranny, and turning his indignation upon the emperor himself, whose hypocrisy, cruelty, and licentiousness, became, from that period, the object of his keenest reprobation.", "24": "He profited, indeed, so far by his danger or his punishment, as to recite no more in public;", "25": "but he continued to write during the remainder of Domitian's reign, in which he finished, as I conceive, his second, third,1 fifth, sixth,2 apd perhaps thir- teenth1 Satires ;", "26": "the eighth2 I have always looked upon as his first.", "27": "In xcv., when Juvenal was in his 54th year, Domitian ban­ ished the philosophers from Rome, and soon after from Italy, with many circumstances of cruelty;", "28": "an action, for which, I am sorry to observe, he is covertly praised by Quintilian.", "29": "Though Juvenal, strictly speaking, did not come under the description of a philosopher, yet, like the hare in the fable, he might not unreasonably entertain some apprehensions for his safety, and, with many other persons eminent for learning and virtue, judge it prudent to withdraw from the city.", "30": "To this period I have always inclined to fix his journey to Egypt.", "31": "Two years afterwards the world was happily relieved from the tyranny of Domitian;", "32": "and Nerva, who succeeded him, recalled the exiles.", "33": "From this time there remains little doubt of Juvenal's being at Rome, where he continued his studies in tranquillity.", "34": "His first Satire after the death of Domitian, seems to have been what is now called the fourth.", "35": "About this time, too, he probably thought of revising and publishing those which he had already written ;", "36": "and composed or completed that intro­ ductory piece,' which now stands at the head of his works.", "37": "As the order is every where broken in upon, it is utterly im­ possible to arrange them chronologically;", "38": "but I am inclined to think that the eleventh Satire closed his poetical career.", "39": "All else is conjecture;", "40": "but in this he speaks of himself as an old man, \" Nostra bibat vernum contracta cuticula solem and indeed he had now passed his grand climacteric.", "41": "This is all that can be collected of the life of Juvenal;", "42": "and how much of this is built upon uncertainties !", "43": "I hope, how­ ever, that it bears the stamp of probability;", "44": "which is all I contend for;", "45": "and which, indeed, if I do not deceive myself, is somewhat more than can be affirmed of what has been hitherto delivered on the subject.", "46": "Little is known of Juvenal's circumstances;", "47": "but, happily, that little is authentic, as it comes from himself.", "48": "He had a competence.", "49": "The dignity of poetry is never disgraced in him, as it is in some of his contemporaries, by fretful complaints of poverty, or clamorous whinings for meat and clothes :", "50": "-the little patrimony which his foster-father left him, he never diminished, and probably never increased.", "51": "It seems to have equalled all his wants, and, as far as appears, all his wishes.", "52": "Once only he regrets the narrowness of his fortune ;", "53": "but the occasion does him honour ;", "54": "it is solely because he cannot afford a more costly sacrifice to express his pious gratitude for the preservation of his friend:", "55": "yet \" two lambs and a youthful steer \" bespeak the affluence of a philosopher;", "56": "which is not belied by the entertainment provided for his friend Persicus, in that beautiful Satire which is here called the last of his works.", "57": "Further it is useless to seek :", "58": "from pride or modesty, he has left no other notices of himself;", "59": "or they have perished.", "60": "Horace and Persius, his immediate predecessors, are never weary of speaking of themselves.", "61": "The life of the former might be written, from his own materials, with all the mi­ nuteness of a contemporary history:", "62": "and the latter, who attained to little more than a third of Juvenal's age, has left nothing to be desired on the only topics which could interest posterity,-his parent, his preceptor, and his course of studies.", "63": "IT will now be expected from me, perhaps, to say something on the nature and design of Satire ;", "64": "but in truth this has so frequently been done, that it seems, at present, to have as little of novelty as of utility to recommend it.", "65": "Dryden, who had diligently studied the French critics, drew up from their remarks, assisted by a cursory perusal of what Casaubon, Heinsius, Rigaltius, and Scaliger had written on the subject, an account of the rise and progress of dramatic and satiric poetry amongst the Romans ;", "66": "which he prefixed to his translation of Juvenal.", "67": "What Dryden knew, he told in a manner that renders every attempt to recount it after him equally hopeless and vain ;", "68": "but his acquaintance with works of literature was not very extensive, while his reliance on his own powers sometimes betrayed him into inaccuracies, to which the influence of his name gives a dangerous importance.\"", "69": "The comparison of Horace with Juvenal and Persius,\" which makes a principal part of his Essay, is not formed with much niceness of discrimination, or accuracy of judgment.", "70": "To speak my mind, I do not think that he clearly perceived or fully understood the characters of the first two :", "71": "-of Persius indeed he had an intimate knowledge ;", "72": "for, though he certain­ ly deemed too humbly of his poetry, he yet speaks of his beau­ ties and defects in a manner which evinces a more than com­ mon acquaintance with both.", "73": "What Dryden left imperfect has been filled up in a great measure by Dusaulx, in the preliminary discourse to his trans­ lation of Juvenal, and by Ruperti, in his critical Essay \" De diversa Satirarum Lucil.", "74": "Herat.", "75": "Pers. et Juvenalis indole.", "76": "\"With the assistance of the former of these I shall endeavour to give a more extended view of the characteristic excellencies and defects of the rival Satirists than has yet appeared in our language;", "77": "little solicitous for the praise of originality, if I may be allowed to aspire to that of candour and truth.", "78": "Pre­ viously to this, however, it will be necessary to say something on the supposed origin of Satire:", "79": "and, as this is a very beaten subject, I shall discuss it as briefly as possible.", "80": "It is probable that the first metrical compositions of the Ro­ mans, like those of every other people, were pious effusions for favours received or expected from the gods :", "81": "of these, the earliest, according to Varro, were the hymns to Mars, which, though used by the Salii in the Augustan age, were no longer intelligible.,", "82": "To these succeeded the Fescennine verses, which were sung, or rather recited, after the vintage and harvest, and appear to have been little more than rude praises of the tutelar'divinities of the country, intermixed with clownish jeers and sarcasms, extemporally poured out by the rustics in some kind of measure, and indifferently directed at the audi­ ence, or at one another.", "83": "These, by degrees, assumed the form of a dialogue;", "84": "of which, as nature is every where the same, and the progress of refinement but little varied, some resem­ blance may perhaps be found in the grosser eclogues of Theo­ critus.", "85": "Thus improved, (if the word may be allowed of such bar­ barous amusements,) they formed, for near three centuries, the delight of that nation :", "86": "popular favour, however, had a dan­ gerous effect on the performers, whose licentiousness dege­ nerated at length into such wild invective, that it was found necessary to restrain it by a positive law:", "87": "\" Si qui populo occentassit, carmenve condisit, quod infamiam faxit ftagitium­ ve alteri, fuste ferito.\"", "88": "From this time we hear no further complaints of the Fescennine verses, which continued to charm the Romans ;", "89": "until, about a century afterwards, and during the ravages of a dreadful pestilence, the senate, as the histo­ rians say, in order to propitiate the gods, called a troop of players from Tuscany, to assist at the celebration of their ancient festivals.", "90": "This was a wise and a salutary measure :", "91": "the plague had spread dejection through the city, which was thus rendered more obnoxious to its fury ;", "92": "and it therefore be­ came necessary, by novel and extraordinary amusements, to divert the attention of the people from the melancholy objects around them.", "93": "As the Romans were unacquainted with the language of Tuscany, the players, Livy tells us, omitted the modulation and the words, and confined themselves solely to gestures, which were accompanied by the flute.", "94": "This imperfect exhi­ bition, however, was so superior to their own, that the Romans eagerly strove to attain the art;", "95": "and, as soon as they could imitate what they admired, graced their rustic measures with music and dancing.", "96": "By degrees they dropped the Fescennine verses for something of a more regular kind, which now took the name of SATIRE.", "97": "1", "98": "These Satires (for as yet they had but little claim to the title of dramas) continued, without much alteration, to the year 514, when Livius Andronicus, a Greek by birth, and a freed­ man of L. Salinator, who was undoubtedly acquainted with the old comedy of his country, produced a regular play.", "99": "That it pleased cannot be doubted, for it surpassed the Satires, even in their improved state ;", "100": "and, indeed, banished them for some time from the scene.", "101": "They had, however, taken too strong a hold of the affections of the people to be easily forgotten, and it was therefore found necessary to reproduce and join them to the plays of Andronicus, (the superiority of which could not be contested,) under the name of Exodia or After-pieces.", "102": "These partook, in a certain degree, of the general amelioration of the stage ;", "103": "something like a story was now introduced into them, which, though frequently indecent and always extrava­ gant, created a greater degree of interest than the reciprocation of gross humour and scurrility in unconnected dialogues.", "104": "Whether any of the old people still regretted this sophisti­ cation of their early amusements, it is not easy to say ;", "105": "but Ennius, who came to Rome about twenty years after this period, and who was more than half a Grecian, conceived that he should perform an acceptable service by reviving the ancient Satires.", "106": "1", "107": "He did not pretend to restore them to the stage, for which indeed the new pieces were infinitely better calcu­ lated, but endeavoured to adapt them to the closet, by refining their grossness and softening their asperity.", "108": "Success justified the attempt.", "109": "Satire, thus freed from action, and formed into a poem, became a favourite pursuit, and was cultivated by several writers of eminence.", "110": "In imitation of his model, Ennius confined himself to no particular species of verse, nor indeed of language, for he mingled Greek expressions with his Latin at pleasure.", "111": "It is solely with a reference to this new attempt that Horace and Quintilian are to be understood, when they claim for the Romans the invention 2 of this kind of poetry ;", "112": "and certainly they had opportunities of judging which we have not, for little of Ennius, and nothing of the old Satire, remains.", "113": "It is not necessary to pursue the history of Satire further in this place, or to speak of another species of it, the Varro­ nian, or, as Varro himself called it, the Menippean, which branched out from the former, and was a medley of prose and verse:", "114": "it will be a more pleasing, as well as a more useful employ, to enter a little into what Dryden, I know not for what reason, calls the most difficult part of his undertaking­ \" a comparative view of the Satirists not certainly with the design of depressing one at the expense of another, (for though I have translated Juvenal, I have no quarrel with Horace and Persius,) but for the purpose of pointing out the characteristic excellencies and defects of them all.", "115": "To do this the more effectually, it will be previously necessary to take a cursory view of the times in which their respective works were pro­ duced.", "116": "LUCILIUS, to whom Horace, forgetting what he had said in another place, attributes the invention of Satire, flourished in the interval between the siege of Carthage and the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutons, by Marius.", "117": "He lived therefore in an age in which the struggle between the old and new manners, though daily becoming more equal, or rather inclining to the worse side, was still far from being decided.", "118": "The freedom of speaking and writing was yet unchecked by fear, or by any law more precise than that which, as has been already men­ tioned, was introduced to restrain the coarse ebullitions of rustic malignity.", "119": "Add to this, that Lucilius was of a most respectable family, (he was great-uncle to Pompey,) and lived in habits of intimacy with the chiefs of the republic, with Laelius, Scipio, and others, who were well able to protect him from the Lupi and Mutii of the day, had they attempted, which they probably did not, to silence or molest him.", "120": "Hence that boldness of satirizing the vicious by name, which startled Horace, and on which Juvenal and Persius delight to felici­ tate him.", "121": "Too little remains of Lucilius, to enable us to judge of his manner:", "122": "his style seems, however, to bear fewer marks of delicacy than of strength, and his strictures appear harsh and violent.", "123": "With all this, he must have been an extraordinary man ;", "124": "since Horace, who is evidently hurt by his reputation, can say nothing worse of his compositions than that they are careless and hasty, and that if he had lived at a more refined period, he would have partaken of the general amelioration.", "125": "I do not remember to have heard it observed, but I suspect that there was something of political spleen in the excessive popu­ larity of Lucilius under Augustus, and something of courtly complacency in the attempt of Horace to counteract it.", "126": "Au­ gustus enlarged the law of the twelve tables respecting libels ;", "127": "and the people, who found themselves thus abridged of the liberty of satirizing the great by name, might not improbably seek to avenge themselves, by an overstrained attachment to the works of a man who, living, as they would insinuate, in better times, practised without fear, what he enjoyed without restraint.", "128": "The space between Horace and his predecessor, was a dreadful interval \" filled up with horror all, and big with death.\"", "129": "Luxury and a long train of vices, which followed the immense wealth incessantly poured in from the conquered provinces, sapped the foundations of the republic, which were finally shaken to pieces by the civil wars, the perpetual dic­ tatorship of Cæsar, and the second triumvirate, which threw the Roman world, without a hope of escape, into the power of an individual.", "130": "Augustus, whose sword was yet reeking with the best blood of the state, now that submission left him no pretence for fur­ ther cruelty, was desirous of enjoying in tranquillity the fruits of his guilt.", "131": "He displayed, therefore, a magnificence hitherto unknown ;", "132": "and his example, which was followed by his min­ isters, quickly spread among the people, who were not very unwilling to exchange the agitation and terror of successive proscriptions, for the security and quiet of undisputed des­ potism.", "133": "Tiberius had other views, and other methods of accomplish­ ing them.", "134": "He did not indeed put an actual stop to the elegant institutions of his predecessor, but he surveyed them with silent contempt, and they rapidly degenerated.", "135": "The race of informers multiplied with dreadful celerity;", "136": "and danger, which could only be averted by complying with a caprice not always easy to discover, created an abject disposition, fitted for the recep­ tion of the grossest vices, and eminently favourable to the designs of the emperor ;", "137": "which were to procure, by universal depravation, that submission which Augustus sought to obtain by the blandishments of luxury and the arts.", "138": "From this gloomy and suspicious tyrant, the empire was transferred to a profligate madman.", "139": "It can scarcely be told without indignation, that when the sword of Chærea had freed the earth from his disgraceful sway, the senate had not suf­ ficient virtue to resume the rights of which they had been deprived ;", "140": "but, after a timid debate, delivered up the state to a pedantic dotard, incapable of governing himself.", "141": "To the vices of his predecessors, Nero added a frivolity which rendered his reign at once odious and contemptible.", "142": "Depravity could reach no further, but misery might yet be extended.", "143": "This was fully experienced through the turbulent and murderous usurpations of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius;", "144": "when the accession of Vespasian and Titus gave the groaning world a temporary respite.", "145": "To these succeeded Domitian, whose crimes form the sub­ ject of many a melancholy page in the ensuing work, and need not therefore be dwelt on here.", "146": "Under him, every trace of ancient manners was obliterated;", "147": "liberty was unknown, Jaw openly trampled upon, and, while the national rites were either neglected or contemned, a base and blind superstition took possession of the enfeebled and distempered mind.", "148": "Better times followed.", "149": "Nerva, and Trajan, and Hadrian, and the Antonines, restored the Romans to safety and tran­ quillity ;", "150": "but they could do no more;", "151": "liberty and virtue were gone for ever:", "152": "and after a short period of comparative happi­ ness, which they scarcely appear to have deserved, and which brought with it no amelioration of mind, no return of the ancient modesty and frugality, they were finally resigned to destruction.", "153": "I now proceed to the \" comparative view \" of which I have already spoken:", "154": "as the subject has been so often treated, little of novelty can be expected from it ;", "155": "to read, compare, and judge, is almost all that remains.", "156": "HORACE, who was gay, and lively, and gentle, and affec­ tionate, seems fitted for the period in which he wrote.", "157": "He had seen the worst times of the republic, and might therefore, with no great suspicion of his integrity, be allowed to acqui­ esce in the infant monarchy, which brought with it stability, peace, and pleasure.", "158": "How he reconciled himself to his poli­ tical tergiversation it is useless to inquire.", "159": "1", "160": "What was so general, we may suppose, brought with it but little obloquy;", "161": "and it should be remembered, to his praise, that he took no active part in the government which he had once opposed.", "162": "2", "163": "If he celebrates the master of the world,

a sufficient excuse for his versatility, that he continues, amidst every change, the zealous defender of virtue.", "170": "Virtue, however, abstractedly considered, has few obligations to his zeal.", "171": "But though, as an ethical writer, Horace has not many claims to the esteem of posterity;", "172": "as a critic, he is entitled to all our veneration.", "173": "Such is the soundness of his judgment, the correctness of his taste, and the extent and variety of his knowledge, that a body of criticism might be selected from his works, more perfect in its kind than any thing which antiquity

object of the Satire;", "673": "which, however, branches out into many collateral topics-the profligacy of the young nobility ;", "674": "the miserable state of the provinces, which they plundered and harassed without mercy;", "675": "the contrast between the state of debasement to which the descendants of the best families had sunk, and the opposite virtues to be found in persons of the lowest station and humblest descent.", "676": "The Satire consists of a dialogue between the poet and one Nævolus, a dependent of some wealthy debauchee, who, after making him subser­ vient to his unnatural passions, in return starved, insulted, hated, and discarded him.", "677": "The whole object seems to be, to inculcate the grand moral lesson, that, under any circumstances, a life of sin is a life of slavery.", "678": "The subject of this inimitable Satire is the vanity of human wishes.", "679": "From the principal events of the lives of the most illustrious characters of all ages, the poet shows
