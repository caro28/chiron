keine Empfindung haben ohne die äußeren Gegenstände, da doch Feuer, Erde und die übrigen Elemente, von welchen eS eine Wahrnehmung gibt, entweder hinsichtlich ihrer selbst oder hinsicht­ lich ihrer Attribute, in den Sinnen enthalten sind.", "720": "ES ist nun leicht einzusehen, daß daS Organ der Wahrnehmung an sich nicht aktuell ist, sondern nur potenziell.", "721": "Es ist daher wie beim Brenn­

übrigen Sinnen findet nun auch statt beim Geruch.", "896": "Wie nemlich beim Gehörsinn Hörbares und UnhörbareS zu unterscheiden ist, beim Gesichtssinn Sichtbares und Unsichtbares, so beim Geruchssinn Riechbares und Unriech­ bares.", "897": "Unriechbar ist etwas theils, weil eS durchaus keinen Ge­ ruch haben kann, theils weil eS einen geringen und schwachen Ge­ ruch hat.", "898": "Ebenso verhält eS sich auch bei dem Unshcmeckbaren.", "899": "— ES wirkt aber auch der Geruchssinn durch ein Mittleres, d. h. z. B. Lust oder Wasser hindurch, denn auch die Wasser« thiere scheinen den Geruchssinn zu haben ohne Unterschied, mögen sie Blut haben oder nicht, wie auch die in der Lust lebenden Thiere, indem ja auch einige von den letzteren schon von weitem zur Nahrung herbeikommen, wenn sie in die Riechweite derselben gelangt sind.ES scheint nun darin eine Schwierigkeit zu liegen, daß — wie doch wohl anzunehmen ist — alle Thiere riechen ohne Unter­ schied, während der Mensch zwar wohl riecht, wenn er einathmet, nicht aber wenn er auSathmet oder den Athem anhält, weder auS der Nähe noch aus der Ferne, ja nicht einmal dann, wenn man den betreffenden Gegenstand innen auf daS Nasenloch legt.", "900": "Was nun freilich den letzteren Punkt betrifft, daß ein Ding nicht mehr wahrnehmbar ist, wenn man eS unmittelbar auf daS Sinnesorgan legt, so ist daS allen Thieren gemein, daß aber ohne Einziehen deS Athems kein Riechen stattfindet, daS ist den Menschen eigen­ thümlich.", "901": "Man darf'S nur Probiren, um die Sache sich klar zu machen.", "902": "Also die blutlosen Thiere, die ja keinen Athem einziehen, müßten irgend eine von den bisher genannten verschiedene Wahr­ nehmung haben.", "903": "Dieß ist aber unmöglich, wenn sie doch den Geruch wahrnehmen, denn Geruch ist eben Wahrnehmung des Riechbaren, sei eS nun angenehm oder unangenehm zu riechen.", "904": "Ueberdieß macht man ja auch die Bemerkung, daß solche Thiere zu Grund gehen durch dieselben starken Gerüche wie der Mensch, z. B. durch den Geruch des Asphalts, des Schwefels und ähn­ licher Stoffe.", "905": "ES ist also nothwendig, daß sie riechen, aber so, daß sie dabei nicht athmen.", "906": "ES scheinen aber in Beziehung auf dieses Sinnesorgan die Menschen sich von den übrigen Thieren in ähnlicher Weise zu unterscheiden, wie sie sich in Beziehung auf die Augen unterscheiden von den hartäugigen Thieren:", "907": "während nemlich die Augen der Menschen eine Verzäunung haben, und eine Art von Deckel in den Augenlidern, welche man bewegen und emporziehen muß, um sehen zu können, haben die hartäugigen Thiere nichts dergleichen, sondern sie sehen im Durchsichtigen die Gegenstände unmittelbar.", "908": "So ist eS nun auch bei dem Riech­ organ:", "909": "während dasselbe nemlich wie die Augen bei den Einen unbedeckt ist, hat eS bei den Thieren, welche Lust einnehmen, einen Deckel, welcher beim Athmen aufgedeckt wird, indem nemlich die Aederchen und die Vermittlungsgänge sich erweitern.", "910": "Und dieß ist auch der Grund, weßhalb die athmenden Thiere im feuchten Element nicht riechen, sie müssen nemlich Athem einziehen, um zu riechen, und dieß können sie im Wasser unmöglich.", "911": "— Wie aber der Geschmack dem Feuchten zukommt, so der Geruch dem Trockenen und dem entspricht auch die Potenz deS RiechorganS.DaS Schmeckbare ist eine Art von Tastbarem und dieß ist die Ursache davon, daß eS nicht wahrnehmbar ist vermittelst deS Mittleren, welches ein fremder Körper wäre;", "912": "denn dieß ist auch beim Tastsinn nicht der Fall.", "913": "Der Körper aber, in welchem der Geschmack ') sich befindet, das Schmeckbare, ist im Feuchten als seiner Materie, dieses Feuchte aber ist etwas Tastbares.", "914": "Darum würden wir, auch wenn wir im Wasser wären, eS wahrnehmen, wenn man das Süße hineinwürfe, die Wahrnehmung würde uns aber nicht vermittelt durch das Medium, sondern sie gienge da­ durch vor sich, daß das Süße mit dem Wasser vermischt würde, wie eS beim Trinkbaren geschieht.",

beim Ge­ schmack ähnlich wie bei den anderen Sinnen.", "921": "Das Gesicht geht auf daS Sichtbare oder Unsichtbare (unsichtbar ist nemlich die Finsterniß und auch diese wird vom Gesicht untershcieden), ferner auf das allzu Helle (denn auch dieses gehört zu dem Unsichtbaren und in andrer Beziehung zur Finsterniß);", "922": "ebenso geht daS Gehör auf den Schall und auf die Stille, von welcher der erstere hörbar ist, die letztere unhörbar, und dazu auf starken Schall, wie daS Gesicht auf daS stark Glänzende;", "923": "wie nemlich der schwache Schall auf gewisse Weise unhörbar ist, so auch der starke und gewalt­ same');", "924": "unsichtbar aber verstehen wir theils so, daß etwas schlech­ terdings nicht gesehen werden kann, wie man sonst die Bezeich« nung „unmöglich\" gebraucht,

schwachen Geschmack hat oder den Ge­ schmackssinn verderbt 5).", "928": "Als Princip deS Geschmacks kann man wohl daS Trinkbare, resp.", "929": "Untrinkbare bezeichnen, denn beides ist Geschmack, aber daS letztere nur schwach und nur so, daß es den Geschmackssinn verderbt, das andere in naturgemäßer Weise.", "930": "DaS Trinkbare aber ist dem Tastsinn und dem Geschmackssinn gemein­ sam.", "931": "Da aber daS Schmeckbare feucht ist, so ist eS nothwendig, daß daS Organ deS Geschmacks zwar nicht aktuell feucht sei, aber doch die Potenz habe, feucht zu werden;", "932": "eS wird nemlich der Geschmackssinn vom Schmeckbaren als solchem auf irgend eine Weise afficirt.", "933": "ES ist also nothwendig, daß dasjenige *), welches feucht werden kann (sofern eS seine Natur festhält), feucht werde, nicht aber von selber feucht sei, nemlich daS Organ deS SchmeckenS.", "934": "Der Beweis hiefür liegt darin, daß die Zunge weder dann wahr­ nimmt, wann sie sehr trocken ist, noch wann sie sehr feucht ist;", "935": "im letzteren Fall wird nur daS erste Feuchte') gefühlt, wie wenn man etwas stark Schmeckendes vorher kostet, ehe man etwas An­ deres schmeckt, und so ist eS ähnlich, wenn den Kranken Alles bitter vorkommt, weil ihre Zunge, mit welcher sie wahrnehmen, voll von solcher eigenen Feuchtigkeit ist.", "936": "— WaS die vershciedenen Arten des Geschmacks betrifft, so sind diese (wie eS auch bei den Farben ist) theils schlechthin einander entgegengesetzt, so das Süße und das Bittere, theils schließen sie sich an diese Gegensätze an, so daS Fettige an das Süße, daS Salzige an das Bittere;", "937": "in der Mitte zwischen diesen stehen dann daS Beißende, Herbe, Saure und Scharfe;", "938": "dieß scheinen ungefähr die vershciedenen Arten des Geschmacks zu sein.", "939": "— So ist also der Geschmack dasjenige, WaS der Potenz nach diese bestimmte Beschaffenheit hat, der Gegen­ stand deS Geschmacks aber ist dasjenige, welches die letztere aktuell hervorbringt.WaS nun das Tastbare betrifft, so hat eS mit diesem die­ selbe Bewandtniß wie mit dem Tastsinn selbst;", "940": "ist nemlich der Tastsinn nicht ein einziger Sinn, sondern eine Mehrheit von Sinnen, so muß eS auch ein mehrfaches Tastbare geben als Gegenstand des Tastsinns.", "941": "Es ist nun aber hier eben die Frage, ob man mehrere Sinne anzunehmen hat oder bloß Einen und was eigentlich das Sinnesorgan ist, welches fähig ist, daS Tast­ bare zu tasten, nemlich ob eS das Fleisch ist (und bei andern Thieren 2) der analoge Theil) oder nicht, — oder ob vielmehr daS Fleisch nur daS Medium ist, während daS eigentliche Sinnes­ organ etwas Anderes, innen Liegendes wäre.", "942": "— Ferner nimmt man an, daß jeder Sinn einen einfachen Gegensatz in sich begreift, also daS Gesicht den Gegensatz von weiß und schwarz, daS Gehör den Gegensatz von tief und hoch, der Geschmackssinn den Gegen­ satz von bitter und süß, dagegen im Tastbaren liegt eine Mehr­ heit von Gegensätzen, nemlich das Heiße und Kalte, das Trockene und Feuchte, das Harte und Weiche u. s. w.", "943": "Man kann eine gewisse Lösung dieser Schwierigkeit allerdings darin finden, daß es in der That auch bei den andern Sinnen eine Mehrheit von Gegen« sähen gibt, z.", "944": "B. in der Stimme nicht nur Tiefe und Höhe, sondern auch Stärke und Schwäche, Weichheit und Rauheit u. dgl.", "945": "So gibt eS auch in Beziehung auf die Farbe noch mehrere Un­ terschiede.", "946": "Allein damit ist noch nicht erklärt, waS man unter dem einheitlichen Substrat sich zu denken hat, welches auch beim Tastsinn zu Grunde liegen muß, wie beim Gehör der Schall.", "947": "— Ferner, ob das Sinnesorgan innen liegt oder nicht, ob eS viel­ mehr unmittelbar das Fleisch ist, dafür scheint kein äußeres An­ zeichen darin zu liegen, daß die Wahrnehmung sofort mit der Berührung eintritt.", "948": "Denn wenn man um das Fleisch z.", "949": "B. ein Häutchen herumspannen würde, so würde dieses in gleicher Weise sofort mit der Berührung') die Wahrnehmung anzeigen, nun ist aber klar, daß in diesem Häutchen daS Sinnesorgan nicht ent­ halten ist 2);", "950": "würde dasselbe aber mit dem Fleisch zusammen­ wahcsen, so würde die Wahrnehmung noch schneller hindurchdringen.", "951": "ES scheint daher mit dem betreffenden Glied sich so zu verhal­ ten, wie wenn uns rings die Lust angewahcsen wäre, eS würde uns in diesem Fall vorkommen, als wäre eS Ein und dasselbe Organs, wodurch wir Schall, Farbe und Geruch wahrnehmen, und somit wären dann Gesicht, Gehör und Geruchssinn Ein und derselbe Sinn.", "952": "Nun aber ist die Luft, durch welche hindurch die Bewegungen stattfinden, von unsrem Körper geschieden, und daher ist klar, daß die betreffenden Sinnesorgane verschieden sind ^).", "953": "Beim Tastsinn nun aber ist dieß nicht ebenso klar, denn auS Luft oder Wasser kann der beseelte Körper unmöglich bestehen, sofern er ja etwas Festes sein muß.", "954": "ES bleibt also nur übrig, daß er gemischt sei auS Erde zugleich mit jenen Elementen, so wie man sich das Fleisch vorstellt und waS dem Fleisch sonst ent­ spricht, woraus sich die Nothwendigkeit ergibt, daß der Körper, welcher das Medium für den Tastsinn bildet, durch welchen die Wahrnehmungen als das Mehrfache stattfinden, .angewachsen sein muß.", "955": "— Daß aber im Tastsinn mehrfache Wahrnehmungen sind, zeigt deutlich die Berührung auf der Zunge, sofern diese ja alles Tastbare an derselben Stelle wahrnimmt, wie den Geschmack der Speisen^).", "956": "Wenn nun auch sonst daS Fleisch überall den Ge­ schmack wahrnähme, so könnte man sagen, der Geschmackssinn und der Tastsinn seien Ein und derselbe Sinn, nun aber, da man nicht durchaus einen für den andern setzen kann ^), müssen eS zwei Sinne sein.", "957": "Eine weitere Schwierigkeit ergibt sich auS der Voraussetzung, daß jeder Körper Tiefe hat;", "958": "die Tiefe ist nemlich die dritte Di­ mension;", "959": "wenn nun also zwischen zwei Körpern ein dritter in der Mittte ist, so ist es nicht möglich, daß jene zwei einander berühren.", "960": "Nun ist daS Feuchte nicht ohne Körper, und ebenso wenig daS Flüssige^), sondern das letztere muß nothwendig ent­ weder Wasser sein oder Wasser enthalten;", "961": "wenn aber im Wasser zwei Körper einander berühren sollen, so muß nothwendig zwi­ schen ihnen Wasser sich befinden, von welchem die Extremitäten angefüllt sind, da ja doch die äußersten Theile nicht trocken sind;", "962": "ist aber dieß richtig, so ist es unmöglich, daß im Wasser ein Gegenstand einen andern berühre.", "963": "Aus dieselbe Weise verhält es sich nun auch mit dem, was in der Luft ist;", "964": "denn die Luft ver­ hält sich zu dem, WaS in ihr ist, ebenso wie daS Wasser zu dem, was in ihm ist.", "965": "Allein daS können wir nun eben nicht deutlich erkennen, ob ein Flüssiges ein anderes Flüssiges berühre, wie es auch in Betreff der im Wasser befindlichen Thiere nicht recht klar ist.", "966": "Weiter ist die Frage:", "967": "ob die Wahrnehmung bei allen Sin­ nen auf die gleiche Weise vor sich geht oder beim einen Sinn so, beim andern anders?", "968": "Nimmt man ja doch gewöhnlich an, der Geschmackssinn und der Tastsinn empfinden durch unmittel­ bare Berührung, während die andern Sinne anS der Ferne wahr­ nehmen.", "969": "Allein dieß ist nicht wirklich so, sondern auch daS Harte und Weiche') nehmen wir wahr durch ein Medium, so gut als daS, was einen Schall erregt oder was sichtbar oder riechbar ist.", "970": "Der Unterschied ist nur der, daß wir beim einen auS der Ferne, beim andern in nächster Nähe wahrnehmen.", "971": "Hierin liegt aber die Schwierigkeit für die Erkenntniß der Sache ^), denn ein Me­ dium der Wahrnehmung ist überall vorhanden, aber beim Tast­ sinn ist eS nicht zu erkennen.", "972": "ES ist ja doch, wie wir oben ge­ sagt haben:", "973": "wenn wir durch ein Häutchen hindurch alles Tastbare wahrnähmen, ohne zu wissen, daß ein solches Medium vorhanden wäre, so würden wir die Sache gerade so ansehen, wie jetzt, wenn wir in der Lust oder im Wasser sind:", "974": "wir meinen, wir berühren die Gegenstände unmittelbar und eS sei kein Medium vorhanden.", "975": "Also daS Medium ist überall, auch beim Tastsinn, aber mit Unterschied:", "976": "nemlich daS Sichtbare und das Tönende nehmen wir dadurch wahr, daß das Medium uns in gewisser Weise afficirt, dagegen bei der Wahrnehmung durch den Tastsinn werden wir nicht durch daS Medium afficirt, sondern zugleich mit dem Medium;", "977": "eS ist gerade, wie wenn Einer durch den Schild hindurch getroffen wird:", "978": "eS ist nemlich nicht der Schild, welcher trifft, nachdem er selber getroffen worden ist, sondern eS werden beide, Mann und Schild, in demselben Augenblick getroffen.", "979": "Ueberhaupt kann man annehmen, daß sich daS Fleisch und die Zunge zum Sinnesorgan des TastenS gerade so verhalten, wie die Luft und das Wasser sich verhalten zum Gesichtssinn, Gehörsinn und Geruchssinn.", "980": "Wenn dagegen das Sinnesorgan selbst wahrnähme, so würde

deutlich, daß daS Organ für'S Tasten innen liegt.", "983": "Bei dieser Voraussetzung ist der Vorgang ganz derselbe, wie bei den andern Sinnen:", "984": "während nemlich die andern Sinne nichts wahrnehmen, wenn der Gegenstand unmittelbar auf das Organ gelegt wird, so ist doch eine Wahrnehmung vorhanden, wenn man etwas auf das Fleisch legt, woraus denn klar ist, daß eben das Fleisch das Medium beim Tasten bildet.Gegenstand deS Tastsinns sind die Unterschiede des Körper­ lichen als solchen;", "985": "ich verstehe darunter die Unterschiede (Merk­ male), welche die Elemente bestimmen, nemlich daS Warme und Kalte, das Trockene und Feuchte, von welchen wir schon früher in der Schrift über die Elemente') gesprochen haben.", "986": "DaS Or­ gan zur Wahrnehmung dieser Unterschiede ist der Tastsinn und dasjenige ^), in welchem ursprünglich das wohnt, was man Tasten nennt, ist der Potenz nach ein solches Glied;", "987": "daS Empfinden oder Wahrnehmen ist nemlich eine Art von
