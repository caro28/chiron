direct information of any kind respect­ ing his life or the age in which he lived.", "2": "Some assign him to the fifth century A.D. ;", "3": "others, to the period between Lucian and Aristaenetus (170-350 A.D.)>", "4": "while others again are of opinion that he lived before Lucian.", "5": "The only circumstance that.", "6": "suggests anything in regard to the period at which he lived is the fact that, amongst the letters of Aristae­ netus, there are two which passed be­ tween Lucian and Alciphron;", "7": "and, as Aristaenetus is generally trustworthy, we may infer that Alciphron was a contemporary of Lucian, which is not incompatible with the opinion, true or false, that he imitated him.", "8": "It cannot be proved that Alci­ phron, any more than Aristaenetus, was a real name.", "9": "It is probable that there was a well-known sophist of that name in the second century A.D., but it does not follow that he wrote the letters.", "10": "The letters, as we have them, are divided into three books.", "11": "Their ob­ ject is to delineate the characters of certain classes of persons by intro­ ducing them as expressing their pe­ culiar sentiments and opinions upon subjects with which they are familiar.", "12": "For this purpose Alciphron chose country people, fishermen, parasites, and courtesans.", "13": "All are made to ex­ press themselves in most elegant and graceful language, even where the subjects are low and obscene.", "14": "The characters are thus to some extent raised above the ordinary standard, without any great violence being done to the truth of the reality.", "15": "The form of these letters is very beautiful, and the language in which they are written is the purest Attic.", "16": "The scene is, with few exceptions, Athens and its neighbourhood;", "17": "the time, some period after the reign of Alexander the Great, as is clear from the letters of the second book.", "18": "The New Attic comedy was the chief source from which Alciphron derived his mate­ rial, and the letters contain much valuable information in regard to the characters and manners he describes, and the private life of the Athenians.", "19": "We come across some remarkably modern touches, as the thimble-rigger at the fair and the claqueurs at the theatre.", "20": "Alciphron perhaps imitated I Lucian in style;", "21": "but the spirit in which he treats his subjects is very different, and far more refined.", "22": "In the great majority of cases the names in the headings of the letters, which seem very clumsy in an English dress, are fictitious, and are purposely coined to express some characteristic of the persons between whom they are supposed to pass.", "23": "In the volume of \"Lucian\" in this series some account has been given of the courtesans of Athens.", "24": "It will here be interesting to describe briefly another curious class of personages, the parasites-a word which has had a remarkable history.,", "25": "Originally, amongst the Greeks, the parasites were persons who held special functions.", "26": "They had a right, like the priests, to a certain portion of the sacrificial victims, and their particular duty was to look after the storage and keep of the sacred corn, hence their name.", "27": "They en­ joyed an honourable position, and the Athenians resigned to them even the management of the temples, which gave them rank next to the priests.", "28": "Soon, after the example of Apollo, the richest citizens looked out for witty table - companions, to amuse them with jests, and flatter them in proportion to their importance and liberality.", "29": "By degrees, however, these parasites, lending themselves to ridi­ cule, fell into discredit and contempt.", "30": "The name, diverted from its etymo­ logical signification, was applied to every haunter of the tables of the rich, to every sponger for a free meal, to every shameless flatterer who, in order to satisfy the needs of his stomach, consented to divert the company and patiently endure the insults which it pleased the master of the house to heap upon him.", "31": "At first this was by no means the case with all parasites.", "32": "Gaiety, audacity, liveliness, good humour, a knowledge of the culinary art, and sometimes even a certain amount of independence lent an additional charm to the members of the pro­ fession.", "33": "One of the most famous of parasites was Philoxenus of Leucas, of whom we read in Athenaeus.", "34": "It was his practice, whether at home or abroad, after he had been to the bath, to go round the houses of the prin­ cipal citizens, followed by boys carry­ ing in a basket oil, vinegar, fish-sauce, and other condiments.", "35": "After he had made his choice, Philoxenus, who was a great gourmand, entered without ceremony, took his seat at table, and did honour to the repast before him.", "36": "One day, at Ephesus, finding that there was nothing left in the market, he asked the reason.", "37": "Being told that everything had been bought up for a wedding festival, he washed and dressed himself, and deliberately walked to the house of the bride­ groom, by whom he was well re­ ceived.", "38": "He took his seat at table, ate, drank, sang an epithalamium or marriage - song, and delighted the guests. \"", "39": "I hope you will dine here to-morrow,\" said the host. \" Yes,\" answered Philoxenus, \" if you lay violent hands upon the market as you have done to-day.\" \" I wish I had a crane's neck, he sometimes ex­ claimed;", "40": "\" then I should be able to relish the flavour of the food for a longer time.\"", "41": "Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, who knew that he was very fond of fish, invited him to dinner, and, while an enormous mullet was set before himself, sent his guest a very small one.", "42": "Without being in the least disconcerted, Philoxenus took up the small fry, pretended to speak to it, and put it close to his ear, as if to hear its reply.", "43": "\"Well,\" said Dionysius, somewhat annoyed, \"what is the matter?\" \"I was.", "44": "asking him certain information about the sea which interests me;", "45": "but he has been caught too young:", "46": "this is his excuse for having nothing to tell me.", "47": "The fish in front of you, on the contrary, is old enough to satisfy my curiosity.\"", "48": "Dionysius, pleased with the rejoinder, sent on to him his own fish.", "49": "To per­ petuate his memory, Philoxenus com­ posed a \" Manual of Gastronomy,\" which was held in great repute.", "50": "Philoxenus, it must be admitted, was a very favourable specimen of his class.", "51": "As a rule the parasites were among the most abject and worthless of men.", "52": "\" Selected for their profli­ gacy, their impudence, or their wit, they were admitted to the tables of the wealthy, to promote licentious mirth.", "53": "This being the case, it does not seem at all unnatural that we should at the same time find them the friends and companions of the courtesans.", "54": "Such characters could not but be mutually necessary to each other.", "55": "The courtesan solicited the acquaintance of the parasite, that she might the more easily obtain and carry on intrigues with the rich and dissipated.", "56": "The parasite was assiduous in his attention to the courtesan, as procuring through her means more easy access to his patrons, and was probably rewarded by them both, for the gratification which he obtained of the vices of the one and the avarice of the other.", "57": "\"The name parasite first assumed a dishonourable signification in the works of the writers of the Middle and New Comedy.", "58": "The first who so used it is said to have been Alexis.", "59": "In the later comedians they are stock characters, whose chief object was to get a dinner without paying for it.", "60": "They are divided into different classes.", "61": "There were the γελωτοοιοὶ, or jesters, who, in order to secure an invitation, not only endeavoured to amuse, but endured the grossest in­ sults and personal ill-treatment (cf. Book III., Letters 6, 7, 49).", "62": "They had notebooks, in which they kept a collection of jokes ready for use.", "63": "The κόλακες, or flatterers, endeavoured to get invitations by playing upon the vanity of their prospective patrons.", "64": "The θεραπυτικοὶ, or \"officious\" para­ sites, tried to curry favour by ser­ vices of the lowest and most de­ grading character, which are detailed in the sixth book of Athenaeus.", "65": "They haunted the markets, wrestling­ schools, baths, and other public places in search of patrons.", "66": "The Romans also had their para­ sites.", "67": "As the stern rigour of the Re­ public relaxed and degenerated into the splendour and dissipation of a despotic government, the Roman parasites became less respectable and more profligate.", "68": "But it does not appear that in the most licentious ages of the Empire they ever equalled in meanness or in vice those worth­ less characters described in such lively colours by Athenaeus, Alciphron, and the comic poets of Greece.", "69": "Frequent allusions to them are found in Horace, Juvenal, Plautus, and particularly in Terence.", "70": "The latinized forms of the names of Greek gods and goddesses (such as Jupiter for Zeus) have been preserved in the translation as being more familiar, although, strictly speaking, they cannot be regarded as correct.", "71": "HAPPILY for us, the sea to-day is smooth and calm again.", "72": "The storm lasted for three days:", "73": "the north winds blew violently from the headlands to­ wards the open;", "74": "the blackening sea grew rough, the waters were white with foam;", "75": "the billows everywhere broke over each other, some dashing against the rocks, while others swelled and burst.", "76": "It was utterly impossible to work :", "77": "we betook ourselves to the huts on the bank, col­ lected a few fragments of wood, the remains of the oaks which had been felled by the ships' carpenters, and lighted a fire to relieve the piercing cold.", "78": "At last the fourth day came, a truly halcyon day, as we may conclude from the clearness of the air, and brought us wealth and fortune in abundance.", "79": "For, as soon as the sun rose, and its first beams glittered on the sea, we quickly launched our little bark, which had lately been drawn up on land, and, putting our nets aboard;", "80": "set to work.", "81": "We cast them not far from land.", "82": "Ha !", "83": "what an enormous haul we made!", "84": "The heavily­ laden net, carried under water, almost dragged down the corks with it.", "85": "Imme­ diately the fish salesmen gathered round, with their yokes over their shoulders, from which hung baskets on either side ;", "86": "and, having purchased our fish for money down, hastened from Phalerum to the city.", "87": "We had enough to satisfy them all, and besides, took back to our wives and chil­ dren a quantity of small fry, enough to keep them not only for one, but for several days, if bad weather should come on.", "88": "ALL our labour is in vain, Cyrton !", "89": "By day we are scorched by the heat of the sun, by night we explore the deep by the light of torches, and yet, in the words of the proverb, we are

to have gone beyond the limits of the jealousy of a lover in the excitement of his anger;", "370": "be assured that he loves you at the present moment more than Hy­ perides himself.", "371": "The latter certainly wishes to be regarded with favour by you in return for having undertaken your defence, and to gain your affection;", "372": "but the passion of the other has been only more violently whetted by the loss of his case.", "373": "You may expect from him, then, fresh entreaties, supplications, and pre­ sents in abundance;", "374": "but, my dear girl, do not prejudice our cause, or, by listen­ ing to the entreaties of Euthias, cause it to be thought that Hyperides has done wrong in taking our part.", "375": "Neither believe those who tell you that the orator's efforts would have been unavailing, unless you had rent your clothes and shown your bare breasts to the judges.", "376": "Why, this very argument, so opportunely em­ ployed, was the result of his exertions on your behalf.", "377": "No, so help me, Venus, may you never find a better lover!", "378": "may you spend all your life with Euthias, with whom you­ are so infatuated!", "379": "Unhappy woman !", "380": "how foolish you are to attach yourself to a monster like that, merely because of your confidence in your beauty !", "381": "Of course he will despise Phryne and love Myrrhine.", "382": "No doubt your object was to irritate Hyperides, who at this moment treats you with neglect.", "383": "He in truth possesses a mistress who is worthy of him;", "384": "and you have a lover who is admirably suited to you.", "385": "But only ask him for a present:", "386": "you will soon see if he does not accuse you of having tried to set fire to the dock­ yards or of having broken the laws.", "387": "To tell the truth, you have made yourself hateful to all of us, who have regard for a more honourable attachment.", "388": "I SHOULD never have believed that, after so long an intimacy with Euxippe, I should quarrel with her.", "389": "I do not re­ proach her with the many services I have rendered her since she arrived here from Samos.", "390": "You know what a hand­ some present Pamphilus offered me;", "391": "but I refused to have anything to do with him, because I knew that he had already become acquainted with her.", "392": "By way of rewarding my kindness handsomely, she is endeavouring to curry favour with that accursed woman Megara, of whom I have long had my suspicions, on account of Straton.", "393": "So there is nothing astonish­ ing in her speaking ill of me.", "394": "It was the festival of Ceres, and we were all assembled according to custom at my house, to spend the night.", "395": "I was sur­ priced at Euxippe's behaviour.", "396": "At first, she kept on giggling with Megara, and, by mocking and mimicking me, showed her spitefulness;", "397": "then she began to sing aloud some verses, containing allusions to a lover who had forsaken me.", "398": "I did not mind this so much.", "399": "But, at last, she lost all decency, and ridiculed my dye and rouge.", "400": "She seems badly off herself:", "401": "I don't believe she even possesses a mirror.", "402": "For, if she saw how like yellow ochre her complexion was, she would not abuse me for being ugly.", "403": "However, I care very little about this.", "404": "I want to please my lovers, not monkeys like Megara or Euxippe.", "405": "I have told you this, that you may not blame me afterwards;", "406": "for, one day, I will revenge myself upon them, not with raillery or insult, but in such a manner as to make them feel ■it.", "407": "I worship the goddess Nemesis.SINCE you have taken it into your head to study philosophy, you have be­ come serious, and raise your eyebrows above your forehead.",

Euthydemus ?", "410": "Don't you know what sort of man that scowling sophist is, who has so excited your admiration by his discourses ?", "411": "You don't know how long he has been pestering me, in order to gain my favours.", "412": "He is also mad after Herpyllis, Megara's pet maid.", "413": "At that time, I refused to receive him, for I preferred your kisses and embraces to all the gold of philosophers.", "414": "But, since he seems to be the cause of your keeping away from me, I will receive him;", "415": "and, if you like, I will prove to you that this wonderful teacher, this woman-hater, is not satisfied with ordinary enjoyments during the night.", "416": "You foolish young man, all this display is simple nonsense, mere artifice, a trap to fleece young men.", "417": "Do you think there is much difference between a sophist and a woman ?", "418": "The only difference is in their ways of per­ suasion ;", "419": "the object of their efforts is the same-to get money.", "420": "Indeed, our prin­ ciples are far better and more religious than theirs:", "421": "we do not deny the exist­ ence of the gods, but we believe our lovers, when they swear that they adore us.", "422": "We also prevent men from com­ mitting incest and adultery.", "423": "Only, be­ cause we are ignorant of the origin of the clouds and the theory of atoms, you consider us to be inferior to the sophists.", "424": "I myself have attended their lectures, and have conversed with several of them.", "425": "The truth is, that none of those who frequent the company of women trouble themselves with idle dreams of upsetting the state and seizing the supreme au­ thority :", "426": "they drink all the morning, get frightfully drunk, and then sleep it off till nine or ten o'clock.", "427": "Again, we educate young men quite as well as they do.", "428": "Compare, if you like, Aspasia the courtesan and the famous sophist So­ crates ;", "429": "and consider which of them pro­ duced the best citizens.", "430": "You will find that Pericles was the pupil of the former, Critias of the latter.", "431": "Abandon this folly, shake off your disagreeable looks, my darling Euthydemus:", "432": "your beautiful eyes were never intended to be scowling;", "433": "re­ turn to your lady-love the same as when you used to visit her on the way from the Lyceum, wiping off the perspiration.", "434": "Let us drink moderately, and prove to each other that pleasure is the aim of life.", "435": "Then you will confess how learned I am!", "436": "Besides, the Deity only allows us a short time to live;", "437": "do not waste it foolishly in trying to solve riddles.", "438": "Fare­ well.", "439": "IF you think it is any satisfaction to you or that it adds to the gratification of your clients, to make me come re­ peatedly to your door and complain to your servants who are sent to more fortunate suitors, I cannot say you are wrong in treating me thus contemptu­ ously.", "440": "I know that my efforts are un­ availing ;", "441": "but be assured that few of your favoured lovers would be so deeply affected by the loss of your affection as I am.", "442": "I flattered myself that the quantity of wine I drank yesterday at Euphemius's would afford me some consolation, and help me to drive away my nightly cares;", "443": "but it had just the contrary effect.", "444": "It only fanned more violently the flame of my passion:", "445": "I wept, I sobbed loudly, so that the better disposed of those around me were moved to pity, while the rest laughed at me.", "446": "There still remains for me a slight alleviation of my sorrow, a poor consolation, which, however, is now withering away and fading.", "447": "I mean the flower which you plucked from your head when we quarrelled at supper, and threw at me, to show that you were not offended with everything I had sent you.", "448": "But, if it amuses you, enjoy my grief;", "449": "if it please you, tell the story of it to those who are now more fortunate than myself;", "450": "it will perhaps soon be their turn to grieve, when they meet with similar treatment.", "451": "However, pray to Venus that she be not angry with you for your pride.", "452": "Another would have written a letter to you full of insults and threats:", "453": "I prefer to address you with prayers and suppli­ cations, for I am desperately in love with you.", "454": "Alas !", "455": "in the excess of my grief, I am afraid of imitating those un­ fortunate lovers whose complaints only serve to increase their misfortune.", "456": "How I wish that a woman's house could be supported on tears!", "457": "I should live right royally, for I know you would keep me abundantly supplied with them;", "458": "but, as it is, unfortunately we want money, clothes, ornaments, and servants.", "459": "Our arrangements depend entirely upon this.", "460": "I have no patrimony at Myrrhinus, no share in the silver mines;", "461": "I depend upon the little presents I receive, and the favours of foolish lovers, wrung only from them with many sighs and tears.", "462": "I have known you now for more than a year, and I am no better for it.", "463": "My hair is in disorder;", "464": "it has not seen any oil all this time.", "465": "I have only got one Tarentine tunic, so old and torn that I am perfectly ashamed to be seen in it by my friends.", "466": "I hope I may have better luck!", "467": "And do you think that, while I stick to you, I shall be able to find other resources ?", "468": "You weep ;", "469": "be sure that won't last long.", "470": "But I shall be finely hungry, unless I can find a lover to give me something.", "471": "I wonder at your tears:", "472": "how absurd they are !", "473": "0 lady Venus!", "474": "You say, Simalion, that you are madly in love with a woman, and that you cannot live without her.", "475": "Well, my friend, have you no valuable drinking-cups at home ?", "476": "has not your mother some jewellery ?",

me to do is to shut my door against him, if ever he wants to spend the night with me, in order to vex her;", "494": "insolence is generally overcome by contempt.", "495": "But, even if this proves useless, then I must have recourse to a more drastic remedy, as in cases of severe illness;", "496": "for it would be intolerable not only to lose the money I get out of him, but also to be Thessale's laughing- stock.", "497": "You say you have a love-potion, which you have often tried upon young men.", "498": "I need some assistance of the kind to cure him of his pride and fondness for drink.",

through her silken shift like fat or curdled milk, look­ ing back complacently all the time at the movements of her rump, then, moving gently as if she were in the act, she sighed, so that, by Venus, I was struck with astonishment.", "576": "Nor did Thryallis shrink from the contest, but, eager to surpass her in wantonness, said, \" I will not enter the lists with anything to cover me, or with any affectation, but just like the athletes at the games:", "577": "the contest admits of no shuffling.\"", "578": "She stripped off her shift, and, bending her loins upwards a little, she said, \" Look at the colour, Myrrhine, how perfect it is, how pure, how irreproachable!", "579": "Look at my hips, how they join the thighs, neither too fleshy nor too lean, and the dimples at their extremities.\"", "580": "Then she showed her loins, not trembling, like Myrrhine's, and, with a smile, shook them with a quivering motion, and whirled her buttocks round in every direction so that they seemed like running water.", "581": "Then we all clapped our hands and awarded the victory to Thry­ allis.", "582": "We also had other contests, and compared each other's breasts;", "583":

learnt to judge me aright.", "804": "This, dearest Menander, is a matter of re­ joicing to me, for I always used to fear the brief duration of a love founded upon simple passion.", "805": "Such a love, however violent it may be, is always easily broken up;", "806": "but, if it be accompanied by reason, the bonds of affection are drawn tighter, it gains sure possession of its pleasures, and

great fear of those Athenian wasps, who would be sure to buzz around me on all sides at the moment of my departure, as if I were taking away the wealth of Athens.", "809": "Wherefore, dear Menander, I

-the will of the gods.", "817": "I have a better plan still.", "818": "I know a woman, very clever in all these matters, who has just arrived from Phrygia.", "819": "She excels in the knowledge of the art of divination, the stretching of the branches of the broom, and the nightly evocation of the shades.", "820": "As I do not believe merely in words, but require acts as well, I will send to her;", "821": "for she says she must per­ form an initiatory lustration and prepare certain animals for the sacrifice, as well -as the male frankincense, the tall styrax, the round cakes for the moon, and some leaves of wild flowers.", "822": "I think that you have decided to come from the Piraeus;", "823": "if not, tell me how long you will be able to exist without seeing Glycera, that I may prepare this Phrygian and hasten to you.", "824": "But perhaps you have already of your own accord considered with your­ self how you may gradually forget the Piraeus, your little estate, and Munychia.",

mistress than them all, and I consider you as a devoted lover and a most diligent observer of your oath.", "828": "Therefore, my darling, try all the more to come without delay to the city, so that, in case you change your mind in regard to visiting the King, you may nevertheless have those plays ready which are most likely to please Ptolemy and his Bacchus, no ordinary one, as you know:", "829": "for instance, either the Thaises, the Misu­ menos, the Thrasyleon, the Epitrepontes, the Rhapizomene, or the Sicyonian.", "830": "But how rash and venturesome am I to take upon myself to judge the compositions of Menander-I, a woman who knows nothing about such matters!", "831": "But I have a clever master in your affection, which has taught me to understand even them;", "832": "you have shown me that any woman, who possesses natural ability, quickly learns from those she loves, and that love acts without delay.", "833": "I should be ashamed, by Diana, if I were to show myself unworthy of such a master by being slow to learn.", "834": "Anyhow, dear Menander, I entreat you also to get ready that play in which you have described myself, so that, even if not present in person, I may sail by proxy to the court of Ptolemy;", "835": "so the King will more clearly understand how strong your love must be, since you take with you at least the written history of the same, although you leave behind you in the city the living object of your affections.", "836": "But you shall not even leave that behind;", "837": "you may rest assured that I shall practise myself in the mysteries of guiding the helm and keeping look-out, until you come to me from the Piraeus, that I may safely guide you over the waves with my own hands, if you think it best to go.", "838": "I pray to all the gods that what may be to the advantage of us both may be disclosed, and that the Phrygian may prophesy what is to our interest even better than your damsel inspired with divine frenzy.", "839": "Farewell.0 MOTHER, I am quite beside myself!", "840": "It is impossible for me to wed the young Methymnaean, the pilot's son, to whom my father lately betrothed me, since I have seen the young man from the city, who carried the holy palm branch, when you gave me permission to go to Athens for the festival of the Oschophoria.", "841": "Ah, mother, how beautiful he is!", "842": "how charm­ ing!", "843": "His locks are curlier than moss;", "844": "he laughs more pleasantly than the sea in a calm;", "845": "his eyes are azure, like the ocean, when the first beams of the rising sun glitter upon it.", "846": "And his whole countenance ?", "847": "You would say that the Graces, having abandoned Orchomenus, after bathing in the fountain of Gargaphia, had come to frolic around his cheeks.", "848": "On his lips bloom roses, which he seems to have plucked from Cytherea's bosom to adorn them.", "849": "He must either be mine or, following the example of the Lesbian Sappho, I will throw myself, not from the Leucadian rocks, but from the crags of Piraeus, into the waves.", "850": "SILLY child, you are surely mad, with­ out a spark of reason.", "851": "You really need a dose of hellebore, not the ordinary kind, but that which comes from Anti­ cyra, in Phocis, since you have lost all maiden modesty.", "852": "Keep quiet, calm your­ self, banish such extravagance from your thoughts and return to your right mind.", "853": "If your father should hear anything of it, he would certainly throw you, without more ado, into the sea, as a dainty morsel for the monsters of the deep.", "854": "RECENTLY there was an abundant supply of fish;", "855": "but, since my nets were quite spoilt, I did not know what to do.", "856": "An inspiration came to me, which I thought worthy of Sisyphus.", "857": "I resolved to go to the money-lender Chremes, and to offer my boat to him as security for four pieces of gold, that I might be able to repair my nets.", "858": "No sooner said than done.", "859": "Chremes, that skinny old wretch, as a rule knits his brows and looks savagely at everybody.", "860": "Perhaps it was the hope of getting possession of my boat which caused him suddenly to relax his severity.", "861": "The wrinkles on his brow cleared;", "862": "he even smiled at me, and assured me that he was ready to render me any service that lay in his power.", "863": "So prompt an alteration made his friend­ liness suspicious, and clearly showed that his intentions were anything but good;", "864": "alas !", "865": "his kindness was only skinned over, for, when the money became due, he claimed the interest with the capital, and refused to grant me so much as an hour's grace.", "866": "Then I recognised the real Chremes of Phoela, the common enemy of mankind, who may usually be found before the Diometian Gate, armed with a crooked stick.", "867": "He was actually making preparations to seize my boat.", "868": "Then I perceived in what a cruel plight I was.", "869": "I ran home with all speed, took from my wife's neck the golden necklace which I had given her in my more prosperous days, and sold it to the money-changer Paseon.", "870": "With the money I got I paid both the capital and the inte­ rest, and I took an oath to myself that in future I would rather die of hunger than ever apply again to a city money-lender.", "871": "It is better to die honourably than to live at the mercy of a low and avaricious old man.", "872": "THE sun-dial does not yet mark the sixth hour, and I am in danger of wasting away under the pinch of hunger.", "873": "Come, it is time to take counsel, Lopadectham­ bus, or rather, let us get a beam and a rope and hang ourselves.", "874": "But I have an idea.", "875": "If we were to throw down the whole column which supports that con­ founded dial, or turn the index so that it may make the hours seem to have gone faster, it will be a device worthy of Pala­ medes.", "876": "I am exhausted and parched with hunger.", "877": "Theochares never takes his seat at table until the servant runs to let him know that it is the sixth hour.", "878": "We therefore need some plan to outwit and overreach the regularity of Theochares.", "879": "For, as he has been brought up under the care of a stern and morose tutor, his ideas are not those of a young man, but he is as austere in his manners as Laches or Apolexias, and he will not allow his belly to satisfy its needs before that hour.", "880": "Farewell.", "881": "YESTERDAY, late in the evening, Gor­ gias, of the family of the Eteobudatae, meeting me by chance, greeted me cour­ teously, and reproached me for not going to see him more frequently.", "882": "Then, after a few playful words, he said to me, \" Go, by Jupiter, my good friend, have a bath and come back to me without delay.", "883": "Do not forget to bring Aedonium, with whom I am very intimate, and who, as you know, is always to be found near the Leocorium.", "884": "I have prepared a noble supper, slices of fish, and jars of wine from Mendos, which you would say was the nectar of the gods.\"", "885": "With these words, he left me.", "886": "I ran in all haste to Aedonium ;", "887": "and when I told her by whom she had been invited, I nearly got into trouble.", "888": "For, as it seems, she had found Gorgias ungrateful and mean in the matter of presents in return for her favours.", "889": "In her anger, which is ever rankling in her breast, she snatched a full kettle from the stove, and, unless I had avoided the danger by quickly starting back, she would have poured all its contents over the top of my head.", "890": "Thus, after feeding ourselves on idle hopes, do we gain a greater share of humiliation than of pleasure.", "891": "I WANT a rope :", "892": "you will soon see me with my neck in a noose.", "893": "For I cannot endure slaps in the face, and all the drunken insults of these cursed diners;", "894": "and yet I cannot control my confounded and gluttonous stomach.", "895": "It is always asking for more;", "896": "it is not satisfied with being filled, but clamours for luxuries.", "897": "But my face cannot stand blows one after the other, and I am in danger of having one of my eyes bunged up by their slaps.", "898": "Alas, alas!", "899": "what misery does our greedy and ravenous stomach force us to endure !", "900": "I have therefore made up my mind to have one more good dinner and to put an end to my life in disgust, since, in my opinion, a voluntary death is preferable to a pain­ ful life.", "901": "OR, Lord! oh, Lord!", "902": "what a day I had yesterday!", "903": "What spirit or god in­ terfered, unexpectedly interfered, to save me, just as I was on the point of going to join the majority?", "904": "For, as I was re­ turning from the banquet, had not Acesi­ laus the physician, by good luck, seen me, half-dead, or rather a corpse, an inhabitant of the nether world, and ordered his pupils to pick me up and carry me home, and, after administering an emetic to me, bled me till the blood flowed plentifully, nothing could have saved me from dying before I had regained consciousness.", "905": "How these wealthy people treated me—and serve him right 1—one making me drink to ex­ cess, and another forcing me to eat more than the skin of my belly could hold.", "906": "One stuffed me with sausages, another rammed a great hunk of bread down my throat, while another made me drink a mixture, not wine, but mustard, fish-sauce, and vinegar, just as if he were pouring it into a cask.", "907": "What a number of pots, pans, and pails I filled, when I brought all this up !", "908": "Acesilaus was utterly asto­ nished, and could not make out where and how I had managed to stow away such a mish-mash of food.", "909": "But now that the protecting and tutelary gods have visibly preserved me from a great danger, I will in future work.", "910": "I will go down to the Piraeus, and carry luggage for hire from the vessels to the warehouses.", "911": "For it is better to feed one's stomach with thyme and barley-porridge, and enjoy a certain amount of security, than to feast upon cakes and pheasants, with the un­ certain

able to meet.", "914": "We can make arrangements to carry off Clymene from the Scyrian quarter and take her to Therippides of the deme of Aexona, who has just come into a fortune.", "915": "For some time he has been madly in love with her, and has spent considerable sums upon her, but all to no purpose.", "916": "For she, seeing the ardour of his passion, plays the coquette and shows herself affected and indifferent;", "917": "and, although he has loaded her with presents, she re­ fuses to let him enjoy her favours unless he adds landed property in the neigh­ bourhood of the silver mines.", "918": "I think it is time to put an end to this, and to carry her off by force, in case she still offers resistance :", "919": "two stout fellows like ourselves ought to have no difficulty

month of the fall of the leaves, I remembered that then dreams are always most false, and I said good-bye to my illusions.", "941": "You have forgotten our marriage bed, our children, our country

most expensive courtesans, the most beautiful singing-girls, in fact, all who perform in public.", "1482": "He is not squandering his patri­ mony, but all the money he spends has been honestly earned by himself.", "1483": "He is fond of music, makes his stay in the city very agreeable to all, and is never rude to anybody.", "1484": "He is very pleasant to look at ;", "1485": "you would say that

first saw Neuris, the maiden who carried the basket, with her beautiful arms and fingers, her eyes flashing glances like lightning, her charming figure and complexion, and her glistening cheeks, I was so inflamed with passion that, forgetting who I was, I ran up and attempted to kiss her;", "1501": "then, when I came to my senses, I was ready to follow her and kiss the marks of her footsteps.", "1502": "Alas, alas, for my insolent folly!", "1503": "to think that I could not be content with lupins, beans, and pulse, but, grown wanton with high feeding, must needs long for what was beyond my

jumped out of the way.", "1507": "They poured at random, and the boiling contents, falling over Bathylus, the lad who was handing the wine, completely flayed him;", "1508": "the skin has peeled off his head, and his back is covered with blisters.", "1509": "Who then of the gods was it that protected me ?", "1510": "Was it the Saviour princes, who preserved me' from the streams of fire, as in

farm ;", "1518": "then I need no longer think about making money by questionable practices in the courts, but could wait patiently to enjoy the fruits of the earth.", "1519": "Having determined to do this, I made friends with Corydon, dressed myself like a countryman, clad myself in a sheepskin, took up a mattock, and got myself up as a regular ditcher.", "1520": "As long as I did this for amusement, it was endurable, and I thought I had made a very good bargain, since I was free from blows and insults, and the unequal footing on which I stood with my wealthy patrons;", "1521": "but

belly.", "1526": "Hard pressed for the bare necessaries of life, I joined a band of Megarian brigands, who lie in wait for travellers near the Scironian rocks;", "1527": "and since then I have gained a dishonest livelihood without working.", "1528": "I do not know whether I shall escape detection ;", "1529": "but I am alarmed about my new pro­ fession, for such a change of life generally ends in
