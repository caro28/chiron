what perhaps may be a less unpopular and invidious thing to say, in most of its parts, I will now proceed, in the regular order of my subject, to speak of those who have embraced the speculative life, and I will say what appears to me to be desirable to be said on the subject, not drawing any fictitious statements from my own head for the sake of improving the appearance of that side of the question which nearly all poets and essay­ ists are much accustomed to do in the scarcity of good actions to extol, but with the greatest simplicity adhering strictly to the truth itself, to which I know well that even the most eloquent men do not keep close in their speeches.", "3": "Nevertheless we must make the endeavour and labour to attain to this virtue ;", "4": "for it is not right that the greatness of the virtue of the men should be a cause of silence to those who do not think it right that anything which is creditable should be suppressed in silence ;", "5": "but the deliberate intention of the philosopher is at once displayed from the appellation given to them;", "6": "for with strict regard to etymology, they are called therapeutæ and therapeutrides,* either because they profess an art of medicine more excellent than that in general use in cities (for that only heals bodies, but the other heals souls which are under the mastery of terrible and almost incurable diseases, which pleasures and appetites, fears and griefs, and covetousness, and follies, and injustice, and all the rest of the innumerable multitude of other passions and vices, have in­ flicted upon them), or else because they have been instructed by nature and the sacred laws to serve the living God, who is superior to the good, and more simple than the one, and more ancient than the unit;", "7": "with whom, however, who is there of those who profess piety that we can possibly compare ?", "8": "Can we compare those who honour the elements, earth, water, air, and fire?", "9": "to whom different nations have given different names, calling fire Hephæstus, I imagine because of its kin­ dling,* and the air Hera, I imagine because of its being raised up,f and raised aloft to a great height, and water Poseidon, probably because of its being drinkable,J and the earth Deme­ ter, because it appears to be the mother § of all plants and of all animals.", "10": "But these names are the inventions of sophists:", "11": "but the elements are inanimate matter, and immovable by any power of their own, being subjected to the operator on them to receive from bim every kind of shape or distinctive quality which he chooses to give them.", "12": "But what shall we say of those men who worship the perfect things made of them, the sun, the moon, and the other stars, planets, or fixed-stars, or the whole heaven, or the universal world?", "13": "And yet even they do not owe their existence to themselves, but to some creator whose knowledge has been most perfect, both in mind and degree.", "14": "What, again, shall we say of the demi-gods?", "15": "This is a matter which is perfectly ridiculous :", "16": "for how can the same man be both mortal and immortal, even if we leave out of the question the fact that the origin of the birth of all these beings is liable to reproach, as being full of youthful intempe­ rance, which its authors endeavour with great profanity to impute to blessed and divine natures, as if they, being madly in love with mortal women, had connected themselves with them;", "17": "while we know gods to be free from all participation in and from all influence of passion, and completely happy.", "18": "Again, what shall we say of those who worship carved works and images ?", "19": "the substances of which, stone and wood, were only a little while before perfectly destitute of shape, before the stone-cutters or wood-cutters hewed them out of the kindred stuff around them, while the remainder of the material, their near relation and brother as it were, is made into ewers, or foot-pans, and other common and dishonoured vessels, which are employed rather for uses of darkness than for such as will bear the light;", "20": "for as for the customs of the Egyptians, it is not creditable even to mention them, for they have introduced irrational beasts, and those not merely such as are domestic and tame, but even the most ferocious of wild beasts to share the honours of the gods, taking some out of each of the elements beneath the moon, as the lion from among the animals which live on the earth, the crocodile from among those which live in the water, the kite from such as traverse the air, and the Egyptian iris.", "21": "And though they actually see that these animals are born, and that they are in need of food, and that they are insatiable in voracity and full of all sorts of filth, and moreover poisonous and devourers of men, and liable to be destroyed by all kinds of diseases, and that in fact they are often destroyed not only, by natural deaths, but also by violence, still they, civilised men, worship these untameable and ferocious beasts;", "22": "though rational men, they worship irrational beasts;", "23": "though they have a near relationship to the Deity, they worship creatures unworthy of being compared even to some of the beasts;", "24": "though appointed as rulers and masters, they worship creatures which are by nature subjects and slaves.", "25": "II.", "26": "But since these men infect not only their fellow countrymen, but also all that come near them with folly, let them remain uncovered, being mutilated in that most indis­ pensable of all the outward senses, namely, sight.", "27": "I am speaking here not of the sight of the body, but of that of the soul, by which alone truth and falsehood are distinguished from one another.", "28": "But the therapeutic sect of mankind, being con­ tinually taught to see without interruption, may well aim at obtaining a sight of the living God, and may pass by the sun, which is visible to the outward sense, and never leave this order which conducts to perfect happiness.", "29": "But they who apply themselves to this kind of worship, not because they are influenced to do so by custom, nor by the advice or recommen­ dation of any particular persons, but because they are carried away by a certain heavenly love, give way to enthusiasm, behaving like so many revellers in bacchanalian or corybantiau mysteries, until they see the object which they have been earnestly desiring.", "30": "Then, because of their anxious desire for an immortal and blessed existence, thinking that their mortal life has already come to an end, they leave their possessions to their sons or daughters, or perhaps to other relations, giving them up their inheritance with willing cheerfulness;", "31": "and those who know no relations give their property to their companions or friends, for it followed of necessity that those who have acquired the wealth which sees, as if ready prepared for them, should be willing to surrender that wealth which is blind to those who themselves'also are still blind in their minds.", "32": "The Greeks celebrate Anaxagoras and Democritus, because they, being smitten with a desire for philosophy, allowed all their estates to be devoured by cattle.", "33": "I myself admire the men who thus showed themselves superior to the attractions of money;", "34": "but how much better were those who have not per­ mitted cattle to devour their possessions, but have supplied the necessities of mankind.", "35": "of their own relations and friends, and have made them rich though they were poor before ?", "36": "For surely that was inconsiderate conduct (that I may avoid saying that any action of men whom Greece has agreed to admire was a piece of insanity) ;", "37": "but this is the act of sober men, and one which has been carefully elaborated by exceeding prudence.", "38": "For what more can enemies do than ravage, and destroy, and cut down all the trees in the country of their antagonists, that they may be forced to submit by reason of the extent to which they are oppressed by want of necessaries ?", "39": "And yet Democritus did this to his own blood relations, inflicting artificial want and penury upon them, not perhaps from any hostile intention towards them, but because he did not foresee and provide for what was advantageous to others.", "40": "How much better and more admirable are they who, without having any inferior eagerness for the attainment of philosophy, have nevertheless preferred magnanimity to carelessness, and, giving presents from their possessions instead of destroying them, so as to be able to benefit others and themselves also, have made others happy by imparting to them of the abundance of their wealth, and themselves by the study of philosophy?", "41": "For an undue care for money and wealth causes great waste of time, and it is proper to economise time, since, according to the saying of the celebrated physician Hippocrates, life is short but art long.", "42": "And this is what Homer appears to me to imply figuratively in the Iliad, at the beginning of the thirteenth book, by the following lines,­ \" The Mysian close-fighting bands, And dwellers on the Scythian lands, Content to seek their humble fare From milk of cow and milk of mare, The justest of mankind.\" *", "43": "As if great anxiety concerning the means of subsistence and the acquisition of money engendered injustice by reason of the inequality which it produced, while the contrary dispo­ sition and pursuit produced justice by reason of its equality, according to which it is that the wealth of nature is defined, and is superior to that which exists only in vain opinion.", "44": "When, therefore, men abandon their property without being influenced by any predominant attraction, they flee without even turning their heads back again, deserting their brethren, their children, their wives, their parents, their numerous families, their affectionate bands of companions, their native lands in which they have been born and brought up, though long familiarity is a most attractive bond, and one very well able to allure any one.", "45": "And they depart, not to another city as those do who entreat to be purchased from those who at present possess them, being either unfortunate or else worth­ less servants, and as such seeking a change of masters rather than endeavouring to procure freedom (for every city, even that which is under the happiest laws, is full of indescribable tumults, and disorders, and calamities, which no one would submit to who had been even for a moment under the in­ fluence of wisdom), but they take up their abode outside of walls, or gardens, or solitary lauds, seeking for a desert place, not because of any ill-natured misanthropy to which they have learnt to devote themselves, but because of the associa­ tions with people of wholly dissimilar dispositions to which they would otherwise be compelled, and which they know to be unprofitable and mischievous.", "46": "III.", "47": "Now this class of persons may be met with in many places, for it was fitting that both Greece and the country of the barbarians should partake of whatever is perfectly good;", "48": "and there is the greatest number of such men in Egypt, in every one of the districts, or nomi as they are called, and especially around Alexandria ;", "49": "and from all quarters those who are the best of these therapeutæ proceed on their pil­ grimage to some most suitable place as if it were their country, which is beyond the Mareotic lake, lying in a somewhat level plain a little raised above the rest, being suitable for their purpose by reason of its safety and also of the fine tempe­ rature of the air.", "50": "For the houses built in the fields and the villages which surround it on all sides give it safety;", "51": "and the admirable tem­ perature of the air proceeds from the continual breezes which come from the lake which falls into the sea, and also from the sea itself in the neighbourhood, the breezes from the sea being light, and those which proceed from the lake which falls into the sea being heavy, the mixture of which produces a most healthy atmosphere.", "52": "But the houses of these men thus congregated together are very plain, just giving shelter in respect of the two things most important to be provided against, the heat of the sun, and the cold from the open air ;", "53": "and they did not live near to one another as men do in cities, for immediate neighbourhood to others would be a troublesome and unpleasant thing to men who have conceived an admiration for, and have determined to devote themselves to, solitude;", "54": "and, on the other hand, they did not live very far from one another on account of the fellowship which they desire to cultivate, and because of the desirableness of being able to assist one another if they should be attacked by robbers.", "55": "And in every house there is a sacred shrine which is called the holy place, and the monastery in which they retire by themselves and perform all the mysteries of a holy life, bring­ ing in nothing, neither meat, nor drink, nor anything else which is indispensable towards supplying the necessities of the body, but studying in that place the laws and the sacred oracles of God enunciated by the holy prophets, and hymns, and psalms, and all kinds of other things by reason of which knowledge and piety are increased and brought to perfection.", "56": "Therefore they always retain an imperishable recollection of God, so that not even in their dreams is any other object ever presented to their eyes except the beauty of the divine virtues and of the divine powers.", "57": "Therefore many persons speak in their sleep, divulging and publishing the celebrated doctrines of the sacred philosophy.", "58": "And they are accustomed to pray twice every day, at morning and at evening;", "59": "when the sun is rising entreating God that the happiness of the coming day may be real happiness, so that their minds may be filled with heavenly light, and when the sun is setting they pray that their soul, being entirely lightened and relieved of the burden of the outward senses, and of the appropriate object of these outward senses, may be able to trace out truth existing in its own consistory and council chamber.", "60": "And the interval between morning and evening is by them devoted wholly to meditation on and to practice of virtue, for they take up the sacred scriptures and philosophise concerning them, investigat­ ing the allegories of their national philosophy, since they look upon their literal expressions as symbols of some secret mean­ ing of nature, intended to be conveyed in those figurative expressions.", "61": "They have also writings of ancient men, who having been the founders of one sect or another have left behind them many memorials of the allegorical system of writing and explanation, whom they take as a kind of model, and imitate the general fashion of their sect;", "62": "so that they do not occupy themselves solely in contemplation, but they likewise compose psalms and hymns to God in every kind of metre and melody imaginable, which they of necessity arrange in more dignified rhythm.", "63": "Therefore, during six days, each of these individuals, retiring into solitude by himself, philosophises by himself in one of the places called monasteries, never going outside the threshold of the outer court, and indeed never even looking out.", "64": "But on the seventh day they all come together as if to meet in a sacred assembly, and they sit down in order according to their ages with all becoming gravity, keeping their bands inside their garments, having their right hand between their chest and their dress, and the left hand down by their side, close to their flank ;", "65": "and then the eldest of them who has the most profound learning in their doctrines comes forward and speaks with steadfast look and with steadfast voice, with great powers of reasoning, and great prudence, not making an exhibition of his oratorical powers like the rhetoricians of old, or the sophists of the present day, but investigating with great pains, and explaining with minute accuracy the precise mean­ ing of the laws, which sits, not indeed at the tips of their ears, but penetrates through their hearing into the soul, and remains there lastingly;", "66": "and all the rest listen in silence to the praises which he bestows upon the law, showing their assent only by nods of the head, or the eager look of the eyes.", "67": "And this common holy place to which they all come to­ gether on the seventh day is a twofold circuit, being separated partly into the apartment of the men, and partly into a chamber for the women, for women also, in accordance with the usual fashion there, form a part of the audience, having the same feelings of admiration as the men, and having adopted the same sect with equal deliberation and decision;", "68": "and the wall which is between the houses rises from the ground three or four cubits upwards, like a battlement, and the upper portion rises upwards to the roof without any opening, on two accounts;", "69": "first of all, in order that the modesty which is so becoming to the female sex may be preserved, and secondly, that the women may be easily able to comprehend what is said being seated within earshot, since there is then nothing which can possibly intercept the voice of him who is speak­ ing.", "70": "IV.", "71": "And these expounders of the law, having first of all laid down temperance as a sort of foundation for the soul to rest upon, proceed to build up other virtues on this foundation, and no one of them may take any meat or drink before the setting of the sun, since they judge that the work of philosophising is one which is worthy of the light, but that the care for the necessities of the body is suitable only to darkness, on which account they appropriate the day to the one occupation, and a brief portion of the night to the other;", "72": "and some men, in whom there is implanted a more fervent desire of knowledge, can endure to cherish a recollection of their food for three days without even tasting it, and some men are so delighted, and enjoy themselves so exceedingly when regaled by wisdom which supplies them with her doctrines in all possible wealth and abundance, that they can even hold out twice as great a length of time, and will scarcely at the end of six days taste even necessary food, being accustomed, as they say that grass hoppers are, to feed on air, their song, as I imagine, making their scarcity tolerable to them.", "73": "And they, looking upon the seventh day as one of perfect holiness and a most complete festival, have thought it worthy of a most especial honour, and on it, after taking due care of their soul, they tend their bodies also, giving them, just as they do to their cattle, a complete rest from their continual labours ;", "74": "and they eat nothing of a costly character, but plain bread and a seasoning of salt, which the more luxurious of them do further season with hyssop ;", "75": "and their drink is water from the spring;", "76": "for they oppose those feelings which nature has made mistresses of the human race, namely, hunger and thirst, giving them nothing to flatter or humour them, but only such useful things as it is not possible to exist without.", "77": "On this account they eat only so far as not to be hungry, and they drink just enough to escape from thirst, avoiding all satiety, as an enemy of and a plotter against both soul and body.", "78": "And there are two kinds of covering, one raiment and the other a house:", "79": "we have already spoken of their houses, that they are not decorated with any ornaments, but run up in a hurry, being only made to answer such purposes as are absolutely necessary;", "80": "and in like manner their raiment is of the most ordinary description, just stout enough to ward off cold and heat, being a cloak of some shaggy hide for winter, and a thin mantle or linen shawl in the summer;", "81": "for in short they practise entire simplicity, looking upon falsehood as the foundation of pride, but truth as the origin of simplicity, and upon truth and falsehood as standing in the light of fountains, for from falsehood proceeds every variety of evil and wicked­ ness, and from truth there flows every imaginable abundance of good things both human and divine.", "82": "V.", "83": "I wish also to speak of their common assemblies, and their very cheerful meetings at convivial parties, setting them in opposition and contrast to the banquets of others, for others, when they drink strong wine, as if they had been drinking not wine but some agitating and maddening kind of liquor, or even the most formidable thing which can be imagined for driving a man out of his natural reason, rage about and tear things to pieces like so many ferocious dogs, aDd rise up and attack one another, biting and gnawing each other's noses, and ears, and fingers, and other parts of their body, so as to give an accurate representation of the story related about the Cyclops and the companions of Ulysses, who ate, as the poet says, fragments of human flesh,* and that more savagely than even he himself;", "84": "for he was only avenging himself on those whom he conceived to be his enemies, but they were ill-treating their companions and friends, and sometimes even their actual relations, while having the salt and dinner-table before them, at a time of peace perpetrating actions inconsistent with peace, like those which are done by men in gymnastic con­ tests, debasing the proper exercises of the body as coiners debase good money, and instead of athletes (ἀθληται̃) becoming miserable men (ἅθλιοι), for ithat is the name which properly belongs to them.", "85": "For that which those men who gain victories in the Olympic games, when perfectly sober in the arena, and having all the Greeks for spectators do by day, exerting all their skill for the purpose of gaining victory and the crown, these men with base designs do at convivial entertainments, getting drunk by night, in the hour of darkness, when soaked in wine, acting without either knowledge, or art, or skill, to the insult, and injury, and great disgrace of those who are subjected to their violence.", "86": "And if no one were to come like an umpire into the middle of them, and part the combatants, and reconcile them, they would continue the contest with unlimited licence, striving to kill and murder one another, and being killed and murdered on the spot;", "87": "for they do not suffer less than they inflict, though out of the delirious state into which they have worked themselves they do not feel what is done to them, since they have filled themselves with wine, not, as the comic poet says, to the injury of their neighbour, but to their own.", "88": "Therefore those persons who a little while before came safe and sound to the banquet, and in friendship for one another, do presently afterwards depart in hostility and mutilated in their bodies.", "89": "And some of these men stand in need of advocates and judges, and others require surgeons and physicians, and the help which may be received from them.", "90": "Others again who seem to be a more moderate kind of feasters when they have drunk unmixed wine as if it were mandragora, boil over as it were, and lean on their left elbow, and turn their heads on one side with their breath redolent of their wine, till at last they sink into profound slumber, neither seeing nor hearing anything, as if they had but one single sense, and that the most slavish of all, namely, taste.", "91": "And I know some persons who, when they are completely filled with wine, before they are wholly overpowered by it, begin to prepare a drinking party for the next day by a kind of subscription and picnic contribution, conceiving a great part of their present delight to consist in the hope of future drunkenness;", "92": "and in this manner they exist to the very end of their lives, without a house and without a home, the enemies of their parents, and of their wives, and of their children, and the enemies of their country, and the worst enemies of all to themselves.", "93": "For a debauched and profligate life is apt to lay snares for every one.", "94": "VI.", "95": "And perhaps some people may be inclined to approve of the arrangement of such entertainments which at present prevails everywhere, from an admiration of, and a desire of imitating, the luxury and extravagance of the Italians which both Greeks and barbarians emulate, making all their pre­ parations with a view to show rather than to real enjoy­ ment, for they use couches called triclinia, and sofas all round the table made of tortoiseshell, and ivory, and other costly materials, most of which are inlaid with precious stones;", "96": "and coverlets of purple embroidered with gold and silver thread;", "97": "and others brocaded in flowers of every kind of hue and colour imaginable to allure the sight, and a vast array of drinking cups arrayed according to each separate description;", "98": "for there are bowls, and vases, and beakers, and goblets, and all kinds of other vessels wrought with the most exquisite skill, their clean cups and others finished with the most elaborate refine­ ment of skilful and ingenious men ;", "99": "and well shaped slaves of the most exquisite beauty, ministering, as if they had come not more for the purpose of serving the guests than of delight­ ing the eyes of the spectators by their mere appearance.", "100": "Of these slaves, some, being still boys, pour out the wine;", "101": "and others more fully grown pour water, being carefully washed and rubbed down, with their faces anointed and pencilled, and the hair of their heads admirably plaited and curled and wreathed in delicate knots;", "102": "for they have very long hair, being either completely unshorn, or else having only the hair on their foreheads cut at the end so as to make them of an equal length all round, being accurately sloped away so as to repre­ sent a circular line, and being clothed in tunics of the most delicate texture, and of the purest white, reaching in front down to the lower part of the knee, and behind to a little below the calf of the leg, and drawing up each side with a gentle doubling of the fringe at the joinings of the tunics, raising undulations of the garment as it were at the sides, and widening them at the hollow part of the side.", "103": "Others, again, are young men just beginning to show a beard on their youthful chins, having been, for a short time, the sport of the profligate debauchees, and being prepared with exceeding care and diligence for more painful services;", "104": "being a kind of exhibition of the excessive opulence of the giver of the feast, or rather, to say the truth, of their thorough ignorance of all propriety, as those who are acquainted with them well know.", "105": "Besides all these things, there is an infinite variety of sweet- meats, and delicacies, and confections, about which bakers and cooks and confectioners labour, considering not the taste, which is the point of real importance, so as to make the food palatable to that, but also the sight, so as to allure that by the delicacy of the look of their viands.", "106": "Accordingly, seven tables, and often more, are brought in, full of every kind of delicacy which earth, and sea, and rivers, and air produce, all procured with great pains, and in high condition, composed of terrestrial, and acquatic, and flying creatures, every one of which is different both in its mode of dressing and in its seasoning.", "107": "And that no description of thing existing in nature may be omitted, at the last dishes are brought in full of fruits, besides those which are kept back for the more luxurious portion of the entertainment, and for what is called the dessert;", "108": "and afterwards some of the dishes are carried away empty from the insatiable greediness of those at table, who, gorging themselves like cormorants, devour all the delicacies so completely that they gnaw even the bones, which some left half devoured after all that they contained has been torn to pieces and spoiled.", "109": "And when they are completely tired with eating, having their bellies filled up to their very throats, but their desires still unsatisfied, being fatigued with eating they turn their heads round in every direction, scanning everything with their eyes and with their nostrils, examining the richness and the number of the dishes with the first, and the steam which is sent up by them with the second.", "110": "Then, when they are thoroughly sated both with the sight and with the scent, these senses again prompt their owners to eat, praising in no moderate terms both the entertainment itself and the giver of it, for its costliness and magnificence.", "111": "However, why need I dwell with prolixity on these matters, which are already condemned by the generality of more moderate men as inflaming the passions, the diminution of which is desirable?", "112": "For any one in his senses would pray for the most unfortunate of all states, hunger and thirst, rather than for a most unlimited abundance of meat and drink at such banquets as these.", "113": "VII.", "114": "Now of the banquets among the Greeks the two most celebrated and most remarkable are those at which Socrates also was present, the one in the house of Callias, when, after Autolycus had gained the crown of victory, he gave a feast in honour of the event, and the other in the house of Agathon, which was thought worthy of being commemorated by men who were imbued with the true spirit of philosophy both in their dispositions and in their discourses, Plato and Xenophon, for they recorded them as events worthy to be had in perpetual recollection, looking upon it that future generations would take them as models for a well managed arrangement of future banquets;", "115": "but nevertheless even these, if compared with the banquets of the men of our time who have embraced the con­ templative system of life, will appear ridiculous.", "116": "Each descrip­ tion, indeed, has its own pleasures, but that recorded by Xeno­ phon is the one the delights of which are most in accordance with human nature, for female harp-players, and dancers, and conjurors, and jugglers, and men who do ridiculous things, who pride themselves much on their powers of jesting and of amusing others, and many other species of more cheerful relaxation, are brought forward at it.", "117": "But the entertainment recorded by Plato is almost entirely connected with love ;", "118": "not that of men madly desirous or fond of women, or of women furiously in love with men, for these desires are accomplished in accordance with a law of nature, but with that love which is felt by men for one another, differing only in respect of age;", "119": "for if there is anything in the account of that banquet elegantly said in praise of genuine love and heavenly Venus, it is introduced merely for the sake of making a neat speech;", "120": "for the greater part of the book is occupied by common, vulgar, promiscuous love, which takes away from the soul courage, that which is the most serviceable of all virtues both in war and in peace, and which engenders in it instead the female disease, and renders men men-women, though they ought rather to be carefully trained in all the practices likely to give men valour.", "121": "And having corrupted the age of boys, and having metamor­ phosed them and removed them into the classification and character of women, it has injured their lovers also in the most important particulars, their bodies, their souls, and their properties;", "122": "for it follows of necessity that the mind of a lover of boys must be kept on the stretch towards the objects of his affection, and must have no acuteness of vision for any other object, but must be blinded by its desire as to all other objects private or common, and must so be wasted away, more especially if it fails in its objects.", "123": "Moreover, the man's property must be diminished on two accounts, both from the owner's neglect and from his expenses for the beloved object.", "124": "There is also another greater evil which affects the whole people, and which grows up alongside of the other, for men who give into such passions produce solitude in cities, and a scarcity of the best kind of men, and barrenness, and unpro­ ductiveness, inasmuch as they are imitating those farmers who are unskilful in agriculture, and who, instead of the deep-soiled champaign country, sow briny marshes, or stony and rugged districts, which are not calculated to produce crops of any kind, and which only destroy the seed which is put into them.", "125": "I pass over in silence the different fabulous fictions, and the stories of persons with two bodies, who having originally been stuck to one another by amatory influences, are subsequently separated like portions which have been brought together and are disjoined again, the harmony having been dissolved by which they were held together;", "126": "for all these things are very attractive, being able by the novelty of their imagination to allure the ears, but they are despised by the disciples of Moses, who in the abundance of their wisdom have learnt from their earliest infancy to love truth, and also continue to the end of their lives impossible to be deceived.", "127": "VIII.", "128": "But since the entertainments of the greatest celebrity are full of such trifling and folly, bearing conviction in them­ selves, if any one should think fit not to regard vague opinion and the character which has been commonly handed down concerning them as feasts which have gone off with the most eminent success, I will oppose to them the entertainments of those persons who have devoted their whole life and themselves to the knowledge and contemplation of the affairs of nature in accordance with the most sacred admonitions and precepts of the prophet Moses.", "129": "In the first place, these men assemble at the end of seven weeks, venerating not only the simple week of seven days, but also its multiplied power, for they know it to be pure and always virgin;", "130": "and it is a prelude and a kind of forefeast of the greatest feast, which is assigned to the number fifty, the most holy and natural of numbers, being compounded of the power of the right-angled triangle, which is the principle of the origination and condition of the whole.", "131": "Therefore when they come together clothed in white garments, and joyful with the most exceeding gravity, when some one of the epbemereutæ (for that is the appellation which they are accustomed to give to those who are employed in such ministrations), before they sit down to meat standing in order in a row, and raising their eyes and their hands to heaven, the one because they have learnt to fix their attention on what is worth looking at, and the other because they are free from the reproach of all impure gain, being never polluted under any pretence whatever by any description of criminality which can arise from any means taken to procure advantage, they pray to God that the entertainment may be acceptable, and welcome, and pleasing;", "132": "and after having offered up these prayers the elders sit down to meat, still observing the order in which they were previously arranged, for they do not look on those as elders who are advanced in years and very ancient, but in some cases they esteem those as very young men, if they have attached themselves to this sect only lately, but those whom they call elders are those who from their earliest infancy have grown up and arrived at maturity in the speculative portion 01 philosophy, which is the most beautiful and most divine part of it.", "133": "And the women also share in this feast, the greater part of whom, though old, are virgins in respect of their purity (not indeed through necessity, as some of the priestesses among the Greeks are, who have been compelled to preserve their chastity more than they would have done of their own accord), but out of an admiration for and love of wisdom, with which they are desirous to pass their lives, on account of which they are indif­ ferent to the pleasures of the body, desiring not a mortal but an immortal offspring, which the soul that is attached to God is alone able to produce by itself and from itself, the Father having sown in it rays of light appreciable only by the intel­ lect, by means of which it will be able to perceive the doctrines of wisdom.", "134": "IX.", "135": "And the order in which they sit down to meat is a divided one, the men sitting on the right hand and the women apart from them on the left;", "136": "and in case any one by chance suspects that cushions, if not very costly ones, still at all events of a tolerably soft substance, are prepared for men who are well born and well bred, and contemplators of philosophy, he must know that they have nothing but rugs of the coarsest materials, cheap mats of the most ordinary kind of the papyrus of the land, piled up on the ground and projecting a little near the elbow, so that the feasters may lean upon them, for they relax in a slight degree the Lacedaemonian rigour of life, and at all times and in all places they practise a liberal, gentle­ manlike kind of frugality, hating the allurements of pleasure with all their might.", "137": "And they do not use the ministrations of slaves, looking upon the possession of servants or slaves to be a thing abso­ lutely and wholly contrary to nature, for nature has created all men free, but the injustice and covetousness of some men who prefer inequality, that cause of all evil, having subdued some, has given to the more powerful authority over those who are weaker.", "138": "Accordingly in this sacred entertainment there is, as I have said, no slave, but free men minister to the guests, perform­ ing the offices of servants, not under compulsion, nor in obedience to any imperious commands, but of their own voluntary free will, with all eagerness and promptitude anti­ cipating all orders, for they are not any chance free men who are appointed to perform these duties, but young men who are selected from their order with all possible care on account of their excellence, acting as virtuous and well-born youths ought to act who are eager to attain to the perfection of virtue, and who, like legitimate sons, with affectionate rivalry minister to their fathers and mothers, thinking their common parents more closely connected with them than those who are related by blood, since in truth to men of right principles there is nothing more nearly akin than virtue;", "139": "and they come in to perform their service ungirdled, and with their tunics let down, in order that nothing which bears any resemblance to a slavish appearance may be introduced into this festival", "140": "I know well that some persons will laugh when they hear this, but they who laugh will be those who do things worthy of weeping and lamentation.", "141": "And in those days wine is not in­ troduced, but only the clearest water;", "142": "cold water for the gene­ rality, and hot water for those old men who are accustomed to a luxurious life.", "143": "And the table, too, bears nothing which has blood, but there is placed upon it bread for food and salt for seasoning, to which also hyssop is sometimes added as all extra sauce for the sake of those who are delicate in their eating, for just as right reason commands the priest to offer up sober sacrifices, so also these men are commanded to live sober lives, for wine is the medicine of folly, and costly seasonings and sauces excite desire, which is the most insatiable of all beasts.", "144": "X.", "145": "These, then, are the first circumstances of the feast;", "146": "but after the guests have sat down to the table in the order which I have been describing, and when those who minister to them are all standing around in order, ready to wait upon them, and when there is nothing to drink, some one will say .... but even more so than before, so that no one ventures to mutter, or even to breathe at all hard, and then some one looks out some passage in the sacred scriptures, or explains some difficulty which is proposed by some one else, without any thoughts of display on his own part, for he is not aiming at reputation for cleverness and eloquence, but is only desirous to see some points more accurately, and is content when he has thus seen them himself not to bear ill will to others, who, even if they did not perceive the truth with equal acuteness, have at all events an equal desire of learning.", "147": "And he, indeed, follows a slower method of instruction, dwelling on and linger­ ing over his explanations with repetitions, in order to imprint his conceptions deep in the minds of his hearers, for as the understanding of his hearers is not able to keep up with the interpretation of one who goes on fluently, without stopping to take breath, it gets behind-hand, and fails to comprehend what is said;", "148": "but the hearers, fixing their eyes and attention upon the speaker, remain in one and the same position listening attentively, indicating their attention and comprehension by their nods and looks, and the praise which they are inclined to bestow on the speaker by the cheerfulness and gentle manner in which they follow him with their eyes and with the fore-finger of the right hand.", "149": "And the young men who are standing around attend to this explanation no less than the guests themselves who are sitting at meat.", "150": "And these explanations of the sacred scriptures are delivered by mystic expressions in allegories, for the whole of the law appears to these men to resemble a living animal, and its express commandments seem to be the body, and the invisible meaning concealed under and lying beneath the, plain words resembles the soul, in which the rational soul begins most excellently to contemplate what belongs to itself, as in a mirror, beholding in these very words the exceeding beauty of the sentiments, and unfolding and explaining the symbols, and bringing the secret meaning naked to the light to all who are able by the light of a slight intimation to per­ ceive what is unseen by what is visible.", "151": "When, therefore, the president appears to have spoken at sufficient length, and to have carried out his intentions adequately, so that his explanation has gone on felicitously and fluently through his own acuteness, and the hearing of the others has been profitable, applause arises from them all as of men rejoicing together at what they have seen and heard;", "152": "and then some one rising up sings a hymn which has been made in honour of God, either such as be has com­ posed himself, or some ancient one of some old poet, for they have left behind them many poems and songs in trimetre iambics, and in psalms of thanksgiving and in hymns, and songs at the time of libation, and at the altar, and in regular order, and in choruses, admirably measured out in various and well diversified strophes.", "153": "And after him then others also arise in their ranks, in becoming order, while every one else listens in decent silence, except when it is proper for them to take up the burden of the song, and to join in at the end ;", "154": "for then they all, both men and women, join in the hymn.", "155": "And when each individual has finished his psalm, then the young men bring in the table which was mentioned a little while ago, on which was placed that most holy food, the leavened bread, with a seasoning of salt, with which hyssop is mingled, out of reverence for the sacred table, which lies thus in the holy outer temple;", "156": "for on this table are placed loaves and salt without seasoning, and the bread is unleavened, and the salt unmixed with anything else, for it was becoming that the simplest and purest things should be allotted to the most excellent portion of the priests, as a reward for their ministrations, and that the others should admire similar things, but should abstain from the loaves, in order that those who are the more excellent persons may have the precedence.", "157": "XI.", "158": "And after the feast they celebrate the sacred festival during the whole night;", "159": "and this nocturnal festival is celebrated in the following manner:", "160": "they all stand up together, and in the middle of the entertainment two choruses are formed at first, the one of men and the other of women, and for each chorus there is a leader and chief selected, who is the most honourable and most excellent of the band.", "161": "Then they sing hymns which have been composed in honour of God in many metres and tunes, at one time all singing together, and at another moving their hands and dancing in corresponding harmony, and uttering in an inspired manner songs of thanks­ giving, and at another time regular odes, and performing all necessary strophes and antistrophes.", "162": "Then, when each chorus of the men and each chorus of the women has feasted separately by itself, like persons in the bacchanalian revels, drinking the pure wine of the love of God, they join together, and the two become one chorus, an imitation of that one which, in old time, was established by the Red Sea, on account of the wondrous works which' were displayed there;", "163": "for, by the commandment of God, the sea became to one party the cause of safety, and to the other that of utter destruction;", "164": "for it being burst asunder, and dragged back by a violent reflux, and being built up on each side as if there were a solid wall, the space in the midst was widened, and cut into a level and dry road, along which the people passed over to the opposite land, being conducted onwards to higher ground;", "165": "then, when the sea returned and ran back to its former channel, and was poured out from both sides, on what had just before been dry ground, those of the enemy who pursued were overwhelmed and perished.", "166": "When the Israelites saw and experienced this great miracle, which was an event beyond all description, beyond all imagi­ nation, and beyond all hope, both men and women together, under the influence of divine inspiration, becoming all one chorus, sang hymns of thanksgiving to God the Saviour, Moses the prophet leading the men, and Miriam the prophet­ ess leading the women.", "167": "Now the chorus of male and female worshippers being formed, as far as possible on this model, makes a most humor­ ous concert, and a truly musical symphony, the shrill voices of the women mingling with the deep-toned voices of the men.", "168": "The ideas were beautiful, the expressions beautiful, and the chorus-singers were beautiful;", "169": "and the end of ideas, and expressions, and chorus-singers, was piety;", "170": "therefore, being intoxicated all night till the morning with this beautiful in­ toxication, without feeling their heads heavy or closing their eyes for sleep, but being even more awake than when they came to the feast, as to their eyes and their whole bodies, and standing there till morning, when they saw the sun rising they raised their hands to heaven, imploring tranquillity and truth, and acuteness of understanding.", "171": "And after their prayers they each retired to their own sepa­ rate abodes, with the intention of again practising the usual philosophy to which they had been wont to devote themselves.", "172": "This then is what I have to say of those who are called therapeutæ, who have devoted themselves to the contempla­ tion of nature, and who have lived in it and in the soul alone, being citizens of heaven and of the world, and very acceptable to the Father and Creator of the universe because of their vir­ tue, which has procured them his love as their most appro­ priate reward, which far surpasses all the gifts of fortune, and conducts them to the very summit and perfection of happiness.", "173": "I.", "174": "IN every uncertain and important business it is proper to invoke God, because he is the good Creator of the world, and because nothing is uncertain with him who is possessed of the most accurate knowledge of all things.", "175": "But of all times it is most necessary to invoke him when one is preparing to discuss the incorruptibility of the world;", "176": "for neither among the things which are visible to the outward senses is there anything more admirably complete than the world, nor among things appreci­ able by the intellect is there anything more perfect than God.", "177": "But the mind is at all times the governor of the outward sense, and that which is appreciable by the intellect is at all times superior to that which is visible to the outward senses, but those persons in whom there is implanted a vigorous and earnest love of truth willingly undergo the trouble of making inquiries relative to the subordinate things, from that which is superior to and the ruler over them.", "178": "If then, we, who have been practised and trained in all the doctrines of prudence, and temperance, and virtue, have discarded all the stains of the passions and diseases, perhaps God would not disdain to give to souls completely purified and cleansed, so as to appear in his image, a knowledge of heavenly things either by means of dreams, or of oracles, or of signs, or of wonders.", "179": "But since we have on us the marks of folly, and injustice, and of all other vices strongly stamped upon us and difficult to be effaced, we must be content even if we are only able by them to discover some faint copy and imitation of the truth.", "180": "It is right, therefore, for those who are investigating the question whether the world is perishable, since the two words, \"corruption,\" and \" the world,\" will be in continual use, first of all to investigate the precise meaning of both expres­ sions, in order that we may know what is now signified, and what has been ordained.", "181": "And we must enumerate, not indeed everything which is signified by those words, but so much as is useful for the purpose of our present instruction.", "182": "II.", "183": "The world, therefore, is spoken of in its primary sense as a single system, consisting of the heaven and the stars in the circumference of the earth, and all the animals and plants which are upon it;", "184": "and in another sense it is spoken of merely as the heaven.", "185": "And Anaxagoras, having a regard to this fact, once made answer to a certain person who asked of him what the reason was why he generally endeavoured to pass the night in the open air, that he did so for the sake of beholding the world, by which expression he meant the motions and revolutions of the stars.", "186": "And in its third meaning, as the Stoics affirm, it is a certain admirably-arranged essence, extending to the period of confla­ gration, either beautifully adorned or unadorned, the periods of the motion of which are called time.", "187": "But at present the subject of our consideration is the world, taken in the first sense of the word, which being one only, consists of the heaven, and of the earth, and of all that is therein.", "188": "And the term corruption is used to signify a change for the worse;", "189": "it is also used to signify the utter destruction of that which exists, a destruction so complete as to have no existence at all;", "190": "for as nothing is generated out of nothing, so neither can anything which exists be destroyed so as to become non-existence.*", "191": "For it is impossible that anything should be generated of that which has no existence anywhere, and equally so that what does exist should be so utterly destroyed as never to be mentioned or heard of again.", "192": "And indeed in this spirit the tragedian says :", "193": "— \"", "194": "Nought that e'er has been Completely dies, but things combined Before another union find;", "195": "Quitting their former company, And so again in other forms are seen,\"☨ Nor is it so very silly a thing to doubt whether the world is destroyed so as to pass into a state of non-existence, but rather whether it is subjected to a change from a new arrangement, being dissolved as to all the manifold forms of its elements and combinations so as to assume one and the same appearance, or whether, like a thing broken and dashed to pieces, it is subjected to a complete confusion of its different fragments.", "196": "III.", "197": "And there are three different opinions on the subject which we are at present discussing.", "198": "Since some persons affirm that the world is eternal, and uncreated, and not liable to any destruction;", "199": "while others, on the contrary, say that it has been created and is destructible.", "200": "There are also others who take a portion of each of these two opinions, agreeing with the last-mentioned sect that it has been created, but with the former class that it is indestructible;", "201": "and thus they have left behind them a mixed opinion, thinking that it is at the same time created and imperishable.", "202": "However, Democritus and Epicurus, and the principal number of the Stoic philosophers, affirm both the creation and the destructibility of the world, though they do not all speak in similar senses;", "203": "for some give a sketch of many worlds, the generation of which they attribute to the concourse and combi­ nation of atoms, and their destruction they impute to the dissolution and breaking up of the combined particles.", "204": "But the Stoics speak of one world only, and affirm that God is the cause of its creation, but that the cause of its cor­ ruption is no longer God, but the power of invincible, un­ wearied fire, which pervades all existing things, in the long periods of time dissolving everything into itself, while from it again a regeneration of the world takes place through the providence of the Creator.", "205": "And according to these men there may be one world spoken of as eternal and another as destruc­ tible, destructible in reference to its present arrangement, and eternal as to the conflagration which takes place, since it is rendered immortal by regenerations and periodical revolutions which never cease.", "206": "But Aristotle, with a knowledge as to which I know not to what degree I may call it holy and pious, affirmed that the world was uncreated and indestructible, and he accused those who maintained a contrary opinion of terrible impiety, for thinking that so great a visible God was in no respect different from things made with hands, though he contains within him­ self the sun, and the moon, and all the rest of the planets and fixed stars, and, in fact, the whole of the divine nature;", "207": "and he said in a cavilling and reproachful tone, that formerly he had feared for his house lest it should be overthrown by violent gales, or extraordinary storms, or by lapse of time, or through the want of the proper care requisite to preserve it, but that now he had a much greater fear hanging over him In consequence of those men who by their reasonings went to destroy the whole world.", "208": "But some say that it was not Aristotle who invented this doctrine, but some of the Py­ thagoreans;", "209": "but I have met with a work of Ocellus, a Luca­ nian by birth, entitled, \" A Treatise on the Nature of the Universe,\" in which he has not only asserted that the world is indestructible, but he has even endeavoured to prove it so by demonstrative proofs.", "210": "IV.", "211": "But some say that the world has been proved by Plato in the Timæus to be both uncreated and indestructible, in the account of that divine assembly in which the younger gods are addressed by the eldest and the governor of them all in the following terms ;", "212": "* \" 0 ye gods of gods, those works of which I am the father and the creator are indissoluble as long as I choose that they shall be so.", "213": "Now everything which has been bound together is capable of being dissolved, but it is the part of an evil ruler to dissolve that which has been well combined and arranged, and which is in good condition.", "214": "Wherefore, since you also have been created, you are not of necessity immortal or utterly indissoluble;", "215": "nevertheless you shall not be dissolved, nor shall you be exposed to the fate of death, in­ asmuch as you have my will to keep you united, which is a still greater and more powerful bond than those by which you were bound together when you were first created.", "216": "\"But some persons interpret Plato's words sophistically, and think that he affirms that the world was created, not inas­ much as it has had a beginning of creation, but inasmuch as if it had been.", "217": "created it could not possibly have existed in any other manner than that in which it actually does exist as has been described, or else because it is in its creation arid change that the parts are seen.", "218": "But the forementioned opinion is better and truer, not only because throughout the whole treatise he affirms that the Creator of the gods is also the father and creator and maker of everything, and that the world is a most beautiful work of his and his offspring, being an imita­ tion visible to the outward senses of an archetypal model appreciable only by the intellect, comprehending in itself as many objects of the outward senses as the model does objects of the intellect, since it is a most perfect impression of a most perfect model, and is addressed to the outward sense as the other is to the intellect.", "219": "*But also because Aristotle bears witness to this fact in the case of Plato, who, from his great reverence for philosophy, would never have spoken falsely, and also because no one can possibly be more to be credited in the case of a teacher than his pupil, especially when the pupil is such a man as this who did not apply himself to instruction lightly with an indifference easily satisfied, but who even endeavoured to surpass all the discoveries of former men, and did actually devise some novel­ ties and enrich every part of philosophy with some most important discoveries.", "220": "V.", "221": "But some persons think that the father of the Platonic theory was the poet Hesiod, as they conceive that the world is spoken of by him as created and indestructible;", "222": "as created, when he says,­ \"First did Chaos rule;", "223": "Then the broad-chested earth was brought to light, Foundation firm and lasting for whatever Exists among mankind ;", "224": "\"t and as indestructible, because he has given no hint of its dis­ solution or destruction.", "225": "Now Chaos was conceived by Aristotle to be a place, because it is absolutely necessary that a place to receive them must be in existence before bodies.", "226": "But some of the Stoics think that it is water, imagining that its name has been derived from effusion.", "227": "But however that may be, it is exceedingly plain that the world is spoken of by Hesiod as having been created:", "228": "and a very long time before him Moses, the lawgiver of the Jews, had said in his sacred volumes that the world was both created and indestructible, and the number of the books is five.", "229": "The first of which he entitled Genesis, in which he begins in the following manner:", "230": "\" In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth ;", "231": "and the earth was invisible and without form.\"", "232": "Then proceeding onwards he relates in the following verses, that days and nights, and seasons, and years, and the sun and moon, which showed the nature of the measurement of time, were created, which, having received an immortal portion in common with the whole heaven, continue for ever indestructible.", "233": "But we must place those arguments first which make out the world to be uncreated and indestructible, because of our respect for that which is visible, employing an appropriate commencement.", "234": "To all things which are liable to destruction there are two causes of that destruction, one being internal and the other external:", "235": "therefore you may find iron, and brass, and all other substances of that kind destroyed by themselves when rust, like a creeping disease, overruns and devours them;", "236": "and by external causes when, if a house or a city is burnt, they also are consumed in the conflagration, being melted by the violent impetuosity of the fire.", "237": "A similar end also befalls animals, partly when they are sick of diseases arising internally, and partly when they are destroyed by external causes, being sacrificed, or stoned, or burnt, or when they endure an unclean death by hanging.", "238": "And if the world also is destroyed, then it must of necessity be so either by some external cause, or else by some one of the powers which exist within itself;", "239": "and both these alter natives are impossible, for there is nothing whatever outside of the world, since all things are brought together in order to make it complete and full, for it is in this way that it will be one, and whole, and free from old age ;", "240": "it will be one, because if anything were left outside of it, then another world might be created resembling that which exists now;", "241": "and whole, because the whole of its essence is expended on itself;", "242": "and exempt from old age and from all disease, since those bodies which are liable to be destroyed by disease or old age are violently overthrown by external causes, such as heat, and cold, and other contrary qualities, no power of which is able to escape so as to surround and attack the world, all those being entirely enclosed within, without any part whatever being separated from the rest.", "243": "But if indeed there is any external thing it must by all means be a vacuum, or else a nature absolutely impossible, which it would be impossible should either suffer or do any­ thing.", "244": "And again, it will also not be dissolved by any cause existing within itself;", "245": "first of all because, if it were, then the part would be greater and more powerful than the whole, which is the greatest possible absurdity, for the world, enjoying an unsurpassable power, influences all its parts, and is not itself influenced or moved by any one of them;", "246": "in the second place because, since there are two causes of corruption, the one being internal and the other external, those things which are competent to admit the one must also by all means be liable to the other;", "247": "and a proof of this may be found in oxen, and horses, and men, and other animals of similar kinds, because it is their nature to be destroyed by the sword, or to be liable to die by disease;", "248": "for it is difficult, or I might rather say impossible, to find anything which, being by nature at the mercy of some external cause perceptible by the intellect, will still not be liable to corruption ... by itself when the world was not.", "249": "For that which has no existence is not put in motion, but it has been shown already that time is an interval of the motion of the world.", "250": "It follows, therefore, of necessity, that each of these things must have subsisted from all eternity, without receiving any beginning of generation, and being in conse­ quence not liable to any corruption.", "251": "Perhaps some quibbling Stoic will say that time is admitted to be an interval of the motion of the world, but not of that world only which is arranged and adorned by itself, but also of that one which is conceived of in connection with the conflagration which has been spoken of;", "252": "to whom we must reply,—\"My good man.", "253": "you, misapplying words, call what is disorderliness and a want of arrangement order (ϰόσμος), for if this thing which we see is correctly and appropriately called the world (ϰόσμς), * being arranged and adorned (ϰςϰοσμημένος) as we see it by man, by the perfection of his skill, then any one would bo surely correct in calling the change which is wrought in it by fire a want of order.\"", "254": "VI.", "255": "But Critolaus, a man who devoted himself very much to literature, and a lover of the Peripatetic philosophy, agree­ ing with the doctrine of the eternity of the world, used the following arguments to prove it:", "256": "\"If the world was created, then it follows of necessity that the earth was created also;", "257": "and if the earth was created, then beyond all question the human race was so too.", "258": "But man was not created, since he subsists of an everlasting race, as shall be proved, therefore the world is eternal.", "259": "\"But I must now proceed to examine the argument which I postponed just now, if indeed things that are so evident stand in need of any demonstration;", "260": "but, indeed, proofs are neces­ sary on account of the inventors of fables who, filling all life with their falsehoods, have utterly driven truth out of the land, and have not merely banished it from cities and houses, but have even deprived each separate individual of that most valuable possession, and, for the purpose of alluring his sight, have invented metres and rhythm as a bait and a snare, by which they cajole the ears of fools, just as ugly and shapeless courtesans allure the eyes by necklaces and spurious ornaments in the absence of all genuine beauty, for they say that the genera­ tion of mankind by means of one another is a more recent work of nature, but that the more original and ancient mode of their birth is out of the earth, since she both is and is considered the mother of all men.", "261": "And they say that those men who are celebrated among the Greeks as having sprung from seed were produced and grew up as trees do now, being perfect and com­ pletely armed sons of the earth.", "262": "But that this is a mere fiction of fable it is easy to see from many circumstances.", "263": "For the very moment that the first man was born there was a necessity for his receiving growth in accordance with the previously defined measures and numbers of time, for nature has arranged the different ages as certain steps along which man in a manner ascends and descends;", "264": "he ascends while he is growing, and he descends at the period when he is lessen­ ing ;", "265": "and the boundary of the uppermost steps is the prime of life at which when a man has arrived he no longer makes any further advance ;", "266": "but as runners who run the diaulos turn back again upon the same path which they have already travelled, so too does man retrace his steps, giving back in the weakness of old age what he has received from vigorous youth ;", "267": "but to fancy that any one has ever been born absolutely perfect is the part of those who are ignorant of the laws of nature, which are unchangeable ordinances.", "268": "For our minds, being vitiated by the contagion of the mortal body which is united to them, are very naturally liable to changes and alterations, but the works of the nature of the universe are unalterable, since she has dominion over all things, and by means of the stability of whatever desires she has once established she preserves the definitions which have been originally fixed in an unchangeable state.", "269": "If then she had originally thought it proper that men should be born perfect, now also man would still be born in a perfect state, without ever being an infant, or a boy, or a youth, but he would at once be a man, and perhaps he would be altogether exempt from old age and from death, for that thing which has no increase must also of necessity be exempt from all diminu­ tion, for up to the prime of a man's life all his changes tend towards increase, but from that period up to old age and death they exist with a gradual diminution;", "270": "and it is natural to suppose that he who has no share in the former must also be free from the subsequent changes.", "271": "And what is there that can hinder men from shooting up now out of the ground like plants, as they say that they did in former times ?", "272": "For the earth has not yet grown old so as to appear to have become barren by reason of the lapse of time, but it remains in the same condition as before, being always young, because it is a fourth part of the universe, and for the sake of ensuring the duration of the universe it is bound not to decay, because its kindred elements, water, air, and fire, all remain for ever exempt from old age.", "273": "And there is a visible proof of the uninterrupted and everlasting vigour of the earth in the plants which spring from it, for being purified, either by the overflowing of rivers, as they say that Egypt is, or by annual rains, by such irrigation it refreshes and recruits its exhausted powers, and then, having rested for a while, it recovers its natural powers to the full extent of its original vigour, and then it begins again with a repetition of the pro­ duction of similar things to those which it produced before to supply abundant food to every description of animal.", "274": "VII.", "275": "In reference to which fact it appears to me that the poets were very felicitous in the appellation which they gave to the earth when they called it Pandora, inasmuch as it gives all things,.", "276": "both such as are required for use and such as serve to pleasure and to enjoyment, and that not to some only but to all animals which enjoy life.", "277": "Accordingly, if any one, when the spring was in its prime, should be borne on wings and raised aloft, and look down from his height upon the mountain and champaign country, and see the one abounding in rich grass, and verdant, producing herbage, and fodder, and barley, and wheat, and innumerable other kinds of crops such as are grown from seed which the husbandmen have strown, and which the season of the year affords of its own accord, and the other overshadowed with branches and leaves by which the trees are adorned, and very full of fruits (not only such as are suitable for food, but also of such as are able to heal suffering, for the fruit of the olive relieves the fatigue of the body, and that of the vine, when drunk in moderation, relaxes the excessive pains of the soul), and rich also in the fragrant airs which are borne around from flowers, and the indescriba­ ble peculiarities of the various flowers which are diversified by divine skill.", "278": "And then, if he turns aside his eyes from those trees which admit of cultivation, and beholds in their turn poplars, and cedars, and pines, and ashes, and the lofty oaks, and the dense and unceasing masses of all the other wild trees which over­ shadow the most numerous and the greatest of the mountains, and the greater part of the border country wherever there is any deep soil, he will then know that the vigour of the earth, which is always young, is unremitting, unsubdued, and un­ wearied.", "279": "So that since it is in no degree deprived of any portion of its former strength, if it had ever done so before, it would be bringing forth men now also, for two most forcible reasons, one in order that it might not quit the classification belonging to it, especially in the sowing and production of that most excellent of all the creatures which dwell upon the earth, the ruler of all, man, and secondly for the sake of giving assist­ ance to women, who after they have conceived are for about ten months weighed down with the most severe pains, and when they are about to bring forth do very often die in the very pains of labour.", "280": "Is it not then altogether a terrible piece of stupidity to imagine that the earth contains any womb calculated for the production of men ?", "281": "for the womb is the place which vivifies the animal, being as some one has called it the workshop of nature, in which it fashions nothing but animals;", "282": "but it is not a portion of the earth, but of a female animal, carefully fashioned so as to be adapted for the production of living creatures, since otherwise it would be necessary for us to attribute breasts to the earth as to a woman, when it produces men and they are born, so that when first born they may have appropriate food.", "283": "But there is no river nor fountain in the whole habitable world which is said ever to have produced milk instead of water;", "284": "and in addition to this, as it is necessary that a child just born must be fed on milk, so also must he avail himself of the protection of clothing on account of the injury which ensues from cold or heat to children while they are being reared, on which account nurses and mothers, to whom the care of infants when just born is of necessity committed, wrap them up in swaddling clothes ;", "285": "but if they were produced out of the earth, how would it be possible that, being left com­ pletely naked, they would not be at once destroyed either by the coldness of the air on the one hand, or the burning heat of the sun on the other ?", "286": "for when great cold or great heat gets the mastery, it produces diseases and corruptions.", "287": "But after the inventors of fables once began to neglect the truth they then ventured to add to their monstrous stories the fiction that those men who sprung from seed were born also in complete armour;", "288": "for what smith, or what new Vulcan, was there under the earth so skilful as in a moment to prepare so many suits of armour?", "289": "and what experience had creatures just born to enable them to use their weapons?", "290": "for man is a very peaceful animal, nature having given to him reason as his especial honour, by means of which he charms and tames the savage passions.", "291": "It would have been much better instead of arms to give him a herald's wand, a symbol of agreement and peace suitable to a reasonable nature, in order that he might so proclaim peace instead of war to all men everywhere.", "292": "VIlI.", "293": "We have now then discussed at sufficient length the nonsense in opposition to truth which is uttered by those who build up falsehood and fables.", "294": "But we must be well assured that men have from all eternity sprung from other men in constant succession, the man implanting the seed in the woman as in a field, and the woman receiving the seed so as to preserve it, and nature by her unseen operations fashioning everything, and each separate part of the body and of the soul, and giving to the whole race of mankind that which each individual separately is unable to receive, namely, the prin­ ciple of immortality ;", "295": "for though the individual members are continually perishing, yet the race remains undying as a truly divine work.", "296": "But if man, who is but a small portion of the universe, is eternal, then certainly the world itself must have been uncreated so as to be imperishable.", "297": "IX.", "298": "But Critolaus, in arguing in support of his opinion, brought forward an argument of this kind,-\" That which is the cause to man of his being in health is itself free from disease, and, in like manner, the cause of his keeping awake must itself be sleepless ;", "299": "and if this is the case, that which is the cause of his existing for ever must itself also be everlast­ ing.\"", "300": "Now the cause of man's existing for ever is the world, since it is so to all other things whatever;", "301": "therefore the world also is immortal.", "302": "Nevertheless, this point also is worthy of one consideration:", "303": "that everything which is born must by all means at the beginning be imperfect, but as time advances he must increase till he arrives at complete perfection, so that if the world was born it was at one time (that I may use the ex­ pressions appropriate to the ages of men) a mere infant, and subsequently increasing in periods of years and lapse of time, it at last and with great difficulty arrived at perfection, for of necessity the period at which that which of all things has the longest existence must be late.", "304": "But if any one fancies that the world has ever really been subjected to such changes as these, it is time that lie should learn that he has been under the influence of incurable mad­ ness, for it is plain that if that is the case not only will its bodily appearance be increased, but its mind also will receive growth, since they who attribute liability to perish to it con­ ceive it to be a rational creature.", "305": "Therefore, just like a man, it will be devoid of reason at the commencement of its exist­ ence, but endowed with reason at the age when it is in its prime, which it is impious not only to say, but even to think, for how can we imagine the most perfect visible circumference which surrounds us, and which contains within itself so many individual inhabitants, is not always perfect both in soul and body, being exempt from all those evils in which everything which has been born and which is perishable is implicated ?X.", "306": "And in addition to this he says, that there are three causes of death to living animals, besides the external causes which may affect them, namely, disease, old age, and want, by no one of which is the world liable to be attacked or sub­ dued, for that it is composed of entire elements, since there is no part of them which is left out or which remains at liberty, so that any violence can be offered to it, and it also is superior to those powers from which diseases arise;", "307": "and they yielding keep the world free from all disease, and free from old age, and in a state of the most perfect self-sufficiency as to all its requirements, and without need of anything, since, there is nothing wanting to it which can possibly contribute to its durability, and wholly exempt from all successions and alter­ nations of fulness and emptiness, which animals being subject to by reason of their unregulated insatiability, bring upon themselves death instead of life, or, to speak more accurately, a life which is more pitiable than any destruction.", "308": "Moreover, if we saw that there was no such thing as any eternal nature to be seen, those who assert the liability of the world to destruction would not appear to be so guilty of dis­ paraging the world without any excuse, since they would have no example whatever of anything being everlasting;", "309": "but since fate, according to the doctrine of those who have investigated the principles of natural philosophy most accurately, is a thing without any beginning and without any end, connecting all the causes of everything, as to leave no break and no interrup­ tion, why may we not in like manner also affirm of the nature of the world that it subsists for a great length of time, being.", "310": "as it were, an arrangement of what is otherwise in no order, a harmony of what is otherwise wholly destitute of such har­ mony, an agreement of what is otherwise without agreement, a union of things previously separated, a condition of stocks and stones, a nature of things growing from seed and of trees, a life of all animals, the mind and reason of men, and the most perfect virtue of virtuous men ?", "311": "But if the nature of the world is uncreated and indestruc­ tible, then it is plain that the world is held together and powerfully preserved by an everlasting indissoluble chain.", "312": "But some of those who used to hold a different opinion, being overpowered by truth, have changed their doctrine ;", "313": "for beauty has a power which is very attractive, and the truth is beyond all things beautiful, as falsehood on the contrary is enormously ugly;", "314": "therefore Boethus, and Posidonius, and Panætius, men of great learning in the Stoic doctrines, as if seized with a sudden inspiration, abandoning all the stories about conflagra­ tions and regeneration, have come over to the more divine doctrine of the incorruptibility of the world;", "315": "and it is said also that Diogenes, when he was very young, agreed entirely with those authors.......Since, therefore, the arrangement of the world is such as I have endeavoured to describe it, so that there is no part what­ ever left out, so as for any force to be applied, it has now been proved that the world will not be destroyed by any external thing, because in fact nothing whatever external has been left at all;", "316": "nor will it be destroyed by anything in itself on account of the proof which has already been considered and stated, according to which that which was obnoxious to the power of one of those causes was also naturally susceptible of the influence of the other.", "317": "XI.", "318": "And there are testimonies also in the Timæus to the fact of the world being exempt from disease and not liable to destruction, such as these:", "319": "\" Accordingly, of the four ele­ ments the constitution of the world receives each in all its integrity;", "320": "for he who compounded it made it to consist of the whole of fire, and the whole of water, and the whole of air, and the whole of earth, not leaving any portion or any power of any one of them outside, from the following intentions :", "321": "— in the first place, in order that the whole might be as far as possible a perfect animal made up of perfect parts.", "322": "And besides all these things, he ordained that it should be one, in­ asmuch as there is nothing left out of which another similar world could be composed.", "323": "Moreover, he willed that it should be exempt from old age, and free from all disease, considering that those things which in the body are hot or cold, or which have mighty powers, if standing all around and falling upon it unseasonably, would be likely to dissolve it, and, by intro­ ducing diseases and old age, cause it to decay and perish.", "324": "For this cause, and because of this reason, God made the whole universe to consist of entire and perfect elements, and exempt from old age and free from disease.", "325": "\"Let this be taken as a testimony delivered by Plato to the imperishable nature of the world.", "326": "Its uncreated character follows from the truth of natural philosophy;", "327": "for dissolution must of necessity attend everything which is born, and incor­ ruptibility must inevitably belong to everything which is un­ born ;", "328": "since the poet who wrote the following iambic verse, \" All that is born must surely die,\" * appears to have spoken very correctly when he asserted this connection of destructibility with birth.", "329": "The argument may be stated in a different way as follows.", "330": "All compound things which are destroyed are dissolved into the elements of which they were compounded ;", "331": "accordingly, dissolution is nothing else but a return of everything to its original constituent parts ;", "332": "just as, on the contrary, composition is that which compel the things combined to come together in a manner contrary to their nature;", "333": "and indeed, this appears to be the most exact truth;", "334": "for men are composed of the four elements which together make up the whole of the universe, the heaven, the earth, the air, and fire, borrowing a few parts of each in a manner at first sight hardly consistent with nature.", "335": "But the things which are thus combined together are necessarily deprived of a motion in accordance with nature;", "336": "for instance, warmth is deprived of its upward motion, and coldness of its downward tendency, the earthy and somewhat weighty substance being lightened and assuming the higher place, which the most earth-like of our own parts, the head, has obtained in us.", "337": "But of all bonds, that is the worst which is forged by violence, and which, being violent, is also short- lived ;", "338": "for it is speedily broken by those who are bound in it, since

Return unto their parent dust, While those from heavenly seed which rise Are borne uplifted to the skies.", "341": "Nought that has once existed dies, Though often what has been combined Before, we separated find, Invested with another form.\"", "342": "And this law and ordinance is established with reference to everything which is destroyed, that wherever composite things are existing in combination they are thrown into disorder instead of into the order in accordance with nature, which they previously enjoyed, and they are removed to situations opposite to those in which they were previously placed, so that they seem in a manner to be sojourners ;", "343": "and when they are dis­ solved again, then they return to the appropriate parts allotted to them by nature.", "344":

been assigned to the earth, to which all things belonging to it adhere, and to which they descend again even if you throw them into the air:", "351": "and this is a proof that their place is in

second place, water was poured over the earth, and air and fire have gone from the central to the upper part, air having received for its portion the region which is on the borders between air and fire, and fire having received the highest place of all:", "354": "on which account, if you light a torch and press it down towards the ground, nevertheless the flame will still turn in a contrary direction, and lightening itself in accordance with the natural motion of fire, will rise upwards :", "355": "if, then, motion con­ trary to nature is the cause of corruptibility and destruction in

inquire what reason there is for God's destroying the world.", "376": "For if he destroys it at all he must do so either with the intention of never making a world again, or with the object of creating a second fresh one;", "377": "now the former idea is inconsistent with the character of God;", "378": "for it is proper to change disorder into order, and not order into disorder;", "379":

respect from infant children who, very often while playing on the sea shore raise up little mounds of sand, and then pull them down again with their hands and destroy them;", "391": "for it would have been much better- than making another world exactly like the former, neither to take anything from, nor to add anything to, nor to change either for the better or for the worse, what existed originally, but to let it remain just as it was.", "392": "If, on the other hand, he is about to make a world better than the former one, then the maker too must be better than the maker of the former world, so that when he made the former world he was inferior both in his skill and in his intel­ lect, which it is impious even to imagine, for God is at all times equal and similar to himself, being neither capable of any relaxation which can make him worse, nor of any extension which can make him better.", "393": "Men, indeed, do admit of such inequalities in either direction, being naturally liable to alter either for the better or for the worse, and continually admitting of increase, and advance, and improvement, and everything contrary to these states ;", "394": "and besides this, the works of us who are but mortal men may very appropriately be perishable, but the works of the immortal must in all consistency and reason be likewise imperishable, for it is natural that what is made should resemble the nature of the maker.", "395": "XIV.", "396": "And, indeed, this I imagine is evident to every one, that if the earth were to be destroyed, then all land animals of every kind must

nothing else than to fancy the gods them­ selves in a process of destruction, for this is equivalent to considering men immortal.", "401": "And yet in a comparison between different objects devoid of honour, if you were to consider the matter, you would find it more consistent with probability to look on men as immortal than to believe that the gods are perishable, since it might happen through the grace of God, for it is not improbable that a mortal might receive immor­ tality, but it is impossible for gods to lose their immortality even if the sophistries of mankind should run on to ever such a degree of wicked insanity.", "402": "And, moreover, those persons who allege conflagrations and regenerations of the world, think and confess that the stars are gods, which nevertheless they

these, and after he has prefaced his doctrines with the assertion that it is impossible for two makers of a species to exist in the same substance, he proceeds, \" Let it be granted for the sake of argument and speculation that there is one person entire and sound, and another wanting one foot from his birth, and that the sound man is called Dion and the cripple Theon, and afterwards that Dion

rather than in truth, for how could it be said that be who had suffered no mutilation whatever, namely Theon, was taken off, and that Dion, who had lost a foot, was not injured ?", "408": "Very appropriately, he will reply, for Dion, who had had his foot out off, falls back upon the original imperfection of Theon, and there cannot be two specific differences in the same subject, therefore it follows of necessity that Dion must remain, and that Theon must be taken off.", "409": "\"", "410": "So are we slain by arrows winged With our own feathers,\" * as the tragic poet says.", "411": "For

:", "413": "let the world be the subject of our argument, as Dion was just now, for it is perfect, and let the soul of the world take the place of Theon, who was imperfect, since a part is less than the whole;", "414": "and as the foot was cut off from Dion, so also let everything which resembles a body be cut off from the world;", "415": "therefore it is necessary to say that the world has not been destroyed though its body has been taken away, just as Dion was not destroyed by having his foot cut off, but the soul of the world it is that has perished, like Theon, who suffered no artificial mutilation, for the world also receded to a lesser substance when all of it that resembled a body was taken away.", "416": "And the soul was destroyed because there could not be two specific

uncreated.", "420": "Why so ?", "421": "Because, as the great Plato says, it is days, and nights, and months, and the periods of years which have shown time, and it is surely impossible that time can exist without the motion of the suu, and the rotary progress of the whole heaven.", "422": "So that it has been defined very felici­ tously by those who are in the habit of giving definitions of things, that time is the interval of the motion of the world, and since this is a sound definition, then the world must be co-eval with time and also the cause of its existence.", "423": "And it is

appears to be most absurd even to the Stoics.", "430": "Why so ?", "431": "Because it is not possible to discover any cause of destruction either within or without, which will destroy the world.", "432": "For on the outside there is nothing except perhaps a vacuum, inasmuch as all the elements in their integrity are collected and contained within it, and within there is no imperfection so great as to be the cause of dissolution to so great a thing.", "433": "Again, if it is destroyed without any cause, then it is plain that from something which has no existence will arise the engendering of destruction, which is an idea quite inadmissible by reason;", "434": "and, indeed, they say that there are altogether three generic manners of corruption, one which arises from division, another which proceeds from a destruction of the distinctive quality which holds the thing together, and the third from confusion;", "435": "therefore the things which consist of a union of separate members, such as flocks of goats, herds of oxen, choruses, armies;", "436": "or, again, bodies which are com­ pounded of limbs joined together, are dissolved by disjunction and separation.", "437": "But wax, when

together.", "438": "Other things are corrupted by confusion, as the medicine which the physicians call tetrapharmacon, for the powers of the drugs brought together and combined were destroyed in such a manner as to produce one perfect medicine of especial virtue.", "439": "By which, then, of these modes of corruption is it becoming to say that the world is destroyed ?", "440": "By that which is caused by separation ?", "441": "No, for it is not compounded of separate members so that its different parts can be dispersed, nor of portions joined together so that they can be dissolved ;", "442": "nor is it united together in a similar manner to our own bodies, for they have the seeds of decay in themselves, and they are subject to influence of a great variety of things by which they are at times injured;", "443": "but the power of the world is invincible, since by its great superiority to other things it has dominion over everything.", "444": "Is it then destroyed by a complete destruction of its dis­ tinctive qualities ?", "445": "This again is impossible, for there remains.", "446": "as the adversaries affirm, a quality of arrangement which by the process of conflagration is only diminished to a lesser sub­ stance ...", "447": "Is it destroyed then by confusion ?", "448": "Away with such an idea, for in that case it would be necessary to confess that the corruption of a body can be reduced to a state of non-existence.", "449": "Why so ?", "450": "Because if each of the particular elements were destroyed separately, it would be possible for it to become changed into another;", "451": "but if they are altogether destroyed at one and the same moment by confusion, then it would be necessary to imagine what is absolutely impossible.", "452": "Again, besides these arguments, if all things, say they, were destroyed by fire, then what will God have to do during all that time, except absolutely nothing?", "453": "And is it not reasonable to say so ?", "454": "For at present, he overlooks and presides over everything, and regulates everything like a genuine father, and if one is to say the truth, he guides and directs everything, sitting as it were by the side of the sun, and moon, and the other planets, and fixed stars, and also by the air, and the other parts of the world, and he co-operates with them in.", "455": "everything which can conduce to the durability of the universe and to its blameless management, in accordance with right reason.", "456": "But if everything is destroyed, then he will have an existence which will be rendered absolutely miserable, by in­ activity and irremediable want of employment;", "457": "than which what idea can be more absurd?", "458": "I hesitate to add, what it would be impious to say, that death will ensue

of the world, in the opinion of those who maintain the opposite doctrine, is God.XVII.", "461": "Is it not however worth while to examine this question, in what manner there can be a regeneration of all those things which have been destroyed by fire, and resolved into fire ?", "462": "for when their substance has been wholly destroyed by the fire, it follows of necessity that the fire itself must also be extinguished as no longer having any nourishment.", "463": "Therefore, as long as it remained the seminal principle of arrangement was likewise preserved, but when it is destroyed that principle is destroyed with it.", "464": "But it would be impious, and an impiety of double dye, not only to attribute destruction to the world, but also to take away the possibility of its regeneration;", "465": "as if God delighted in disorder, and irregularity, and all kinds of evil things.", "466": "But we must examine this question more accurately, in the following manner.", "467": "There are three species in fire ;", "468": "the coal, and the flame, and the light.", "469": "Now coal is the fire in its earthy substance, which, like a sort of spiritual habit, couches and lies hid in a sort of cavern, pervading it all to its very extremities.", "470": "And the flame is that part which, being raised on high, is lifted up from its fuel.", "471": "And the light is that which is emitted from the flame, so as to co-operate with the eyes, in order to enable them to comprehend what is seen.", "472": "And the flame occupies the middle position between the coal and the light;", "473": "for when it is extin­ guished it ends in coal, and when it is kindled it excites the light, which, being deprived of its burning power, blazes.", "474": "If therefore, we affirm that the world is dissolved by conflagration, it would not be coal, because, in that case there will be a great deal of the earthy substance left behind, in which also fire must necessarily be contained.", "475": "But we must agree, that none of the other bodies subsist any longer, but that earth, and water, and air, are all dissolved into unmixed fire.", "476": "Nor, again, would it become flame ;", "477": "for that can only exist in connexion with nourishment;", "478": "and, if nothing is left behind, being de­ prived of all nourishment it will immediately be extinguished.", "479": "It follows from all this, that it cannot become light either ;", "480": "for light by itself has no substance at all, but flows from the things before mentioned, coal and flame, not in a great degree from the coal, but very much from the flame ;", "481": "for it is diffused over a very great space indeed.", "482": "But if, as has been already proved.", "483": "those things had no existence from the conflagration of all things, then there could not be any light either.", "484": "For the abundant, and vast, and extensive brilliancy of mid-day, when the sun proceeds under the earth, is at once caused to disappear by night, especially if it be a moonless night.", "485": "Therefore the world is not destroyed by fire, but is indestructible.", "486": "And if it should be destroyed by fire, there could not be another created.", "487": "XVIII.", "488": "On which account some of the Stoics also, being gifted with a more acute discernment, and perceiving that they would infallibly be convicted, thought it well to be beforehand in preparing assistance as it were for a defunct proposition.", "489": "But what they prepared was of no use;", "490": "for, since fire is the cause of all motion, and since motion is the beginning of generation, for it is impossible that anything whatever should be generated without motion, they said that before the new world began to be formed, when it was beginning to be fashioned, the whole fire would not be extinguished in that conflagration ;", "491": "that they affirmed that some would still remain, but yet only a small portion.", "492": "For they were exceedingly cautious, lest if it should be wholly extinguished, the conse­ quence would be that everything would remain motionless and devoid of ornament, inasmuch as the cause of motion would no longer be in any existence.", "493": "But all these ideas are the invention of quibblers, who employ all their artifices in opposition to the truth.", "494": "Why so ?", "495": "Because it is impossible, as has been proved already, that the world, after it has been destroyed by conflagration, should become similar to coal, inas­ much as there is a vast quantity of earthy substance left in which the fire must of necessity lie in ambush.", "496": "And perhaps too the conflagration could not prevail in every quarter, if the heaviest and most invincible of the elements, namely the earth, still remains, without being dissolved ;", "497": "but it must of necessity change, either into flame or into light:", "498": "into flame, as Cleanthes thought;", "499": "into light, as Chrysippus conceived.", "500": "But if it becomes flame, then, when it approaches extinction, it will be extinguished all at once, and not partially or gradually.", "501": "For the nutriment exists aloug with it;", "502": "on which account, while there is a great deal of it, it increases and is diffused;", "503": "but when it is stunted it becomes less.", "504": "And any one might conjecture the truth of what takes place from what he sees happen among us.", "505": "A lamp, when any one pours oil upon it, gives forth a most brilliant flame;", "506": "but when any one ceases to supply it with that nutriment, and leaves only a small portion in the lamp, then the lamp is at once extin­ guished, and does not give out the smallest portion of flame.", "507": "If again this is not the case, but if the world becomes light, then again it changes altogether.", "508": "Why so ?", "509": "Because it has no substance or character of its own, but is generated from flame, and when this is wholly and completely extinguished in all its parts, it follows of necessity that the light also must be extin­ guished, and that not partially, but altogether.", "510": "For what flame is to nourishment, that also is light to flame.", "511": "As there­ fore the flame is extinguished concurrently with the want of nourishment, so also is the light simultaneously with the flame, so that it is actually impossible for the world to be capable of regeneration, if there is no seminal principle lurking and kindled within it, but if all things are expended and destroyed, some by fire, and some by want.", "512": "From all which arguments it is plain that the world is for ever uncreated and imperishable.", "513": "XIX.", "514": "Nevertheless, as Chrysippus says, some suppose that fire resolves all the arrangement of the universe when the elements are separated into itself, so that it becomes the seed of the world which is about to be made;", "515": "and suppose in conse­ quence that, of all the ideas which he and his sect have entertained on the subject, none are falsified.", "516": "Granting, in the first place, that generation proceeds from seed, and that all dissolution is a resolving back into seed;", "517": "in the second place, because it is argued by natural philosophers that the world is a rational nature, inasmuch as it is not only possessed of life, but is also endowed with intellect, and moreover even with wisdom;", "518": "by these arguments he establishes the contrary proposition to that which he intends, namely, that it will never be destroyed.", "519": "But the proofs are ready at hand to those who do not fear to join in the investigation.", "520": "Therefore the world resembles either a plant or an animal.", "521": "But whether it is a plant or whether it is an animal, still, if it be destroyed by conflagration, it will never be itself its own seed.", "522": "And the circumstances which take place among our­ selves bear witness that nothing, whether greater or less, when destroyed, has ever been separated in such a manner as to engender seed.", "523": "Do you not see how many materials of plants susceptible of cultivation there are, and how many kinds of wild plants too are diffused over every portion of the earth ?", "524": "Every one of these trees, as long as the trunk is in good health, together with its fruit, produces also a seed to propagate its species;", "525": "but becoming destroyed after a lapse of time, and being wholly withered, roots and all, it never becomes resolved into a ripened seed.", "526": "And so too in the same manner the different kinds of animals, which it is not easy even to enume­ rate by reason of their multitude, as long as they survive and flourish vigorously, produce a seed, which is calculated to propagate their species;", "527": "but when they are dead there is no longer any seed.", "528": "For it would be absurd for a man when he is alive to employ only the eighth part of his soul, which is called the generative power, for the propagation of a being like himself, but after he is dead to exert the whole of himself for the same purpose;", "529": "for death can never be more energetic or efficacious than life.", "530": "And besides, there is no single existing thing which is brought to perfection by seed alone without its appropriate nourishment.", "531": "For seed resembles the beginning, and the beginning by itself does not make perfect;", "532": "for beware of imagining that the ear of corn blossoms and ripens solely from the seed, which is cast by the husbandman on the ploughed field ;", "533": "for in truth, dry­ ness and moisture, the twofold moisture which is derived from the earth, co-operate in the greatest degree towards its growth.", "534": "And so the creature which is fashioned in the womb is not permitted by nature to be brought to life and perfection by the seed alone, but also by the nourishment shed upon it from without, which the woman who has conceived supplies.", "535": "Why then do I say this ?", "536": "Because in the case of such a conflagration as that of which I have been speaking, the seed alone will be left, there being no nutriment remaining, since everything which was to have supplied nutriment will have been resolved into fire;", "537": "so that the world, which would be to be formed, according to the principle of regeneration, will have a lame and imperfect form and character, since that which is chiefly required to co'operate towards its perfection, on which, as on a staff, the seminal origin ought to, and naturally does, lean, is destroyed ;", "538": "but this would be absurd, as is shown, and made manifest from the clearest evidence.", "539": "Again, all those things which derive their origin from seed are of a greater magnitude than the seed which gives them their existence, and are seen to fill a more extended space;", "540": "for very often trees, whose tops reach to heaven itself, shoot up out of a very small grain of seed;", "541": "and the fattest and tallest auimals grow from a very small quantity of moisture, which is laid as their foundation;", "542": "but there happens that which was mentioned a little while ago, that these, at the time nearest to their birth are very little, but that subse­ quently they keep on increasing in size till they arrive at complete perfection.", "543": "But in the case of the universe the exact contrary will take place, for here the seed will both be greater and will also fill a larger space ;", "544": "and the ultimate perfection at which the thing formed arrives will be smaller, and will appear in a smaller space;", "545": "and the world, originally derived from a seed, will not progress from a very small thing towards increase, but, on the other hand, will be diminished from a greater magnitude to a smaller;", "546": "and it is easy to see the truth of what is here said.", "547": "Every body, when it is resolved into fire, is dissolved, and melted, and diffused;", "548": "and when the flame which is in it is extinguished, it is then contracted and shrunk up to nothing;", "549": "but there is no need of arguments to prove a thing which is so clear, as if it were obscure;", "550": "and, indeed, the world, if con­ sumed by fire, will become greater, inasmuch as all its essence will then be dissolved into the thinnest air;", "551": "and it appears to me that the Stoics have foreseen this, and on that account have, in their arguments, assumed that a vacuum of infinite extent will be left abandoned on the outside of the world ;", "552": "that so, since it is fated to be subjected to a certain diffusion of boundless extent, it may not be in want of a place which may be capable of receiving that diffusion.", "553": "When therefore it has been extended and increased to such a degree, as to be very nearly equal to the infinite extent of the vacuum by the bound­ less and illimitable extension of its own diffusion, it then, according to them, is itself the principle of seed to itself;", "554": "but when, according to a perfect regeneration of the parts, its entire substance * ...... being contracted in the extinction of the fire into dense air;", "555": "but when the air again is contracted, and when it settles down into water, then again the water is still further condensed, so as to be changed into earth, which is the best of all the elements.", "556": "But all these arguments are beyond the ordinary ideas of those who are able to consider and argue upon the consequences of these things.", "557": "XX.", "558": "However, besides what has been here said, any one may use this argument also in corroboration of his opinion, which will certainly convince all those who are not deter­ mined to be obstinate beyond all bounds ;", "559": "of those things which in pairs are exactly contrary to one another it is impos­ sible that one thing should be, and that the other should not be;", "560": "for since there is white it follows as a matter of absolute necessity that there must also be black, and since there is a great there must likewise be a little ;", "561": "since there is an odd there must inevitably be an even ;", "562": "since there is a sweet there must be a bitter;", "563": "since there is day there must be night;", "564": "and so on in an infinite number of similar cases;", "565": "but if a conflagra- tion should take place, then something would ensue which is impossible;", "566": "for then, of things in a pair, the one will happen and the other will not.", "567": "Come, now, let us consider the matter thus:", "568": "if everything is resolved into fire, there is then something light, and rare, and warm;", "569": "for all these are the especial properties of fire;", "570": "but there can be nothing heavy, or cold, or thick, which are the opposites of the qualities which I have just enumerated.", "571": "How then can any one more completely overturn the idea of the universal disorder which would be involved in such a confla­ gration than by showing that those things which by a law of nature must exist together, are by this process separated from their natural conjunction?", "572": "And the separation has extended to such a degree, that those who maintain this doctrine attri­ bute eternal durability to the one and deny any existence at all to the other.", "573": "Again, there is this assertion made by some of those who diligently employ themselves in investigating truth which appears to me to be a sufficiently felicitous one;", "574": "if the world is destroyed it will either be destroyed by some other efficient cause, or by God;", "575": "now there is certainly nothing else whatever from which it can receive its destruction, for there is nothing whatever which it does not surround and contain;", "576": "but that which is surrounded and confined within something else is manifestly inferior in power to that which surrounds and confines it, by which it is therefore mastered;", "577": "on the other hand, to say that it is destroyed by God is the most impious of all possible assertions;", "578": "for God is the cause not of disorder, and irregularity, and destruction, but of order, and beautiful regularity, and life, and of every good thing, as is confessed by all those whose opinions are based on truth.", "579": "XXI.", "580": "But a person may very likely wonder at those who talk about conflagrations and regenerations, not only on account of the arguments which I have just been adducing, by which they are convicted of maintaining erroneous opinions, but also above all other reasons for this one;", "581": "for since there are four elements of which the world consists, namely, earth, water, air, and fire, why is it that they are to separate fire from all the others, and to affirm that all the others are dissolved into that one?", "582": "For some one may say, if it is necessary that they should all be resolved into one, why should they not be resolved into air, or water, or earth ?", "583": "For these elements also contain powers of great magnitude ;", "584": "but yet no one has ever said that the world was to pass away into air, or into water, or into earth;", "585": "so that it would be equally natural to deny that it is resolved into fire.", "586": "Moreover, it would have become them, perceiving the beau­ tiful equality which exists in the world, to fear and to feel too great awe to venture to condemn so divine a thing to death :", "587": "for there is a most admirable system of compensation existing in the four elements which arrange and dispense their vicissi­ tudes by the rules of equality, and the definitions of justice;", "588": "for as the seasons of the year, in their proper alternations of revolutions, go through their regular cycle, completing their periodical changes without any cessation;", "589": "in the same manner suppose that the elements of the world in the course of their continual interchanges with one another (though it is a most paradoxical assertion), when they appear to be perishing are in reality being made immortal, passing over the same course again and again, so as to have their existence infinitely pro­ tracted.", "590": "Therefore the steep road begins with the earth;", "591": "for when it is wasted away it endures a change to water, and the water when it has evaporated is changed into air, and the air when rarefied is changed into fire;", "592": "but the downward road descends from the head, when the fire in consequence of the conflagra­ tion which ensues settles down into air, and again when the air being closely pressed settles down into water, and when the water by its copious effusion is condensed so as to be changed into earth.", "593": "Heraclitus therefore spoke very correctly when he said that, \" Water was the death of the soul, and earth the death of water.\"", "594": "For thinking that the breath was the soul, he indi. cates, by this figurative and enigmatical expression, that the end of air is the production of water, and again that the end of water is the production of earth;", "595": "and when he speaks of death lie does not mean utter destruction, but a change into some other element;", "596": "that equalised proportion of the elements which is attempered by itself being thus preserved eternal and uninjured, as is not only probable but absolutely inevitable ;", "597": "since what is unequal is essentially unjust, and injustice is the offspring of wickedness, and wickedness is banished from the abode of immortality.", "598": "But the world is of a divine magnitude, and has been shown to be the abode of those gods which are visible to the outward senses;", "599": "and to affirm that this world is destroyed is the part of those who do not see the connection of nature and the united consequence and coherence of things.", "600": "XXII.", "601": "But some of those persons who have fancied that the world is everlasting, inventing a variety of new arguments, employ also such a system of reasoning as this to establish their point:", "602": "they affirm that there are four principal manners in which corruption is brought about, addition, taking away, transposition, and alteration;", "603": "accordingly, the number two is by the addition of the unit corrupted so as to become the number three, and no longer remains the number two;", "604": "and the number four by the taking away of the unit is corrupted so as to become the number three ;", "605": "again, by transposition the letter Z becomes the letter H when the parallel lines which were previously horizontal are placed perpendicularly II, and when the line which did before pass upwards I, so asto connect the two is now made horizontal, and still extended between them so as to join them.", "606": "And by alteration the word οἶvος, wine, becomes ὄξος, vinegar.", "607": "But of the manner of corruption thus mentioned there is not one which is in the least degree whatever applicable to the world, since otherwise what could we say ?", "608": "Could we affirm that anything is added to the world so as to cause its destruc­ tion ?", "609": "But there is nothing whatever outside of the world which is not a portion of it as the whole, for everything is surrounded, and contained, and mastered by it.", "610": "Again, can we say that anything is taken from the world so as to have that effect?", "611": "In the first place that which would be taken away would again be a world of smaller dimensions than the existing one, and in the second place it is impossible that any body could be separated from the composite fabric of the whole world so as to be completely dispersed.", "612": "Again, are we to say that the constituent parts of the world are transposed ?", "613": "But at all events they remain in their original positions without any change of place, for never at any time shall the whole earth be raised up above the water, nor the water above the air, nor the air above the fire.", "614": "But those things which are by nature heavy, namely the earth and the water, will have the middle place, the earth supporting everything like a solid foundation, and the water being above it;", "615": "and the air and the fire, which are by nature light, will have the higher position, but not equally, for the air is the vehicle of the fire;", "616": "and that which is carried by anything is of necessity above that which carries it.", "617": "Once more:", "618": "we must not imagine that the world is de­ stroyed by alteration, for the change of any elements is equi­ pollent, and that which is equipollent is the cause of unvarying steadiness, and of untroubled durability, inasmuch as it neither seeks any advantage itself, and is not subject to the inroads of other things which seek advantages at its expense;", "619": "so that this retribution and compensation of these powers is equalized by the rules of proportion, being the produce of health and endless preservation, by all which considerations the world is demonstrated to be eternal.", "620": "XXIII.", "621": "Theophrastus, moreover, says that those men who attribute a beginning and destructibility to the world are deceived by four particulars of the greatest importance, the inequalities of the earth, the retreat of the sea, the dissolution of each of the parts of the universe, and the destruction of different terrestrial animals in their kinds;", "622": "and he proceeds to establish the first point thus:", "623": "if the earth had never had any beginning of its creation, then there would have been no portion of it rising above the rest so as to be conspicuous, but all the mountains would have been level, and all the pieces of rising ground would have been even with the plain.", "624": "For as there are such vast showers falling from heaven throughout all ages, it would be natural that of any places which were originally raised on high some would be broken down and washed away by torrents, and others would subside of their own accord and so become lowered, and that every place everywhere would be smoothed;", "625": "but now, as things are, the constant inequalities which exist, and the vast heights of many mountains, reaching up even to the sky, are so many proofs that the earth is not eternal.", "626": "For otherwise, as I have said before, all the earth would long since have been rendered level from one extremity to the other by the vast rains which would have fallen from the eternal commencement of time;", "627": "for it is the character of the nature of water, and especially of such as descends in a heavy fall from lofty places, to push some things away by force, and to cut out and hollow other places by its continual dropping, and in this manner to operate on the hard, rugged, stony ground not less than men digging.", "628": "And again, the sea, as they affirm, is already somewhat diminished, and for proof of this fact we can appeal to the most celebrated islands, Rhodes and Delos, for these were in ancient times invisible, being overwhelmed by and sunk under the sea, but by lapse of time, as the sea gradually diminished, they by slow degrees rose above it and came into sight, as the histories which are written concerning them record.", "629": "And they used to call Delos Anaphe, confirming the account here given by both names, since when it appeared above the waters * it became evident, ☨ having been formerly invisible and unseen.", "630": "And in addition to these arguments they adduce the facts that many great and deep bays and gulfs of vast seas have been dried up, and have become land, and have so turned out no insignificant addition to the adjacent country when sown and planted;", "631": "and on that soil there is still left plenty of proof of such spots having formerly been sea, in the pebbles, and shells, and other things which are commonly washed up on the sea-shore being found in them ;", "632": "on which account Pindar says respecting Delos— \"", "633": "Hail, island raised by God, Chosen abode Of fair Latona's son with golden hair.", "634": "Hail, ocean's youngest child, The last immoveable domain", "635": "That o'er his bosom smiled.", "636": "Upraised from beneath the billowy main Mortals may call you Delos, but the choir That dwells upon Olympus' height, Their chosen bards inspire To praise thee as earth's brightest, holiest light.\"‡", "637": "For Pindar has here called Delos the daughter of the ocean, intending by this enigmatical expression to convey the idea which I have mentioned.", "638": "But if the sea is gradually being diminished then the earth also will be diminished;", "639": "and in long revolutions of years every one of the elements will be entirely consumed and destroyed;", "640": "and the whole air will be consumed, being diminished by little and little ;", "641": "and all things will be absorbed and dissolved into the one substance of fire.", "642": "XXIV.", "643": "And for the purpose of establishing the third alternative of this question they use the following argument:", "644": "beyond all question that thing is destroyed all the parts of which are liable to destruction;", "645": "but all the parts of the world are liable to destruction, therefore the world also is liable to destruction.", "646": "But we must now proceed to consider the question which we postponed till the present time.", "647": "What sort of a part of the earth is that, that we may begin from this, whether it is greater or less, that is not dissolved by time ?", "648": "Do not the very hardest and strongest stones become hard and de­ cayed through the weakness of their conformation (and this conformation is a sort of course of a highly strained spirit, a bond not indissoluble, but only very difficult to unloose), in consequence of which they are broken up and made fluid, so that they are dissolved first of all into a thin dus't, and after­ wards are wholly wasted away and destroyed ?", "649": "Again, if the water were never agitated by the winds, but were left immove­ able for ever, would it not from inaction and tranquillity become dead ?", "650": "at all events it is changed by such stagnation, and becomes very foetid and foul-smelling, like an animal deprived of life.", "651": "And so also the corruptions of the air are plain to everyone, for it is the nature of the atmosphere to become sick and to decay, and, as one may say, in a manner to die;", "652": "since what else is it which a man, who is not aiming at select­ ing plausible language, but only at truth, would call a plague except a death of the atmosphere, which diffuses its own disease and suffering to the destruction of everything which is endowed with life ?", "653": "And why need I speak at great length concerning fire ?", "654": "for if it is deprived of nourishment it is immediately extinguished, becoming, as the poets say, tame by its own natural qualities, on which account it depends upon, and is raised up by the duration of the fuel which is supplied and kindled, but when that is expended the fire also disappears.", "655": "And they say that the dragons in India are exposed to the same' kind of fate, for that they crawl upon the greatest of all beasts, namely ele­ phants, and creep over their backs and the whole of their bellies, and then, if they can find a vein, they divide that and drink the blood, sucking it insatiably, with a strong breath and a vigorous noise.", "656": "Meantime the elephants, though greatly drained, and though becoming gradually exhausted, hold out for some time, leaping about in their perplexity, and lashing their sides with their trunks in the hope of being able to shake off the dragons.", "657": "After a time, as the vital principle is continually becoming more and more exhausted, they are no longer able to leap about, but stand trembling and quivering, and after a little more time their legs become too weak to support them, and they are thrown down and die for want of blood.", "658": "And when they are fallen down those animals which were the causes of their death die with them in the following manner :", "659": "since the dragons have no longer any nourishment, they attempt to loosen the bonds with which they twined them­ selves round the elephants, wishing now to get released from them, but they are pressed down by the weight of the ele­ phants and crushed, and much more so when the animal has become a lifeless, hard, and stone-like substance ;", "660": "for though they wriggle about and try every expedient in order to effect their release from the power of the animal which weighs them down, and by which they are entangled, though they have long practised themselves in every variety of wile, amid all kinds of difficulties and distresses, they at last become too weak to resist, like men who have been starved to death, or who have been caught by a wall which has suddenly fallen down upon them, and not being able even to lift up their heads they die of suffocation.", "661": "If then, each of the separate parts of the world awaits utter destruction, it is plain that the world which is compounded of these can not be itself exempt from destruction.", "662": "We must now consider with accuracy the fourth and remain­ ing argument.", "663": "Thus they argue:", "664": "if the world were eternal then the animals also would be eternal, and much more the human race, in proportion as that is more excellent than the other animals;", "665": "but, on the contrary, those who take delight in inves­ tigating the mysteries of nature consider that man has only been created in the late ages of the world;", "666": "for it is likely, or I should rather say it is inevitably true, that the arts co-exist with man, so as to be exactly co-eval with him, not only because methodical proceedings are appropriate to a rational nature, but also because it is not possible to live without them;", "667": "let us therefore examine the dates of each of these, disregarding the fables invented by the tragedians about the gods;", "668": "but if man is not eternal then neither is any other animal, so that then neither are the places which receive them, the earth, or the water, or the air ;", "669": "from all which considerations it is plain that this world is liable to destruction.", "670": "XXV.", "671": "But it is necessary to encounter such quibbling arguments as these, lest some persons of too little experience should yield to and be led away by them ;", "672": "and we must begin our refutation of them from the same point from which the Sophists begin their deceit.", "673": "They say, \"", "674": "There could no longer be any inequalities existing on the earth, if the world were eternal.\"", "675": "Why not, my most excellent friends?", "676": "For other persons will come up and say that the natures of trees are in no respect different from mountains;", "677": "but just as they at certain seasons lose their leaves, and again at certain seasons recover their verdure again;", "678": "(on which account there is admi­ rable truth in those lines of the poet :", "679": "­ \"Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;", "680": "Another race the following spring supplies;", "681": "They fall successive and successive rise.\" *", "682": "And so in like manner some portions of the mountains are broken off, and others grow in their stead :", "683": "but after a long lapse of time the additional growth becomes conspicuous because the trees having a more rapid nature, display their increase with great rapidity;", "684": "but mountains have a slower character, on which account it happens that the additions which take place in their case are not perceptible by the outward senses except after a long time.", "685": "And these men appear to be ignorant of the manner in which they are produced, since if they had not been, perhaps they would have been silent out of shame ;", "686": "but still there is no reason why we should not teach them;", "687": "but there is nothing new in what is now said, neither are they our words but the ancient sayings of wise men, by whom nothing which was necessary for knowledge has been left uninvestigated ;", "688": "when the fiery principle which is contained beneath, in the earth, is thrust upwards by the natural power of fire, it proceeds to its own appropriate place;", "689": "and if it meets with any respite or relaxation, though ever so slight, it draws up with it a large portion of the earthy substance, as much as it can ;", "690": "and when it has emerged from the earth it proceeds more slowly;", "691": "but the earthy substance being compelled to follow it for a long time, being at last raised to an immense height, is contracted at the top, and at last comes to end on a sharp point imitating the general appearance of the flame of fire;", "692": "for there arises then a most violent contention between two things which are natural adversaries, the lightest and the heaviest of things, each of them pressing onwards to reach its own place, and each striving against the violent efforts of the other ;", "693": "accord­ ingly the fire, which is drawing up the earth with it, is corn­ pelled to sink down by its descending power;", "694": "and the earth naturally inclining to the lowest point is nevertheless to a certain degree made light, and lifted up by the upward ten­ dencies of fire, and so is raised on high, and being at last overpowered by the more influential power which lightens it is thrust upwards towards the natural seat of fire, and established on high.", "695": "Why then need we wonder if the mountains are not entirely washed away by-the impetuosity of the rains, when so great a power, which keeps them together, and by which they are raised up, is very firmly and steadfastly connected with them ?", "696": "For if they were released from the bond which holds them together, it would be natural for them to be entirely dissolved and to be dispersed by the water;", "697": "but since they are bound together by this power of fire, they resist the impetuosity of the rains more surely.", "698": "XXVI.", "699": "These things, then, may be said by us with respect to the argument that the inequalities of the surface of the earth are no proof of the world having been created and being liable to destruction ;", "700": "but with respect to that argument which was endeavoured to be established by the diminution of the sea, we may reasonably adduce this statement in opposition to it:", "701": "\" Do not look only at the islands which have risen up out of the sea, nor at any portions of land which, having been for­ merly buried by the waters, have in subsequent times become dry land ;", "702": "for obstinate contention is very unfavourable to the consideration of natural philosophy, which considers the search after truth to be the chief object of rational desire;", "703": "but look lather at the contrary effects :", "704": "consider how many districts on the main-land, not only such as were near the coast, but even such as were completely in-land, have been swallowed up by the waters;", "705": "and consider how great a portion of land has become sea and is now sailed over by innumerable ships.\"", "706": "Are you ignorant of the celebrated account which is given of that most sacred Sicilian strait, which in old times joined Sicily to the continent of Italy?* and where vast seas on each side being excited by violent storms met together, coming from opposite directions, the land between them was over­ whelmed and broken away;", "707": "from which circumstance the city built in the neighbourhood was called Rhegium,t and the result was quite different from what any one would have expected;", "708": "for the seas which had formerly been separated now flowed together and were united in one expanse;", "709": "and the land which had previously united was now separated into two portions by the strait which intersected it, in consequence of which Sicily, which had previously formed a part of the main­ land, was now compelled to be an island.", "710": "And it is said that many other cities also have disappeared, having been swallowed up by the sea which overwhelmed them;", "711": "since they speak of three in Peloponnesus— \" Ægira and fair Bura's walls, And Helica's lofty halls, And many a once renowned town, With wreck and seaweed overgrown,\" as having been formerly prosperous, but now overwhelmed by the violent influx of the sea.", "712": "And the island of Atalantes which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timæus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inun­ dation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.", "713": "Therefore that imagi­ nary and fictitious diminution of the sea has no connection with the destruction or durability of the world ;", "714": "for in fact it ap­ pears to recede indeed from some parts, but to rise higher in others;", "715": "and it would have been proper rather not to look at only one of these results but at both together, and so to form one's opinion, since in all the disputed questions which arise in human life, a wise and honest judge will not deliver his opinion before he has heard the arguments of the advocates on both sides.", "716": "XVII.", "717": "And as for the third argument, it is convicted by itself, as being derived only from an unsound system of ques­ tioning proceeding from the assertions originally made;", "718": "for in truth it does not necessarily follow that a thing, all the parts of which are liable to corruption, is likewise perishable itself;", "719": "but this is only inevitably true of that thing of which all the parts are perishable when taken collectively and together in the same place and at the same time, since in the case of a person who has the tip of his finger cut off, he is not disabled from living, but if he had the whole collection of all his parts and limbs cut off at once, he would die immediately.", "720": "There­ fore in the same manner, if all the elements of the world together were all to disappear at one and the same moment, then it would be necessary to admit that the world was liable to corruption and destruction;", "721": "but if each of these elements separately only changes its nature so as to assimilate to that of its nature, it is then rendered immortal rather than destroyed, according to the philosophical statement of the tragic poet­ \"Nought that has once existed dies, Though often what has been combined Before, we separated find, Invested with another form,\" For it is the greatest folly imaginable to estimate the antiquity of the human race from the state of art;", "722": "for if any one were to follow the absurdity of such a system of reasoning as this, he will prove the world to be very young indeed, and to have been made scarcely a thousand years, since all those men whom we have heard of traditionally as the discoverers in different branches of science do not go back to a greater number of years than that which I have mentioned.", "723": "But if we must speak of the arts as co-eval with the race of mankind, then we must speak, drawing our arguments from natural history, and not inconsiderately or carelessly.", "724": "And what is this history ?", "725": "The destruction of the things on the earth, not all together, but of the greatest number of them, is attributed to two principal causes, the indescribable violence and power of fire and water.", "726": "And they say that each of these elements attacks them in its turn, after very long periods of revolving years.", "727": "When, therefore, a conflagration seizes upon things, a stream of ethereal fire being poured down from above is frequently diffused over them, overrunning many districts of the habitable world;", "728": "and when a deluge draws down the whole of the rainy nature of water, the regular rivers and torrents overflowing, and not only that, but even far exceeding the ordinary measure of a common flood, and breaking down their banks with their violence, or else overleaping them, and rising to an enormous height, from which they swell and are diffused over all the adjacent champaign country, and the land is in the first instance divided into huge lakes, as the water is con­ tinually settling down into the more hollow parts, and after­ wards flows still higher, and inundates the isthmuses which separate the lakes, till at last everything presents the appear­ ance of one vast sea from the union of so many waters.", "729": "And then it happens that, through the violence of these powers contending against one another in turn, the inhabitants of the places exposed to it are destroyed;", "730": "those who dwell on the mountains and higher ground, and in ill-watered districts, being destroyed by fire, as not having a sufficiency of water, which is the natural weapon with which to repel fire, and those, on the other hand, being destroyed by water who live on the banks of rivers or lakes, or on the shores of the sea, for evils like to attack those who are nearest first, or indeed solely.", "731": "Accordingly, when the greater part of mankind is destroyed in the manners above mentioned, besides an infinity of other ways of less power and importance, it follows of necessity that the arts also must fail, for it cannot be possible to discuss science by itself without some one to reduce it to method and practice.", "732": "But when those common pestilences relax their fury, and when the human race begins again to recover vigour and to flourish, descending from those who have not been previously destroyed by the evils which pressed upon them, then the arts also begin again to exist, not indeed as they were at first, but in thinner numbers from the diminution of the numbers of those who practise them.", "733": "I have now then set forth to the best of my ability what I have been able to learn or to understand concerning the indestructibility of the world, and in the subsequent treatises I shall proceed to show what may be said against each of the arguments here stated.", "734": "1.", "735": "FLACCUS AVILLIUS succeeded Sejanus in his hatred of and hostile designs against the Jewish nation.", "736": "He was not, indeed, able to injure the whole people by open and direct means as he had been, inasmuch as he had less power for such a purpose, but he inflicted the most intolerable evils on all who came within his reach.", "737": "Moreover, though in appearance he only attacked a portion of the nation, in point of fact he directed his aims against all whom he could find anywhere, proceeding more by art than by force;", "738": "for those men who, though of tyrannical natures and dispositions, have not strength enough to accomplish their designs openly, seek to compass them by manoeuvres.", "739": "This Flaccus being chosen by Tiberius Cæsar as one of his intimate companions, after the death of Severus, who had been lieutenant-governor in Egypt, was appointed viceroy of Alex­ andria and the country round about, being a man who at the beginning, as far as appearance went, had given innumerable instances of his excellence, for he was a man of prudence and diligence, and great acuteness of perception, very energetic in executing what he had determined on, very eloquent as a speaker, and skilful too at discerning what was suppressed as well as at understanding what was said.", "740": "Accordingly in a short time he became perfectly acquainted with the affairs of Egypt, and they are of a very various and diversified character, so that they are not easily comprehended even by those who from their earliest infancy have made them their study.", "741": "The scribes were a superfluous body when he had made such advances towards the knowledge of all things, whether important or trivial, by his extended experience, that he not only surpassed them, but from his great accuracy was qualified instead of a pupil to become the instructor of those who had hitherto been the teachers of all other persons.", "742": "However, all those things in which he displayed an admirable system and great wisdom concerning the accounts and the general arrange­ ment of the revenues of the land, though they were serious matters and of the last importance, were nevertheless not such as gave any proofs of a soul fit for the task of governing ;", "743": "but those things which exhibited a more brilliant and royal disposition he also displayed with great freedom.", "744": "For instance, he bore himself with considerable dignity, and pride and pomp are advantageous things for a ruler;", "745": "and he decided all suits of importance in conjunction with the magistrates, he pulled down the overproud, he forbade promiscuous mobs of men from all quarters to assemble together, and prohibited all associa­ tions and meetings which were continually feasting together under pretence of sacrifices, making a drunken mockery of public business, treating with great vigour and severity all who resisted his commands.", "746": "Then when he had filled the whole city and country with his wise legislation, he proceeded in turn to regulate the military affairs of the land, issuing commands, arranging matters, training the troops of every kind, infantry, cavalry, and light- armed, teaching the commanders not to deprive the soldiers of their pay, and so drive them to acts of piracy and rapine, and teaching each individual soldier not to proceed to any actions unauthorised by his military service, remembering that he was appointed with the especial object of preserving peace.", "747": "II.", "748": "Perhaps some one may say here :", "749": "\"Do you then, my good man, you who have determined to accuse this man, bring no accusation whatever against him, but on the contrary, weave long panegyrics in his honour?", "750": "Arc you not doting and mad?\"\"", "751": "I am not mad, my friend, nor am I a downright fool, so as to be unable to see the consequences or connexion of things.", "752": "I praise Flaccus, not because it is right to praise an enemy, but in order to make his wickedness more conspicuous;", "753": "for pardon is given to a man who does wrong from ignorance of what is right;", "754": "but he who does wrong knowingly has no excuse, being already condemned by the tribunal of his own conscience.", "755": "\"III.", "756": "For having received a government which was intended to last six years, for the first five years, while Tiberius Cæsar was alive, he both preserved peace and also governed the country generally with such vigour and energy that he was superior to all the governors who had gone before him.", "757": "But in the last year, after Tiberius was dead, and when Caius had succeeded him as emperor, he began to relax in and to be indifferent about everything, whether it was that he was over­ whelmed with most heavy grief because of Tiberius (for it was evident to everyone that he grieved exceedingly as if for a near relation, both by his continued depression of spirits and his incessant weeping, pouring forth tears without end as if from an inexhaustible fountain), or whether it was because he was disaffected to his successor, because he preferred devoting him­ self to the party of the real rather than to that of the adopted children, or whether it was because he had been one of those who had joined in the conspiracy against the mother of Caius, having joined against her at the time when the accusations were brought against her, on account of which she was put to death, and having escaped through fear of the consequence of proceeding against him.", "758": "However, for a time he still paid some attention to the affairs of the state, not wholly abandoning the administration of his government;", "759": "but when he heard that the grandson of Tiberius and his partner in the government had been put to death at the command of Caius, he was smitten with intolerable anguish, and threw himself on the ground, and lay there speechless, being utterly deprived of his senses, for indeed his mind had long since been enervated by grief.", "760": "For as long as that child lived he did not despair of some sparks still remaining of his own safety, but now that he was dead.", "761": "he considered that all his own hopes had likewise died with him, even if a slight breeze of assistance might still be left, such as his friendship with Macro, who had unbounded influence with Cams in his authority;", "762": "and who, as it is said.", "763": "had very greatly contributed to his obtaining the supreme power, and in a still higher degree to his personal safety, since Tiberius had frequently thought of putting Caius out of the way, as a wicked man and one who was in no respects calcu­ lated by nature for the exercise of authority, being influenced also partly by his apprehensions for his grandson ;", "764": "for he feared lest, when he himself was dead, his death too would be added to the funerals of his family.", "765": "But Macro had constantly bade him discard these apprehen­ sions from his mind, and had praised Caius, as a man of a simple, and honest, and sociable character;", "766": "and as one who was very much attached to his cousin, so that he would willingly yield the supreme authority to him alone, and the first rank in everything.", "767": "And Tiberius, being deceived by all these repre­ sentations, without being aware of what he was doing, left behind him a most irreconcileable enemy, to himself, and his grandson, and his whole family, and to Macro, who was his chief adviser and comforter, and to all mankind;", "768": "for when Macro saw that Caius was forsaking the way of virtue and yielding to his unbridled passions, following them wherever they led him and against whatever objects they led him, he admonished and reproved him, looking upon him as the same Caius who, while Tiberius was alive, was mild-tempered and docile ;", "769": "but to his misery he suffered most terrible punishment for his exceeding, good-will, being put to death with his wife, and children, and all his family, as a grievous and troublesome object to his new sovereign.", "770": "For whenever he saw him at a distance coming towards him, he used to speak in this manner to those who were with him :", "771": "\"", "772": "Let us not smile;", "773": "let us look sad:", "774": "here comes the censor and monitor;", "775": "the all-wise man, he who is beginning now to be the schoolmaster of a full-grown man, and of an emperor, after time itself has sepa­ rated him from and discarded the tutors of his earliest infancy.\"", "776": "IV.", "777": "When, therefore, Flaccus learnt that he too was put to death, he utterly abandoned all other hope for the future, and was no longer able to apply himself to public affairs as he had done before, being enervated and wholly broken down in spirit.", "778": "But when a magistrate begins to despair of his power of exerting authority, it follows inevitably, that his subjects must quickly become disobedient, especially those who are naturally, at every trivial or common occurrence, inclined to show insubordination, and, among people of such a disposition, the Egyptian nation is pre-eminent, being constantly in the habit of exciting great seditions from very small sparks.", "779": "And being placed in a situation of great and perplexing dif­ ficulty he began to rage, and simultaneously, with the change of his disposition for the worse, he also altered everything which had existed before, beginning with his nearest friends and his most habitual customs;", "780": "for he began to suspect and to drive from him those who were well affected to him, and who were most sincerely his friends, and he reconciled himself to those who were originally his declared enemies, and he used them as advisers under all circumstances;", "781": "but they, for they persisted in their ill-will, being reconciled with him only in words and in appearance, but in their actions and in their hearts they bore him incurable enmity, and though only pre­ tending a genuine friendship towards him, like actors in a theatre, they drew him over wholly to their side;", "782": "and so the governor became a subject, and the subjects became the governor, advancing the most unprofitable opinions, and im­ mediately confirming and insisting upon them;", "783": "for they be­ came executors of all the plans which they had devised, treating him like a mute person on the stage, as one who was only, by way of making up the show, inscribed with the title of authority, being themselves a lot of Dionysiuses, dema­ gogues, and of Lampos, a pack of cavillers and word-splitters;", "784": "and of Isidoruses, sowers of sedition, busy-bodies, devisers of evil, troublers of the state;", "785": "for this is the name which has, at last, been given to them.", "786": "All these men, having devised a most grievous design against the Jews, proceeded to put it in execution, and coming privately to Flaccus said to him, \" All your hope from the child of Tiberius Nero has now perished, and that which was your second best prospect, your companion Macro, is gone too, and you have no chance of favour with the emperor, therefore we must find another advocate, by whom Caius may be made propitious to us, and that advocate is the city of Alexandria, which all the family of Augustus has honoured from the very beginning, and our present master above all the rest;", "787": "and it will be a sufficient mediator in our behalf, if it can obtain one boon from you, and you cannot confer a greater benefit upon it than by abandoning and denouncing all the Jews.", "788": "\"Now though upon this he ought to have rejected and driven away the speakers as workers of revolution and common ene­ mies, he agrees on the contrary to what they say, and at first he made his designs against the Jews less evident, only abstaining from listening to causes brought before his tribunal with impartiality and equity, and inclining more to one side than to the other, and not allowing to both sides an equal freedom of speech;", "789": "but whenever any Jew came before him he showed his aversion to him, and departed from his habitual affability in their case;", "790": "but afterwards he exhibited his hos­ tility to them in a more conspicuous manner.", "791": "V.", "792": "Moreover, some occurrences of the following description increased that folly and insolence of his which was derived from instruction rather than from nature.", "793": "Caius Cæsar gave Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the king, the third part of his paternal inheritance as a sovereignty, which Philip the tetrarch, who was his uncle on his father's side, had previously enjoyed.", "794": "And when he was about to set out to take possession of his kingdom, Caius advised him to avoid the voyage from Brun­ dusium to Syria, which was a long and troublesome one, and rather to take the shorter one by Alexandria, and to wait for the periodical winds;", "795": "for he said that the merchant vessels which set forth from that harbour were fast sailers, and that the pilots were most experienced men, who guided their ships like skilful coachmen guide their horses, keeping them straight in the proper course.", "796": "And lie took his advice, looking upon him both as his master and also as a giver of good counsel.", "797": "Accordingly, going down to Dicæarchia, and seeing some Alexandrian vessels in the harbour, looking all ready and fit to put to sea, he embarked with his followers, and had a fair voyage, and so a few days afterwards he arrived at his journey's end, unforeseen and unexpected, having commanded the cap­ tains of his vessels (for he came in sight of Pharos about twilight in the evening) to furl their sails, and to keep a short distance out of sight in the open sea, until it became late in the evening and dark, and then at night he entered the port, that when he disembarked he might find all the citizens buried in sleep, and so, without any one seeing him, he might arrive at the house of the man who was to be his entertainer.", "798": "With so much modesty then did this man arrive, wishing if it were possible to enter without being perceived by any one in the city.", "799": "For he had not come to see Alexandria, since he had so­ journed in it before, when he was preparing to take his voyage to Rome to see Tiberius, but he desired at this time to take the quickest road, so as to arrive at his destination with the smallest possible delay.", "800": "But the men of Alexandria being ready to burst with envy and ill-will (for the Egyptian dispo­ sition is by nature a most jealous and envious one and inclined to look on the good fortune of others as adversity to itself), and being at the same time filled with an ancient and what I may in a manner call an innate enmity towards the Jews, were in­ dignant at any one's becoming a king of the Jews, no less than if each individual among them had been deprived of an ancestral kingdom of his own inheritance.", "801": "And then again his friends and companions came and stirred up the miserable Flaccus, inviting, and exciting, and stimu­ lating him to feel the same envy with themselves ;", "802": "saying, \" The arrival of this man to take upon him his government is equivalent to a deposition of yourself.", "803": "He is invested with a greater dignity of honour and glory than you.", "804": "He attracts all eyes towards himself when they see the array of sentinels and body-guards around him adorned with silvered and gilded arms.", "805": "For ought he to have come into the presence of another governor, when it was in his power to have sailed over the sea, and so to have arrived in safety at his own govern­ ment?", "806": "For, indeed, if Caius did advise or rather command him to do so, he ought rather with earnest solicitations to have deprecated any visit to this country, in order that the real governor of it might not be brought into disrepute and appear to have his authority lessened by being apparently disre­ garded.", "807": "\"When he heard this he was more indignant than before, and in public indeed he pretended to be his companion and his friend, because of his fear of the man who directed his course, but secretly he bore him much ill-will, and told every one how he hated him, and abused him behind his back.", "808": "and insulted him indirectly, since he did not dare to do so openly ;", "809": "for he encouraged the idle and lazy mob of the city (and the mob of Alexandria is one accustomed to great license of speech, and one which delights above measure in calumny and evil-speak­ ing), to abuse the king, either beginning to revile him in his own person, or else exhorting and exciting others to do so by the agency of persons who were accustomed to serve him in business of this kind.", "810": "And they, having had the cue given them.", "811": "spent all their days reviling the king in the public schools, and stringing together all sorts of gibes to turn him into ridicule.", "812": "And at times they employed poets who compose farces, and managers of puppet shows, displaying their natural aptitude for every kind of disgraceful employment, though they were very slow at learning anything that was creditable, but very acute, and quick, and ready at learning anything of an opposite nature.", "813": "For why did he not show his indignation, why did he not commit them to prison, why did he not chas­ tise them for their insolent and disloyal evil speaking ?", "814": "And even if he had not been a king but only one of the household of Cæsar, ought he not to have had some privileges and espe­ cial honours ?", "815": "The fact is that all these circumstances are an undeniable evidence that Flaccus was a participator in all this abuse;", "816": "for he who might have punished it with the most extreme severity, and entirely checked it, and who yet took no steps to restrain it, was clearly convicted of having permitted and encouraged it;", "817": "but whenever an ungoverned multitude begins a course of evil doing it never desists, but proceeds from one wickedness to another, continually doing some monstrous thing.", "818": "VI.", "819": "There was a certain madman named Carabbas, afflicted not with a wild, savage, and dangerous madness (for that comes on in fits without being expected either by the patient or by bystanders), but with an intermittent and more gentle kind ;", "820": "this man spent all his days and nights naked in the roads, minding neither cold nor heat, the sport of idle children and wanton youths ;", "821": "and they, driving the poor wretch as far as the public gymnasium, and setting him up there on high that he might be seen by everybody, flattened out a leaf of papyrus and put it on his head instead of a diadem, and clothed the rest of his body with a common door mat instead of a cloak, and instead of a sceptre they put in his hand a small stick of the native papyrus which they found lying by the way side and gave to him;", "822": "and when, like actors in theatrical spectacles, he had received all the insignia of royal authority, and had been dressed and adorned like a king, the young men bearing sticks on their shoulders stood on each side of him instead of spear­ bearers, in imitation of the body-guards of the king, and then others came up, some as if to salute him, and others making as though they wished to plead their causes before him, and others pretending to wish to consult with him about the affairs of the state.", "823": "Then from the multitude of those who were standing around there arose a wonderful shout of men calling out Maris ;", "824": "and this is the name by which it is said that they call the kings among the Syrians ;", "825": "for they knew that Agrippa was by birth a Syrian, and also that he was possessed of a great district of Syria of which he was the sovereign ;", "826": "when Flaccus heard, or rather when he saw this, he would have done right if he had appre­ bended the maniac and put him in prison, that he might not give to those who reviled him any opportunity or excuse for insulting their superiors, and if he had chastised those who dressed him up for having dared both openly and disguisedly, both with words and actions, to insult a king and a friend of Cæsar, and one who had been honoured by the Roman senate with imperial authority;", "827": "but he not only did not punish them, but he did not think fit even to check them, but gave complete license and impunity to all those who designed ill, and who were disposed to show their enmity and spite to the king, pretending not to see what he did see, and not to hear what he did hear.", "828": "And when the multitude perceived this, I do not mean the ordinary and well-regulated population of the city, but the mob which, out of its restlessness and love of an unquiet and disor­ derly life, was always filling every place with tumult and con­ fusion, and who, because of their habitual idleness and laziness, were full of treachery and revolutionary plans, they, flocking to the theatre the first thing in the morning, having already purchased Flaccus for a miserable price, which he with his mad desire for glory and with his slavish disposition, conde­ scended to take to the injury not only of himself, but also of the safety of the commonwealth, all cried out, as if at a signal given, to erect images in the synagogues, proposing a most novel and unprecedented violation of the law.", "829": "And though they knew this (for they are very shrewd in their wickedness), they adopted a deep design, putting forth the name of Cæsar as a screen, to whom it would be impiety to attribute the deeds of the guilty;", "830": "what then did the gover­ nor of the country do?", "831": "Knowing that the city had two classes of inhabitants, our own nation and the people of the country, and that the whole of Egypt was inhabited in the same man­ ner, and that Jews who inhabited Alexandria and the rest of the country from the Catabathmos on the side of Libya to the boundaries of Ethiopia were not less than a million of men ;", "832": "and that the attempts which were being made were directed against the whole nation, and that it was a most mischievous thing to distress the ancient hereditary customs of the land ;", "833": "he, disregarding all these considerations, permitted the mob to proceed with the erection of the statues, though he might have given them a vast number of admonitory pre­ cepts instead of any such permission, either commanding them as their governor, or advising them as their friend.", "834": "VII.", "835": "But he, for he was eagerly co-operating in all that was being done amiss, thought fit to use his superior power to face the seditious tumult with fresh additions of evil, and as far as it depended on him, one may almost say that he filled the whole of the inhabited world with civil wars ;", "836": "for it was sum­ ciently evident that the report about the destruction of the synagogues, which took its rise in Alexandria would be imme­ diately spread over all the districts of Egypt, and would extend from that country to the east and to the oriental nations, and from the borders of the land in the other direc­ tion, and from the Mareotic district which is the frontier of Libya, towards the setting of the sun and the western nations.", "837": "For no one country can contain the whole Jewish nation, by reason of its populousness ;", "838": "on which account they frequent all the most prosperous and fertile countries of Europe and Asia, whether islands or continents, looking indeed upon the holy city as their metropolis in which is erected the sacred temple of the most high God, but accounting those regions which have been occupicd by their fathers, and grandfathers, and great grandfathers, and still more remote ancestors, in which they have been born and brought up, as their country;", "839": "and there are even some regions to which they came the very moment that they were originally settled, sending a colony of their people to do a pleasure to the founders of the colony.", "840": "And there was reason to fear lest all the populace in every country, taking what was done in Egypt as a model and as an excuse, might insult those Jews who were their fellow citizens, by introducing new regulations with respect to their synagogues and their national customs;", "841": "but the Jews, for they were not inclined to remain quiet under everything, although naturally entirely disposed towards peace, not only because contests for natural customs do among all men appear more important than those which are only for the sake of life, but also because they alone of all the people under the sun, if they were deprived of their houses of prayer, would at the same time be deprived of all means of showing their piety towards their benefactors, which they would have looked upon as worse than ten thousand deaths, inasmuch as if their synagogues were destroyed they would no longer have any sacred places in which they could declare their gratitude, might have reasonably said to those who opposed them:", "842": "You, without being aware of it, are taking away honour from your lords instead of conferring any on them.", "843": "Our houses of prayer are manifestly incitements to all the Jews in every part of the habitable world to display their piety and loyalty towards the house of Augustus;", "844": "and if they are destroyed from among us, what other place, or what other manner of show­ in,, that honour, will be left to us ?", "845": "For if we were to neglect the opportunity of adhering to our national customs when it is afforded to us, we should deserve to meet with the severest punishment, as not giving any proper or adequate return for the benefits which we have received;", "846": "but if, while it is in our power to do so, we, in conformity with our own laws which Augustus himself is in the habit of confirming, obey in every­ thing, then I do not see what great, or even what small offence can be laid to our charge ;", "847": "unless any one were to impute to us that we do not transgress the laws of deliberate purpose, and that we do not intentionally take care to depart from our national customs, which practices, even if they at first attack others, do often in the end visit those who are guilty of them.", "848": "But Flaccus, saying nothing that he ought to have said, and everything which he ought not to have said, has sinned against us in this manner;", "849": "but those men whom he has studied to gratify, what has been their design ?", "850": "Have they had the feel­ ings of men wishing to do honour to Csesar ?", "851": "Was there then a scarcity of temples in the city, the greatest and most import­ ant parts of which are all allotted to one or other of the gods.", "852": "in which they might have erected any statues they pleased ?", "853": "We have been describing the evidence of hostile and unfriendly men, who seek to injure us with such artifice, that even when injuring us they may not appear to have been acting iniqui tously, and yet that we who are injured by them cannot resist with safety to ourselves;", "854": "for, my good men, it does not con­ tribute to the honour of the emperor to abrogate the laws, to disturb the national customs of a people, to insult those who live in the same country, and to teach those who dwell in other cities to disregard unanimity and tranquillity.", "855": "VIII.", "856": "Since, therefore, the attempt which was being made to violate the law appeared to him to be prospering, while he was destroying the synagogues, and not leaving even their name, he proceeded onwards to another exploit, namely, the utter destruction of our constitution, that when all those things to which alone our life was anchored were cut away, namely, our national customs and our lawful political rights and social privileges, we might be exposed to the very extremity of calamity, without having any stay left to which we could cling for safety, for a few days afterwards he issued a notice in which he called us all foreigners and aliens, without giving us an oppor­ tunity of being heard in our own defence, but condemning us without a trial;", "857": "and what command can be more full of tyranny than this ?", "858": "He himself being everything-accuser, enemy, witness, judge, and executioner, added then to the two former appel­ lations a third also, allowing any one who was inclined to proceed to exterminate the Jews as prisoners of war.", "859": "So when the people had received this license, what did they do ?", "860": "There are five districts in the city, named after the first five letters of the written alphabet, of these two are called the quarters of the Jews, because the chief portion of the Jews lives in them.", "861": "There are also a few scattered Jews, but only a very few, living in some of the other districts.", "862": "What then did they do ?", "863": "They drove the Jews entirely out of four quarters, and crammed them all into a very small portion of one;", "864": "and by reason of their numbers they were dispersed over the sea-shore, and desert places, and among the tombs, being deprived of all their property;", "865": "while the populace, overrunning their desolate houses, turned to plunder, and divided the booty among them­ selves as if they had obtained it in war.", "866": "And as no one hindered them, they broke open even the workshops of the Jews, which were all shut up because of their mourning for Drusilla,* and carried off all that they found there, and bore it openly through the middle of the market-place as if they had only been making use of their own property.", "867": "And the cessation of business to which they were compelled to submit was even a worse evil than the plunder to which they were exposed, as the consequence was that those who had lent money lost what they had lent, and as no one was per­ mitted, neither farmer, nor captain of a ship, nor merchant, nor artisan, to employ himself in his usual manner, So that poverty was brought on them from two sides at once, both from rapine, as when license was thus given to plunder them they were stripped of everything in one day, and also from the circumstance of their no longer being able to earn money by their customary occupations.", "868": "IX.", "869": "And though these were evils sufficiently intolerable, yet nevertheless they appear actually trifling when compared with those which were subsequently inflicted on them, for poverty indeed is a bitter evil, especially when it is caused by the machinations of one's enemies, still it is less than insult and personal ill treatment even of the slightest character.", "870": "But now the evils which were heaped upon our people were so excessive and inordinate, that if a person were desirous to use appropriate language, he would never call them insults or assaults, but, as it appears to me, he-would actually be wholly at a loss for suitable expressions, on account of the enormity of the cruelties now newly invented against them, so that if the treatment which men experience from enemies who have sub­ dued them in war, however implacable they may be by nature, were to be compared with that to which the Jews were sub­ jected, it would appear most merciful.", "871": "Enemies, indeed, plunder their conquered foes of their money, and lead away multitudes in captivity, having incurred the same risk of losing all that they had if they themselves had been defeated.", "872": "Not but that in all such cases there are very many persons for whom their relations and friends put down a ransom, and who are thus emancipated from captivity, inasmuch as though their enemies could not be worked upon by compassion, they could by love of money.", "873": "But what is the use of going on in this way, some one will say, for as long as men escape from danger it signifies but little in what way their preservation is brought to pass ?", "874": "Moreover, it has often, happened that enemies have granted to those who have fallen in battle the honour of funeral rites, those who were gentle and humane burying them at their own expense, and those who have carried on their enmity even against the dead giving up their bodies to their friends under a truce, in order that they might not be deprived of the last honour of all.", "875": "the customary ceremonies of sepulture.", "876": "This, then, is the conduct of enemies in time of war;", "877": "let us now see what was done by those who a little while before had been friends in time of peace.", "878": "For after plundering them of everything, and driving them from their homes, and expelling them by main force from most of the quarters of the city, our people, as if they were block­ aded and hemmed in by a circle of besieging enemies, being oppressed by a terrible scarcity and want of necessary things, and seeing their wives and their children dying before their eyes by an unnatural famine (for every other place was full of pros­ perity and abundance, as the river had irrigated the corn-lands plentifully with its inundations, and as all the champaign country, which is devoted to the purposes of bearing wheat, was this year supplying a most abundant over-crop of corn with very unusual 'fertility), being no longer able to support their want, some, though they had never been used to do so before, came to the houses of their friends and relations to be,, them to contribute such food as was absolutely necessary as a charity;", "879": "others, who from their high and free-born spirit could not endure the condition of beggars, as being a slavish state unbecoming the dignity of a freeman, came down into the market with no other object than, miserable men that they were, to buy food for their families and for themselves.", "880": "And then, being immediately seized by those who had excited the seditious multitude against them, they were treacherously put to death, and then were dragged along and trampled under foot by the whole city, and completely destroyed, without the least portion of them being left which could possibly receive burial;", "881": "and in this way their enemies, who in their savage madness had become transformed into the nature of wild beasts, slew them and thousands of others with all kinds of agony and tortures, and 'newly invented cruelties, for wherever they met with or caught sight of a Jew, they stoned him, or beat him with sticks, not at once delivering their blows upon mortal parts, lest they should die speedily, and so speedily escape from the sufferings which it was their design to inflict upon them.", "882": "Some persons even, going still greater and greater lengths in the iniquity and license of their barbarity, disdained all blunter weapons, and took up the most efficacious arms of all, fire and iron, and slew many with the sword, and destroyed not a few with flames.", "883": "And the most merciless of all their persecutors in some instances burnt whole families, husbands with their wives, and infant children with their parents, in the middle of the city, sparing neither age nor youth, nor the innocent helplessness of infants.", "884": "And when they had a scarcity of fuel, they collected faggots of green wood, and slew them by the smoke rather than by fire, contriving a still more miserable and protracted death for those unhappy people, so that their bodies lay about promiscuously in every direction half burnt, a grievous and most miserable sight.", "885": "And if some of those who were employed in the collection of sticks were too slow, they took their own furniture, of which they had plundered them, to burn their persons, robbing them of their most costly articles, and burning with them things of the greatest use and value, which they used as fuel instead of ordinary timber.", "886": "Many men too, who were alive, they bound by one foot, fastening them round the ankle, and thus they dragged them along aDd bruised them, leaping on them, designing to inflict the most barbarous of deaths upon them, and then when they were dead they raged no less against them with interminable hostility, and inflicted still heavier insults on their persons, dragging them, I had almost said, through all the alleys and lanes of the city, until the corpse, being lacerated in all its skin, and flesh, and muscles from the inequality and roughness of the ground, all the previously united portions of his composition being torn asunder and separated from one another, was actually torn to pieces.", "887": "And those who did these things, mimicked the sufferers, like people employed in the representation of theatrical farces;", "888": "but the relations and friends of those who were the real victims, merely because they sympathized with the misery of their relations, were led away to prison, were scourged, were tortured, and after all the ill treatment which their living bodies could endure, found the cross the end of all, and the punishment from which they could not escape.X.", "889": "But after Flaccus had broken through every right, and trampled upon every principle of justice, and had left no portion of the Jews free from the extreme severity of his designing malice, in the boundlessness of his wickedness he contrived a monstrous and unprecedented attack upon them, being ever an inventor of new acts of iniquity, for he arrested thirty-eight members of our council of elders, which our saviour and benefactor, Augustus, elected to manage the affairs of the Jewish nation after the death of the king of our own nation, having sent written commands to that effect to Manius Maximus when he was about to take upon himself for the second time the government of Egypt and of the country, he arrested them, I say, in their own houses, and commanded them to be thrown into prison, and arranged a splendid pro­ cession to send through the middle of the market-place a body of old men prisoners, with their hands bound, some with thongs and others with iron chains, whom he led in this plight into the theatre, a most miserable spectacle, and one wholly unsuited to the times.", "890": "And then he commanded them all to stand in front of their enemies, who were sitting down, to make their disgrace the more conspicuous, and ordered them all to be stripped of their clothes and scourged with stripes, in a way that only the most wicked of malefactors are usually treated, and they were flogged with such severity that some of them the moment they were carried out died of their wounds, while others were rendered so ill for a long time that their recovery was despaired of.", "891": "And the enormity of this cruelty is proved by many other circumstances, and it will be further proved most evidently and undeniably by the circumstance which I am about to mention.", "892": "Three of the members of this council of elders, Euodius, and Trypho, and Audio, had been stripped of all their property, being plundered of everything that was in their houses at one onset, and he was well aware that they had been exposed to this treatment, for it had been related to him when he had in the first instance sent for our rulers, under pretence of wishing to promote a reconciliation between them and the rest of the city;", "893": "but nevertheless, though he well knew that they had been deprived of all their property, he scourged them in the very sight of those who had plundered them, that thus they might endure the twofold misery of poverty and personal ill treatment, and that their persecutors might reap the double pleasure of enjoying riches which did in no respect belong to them, and also of feasting their eyes to satiety on the disgrace of those whom they had plundered.", "894": "Now, though I desire to mention a circumstance which took place at that time, I aID in doubt whether to do so or not, lest if it should be looked upon as unimportant, it may appear to take off from the enormity of these great iniquities ;", "895": "but even if it is unimportant in itself, it is nevertheless an indication of no trifling wickedness of disposition.", "896": "There are different kinds of scourges used in the city, distinguished with reference to the deserts or crimes of those who are about to be scourged.", "897": "Accordingly, it is usual for the Egyptians of the country them­ selves to be scourged with a different kind of scourge, and by a different class of executioners, but for the Alexandrians in the city to be scourged with rods by the Alexandrian lictors, and this custom had been preserved, in the case also of our own people, by all the predecessors of Flaccus, and by Flaccus himself in the earlier periods of his government;", "898": "for it is pos­ sible, it really is possible, even in ignominy, to find some slight circumstance of honour, and even in ill treatment to find something which is, to some extent, a relaxation, when any one allows the nature of things to be examined into by itself, and to be confined to its own indispensable require­ ments, without adding from his own ingenuity any additional cruelty or treachery, to separate and take from it all that is mingled with it of a milder character.", "899": "How then can it be looked upon as anything but most infamous, that when Alexandrian Jews, of the lowest rank, had always been previously beaten with the rods, suited to freemen and citizens, if ever they were convicted of having done anything worthy of stripes, yet now the very rulers of the nation, the council of the elders, who derived their very titles from the honour in which they were held and the offices which they filled, should, in this respect, be treated with more indig­ nity than their own servants, like the lowest of the Egyptian rustics, even when found guilty of the very worst of crimes ?", "900": "I omit to mention, that even if they had committed the most countless iniquities, nevertheless the governor ought, out of respect for the season, to have delayed their punishment;", "901": "for with all rulers, who govern any state on constitutional prin­ ciples, and who do not seek to acquire a character for audacity.", "902": "but who do really honour their benefactors, it is the custom to punish no one, even of those who have been lawfully con­ demned, until the famous festival and assembly, in honour of the birth-day of the illustrious emperor, has passed.", "903": "But he committed this violation of the laws at the very season of this festival, and punished men who had done no wrong;", "904": "though certainly, if he ever determined to punish them, he ought to have done so at a subsequent time;", "905": "but he hastened, and would admit of no delay, by reason of his eagerness to please the multitude who was opposed to them, thinking that in this way he should be able, more easily, to gain them over to the objects which he had in view.", "906": "I have known instances before now of men who had been crucified when this festival and holiday was at hand, being taken down and given up to their relations, in order to receive the honours of sepulture, and to enjoy such observances as are due to the dead;", "907": "for it used to be considered, that even the dead ought to derive some enjoyment from the natal festival of a good emperor, and also that the sacred character of the festival ought to be regarded.", "908": "But this man did not order men who had already perished on crosses to be taken down, but he commanded living men to be crucified, men to whom the very time itself gave, if not entire forgiveness, still, at all events, a brief and temporary respite from punishment;", "909": "and he did this after they had been beaten by scourgings in the middle of the theatre;", "910": "and after he had tortured them with fire and sword;", "911": "and the spectacle of their sufferings was divided;", "912": "for the first part of the exhibition lasted from the morning to the third or fourth hour, in which the Jews were scourged, were hung up, were tortured on the wheel, were con­ demned, and were dragged to execution through the middle of the orchestra;", "913": "and after this beautiful exhibition came the dancers, and the buffoons, and the flute-players, and all the other diversions of the theatrical contests.", "914": "XI.", "915": "And why do I dwell on these things?", "916": "for a second mode of barbarity was afterwards devised against us, because the governor wished to excite the whole multitude of the army against us, in accordance with the contrivance of some foreign informer.", "917": "Now the information which was laid against the nation was, that the Jews had entire suits of armour in their houses;", "918": "therefore, having sent for a centurion, in whom he placed the greatest confidence, by name Castor, he ordered him to take with him the boldest soldier of his own band, to go with haste, and, without saying a word to any one, to enter the houses of the Jews, and to search them, and see whether there was any store of arms laid up in them;", "919": "and he ran with great speed to perform the commands which had been given him.", "920": "But they, having no suspicion of his intentions, stood at first speechless with astonishment, their wives and their children clinging to them, and shedding abundance of tears, because of their fear of being carried into captivity, for they were in continual expectation of that, looking upon it as all that was wanting to complete their total misery.", "921": "But when they heard from some of those who were sent to make the search an inquiry as to where they had laid up their arms, they breathed awhile, and opening all their secret recesses displayed everything which they had, being partly delighted and partly grieving;", "922": "delighted at the opportunity of repelling the false accusation which was thus brought against them by its own character, but indignant, in the first place, because calumnies of such a nature, when concocted and urged against them by their enemies, were believed beforehand;", "923": "and, secondly, because their wives, who were shut up, and who did not actually come forth out of their inner chambers, and their virgins, who were kept in the strictest privacy, shunning the eyes of men, even of those who were their nearest relations, out of modesty, were now alarmed by being displayed to the public gaze, not only of persons who were no relations to them, but even of common soldiers.", "924": "Nevertheless, though a most rigorous examination took place, how great a quantity of defensive and offensive armour do you think was found ?", "925": "Helmets, and breast-plates, and shields, and daggers, and javelins, and weapons of every description, were brought out and piled up in heaps ;", "926": "and also how great a variety of missile weapons, javelins, slings, bows, and darts ?", "927": "Absolutely not a single thing of the kind;", "928": "scarcely even knives sufficient for the daily use of the cooks to prepare and dress the food.", "929": "From which circumstance, the simplicity of their daily manner of life was plainly seen:", "930": "as they made no pretence to magnificence or delicate luxury ;", "931": "the nature of which things is to engender satiety, and satiety is apt to engender insolence, which is the beginning of all evils.", "932": "And indeed it was not a long time before that, that the arms had been taken away from the Egyptians throughout the whole country by a man of the name of Bassus, to whom Flaccus had committed this employment.", "933": "But at that time one might have beheld a great fleet of ships sailing down and anchor­ ing in the harbours afforded by the mouths of the river, full of arms of every possible description, and numerous beasts of burden loaded with bags made of skins sewn together and hanging like panniers on each side so as to balance better, and also almost all the waggons belonging to the camp filled with weapons of every sort, whicn were brought in rows so as to be all seen at once, and arranged together in order.", "934": "And the distance between the harbour and the armoury in.", "935": "the king's palace in which the arms were commanded to be deposited was about ten stadia;", "936": "it was then very proper to investigate the houses of the men who had amassed such quantities of arms;", "937": "for as they had often actually revolted, they were naturally liable to be suspected of designing revolutionary measures, and it was quite fitting that, in imitation of the sacred games, those who had superintended the collection of the arms should keep a new triennial festival in Egypt, in order that they might not again be collected without any one being aware of it, or else that at all events only a few might be collected instead of a great number, from the people not having time enough to assemble any great number.", "938": "But why were we to be exposed to any treatment of the sort ?", "939": "For when were we ever suspected of any tendency to revolt ?", "940": "And when did we bear any other than a most peaceful charac­ ter among all men ?", "941": "And the habits in which we daily and habitually indulge, are they not irreproachable, tending to the lawful tranquillity and stability of the state ?", "942": "In fact, if the Jews had had arms in their houses, would they have submitted to be stripped of above four hundred dwellings, out of which they were turned and forcibly expelled by those who plundered them of all their properties ?", "943": "Why then was not this search made in the houses of those people who had arms, if not of their own private property, at all events such as they had car­ ried off from others ?", "944": "The truth is, as I have said already, the whole business was a deliberate contrivance designed by the cruelty ofFlaccus and of the multitude, in which even women were included;", "945": "for they were dragged away as captives, not only in the market- place, but even in the middle of the theatre, and dragged upon the stage on any false accusation that might be brought against them with the most painful and intolerable insults;", "946": "and then, when it was found that they were of another race, they were dismissed;", "947": "for they apprehended many women as Jewesses who were not so, from want of making any careful or accurate investigation.", "948": "And if they appeared to belong to our nation, then those who, instead of spectators, became tyrants and mas­ ters, laid cruel commands on them, bringing them swine's flesh, and enjoining them to eat it Accordingly, all who were wrought on by fear of punishment to eat it were released without suffering any ill treatment;", "949": "but those who were more obstinate were given up to the tormentors to suffer intole­ rable tortures, which is the clearest of all possible proofs that they had committed no offence whatever beyond what I have mentioned.", "950": "XII.", "951": "But it was not out of his own head alone, but also because of the commands and in consequence of the situation of the emperor that he sought and devised means to injure and oppress us;", "952": "for after we had decreed by our votes and carried out by our actions all the honours to the emperor Caius, which were either within our power or allowable by our laws, we brought the decree to him, entreating him that, as it was not permitted to us to send an embassy ourselves to bear it to the emperor, he would vouchsafe to forward it himself.", "953": "And, after he had read all the articles contained in the decree, and having often nodded his head in token of his approbation of them, smiling, and being very much delighted, or else pretending to be pleased, he said:", "954": "\" I approve of you very greatly in all things, for your piety and loyalty, and I will forward it as you request, or else I myself will act the part of your ambassador, that Caius may be aware of your gratitude.", "955": "And I myself will bear witness in your favour to all that I know of the orderly disposition and obedient character of your nation, with­ out exaggerating anything ;", "956": "for truth is the most sufficient of all panegyrics.", "957": "\"At these promises we were greatly delighted, and we gave him thanks, hoping that the decree would be thoroughly read and appreciated by Caius.", "958": "And indeed it was natural enough, since all the things that are promptly and carefully sent by the lieutenant-governors are read and examined without delay by you;", "959": "but Flaccus, wholly neglecting all our hopes, and all his own words, and all his own promises, retained the decree, in order that you, above all the men under the sun, might be looked upon as enemies to the emperor.", "960": "Was not this the conduct of one who had been vigilant afar off, and who had long been contriving his design against us, and who was not now yielding to some momentary impulse, and attacking us on a sudden without any previous contrivance with unreasonable impetuosity, being led away by some fresh motive?", "961": "But God, as it seems, he who has a care for all human affairs, scattered his flattering speeches cunningly devised to mislead the emperor, and baffled the counsels of his lawless disposition and the manoeuvres which he was em­ ploying, taking pity on us, and very soon he brought matters into such a train that Flaccus was disappointed of his hopes.", "962": "For when Agrippa, the king, came into the country, we set before him all the designs which Flaccus had entertained against us;", "963": "and he set himself to rectify the business, and, having promised to forward the decree to the emperor, he taking it, as we hear, did send it, accompanied with a defence relating to the time at which it was passed, showing that it was not lately only that we had learnt to venerate the family of our benefactors, but that we had from the very first beginning shown our zeal towards them, though we had been deprived of the opportunity of making any seasonable demonstration of it by the insolence of our governor.", "964": "And after these events justice, the constant champion and ally of those who are injured, and the punisher of everything impious, whether it be action or man, began to labour to work his overthrow.", "965": "For at first they endured the most unexampled insults and miseries, such as had never happened under any other of our governors, ever since the house of Augustus first acquired the dominion over earth and sea;", "966": "for some men of those who, in the time of Tiberius, and of Cæsar his father, had the government, seeking to convert their governorship and viceroyalty into a sovereignty and tyranny, filled all the country with intolerable evils, with corruption, and rapine, and condemnation of persons who had done no wrong, and with banishment and exile of such innocent men, and with the slaughter of the nobles without a trial;", "967": "and then, after the appointed period of their government had expired, when they returned to Rome, the emperors exacted of them an accpunt and relation of all that they had done, especially if by chance the cities which they had been oppressing sent any embassy to complain ;", "968": "for then the emperors, behaving like impartial judges, listening both to the accusers and to the defendant on equal terms, not thinking it right to fire-judge and pre-condemn anyone before his trial, decided without being influenced either by enmity or favour, but according to the nature of truth, and pronouncing such a judgment as seemed to be just.", "969": "But in the case of Flaccus, that justice which hates iniquity did not wait till the term of his government had expired, but went forward to meet him before the usual time, being indignant at the immoderate extravagance of his lawless iniquity.", "970": "XIII.", "971": "And the manner in which lie was cut short in his tyranny was as follows.", "972": "He imagined that Caius was already made favourable to him in respect of those matters, about which suspicion was sought to be raised against him, partly by his letters which were full of flattery, and partly by the harangues which he was continually addressing to the people, in which he courted the emperor by stringing together flattering sentences and long series of cunningly imagined panegyrics, and partly too because he was very highly thought of by the greater part of the city.", "973": "But he was deceiving himself without knowing it;", "974": "for the hopes of wicked men are unstable, as they guess what is more favourable to them while they suffer what is quite contrary to it, as in fact they deserve.", "975": "JFor Bassus, the centurion, was sent from Italy by the appointment of Caius with the company of soldiers which lie commanded.", "976": "And having embarked on board one of the fastest sailing vessels, he arrived in a few days at the harbour of Alexandria, off the island of Pharos, about evening;", "977": "and he ordered the captain of the ship to keep out in the open sea till sunset, intending to enter the city unexpectedly, in order that Flaccus might not be aware of his coming beforehand, and so be led to adopt any violent measures, and render the service which he was commanded to perform fruitless.", "978": "And when the evening came, the ship entered the harbour, and Bassus, disembarking with his own soldiers, advanced, neither recognizing nor being recognized by any one ;", "979": "and on his road finding a soldier who was one of the quaternions of the guard, he ordered him to show him the house of his captain;", "980": "for he wished to communicate his secret errand to him, that, if he required additional force, he might have an assistant ready.", "981": "And when he heard that he was supping at some person's house in company with Flaccus, he did not relax in his speed, but hastened onward to the dwelling of his entertainer;", "982": "for the man with whom they were feasting was Stephanion, one of the freedmen of Tiberius Csesar;", "983": "and withdrawing to a short distance, he sends forward one of his own followers to recon­ noitre, disguising him like a servant in order that no one might notice him or perceive what was going forward.", "984": "So he, entering in to the banqueting-room, as if he were the servant of one of the guests, examined everything accurately, and then returned and gave information to Bassus.", "985": "And he, when he had learnt the unguarded condition of the entrances, and the small number of the people who were with Flaccus (for he was attended by not more than ten or fifteen slaves to wait upon him), gave the signal to his soldiers whom he had with him, and hastened forward, and entered suddenly into the supper­ room, he and the soldiers with him, who stood by with their swords girded on, and surrounded Flaccus before he was aware of it, for at the moment of their entrance he was drinking health with some one, and making merry with those who were present.", "986": "But when Bassus had made his way into the midst, the moment that he saw him he became dumb with amazement and consternation, and wishing to rise up he saw the guards all round him, and then he perceived his fate, even before he heard what Caius wanted with him, and what commands had been given to those who had come, and what he was about to endure, for the mind of man is very prompt at perceiving at once all those particulars which take a long time to happen, and at hearing them all together.", "987": "Accordingly, every one of those who were of this supper party rose up, being through fear unnerved, and shuddering lest some punishment might be affixed to the mere fact of having been supping with the culprit, for it was not safe to flee, nor indeed was it possible to do so, since all the entrances were already occupied.", "988": "So Flaccus was led away by the soldiers at the command of Bassus, this being the manner in which he returned from the banquet, for it was fitting that justice should begin to visit him at a feast, because he had deprived the houses of innumerable innocent men of all festivity.", "989": "XIV.", "990": "This was the unexampled misfortune which befell Flaccus in the country of which he was governor, being taken prisoner like an enemy on account of the Jews, as it appears to me, whom he had determined to destroy utterly in his desire for glory.", "991": "And a manifest proof of this is to be found in the time of his arrest, for it was the general festival of the Jews at the time of the autumnal equinox, during which it is the custom of the Jews to live in tents ;", "992": "but none of the usual customs at this festival were carried out at all, since all the rulers of the people were still oppressed by irremediable and intolerable injuries and insults, and since the common people looked upon the miseries of their chiefs as the common calamity of the whole nation, and were also depressed beyond measure at the individual afflictions to which they were each of them sepa­ rately exposed, for griefs are redoubled when they happen at the times of festival, when those who are afflicted are unable to keep the feast, both by reason of the deprivation of their mirthful cheerfulness, which a general assembly requires, and also from the presence of sorrow by which they were now over­ come, without being able to find any remedy for such terrible disasters.", "993": "And while they were yielding to excessive sorrow, and feel­ ing overwhelmed by most severe anguish, and they were all collected in their houses at the approach of night, some persons came in to inform them of the apprehension of the governor which had then taken place.", "994": "And they thought that this was to try them, and was not the truth, and were grieved all the more from thinking themselves mobbed, and that a snare was thus laid for them;", "995": "but when a tumult arose through the city, and the guards of the night began to run about to and fro, and when some of the cavalry were heard to be galloping with the utmost speed and with all energy to the camp and from the camp, some of them, being excited by the strangeness of the event, went forth from their houses to inquire what had happened, for it was plain that something strange had occurred.", "996": "And when they heard of the arrest that had taken place, and that Flaccus was now within the toils, stretching up their hands to heaven, they sang a hymn, and began a song of praise to God, who presides over all the affairs of men, saying, \" We are not delighted, 0 Master, at the punishment of our enemy, being taught by the sacred laws to submit to all the vicissi­ tudes of human life, but we justly give thanks to thee, who hast had mercy and compassion upon us, and who hast thus relieved our continual and incessant oppressions.", "997": "\"And when they had spent the whole night in hymns and songs, they poured out through the gates at the earliest dawn, and hastened to the nearest point of the shore, for they had been deprived of their usual places for prayer, and standing in a clear and open space, they cried out, \" 0 most mighty King of all mortal and immortal beings, we have come to offer thanks unto thee, to invoke earth and sea, and the air and the heaven, and all the parts of the universe, and the whole world in which alone we dwell, being driven out by men and robbed of every­ thing else in the world, and being deprived of our city,and of all the buildings both private and public within the city, and being made houseless and homeless by the treachery of our governor, the only men in the world who are so treated.", "998": "You suggest to us favourable hopes of the setting straight of what is left to us, beginning to consent to our prayers, inasmuch as you have on a sudden thrown down the common enemy of our nation, the author and cause of all our calamities, exulting in pride, and trusting that he would gain credit by such means, before he was removed to a distance from us, in order that those who were evilly afflicted might not feel their joy impaired by learning it only by report, but you have chastised him while lie was so near, almost as we may say before the eyes of those whom he oppressed, in order to give us a more distinct per­ ception of the end which has fallen upon him in a short time beyond our hopes.\"XV.", "999": "And besides what I have spoken of there is also a third thing, which appears to me to have taken place by the interposition of divine providence;", "1000": "for after he had set sail at the beginning of winter, for it was rightly ordained that he should have his fill of the dangers of the sea, inasmuch as he had filled all the elements of the universe with his impieties, after suffering innumerable hardships he with difficulty got safely to Italy, and the moment that he had arrived there he was pursued by accusations which were brought against him, and which were brought before two of his greatest enemies, Isidorus and Lampo, who a little while before were in the position of subjects to him, calling him their master, and bene­ factor, and saviour, and names of that sort, but who now were his adversaries, and that too displaying a power not only equal to but far superior to his own, not merely from the confidence which men feel in the justice of their cause, but, what was a matter of great moment, because they saw that the Judge of all human affairs was his irreconcileable enemy, being about now to take upon himself the form of a judge from a prudent determination not to appear to condemn any one beforehand unheard, and not to act the part of an enemy, who before hearing either accusation or defence, has already condemned the defendant in his mind, and has sentenced him to the most severe punishments.", "1001": "But nothing is so terrible as for men who have been the more powerful to be accused by their inferiors, and for those who have been rulers to be impeached by their former subjects, which is as if masters were being prosecuted by their natural or purchased slaves.", "1002": "XVI.", "1003": "And yet even this in my opinion was a lighter evil when compared with another which was greater still;", "1004": "for it was not people who were merely in the simple rank of subjects who now, discarding that position and conspiring together, on a sudden attacked him with their accusations;", "1005": "but those who did so were men who during the chief part of the time that he had had the government of the courtry had been in a position of the greatest enmity and hatred to him, Lampo having been under a prosecution for impiety against Tiberius Cæsar, and having been almost worn out by the matter which had been thus impending over his head for two years;", "1006": "for the judge who had a grudge against him caused all sorts of delays and every possible protraction of the cause on various pretexts, wishing even if he escaped from the accusation, at all events to keep the terror of the future as uncertain hanging over his head for the longest possible period, so as to make his life more miserable even than death.", "1007": "And then again when he seemed to have come off victorious, saying that he was insulted and injured in his property (for he was compelled to become a gymnasiarch), either by being economical and illiberal in his expenses, pretending that he had not sufficient wealth for such unlimited expenditure, or perhaps really not having enough;", "1008": "but before he came to the trial, making a parade of being very rich, but when he did come to the proof then appearing not to be a man of exceeding wealth, having acquired nearly all the riches which he had by unjust actions.", "1009": "For standing by the rulers when they gave judgment, he took notes of all that took place on the trial as if he were a clerk;", "1010": "and then he designedly passed over or omitted such and such points, and interpolated other things which were not said.", "1011": "And at times, too, he made alterations, changing and altering.", "1012": "and perverting matters, and turning things up-side down, aim­ ing to get money by every syllable, or, I might rather say, by every letter, like a hunter after musty records, whom the whole people with one accord did often with great felicity and pro­ priety of expression call a pen-murderer, as slaying numbers of persons by the things which he wrote, and rendering the living more miserable than even the dead, as, though they might have got the victory and been in comfort, they were subjected to miserable defeat and poverty, their enemies having bought victory, and triumph, and wealth, of a man who sold and made his market of the properties of others.", "1013": "For it was impossible for rulers who had the charge of so vast a country entrusted to them, when affairs of every sort, both private and public, were coming in upon them fresh every day, to remember everything which they had heard, especially as they had not only to fill the part of judges, but also to take accounts of all the revenues and taxes, the investigation into which occupied the greater portion of the year.", "1014": "And the man to whom it was entrusted to take charge of that most im­ portant of all deposits, namely, justice, and of those most holy sentiments which had been delivered and urged before them, caused forgetfulness to the judges, registering those who ought to have had sentence in their favour as defeated, and those who ought to have been defeated as victorious, after the receipt of his accursed pay, or, to speak more properly, wages of iniquity.", "1015": "XVII.", "1016": "Such, then, was the character of Lampo, who was now one of the accusers of Flaccus.", "1017": "And Isidorus was in no respect inferior to him in wicked­ ness, being a man of the populace, a low demagogue, one who had continually studied to throw everything into disorder and confusion, an enemy to all peace and stability, very clever at exciting seditions and tumults which had no existence before, and at inflaming and exaggerating such as were already ex­ cited, taking care always to keep about him a disorderly and promiscuous mob of all the refuse of the people, ready for every kind of atrocity, which he had divided into regular sections as so many companies of soldiers.", "1018": "There are a vast number of parties in the city whose associ­ ation is founded in no one good principle, but who are united by wine, and drunkenness, and revelry, and the offspring of those indulgencies, insolence;", "1019": "and their meetings are called synods and couches by the natives.", "1020": "In all these parties or the greater number of them Isidorus is said to have borne the bell, the leader of the feast, the chief of the supper, the dis­ turber of the city.", "1021": "Then, whenever it was determined to do some mischief, at one signal they all went forth in a body, and did and said whatever they were told.", "1022": "And on one occasion, being indignant with Flaccus because, after he had appeared originally to be a person of some weight with him, he after­ wards was no longer courted in an equal degree, having hired a gang of fellows from the training schools and men accustomed to vociferate loudly, who sell their outcries as if in regular market to those who are inclined to buy them, he ordered them all to assemble at the gymnasium ;", "1023": "and they, having filled it, began to heap accusations on Flaccus without any particular grounds, inventing all kinds of monstrous accu­ sations and all sorts of falsehoods in ridiculous language, stringing long sentences together, so that not only was Flaccus himself alarmed but all the others who were there at this un­ expected attack, and especially, as it may be conjectured, from the idea that there must certainly have been some one behind the scenes whom they were studying to gratify, since they themselves had suffered no evil, and since they were well aware that the rest of the city had not been ill-treated by him.", "1024": "Then, after they had deliberated awhile, they determined to apprehend certain persons of them and to inquire into the cause of this indiscriminate and sudden rage and madness.", "1025": "And the men who were arrested, without being put to the tor­ ture, confessed the truth and added proofs to their words by what had been done, detailing the pay which had been agreed to be given to them, both that which had been already given and that which, in accordance with his promises, was subse­ quently to be paid, and the men who were appointed to distribute it as the leaders of the sedition, and the place where it was to break out, and the time when the giving of the bribes was to take place.", "1026": "And when every one, as was very natural, was indignant at this, and when the city was mightily offended, that the folly of some individuals should attach to it so as to dim its reputa­ tion, Flaccus determined to send for some of the most honour­ able men of the people, and, on the next day to bring forward before them those who had distributed the bribes, that he might investigate the truth about Isidorus, and also that he might make a defence of his own system of government, and prove that he had been unjustly calumniated ;", "1027": "and when they heard the proclamation there came not only the magistrates but also the whole city, except that portion which was about to be convicted of having been the agents of corruption or the corrupted.", "1028": "And they who had been employed in this honourable service, being raised up on the platform, that they might be elevated and conspicuous and be recognised by all men, accused Isidorus as having been the cause of all the tumults and of the accusations which had been brought against Flaccus, and as having given money and bribes to no small number of them by himself.", "1029": "\" Since else,\" said they, \" where could we have got such great abundance ?", "1030": "We are poor men, and are scarcely able to provide our daily expenses for absolute necessaries;", "1031": "and what evil did we ever suffer from the governor, so as to be forced to bear him ill will?", "1032": "Nay, but it is he who was the cause of all these things, the author of them all, he who is always envious of those who are in prosperity, -and an adver­ sary of all stability and wholesome law.", "1033": "\"And when those who were present came to the knowledge of these things, for what was thus said was a very evident proof and evidence of the intentions of the person accused, they all raised an outcry, some calling out that he should be degraded, others that he should be banished, others that he should be put to death, and these last were the most nu­ merous ;", "1034": "and the others changed their tone and joined them, so that at last they all cried out, with one accord and with one voice, to slay the common pest of the laud, the man to whom it was owing that, ever since he had arrived in the country and taken any part in public affairs, no part of the city or of the common interests had ever been left in a sound or healthy condition;", "1035": "and he, indeed, being convicted by his conscience, fled away in-doors, fearing lest he should be seized;", "1036": "but Flaccus did nothing against him, thinking that now that he had voluntarily removed himself, everything in the city would soon be free from sedition and contention.", "1037": "XVIII.", "1038": "I have related these events at some length, not for the sake of keeping old injuries in remembrance, but because I admire that power who presides over all freemen's affairs, namely, justice, seeing that those men who were so generally hostile to Flaccus, those by whom of all men he was most hated, were the men who now brought their accusations against him, to fill up the measure of his grief, for it is not so bitter merely to be accused as to be accused by one's confessed enemies;", "1039": "but this mail was not merely accused, though a go­ vernor, by his subjects, and that by men who had always been his enemies, when he had only a short time before been the lord of the life of every individual among them, but he was also apprehended by force, being thus subjected to a. twofold evil, namely, to be defeated and ridiculed by exulting enemies, which is worse than death to all right-minded and sensible people.", "1040": "And then see what an abundance of disasters came upon him, for he was immediately stripped of all his possessions, both of those which he inherited from his parents and of all that he had acquired himself, having been a man who took especial delight in luxury and ornament;", "1041": "for he was not like some rich men, to whom wealth is an inactive material, but he was continually acquiring things of every useful kind in all imaginable abundance;", "1042": "cups, garments, couches, minia­ tures, and everything else which was any ornament to a house;", "1043": "and besides that, he collected a vast number of servants, care­ fully selected for their excellencies and accomplishments, and with reference to their beauty, and health, and vigour of body, and to their unerring skill in all kinds of necessary and use­ ful service;", "1044": "for every one of them was excellent in that employ­ ment to which he was appointed, so that he was looked upon as either the most excellent of all servants in that place, or, at all events, as inferior to no one.", "1045": "And there is a very clear proof of this in the fact that, though there were a vast number of properties confiscated and sold for the public benefit, which belonged to persons who had been condemned, that of Flaccus alone was assigned to the emperor, with perhaps one or two more, in order that the law which had been established with respect to persons convicted of such crimes as his might not be violated.", "1046": "And after he had been deprived of all his property, he was condemned to banishment, and was exiled from the whole continent, and that is the greatest and most excellent portion of the inhabited world, and from every island that has any character for fertility or richness;", "1047": "for he was commanded to be sent into that most miserable of all the islands in the Ægæan Sea,* called Gyara, and he would have been left there if he had not availed himself of the intercession of Lepidus, by whose means he obtained leave to exchange Gyara for Andros, which was very near it.", "1048": "Then he was sent back again on the road from Rome to Brundusium, a journey which he had taken a few years before, at the time when he was appointed governor of Egypt and the adjacent country of Lybia, in order that the cities which had then seen him exulting and behaving with great insolence in the hour of his prosperity, might now again behold him full of dishonour.", "1049": "And thus he being now become a conspicuous mark by reason of this total change of fortune, was overwhelmed with more bitter grief, his calamities being constantly re-kindled and inflamed by the addition of fresh miseries, which, like relapses in sickness, compel the recol­ lection of all former disasters to return, which up to that time appeared to be buried in obscurity.", "1050": "'XIX.", "1051": "And after he bad crossed the Ionian Gulf he sailed up the sea which leads to Corinth, being a spectacle to all the cities in Peloponnesus which lie on the coast, when they heard of his sudden reverse of fortune;", "1052": "for when he disembarked from the vessel all the evil disposed men who bore him ill will ran up to see him, and others also came to sympathize with him—men who are accustomed to learn moderation from the misfortunes of others.", "1053": "And at Lechæum, crossing over the isthmus into the opposite gulf, and having arrived at Cenchreæ, the dockyard of the Corinthians, he was compelled by the guards, who would not permit him the slightest respite, to embark immediately on board a small transport and to set sail, and as a foul wind was blowing with great violence, after great sufferings he with difficulty arrived safe at the Piræus.", "1054": "And when the storm had ceased, having coasted along Attica as far as the promontory of Sunium,* he passed by all the islands in order, namely, Helena, and Ceanus, and Cythnos, and all the rest which lie in a regular row one after another, until at last he came to the point of his ultimate destination, the island of Andros, which the miserable man beholding afar off poured forth abundance of tears down his cheeks, as if from a regular fountain, and beating his breast, and lamenting most bitterly, he said, \" Men, ye who are my guards and attendants in this my journey, I now -eceive in exchange for the glorious Italy this beautiful country of Andros, which is an unfortunate island for me.", "1055": "I, Flaccus, who was born, and brought up, and educated in Rome, the heaven of the world, and who have been the schoolfellow and companion of the granddaughters of Augustus, and who was afterwards selected by Tiberius Cæsar as one of his most intimate friends, and who have had entrusted to me for six years the greatest of all his possessions, namely, Egypt.", "1056": "What a change is this !", "1057": "In the middle of the day, as if an eclipse had come upon me, night has overshadowed my life.", "1058": "What shall I say of this little islet ?", "1059": "Shall I call it my place of banishment, or my new country, or harbour and refuge of misery ?", "1060": "A tomb would be the most proper name for it;", "1061": "for I, miserable that I am, am now in a manner conducted to my grave, attending my own funeral, for either I shall destroy my miserable life through my sorrow, or if I am able to cling to life among my miseries, I shall in that case find a distant death, which will be felt all the time of my life.", "1062": "\"These, then, were the lamentations which he poured forth, and when the vessel came near the harbour he landed, stoop­ ing down to the very ground like men heavily oppressed, being weighed down by his calamities as if the heaviest of burdens was placed upon his neck, without being able to look up, or else not daring to do so because of the people whom be might meet, and of those who came out to see him and who stood on each side of the road.", "1063": "And those men who had conducted him hither, bringing the populace of the Andrians, exhibited him to them all, making them all witnesses of the arrival of the exile in their island.", "1064": "And they, when they had discharged their office, departed;", "1065": "and then the misery of Flaccus was renewed, as he no longer beheld any sight to which he was accustomed, but only saw sad misery presented to him by the most conspicuous evidence, while he looked around upon what to him was perfect desola­ tion, in the middle of which he was placed ;", "1066": "so that it seemed to him that a violent execution in his native land would have been a lighter evil, or rather, by comparison with his present circumstances, a most desirable good;", "1067": "and he gave himself up to such violence of grief, that he was in no respect different from a maniae, and leaped about, and ran to and fro, and clapped his hands, and smote his thighs, and threw him­ self upon the ground, and kept continually crying out, “ I am Flaccus !", "1068": "who but a little while ago was the governor of the mighty city, of the populous city of Alexandria!", "1069": "the governor of that most fertile of all countries, Egypt!", "1070": "I am he on whom all those myriads of inhabitants

subjects !", "1072": "I am he who was every day accompanied when I went out by countless com­ panies of clients!", "1073": "But now, was not all this a vision rather than reality ?", "1074": "and was I asleep, and was this prosperity which I then beheld a dream-phantoms marching through empty space, fictions of the soul, which perhaps registered non- existent things as though they had a being?", "1075": "Doubtless, I have been deceived.", "1076": "These things were but a shadow and no real things, imitations of reality and not a real truth, which makes falsehood evident;", "1077": "for as after we have awakened we find none of those things which appeared to us in our dreams, but all such things have fled in a body and disappeared, so too, all that brilliant prosperity which I formerly enjoyed has now been extinguished in the briefest moment of time.\"XX.", "1078": "With such discourses as these, he was continually being cast down, and in a manner, as I may say, prostrated;", "1079": "and avoiding all places where he might be likely to meet with many persons on account of the shame which clung to him, he never went down to the harbour, nor could he endure to visit the market-place, but shut himself up in his house, where he kept himself close, never venturing to go beyond the outer court.", "1080": "But sometimes indeed, in the deepest twilight of the dawn, when every one else was still in bed, so that he could be seen by no one whatever, he would go forth out of the city and spend the entire day in the desolate part of the island, turning away if any one seemed likely to meet him;", "1081": "and being torn as to his soul with the memorials of his misfortunes which he saw about him in his house, and being devoured with anguish, he went back home in the darkness of the night, praying, by reason of his immoderate and never-ending misery, that the evening would become morning, dreading the darkness and the strange appearances which represented themselves to him when he went to sleep, and again in the morning he prayed that it might be evening;", "1082": "* for the darkness which surrounded him was opposed to everything light or cheerful.", "1083": "And a few months afterwards, having purchased a small piece of land, he spent a great deal of his time there living by himself, and bewailing and weeping over his fate.", "1084": "It is said too, that often at midnight he became possessed like those who celebrate the rites of the Corybantes, and at such times he would go forth out of his farm-house and raise his eyes to heaven and to the stars, and beholding all the beauty really existing in the world, he would cry out, \" 0 King of gods and men !", "1085": "you are not, then, indifferent to the Jewish nation, nor are the assertions

I am an evident proof of this;", "1088": "for all the frantic designs which I conceived against the Jews, I now suffer myself.", "1089": "I consented when they were stripped of their possessions,

into the theatre, and commanded them to be shamelessly and unjustly insulted in the sight of their greatest enemies;", "1094": "and therefore I justly have been myself led not into a theatre or into one city, but into many cities, to endure the utmost extremity of insult, being ill-treated in my miserable soul instead of my body;", "1095": "for I was led in procession through the whole of Italy as far as Brundusium, and through all Peloponnesus as far as Corinth, and through Attica, and all the islands as far as Andros, which is this prison of mine;", "1096": "and I am thoroughly as­ sured that even this is not the limit of my misfortunes, but that others are still in store for me, to fill up the measure as a requital for all the evils which I have done.", "1097": "I put many persons to

of his destiny, and his uninterrupted sorrow agitated, and disturbed, and over­ turned his soul.", "1113": "But Caius, being a man of an inhuman nature and insatiable in his revenge, did not, as some persons do, let go those who had been once punished, but raged against them without end, and was continually contriving some new and terrible suffering for them;", "1114": "and, above all men, he hated Flaccus to such a degree, that he suspected all who bore the same name, from his detestation of the very appellation ;", "1115": "and he often repented that he had condemned him to banishment and not to death, and though he had a great respect for Lepidus who had interceded for him, he blamed him, so that he was kept in a state of great alarm from fear of punishment impending over him, for he feared lest, as was very likely, he, because he had been the cause of another person having been visited by a lighter punishment, might himself have a more severe one inflicted upon him.", "1116": "Therefore, as no one any longer ventured to say a word by way of deprecating the anger of the emperor, he gave loose to his fury, which was now implacable and unrestrained, and which, though it ought to have been mitigated by time, was rather increased by it, just as recurring diseases are in the body when a relapse takes place, for all such relapses are more grievous than the original attacks.", "1117": "They say that on one occasion Caius, being awake at night, began to turn his mind to the magistrates and officers who were in banishment, and who in name indeed were looked upon as unfortunate, but who in reality had now thus acquired a life free from trouble, and truly tranquil and free.", "1118": "And he gave a new name to this banishment, calling it an emigration, \" For,\" said he, \" it is only a kind of emigration the banishment of these men, inasmuch as they have all the necessaries of life in abundance, and are able to live in tran­ quillity, and stability, and peace.", "1119": "But it is an absurdity for them to be living in luxury, enjoying peace, and indulging in all the pleasures of a philosophical life.", "1120": "\"Then he commanded the most eminent of these men, and those who were of the highest rank and reputation, to be put to death, giving a regular list of their names, at the head of which list was Flaccus.", "1121": "And when the men arrived at Andros, who had been commanded to put him to death, Flaccus happened, just at that moment, to be coming from his farm into the city, and they, on their way up from the port, met him, and while yet at a distance they perceived and recognised one another;", "1122": "at which he, perceiving in a moment the object for which they were come (for every man's soul is very prophetic, especially of such as are in misfortune), turn­ ing out of the road, fled and ran away over the rough ground, forgetting, perhaps, that Andros was an island and not the con­ tinent.", "1123": "And what is the use of speed in an island which the sea washes all round ?", "1124": "for one of two things must of necessity happen, either that if the fugitive advances further he must be carried into the sea, or else arrested when he has reached the farthest boundary.", "1125": "Therefore, in a comparison of evils, destruc­ t'on by land must be preferable to destruction by sea, since nature has made the land more closely akin to man, and to all terrestrial animals, not only while they are alive, but even after they are dead, in order that the same element may receive both their primary generation and their last dis­ solution.", "1126": "The officers therefore pursued him without stopping to take breath and arrested him ;", "1127": "and then immediately some of them dug a ditch, and the others dragged him on by force in spite of all his resistance and crying out and struggling, by which means his whole body was wounded like that of beasts that are despatched with a number of wounds;", "1128": "for he, turning round them and clinging to his executioners, who were hin­ dered in their aims which they took at him with their swords, and who thus struck him with oblique blows, was the cause of his own sufferings being more severe;", "1129": "for he was in conse­ quence mutilated and cut about the hands, and feet, and head, and breast, and sides, so that he was mangled like a victim, and thus he fell, justice righteously inflicting on his own body wounds equal in number to the murders of the Jews whom he had unlawfully put to death.", "1130": "And the whole place flowed with blood which was shed from his numerous veins, which were cut in every part of his body, and which poured forth blood as from a fountain.", "1131": "And when the corpse was dragged into the trench which had been dug, the greater part of the limbs separated from the body, the sinews by which the whole of the body is kept together being all cut through.", "1132": "Such was the end of Flaccus, who suffered thus, being made the most manifest evidence that the nation of the Jews is not left destitute of the providential assistance of God.I.", "1133": "How long shall we, who are aged men, still be like children, being indeed as to our bodies gray-headed through the length of time that we have lived, but as to our souls utterly infantine through our want of sense and sensibility, looking upon that which is the most unstable of all things, namely, fortune, as most invariable, and that which is of all things in the world the most steadfast, namely, nature, as utterly un­ trustworthy ?", "1134": "For, like people playing at draughts, we make changes, altering the position of actions, and considering the things which are the result of fortune as more durable than those which result from nature, and the things which proceed in accordance with nature as less stable than those which are the result of chance.", "1135": "And the reason of all this is, that we form our judgment of present events without paying any prudential attention to the future, being influenced by the erroneous guidance of our outward senses instead of the secret operations of the intellect;", "1136": "for the things which are openly conspicuous and before our hands so as to be taken up by them, are com­ prehended by our eyes, but our reasoning power outstrips them, hastening onwards to what is invisible and future ;", "1137": "but never­ theless, we obscure the vision of our reason, though it is far more acute than those bodily powers of sight which are exercised by the eyes, some of us confusing it by indulgence in wine and satiety, and others by that greatest of all evils, namely, ignorance.", "1138": "Nevertheless, the existing opportunity and the many and important propositions which arise to be decided on

its supplications to him, which belongs especially to the father and sovereign of the universe, and the great cause of all things ;", "1139": "and these propositions are sufficient to persuade them of this truth.", "1140": "*And this nation of suppliants is in the Chaldaic language called Israel, but when the name is translated into the Greek language it is called, “ the seeing nation which

who behold them to reverence and orderly conduct, and to an admiration of and desire for a life of moderation and temperance, how great a bulwark of virtue and excellence must we not expect to find in those souls which, after having investigated the nature of every created thing, have learnt to contemplate the uncreated and Divine Being, the first good of all, the one beautiful, and happy, and glorious, and blessed being ;", "1142": "better, if one is to tell the plain truth, than the good itself;", "1143": "more beautiful than the beautiful itself;", "1144": "more happy than happiness

cannot make such advances as to attain to a thorough comprehension of God, who can neither be touched nor handled ;", "1148": "but it withdraws from and falls short of such a height, being unable to employ appropriate language as a step towards the manifestation (I will not say of the living God, for even if the whole heaven were to become endowed with articulate voice, it would not be furnished

beneficent powers, not only because such a display is a portion of his laws and ordi­ nances (for law is made up of two things, the honour of the good, and the chastisement of the wicked), but also because punishment reproves, and very often even corrects, and ame­ liorates those who have done wrong;", "1151": "and if it fails to do so with respect to them, at all events it does so to those who

their souls, their peace, their hopes, their parti­ cipation in and enjoyment of all good things ;", "1177": "for men began to remember how numerous and how great are the evils which spring from

inalienable happiness and prosperity, both separately to each individual and generally to the whole state-began, as the proverb has it, at home, and changed into a ferocity of disposition, or, I should rather say, displayed the savageness which he had previously overshadowed by pretence and hypocrisy;", "1184": "for he put to death his cousin who had been left as the partner of his kingdom, and who was in fact a more natural successor to it than he himself;", "1185": "for he himself was only Tiber rius's grandson by adoption, but the other was so by blood J arguing as a pretext that he had detected him in plotting against him, though his very age was a sufficient refutation of any such accusation;", "1186": "for the unhappy victim was only just emerging from boyhood, and beginning to rank among the youths.", "1187": "And, as some persons say, if Tiberius had lived a short time longer, Caius would have been made away with, as he began to be looked upon by him with unalterable suspicion, and the genuine grandson of Tiberius would have been named the future emperor, and the inheritor of his paternal kingdom.", "1188": "But Tiberius was carried off by fate, before he could bring his designs to their completion;", "1189": "and Caius thought that he should be able to escape all evil report which might arise from his transgressing the principles of justice with respect to his partner by outwitting him.", "1190": "And the contrivance which he adopted was of the following character.", "1191": "Having assembled all the chief magistrates, he said :", "1192": "\"I am desirous that he who is my cousin by birth and my brother in affection, in accord­ ance with the instruction of Tiberius who is now dead, shall be a partner with me in my absolute authority.", "1193": "But you your­ selves perceive that he is as yet a mere child, and that he is in need of masters, and teachers, and guardians;", "1194": "since what can be a more desirable blessing for me than that my one mind and one body shall not be loaded with so great a weight of the cares of government, but for me to have some one who may be able to lighten and alleviate them by sharing them *?", "1195": "J, therefore,\" said he:", "1196": "\"passing over and being superior to all tutors, and masters, and guardians, register myself as his father, and him as my son.\"V.", "1197": "With these words he deceived both those who were present and the youth himself;", "1198": "for his proposal was a mere bait, his intention being not to invest him with the power which he expected, but to deprive him of even that which he already had, according to the law affecting co-heirs and partners;", "1199": "and accordingly now he plotted against him with absolute fearlessness, having no regard for nor fear of any one;", "1200": "for by the laws of the Romans the most complete and absolute authority over the son belongs to the father, besides the fact of Caius having the imperial authority which was wholly irrespon­ sible, since no one could either venture or had any power to demand an account from him of any thing whatever that he might do.", "1201": "Accordingly, looking upon this youth to be like a thirds-man in the games, he proceeded to overthrow him, feeling no com­ passion, either for the fact of his having been brought up with him, or his being so nearly related to him, or for his age, but having no idea of sparing this miserable youth, doomed to an early death;", "1202": "his own partner in the government, his co-heir, who had formerly been expected to be all but the absolute emperor, by reason of his being the nearest relation to Tiberius;", "1203": "for when their fathers are dead, the grandsons are usually looked upon by their grandfathers as standing in the position of sons.", "1204": "It is said moreover, that this youth, being ordered to slay himself with his own hands, while a centurion and a captain of a thousand were standing by (who had been expressly com­ manded to take no part in the horrid deed, since it was not lawful for the descendants of the emperors to be put to death by any one else;", "1205": "for Caius remembered the laws amid his lawless acts, and had some regard for piety in all his impious deeds, imitating as well as he could the nature of truth) ;", "1206": "he, not knowing how to kill himself, for he had never seen any one else put to death, and had never had any practice in fighting with weapons, which is the usual exercise and course of instruction for children who are being educated with a view to become leaders and rulers, on account of the wars which they may have to conduct, at first exhorted those officers who had come to him to put him to death themselves, stretching out his neck;", "1207": "but when they did not dare to do so, he himself taking the sword inquired in his ignorance and want of experience what was the most mortal place, in order that by a well-directed blow he might cut short his miserable life;", "1208": "and they, like instructors in misery, led him on his way, and pointed out to him the part into which he was to thrust his sword;", "1209": "and he, having thus learnt his first and last lesson, became himself, miserable that he was, his own murderer under compulsion.", "1210": "VI.", "1211": "But when this first and greatest undertaking had been accomplished by Caius, there being no longer left any one who had any connexion with the supreme authority, to whom any one who bore him ill-will, and who was suspected by him, could possibly turn his eyes;", "1212": "he now, in the second place, proceeded to compass the death of Macro, a man who had co- operated with him in every thing relating to the empire, not only after he had been appointed emperor, for it is a character­ istic of flattery to court those who are in a state of prosperity, but who had previously assisted him in his measures for securing that authority.", "1213": "For Tiberius, who was a man of very profound prudence, and the most able of all the men of his court at perceiving the hidden intentions of any man, and who was as pre-eminent in intelligence and acuteness as he was in good fortune, did very often look with suspicion upon Caius as being evil disposed towards all the house of Claudius, and as being related to him only on the mother's side,* and he feared for his grandson, lest he, being left a mere child, should be put to death by him.", "1214": "And he judged him, moreover, very little fitted for an authority of such magnitude, both on account of the unsociable­ ness and ferocity of his nature, and the inequality of his temper;", "1215": "for he was continually giving way to the most frantic and most inconsistent moods, not preserving any consistency either in his words or in his actions;", "1216": "all which Macro studied with all his strength at every opportunity, pacifying the suspi­ cions of Tiberius and all the prejudices with which he perceived that his mind was inflamed against Caius by reason of his ceaseless fear and anxiety for his grandson.", "1217": "For he represented to him, that Caius was a person of a good and obedient disposition, and one who entertained the greatest affection for his cousin, so that out of his exceeding regard for him he would be willing even to abandon the government and to yield it up to him by himself, but that excessive modesty was anything but advantageous to many persons, in consequence of which Caius, who was of a most guileless and single-minded disposition, was looked upon by many as crafty and designing.", "1218": "And when he could not persuade him, by all the arguments drawn from probabilities which he advanced, he brought for­ ward that which rested upon specific agreements, adding, \" I myself will be his security, I who deserve to have confidence placed in me, inasmuch as I have given sufficient proof that I myself am individually a friend to Cæsar, and a friend to Tiberius, since it was I who carried into execution, your in­ tentions respecting the downfall of Sejanus.", "1219": "And, in short, he was very assiduous, and energetic, and comprehensive in his praises of Caius, if, indeed, one may speak of speeches in defence of a man as equivalent to pane­ gyrics on him, which were rather addressed to the doing away with the unfavourable impressions and suspicions, excited by obscure and indistinct hints and accusations.", "1220": "In short, all the things which any one could say on behalf of any brother or legitimate child, such and more too did Macro say to Tiberius in behalf of Caius.", "1221": "And the cause of this was accord­ ing to the report which obtain d among the generality of people, not only that Macro had, on the other hand, been greatly courted by him, as one who had the greatest, or, indeed, all the power under the empire;", "1222": "but also that Macro's wife was favourable to him, for a reason which ought not to be mentioned, and she every day urged on, and encouraged, and entreated her husband to omit no exertion of his zeal and energy on behalf of the young man.", "1223": "And a wife is a very powerful engine to divert or to persuade the mind of her hus­ band, especially if she be one of an amorous temperament, for because of her own consciousness she becomes more given to flattery.", "1224": "And Macro, being ignorant of the dishonour done to his marriage-bed and to his family, and looking upon her flattery as a proof of her sincere good will and affection for him, was deceived, and without being, aware of it was led, by her intrigues, to embrace his bitterest enemies as his best friends.", "1225": "VII.", "1226": "Therefore, as he knew that he had preserved him ten thousand times, when he was in the most imminent danger of being put to death, he used to offer him undisguised, sincere, and honest admonitions and advice, with perfect freedom of speech;", "1227": "for, like a good workman, he was desirous that what he looked upon as his own work should remain uninjured and indestructible, without being put an end to, either by himself or by any one else;", "1228": "therefore, whenever he saw him sleeping at any entertainment he would go round and awaken him, having, at the same time, a regard for what was becoming and also for his safety, for a man who is asleep is a good object for treachery ;", "1229": "and whenever he beheld him looking with an excited eye at any dancers, or even sometimes dancing with them, or not smiling with dignity upon actors of farcical and laughable spectacles, but rather grinning like a boy, or wholly carried away by the tunes of some harp-player or chorus, so as on some occasions even to join in their song, he would, if he was sitting or going near him, give him a nudge, and en­ deavour to check him.", "1230": "And very often, when he was reclining near him, he would whisper in his ear, and admonish him gently and quietly, so that no one else might hear what was said, saying, \"", "1231": "You ought not only not to be like any one else here, but like no one else whatever, neither at any spectacle, or at anything that is to be heard, or in anything else that ever affects the out­ ward senses, but you ought rather to surpass all other men in every action of your life, as much as you surpass them in your good fortune, for it is unreasonable for the ruler of all the earth and of all the sea to be subdued by a song or by an ex­ hibition of dancing, or by any ridiculous jest or piece of acting, or by anything else of that kind ;", "1232": "and not on every occasion, and in every place, to remember his position as emperor, like a shepherd and protector of the flock, availing himself of everything that can tend to any kind of amelioration, from every word, and from every action, of every description what­ ever.", "1233": "\"Then again he would add, “ When you are present at any theatrical contest, or at any gymnastic games, or at any of the contests in the hippodrome, do not consider the pursuits them­ selves so much as the behaving correctly in all such pursuits, and entertain thoughts of this nature :", "1234": "if some men labour in this manner to bring to perfection things that can in no respect benefit human life, but which only afford pleasure and amusement to the spectators, in such a way as to be praised and admired, and to receive rewards, and honours, and crowns, and to have their names proclaimed as conquerors;", "1235": "what ought that man to do who is skilful in the most sublime and most important of all arts ?", "1236": "Now the greatest and most excel­ lent of all sciences is the science of government, by means of which every country which is good and fertile, whether it be champaign or mountainous, is cultivated, and every sea is na­ vigated without danger by heavily-laden merchant-vessels, to communicate to the different countries the useful productions of each, out of a natural desire for participation and associa­ tion, so that each land receives what it stands in need of, and sends abroad in requital those good things of which it has a superfluity;", "1237": "for envy has never obtained a dominion over the whole of the habitable world, nor even over those great divisions of it, the whole of Europe or the whole of Asia, but it lurks in holes like a venomous reptile, creeping out in small districts to attack an individual man, or a single family, or, if it is very violent and powerful, perhaps one city;", "1238": "but it never attacks a larger circle of a whole nation or a whole country, especially ever since your august family has really begun to rule over all men in every part of the world.\"", "1239": "For your house has discovered and brought to light every­ thing that is good, even in the midst of evils, and has banished all evils to the extremities of the earth, and beyond its borders to the very depths of Tartarus, and has brought back, from the most distant borders of the earth and sea, those profitable and beneficial things which were in a manner banished into the habitable world around us;", "1240": "and now all these things are en­ trusted to your power, to be governed by your authority.\"", "1241": "Accordingly you, having been conducted by nature to the supreme helm of the world, and having the government of everything placed in your hand, must guide the universal ship of all mankind in a safe and salutary manner, rejoicing and delighting in nothing more than in doing good to your sub­ jects ;", "1242": "for different people have different contributions to bestow, which individuals necessarily offer in their several cities.", "1243": "But the most suitable gift for a ruler to give is to adopt wise counsels with respect to those who are subject to his authority, and to execute intentions which have been rightly formed, and to bestow on them good things without any limita­ tion, with a liberal hand and mind, except such as it may be better to keep in reserve from a prudent foreknowledge of the uncertainty of the future.\"", "1244": "VIII.", "1245": "The unhappy man kept dinning suggestions of this kind into his ears in the hope of improving Caius;", "1246": "but he, being a contentious and quarrelsome person, turned his mind in the directly opposite direction, as if he were exhorted to do exactly the contrary, and be conceived a most determined dis­ gust for his monitor, so as never to behold him with a cheerful countenance;", "1247": "and sometimes when he saw him at a distance he would speak as follows to those near him:", "1248": "\"", "1249": "Here comes the teacher of one who has no longer any right to be looked upon as a pupil ;", "1250": "-here comes the pedagogue of one who is no longer a child,

government, and as a teacher of it, though from whom he has learnt the principles of sovereign government I know not;", "1251": "for from the moment that I left my cradle, I have had ten thousand instructors, fathers, brothers, uncles, cousins, and grandfathers, up to the very founders of my family, in fact every one related to me either on my father's or my mother's side, who had acquired absolute power for themselves, even without taking into consideration the fact that, by their being the authors of my being, they had im­ planted in me some degree of royal power and some natural aptitude for government.", "1252": "For as similitudes of both body and soul exist both in the form, and position, and motions of men, and also as the inclinations, and dispositions, and actions of men are preserved in some degree of similitude through the principles of descent, so also is it probable that the very same principles should convey an outline of similitude in respect of one's aptitude for government.", "1253": "Shall any one, then, who is ignorant dare to instruct me who am the reverse of ignorant ?", "1254": "me who, even before my birth, while I was yet in my mother's womb, was fashioned as an emperor in the workshop of nature ?", "1255": "For how can it be possible for persons, who but a short time before were private individuals, to contemplate as they should the intentions of an imperial soul ?", "1256": "But some persons in their shameless audacity dare to put themselves forward as inter­ preters and perfecters of the principles of government, when in reality they scarcely ought to be enrolled among those who have any understanding whatever of the matter.", "1257": "\"And as he thus diligently laboured to alienate himself from Macro, he began also to invent false but plausible and specious grounds for blaming and accusing him;", "1258": "for passionate and irritable natures, especially when belonging to powerful men, are very ingenious at

very atten­ tive and affectionate to Caius, showing all imaginable regard for him, not so much like a father-in-law as like an actual father, and he hoped that he should find that Caius also enter­ tained equal good will towards him, transforming himself according to the principles of equality from a son-in-law into a son;", "1279": "but he was, without knowing it, cherishing mistaken opinions, and deluding himself, for he was continually uttering affectionate speeches, keeping back nothing which could tend to the amelioration and improvement of Caius's disposition and way of life and mode of government, speaking with all freedom, and looking upon his own surpassing nobility of birth and nearness of connexion by marriage as circumstances which gave him grounds for great familiarity and openness, for his daughter had been dead only a very short time, so that the laws and bonds which bind such kinsmen were scarcely destroyed, and one may almost say were still quivering with life, some relics of the breath of vitality being still left, as it were, and remaining warm in the body.", "1280": "But Caius, looking upon every admonition as an insult, because he fancied that he himself was the wisest and most virtuous of all men, and more­ over the most valorous and the most just, hated all who ventured to offer him instruction more than even his avowed enemies.", "1281": "Therefore, looking on Silanus as a bore, who only wished to check the impetuosity and indulgence of his appetites, and dis­ carding all recollection of and regard for his deceased wife, he treacherously put her father to death, who was also his own father-in-law.X.", "1282": "And by this time the matter began to be widely talked about in consequence of the continual deaths of so many eminent men, so that now

you filled the whole of the habitable world with joy as lie did ?", "1344": "Are all Asia and Europe inadequate to contain the gifts which have been showered upon mankind by you?", "1345": "No doubt you have invented new arts and sciences, like a common pest and murderer of your kind, by which you have changed all pleasant 'and acceptable things into vexation and sorrow, and have made life miserable and intolerable to all men everywhere, appro­ priating to yourself in your intolerable and insatiable greedi­ ness all the good and beautiful things which belonged to every one else, whether from the east or from any other country of the universe, carrying off everything from the south, every­ thing from the north, and in requital giving to and pouring down upon those whom you had plundered every sort of mis­ chievous and injurious things from your own bitter spirit, everything which is ever engendered in cruel, and destructive, and envenomed dispositions;", "1346": "these are the reasons why you appeared to us as a new Bacchus.", "1347": "But I suppose you imitated Hercules in your unwearied labours and your incessant displays of valour and virtue;", "1348": "you, 0 most wretched of men having filled every continent and every island with good laws, and principles of justice, and wealth, and comfort, and prosperity, and abundance of other blessings, you, wretched man, full of all cowardice and iniquity, who have emptied every city of all the things which can con­ duce to stability and prosperity, and have made them full of everything which leads to trouble and confusion, and the most utter misery and desolation.", "1349": "Tell me then, 0 Caius!", "1350": "do you, after having made all these contributions to universal destruction, do you, I say, seek to acquire immortality in order to make the calamities which you have heaped upon mankind, not of brief duration and short- lived, but imperishable and everlasting ?", "1351": "But I think, on the contrary, that even if you had previously appeared to be a god, you would beyond all question have been changed on account of your evil practices into an ordinary nature, resembling that, of common perishable mortals ;", "1352": "for if virtues can make their possessors immortal, then beyond all doubt vices can make them mortal.", "1353": "Do not, therefore, inscribe your name by the side of that of the twin sons of Jupiter, those most affectionate of deities, you who have been the murderer and destruction of your brethren, nor claim a share in the honours of Hercules or Bacchus, who have benefited human life.", "1354": "You have been the undoer and destroyer of those good effects which they produced.", "1355": "XIII.", "1356": "But the madness and frenzy to which he gave way were so preposterous, and so utterly insane, that he went even beyond the demigods, and mounted up to and invaded the veneration and worship paid to those who are looked upon as greater than they, as the supreme deities of the world, Mercury, and Apollo, and Mars.", "1357": "And first of all he dressed himself up with the caduceus, and sandals, and mantle of Mercury, exhibiting a regularity in his disorder, a consistency in his confusion, and a ratiocina­ tion in his insanity.", "1358": "Afterwards, when he thought fit to do so, he laid aside these ornaments, and metamorphosed and transformed himself into Apollo, crowning his head with garlands, in the form of rays, and holding a bow and arrows in his left hand, and holding forth graces in his right, as if it became him to proffer blessings to all men from his ready store, and to display the best ar­ rangement possible on his right hand, but to contract the punishments which he had it in his power to inflict, and to allot to them a more confined space on his left.", "1359": "And imme­ diately there were established choruses, who had been carefully trained, singing paeans to him, the same who had, a little while before, called him Bacchus, and Evius, and Lyæus, and sang Bacchic hymns in his honour when he assumed the disguise of Bacchus.", "1360": "Very often, also, he would clothe himself with a breastplate, and march forth sword in hand, with a helmet on his head and a shield on his left arm, calling himself Mars, and on each side of him there marched with him the attendants of this new and unknown Mars, a troop of murderers and executioners who had already performed him all kinds of wicked services when he was raging and thirsting for human blood;", "1361": "and then when men saw this they were amazed and terrified at the marvellous sight, and they wondered how a man who did exactly the contrary to what was done by those beings to whom he claimed to be equal in honour, did not choose to imitate their virtues, but assumed the outward character of each with I the most abominable conduct.", "1362": "And yet all those ornaments and decorations which belonged to them were attached to his statues and images, which indicated by symbols the benefits which the beings who are thus honoured confer upon the race of mankind.", "1363": "Mercury, for instance, requires wings attached to his ankles.", "1364": "Why so ?", "1365": "Is it not because it behoves him to be the interpreter and declarer of the will of the gods (from which employment, in fact, he derives his Greek name of Hermes✻), announcing good news to mankind (for not only no god but no sensible man ever will become the messenger of evil), and therefore it is necessary for him to be exceedingly swift-footed, and all but winged, from the unhesitating rapidity with which he requires to proceed.", "1366": "Since it is right that beneficial news should be announced with great promptness, just as bad news ought to be brought slowly, unless indeed any one should prefer saying that such ought to be entirely sup­ pressed in silence.", "1367": "Again, he takes with him his caduceus or herald's wand, as a token of reconciliation and peace, for wars receive their respites and terminations by means of heralds, who restore peace ;", "1368": "and wars which have no heralds to terminate them cause endless calamities to both parties, both to those who invade their neighbours and to those who are endeavouring to repel the invasion.", "1369": "But for what purpose did Caius assume the winged sandals of Mercury ?", "1370": "Was it because he wished to spread with power, and rapidity, and loudness that miserable and ill-omened intelligence which ought rather to be buried in silence altogether, conveying his voice everywhere with un­ ceasing eelerity ?", "1371": "And yet what need had he of such rapid motion ?", "1372": "for even while standing still he poured forth unspeakable evils upon evils as if from an unceasing fountain, showering them down upon every portion of the habitable world.", "1373": "And of what use was the herald's wand to him, who never either said or did anything bearing upon peace, but who rather filled every house and every city within Greece and in the countries of the barbarians with civil wars?", "1374": "Let him, therefore, impostor that he is, lay aside the name of Mercury, since by assuming it he is only profaning an appellation which does not belong to him.", "1375": "XIV.", "1376": "Again, of all the attributes of Apollo, what is there which in the least degree resembles his characteristics ?", "1377": "He wears a crown emitting rays all around, the artist who made it having given a most admirable representation of the beams of the sun;", "1378": "but how can the sun, or in fact any light at all, be a welcome object to him, and not rather night, or anything else, if there be such more completely enveloped darkness, or even anything darker than darkness itself, for the performance of his lawless actions ?", "1379": "Since good actions do require the bril­ liancy of noonday for their proper display, but shameful actions, as they say, are suited to the extreme depths of Tartarus, into which they ought to be thrust in order to be concealed from sight, as is becoming.", "1380": "Let him also transpose the things which he bears in each of his hands, and not pollute the proper arrangement, for let him bear his arrows and his bow in his right hand, for he knows how with good aim to shoot at and to pierce men and women, and whole families, and populous cities, to their complete destruction.", "1381": "And let him either at once throw away his graces altogether, or else let him keep them in the shade in his left hand, for he has defaced their beauty, directing all his eyes and exciting all his desires against vast properties, so as to plunder them in an iniquitous manner, in consequence of which their owners were murdered, finding themselves unfortunate through their good fortune.", "1382": "But no doubt he with great felicity gave a new representa­ tion of the medical skill of Apollo, for this god was the inventor of healing medicines,.", "1383": "so as to cause health to men, thinking fit himself to heal the diseases which were inflicted by others, by reason of the excessive mildness and gentleness of his own nature and habits, but this man, on the contrary, loads those who are in good health with disease, and inflicts mutilations on those who are sound, and in short visits the living with most cruel death, caused by the hand of man before the time of their natural death, preparing every imaginable engine of destruction in abundant plenteousness, by means of which, if he had not himself been previously put to death in accordance with justice, everything glorious or respectable in every city would long ago have been destroyed.", "1384": "For his designs were prepared against all those in authority and all those possessed of riches, and especially against those in Rome and those in the rest of Italy, by whom such quanti­ ties of gold and silver had been treasured up that even if all the riches of all the rest of the habitable world had been collected together from its most distant borders, it would have been found to be very inferior in amount.", "1385": "On this account he began, he, this hater of the citizens, this?", "1386": "devourer of the people, this pestilence, this destructive evil, began to banish all the seeds of peace from his country, as if he were expelling evil from holy ground;", "1387": "for Apollo is said to have been not only a physician but also an excellent prophet, by his oracular predictions announcing what was likely to con­ duce to the advantage of mankind, in order that no one, being overshadowed by uncertainty, going on without seeing his way before him like a blind man, might hastily fall into unexpected evils as if they were the greatest benefits;", "1388": "but that men having previously acquired a knowledge of the future as if it were really present, and looking at it with the eye of their mind, might guard against future evils just as they can see evils actually before them with the bodily eye, and in this way secure themselves against any irremediable disaster.", "1389": "Is it fitting now to compare with these oracles of Apollo the ill-omened warnings of Caius, by means of which poverty, and dishonour, and banishment, and death were given premature notice of to all those who were in power and authority in any part of the world ?", "1390": "What connexion or resemblance was there between him and Apollo, when he never paid any attention to any ties of kindred or friendship?", "1391": "Let him cease, then, this pretended Apollo, from imitating that real healer of mankind, for the form of God is not a thing which is capable of being imitated by an inferior one, as good money is imitated by bad.", "1392": "XV.", "1393": "A man, indeed, may expect anything rather than that a man endowed with such a body and such a soul, when both of them are effeminate and broken down, could ever possibly be made like to the vigour of Mars in either particular;", "1394": "but this man, like a mummer transforming himself on the stage, putting on all sorts of masks one after another, sought to deceive the spectators by a series of fictitious appearances.", "1395": "Come, then, let him be subjected to an examination in respect of all the particulars of his soul and body, by.", "1396": "reason of his utter unlikeness to the aforesaid deity in every position and in every motion.", "1397": "Was he not utterly unlike Mars, not in respect only of his appearance as celebrated in fable, but as to his natural qualities?", "1398": "Mars, who is endued with pre-eminent valour, which we know to be a power calculated to avert evil, to he the assistant and ally of all who are unjustly oppressed, as indeed his very name shows, for he appears to me to be called Mars from his helping,* which is the same as assisting, being as such the god who is able to put down wars and to cause peace, of which this representation of his was the enemy, being the comrade of wars, and the man who changed peace and stability into disorder and confusion.", "1399": "XVI.", "1400": "Have we not, then, learned from all these instances, that Caius ought not to be likened to any god, and not even to any demi-god, inasmuch as he has neither the same nature, nor the same essence, nor even the same wishes and intentions as any one of them;", "1401": "but appetite as it seems is a blind thing, and ' especially so when it takes to itself vain-gloriousness and am­ bition in conjunction with the greatest power, by which we who were previously unfortunate are utterly destroyed, for he regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his, and who had been taught in a manner from their very swaddling-clothes by their parents, and teachers, and instructors, and even before that by their holy laws, and also by their unwritten maxims and customs, to believe that there was but one God, their Father and the Creator of the world;", "1402": "for all others, all men, all women, all cities, all nations, every country and region of the earth, I had almost said the whole of the inhabited world, although groaning over what was taking place, did nevertheless flatter him, dignifying him above measure, and helping to increase his pride and arrogance;", "1403": "and some of them even introduced the barbaric custom into Italy of falling down in adoration before him, adulterating their native feelings of Roman liberty.", "1404": "But the single nation of the Jews, being excepted from these actions, was suspected by him of wishing to counteract his desires, since it was accustomed to embrace voluntary death as an entrance to immortality, for the sake of not permitting any of their national or hereditary customs to be destroyed, even if it were of the most trivial character, because, as is the case in a house, it often happens that by the removal of one small part, even those parts which appeared to be solidly established fall down, being relaxed and brought to decay by the removal of that one thing, but in this case what was put in motion was not a trifle, but a thing of the very greatest importance, namely, the erecting the created and perishable nature of a man, as far at least as appearance went, into the uncreated and imperishable nature of God, which the nation correctly judged to be the most terrible of all impieties (for it would have been easier to change a god into man, than a man into God), besides the fact of such an action letting in other most enormous wick­ edness, infidelity and ingratitude towards the Benefactor of the whole world, who by his own power gives abundant supplies of all kinds of blessings to every part of the universe.", "1405": "XVII.", "1406": "Therefore a most terrible and irreconcileable war was prepared against our nation, for what could be a more terrible evil to a slave than a master who was an enemy?", "1407": "And his subjects are the slaves of the emperor, even if they were not so to any one of the former emperors, because they governed with gentleness and in accordance with the laws, but now that Caius had eradicated all feelings of humanity from his soul, and had admired lawlessness (for looking upon himself as the law, he abrogated all the enactments of other lawgivers in every state and country as so many vain sentences), we were properly to be looked upon not only as slaves, but as the very lowest and mose dishonoured of slaves, now that our ruler was changed into our master.", "1408": "XVIII.", "1409": "And the mixed and promiscuous multitude of the Alexandrians perceiving this, attacked us, looking upon it as a most favourable opportunity for doing so, and displayed all the arrogance which had been smouldering for a long period, disturbing everything, and causing universal confusion, for they began to crush our people as if they had been surrendered by the emperor for the most extreme and undeniable miseries, or as if they had been subdued in war, with their frantic and most brutal passion, forcing their way into their houses, and driving out the owners, with their wives and children, which they rendered desolate and void of inhabitants.", "1410": "And no longer watching for night and darkness, like ordinary robbers out of fear of being detected, they openly plun­ dered them of all their furniture and treasures, carrying them off in broad daylight, and displaying their booty to every one whom they met, as if they had inherited it or fairly purchased it from the owners.", "1411": "And if a multitude joined together to share any particular piece of plunder, they divided it in the middle of the market.", "1412": "place, reviling it and turning it all into ridicule before the eyes of its real owners.", "1413": "These things were of themselves terrible and grievous;", "1414": "how could they be otherwise ?", "1415": "Surely it was most miserable for men to become beggars from having been wealthy, and to be reduced on a sudden from a state of abundance to one of utter indigence, without having done any wrong, and to be rendered houseless and homeless, being driven out and expelled from their own houses, that thus, being compelled to dwell in the open air day and night, they might be destroyed by the burning heat of the sun or by the cold of the night.", "1416": "Yet even these evils were lighter than those which I am about to mention;", "1417": "for when the populace had driven together these countless myriads of men, and women, and children, like so many herds of sheep and oxen, from every quarter of the city, into a very narrow space as if into a pen, they expected that in a few days they should find a heap of corpses all huddled together, as they would either have perished by hunger through the want of necessary food, as they had not prepared themselves with any thing requisite, through a foreknowledge of the evils which thus suddenly came upon them;", "1418": "or else through being crushed and suffocated from want of any adequate space to breathe in, all the air around them becoming tainted, and all that there was of vivifying power in their respiration being cut off, or, if one is to say the truth, utterly expelled, by the breath of those who were expiring among them.", "1419": "By which, each individual being inflamed, and in a manner oppressed by a descent of fever upon him, inhaled a hot and unwholesome breath through his nostrils and mouth, heap­ in,-,, as the proverb has it, fire on fire;", "1420": "for the power which resides in the inmost parts changed its nature, and became most excessively fiery;", "1421": "upon which, when the external breezes, being moderately cool, blow, all the organs of the respiratory powers flourish, and are in a good and healthy condition;", "1422": "but when these breezes change and become hot, then those organs must of necessity be in a bad state, fire being added to fire.", "1423": "XIX.", "1424": "As they then were no longer able to endure the misery of the place within which they were enclosed, they poured forth into desolate parts of the wilderness, and to the shore, and among the tombs, in their eagerness to find any pure and untainted air.", "1425": "And if any of them had previously been left in the other parts of the city, or if any had come in thither from the fields out of ignorance of the evils which had visited their companions, they fell into every variety of misfortune, being stoned, or else wounded with sharp tiles, or beaten on the most mortal parts of the body, and especially on the head, with branches of maple and of oak, in such a way as to cause death.", "1426": "And some of those persons who are accustomed to pass their time in idleness and inaction, sitting around, occupied themselves in watching those who, as I have said before, were thus driven together and crammed into a very small space, as if they were a force which they were blockading;", "1427": "lest any one should secretly escape without their perceiving it.", "1428": "And a great many were designing to effect their escape from want of necessaries, disregarding their own safety from a fear that, if they remained, the whole body might perish with famine.", "1429": "So those men, expecting that they would endeavour to escape, kept a continual watch, and the moment that they caught any one, they immediately put him to death with every circumstance of insult and cruelty.", "1430": "And there was another company lying in wait for them on the quays of the river, to catch any Jews who arrived at those spots, and to plunder them of every thing which they brought for the purposes of traffic;", "1431": "for, forcing their way into their ships they took out the cargo before the eyes of its lawful owners, and then, binding the hands of the merchants behind them, they burnt them alive, taking the rudders, and helms, and punt-poles, and the benches for the rowers to sit upon, for fuel.", "1432": "And thus these men perished by a most miserable death being burnt alive in the middle of the city;", "1433": "for sometimes, for want of other timber they brought piles of faggots together, and tying them up, they threw them on the miserable victims;", "1434": "and they, being already half burnt, were killed, more by the smoke of the green wood than by the flames, as the new faggots gave forth only an unsubstantial and smoky sort of flame, and were soon extinguished, not being able to be reduced to ashes by reason of their lightness.", "1435": "And many who were still alive they took and bound, and fastened their ankles together with thongs and ropes, and then dragged them through the middle of the market-place, leaping on them, and not sparing their corpses even after they were dead;", "1436": "for, tearing them to pieces limb from limb, and trampling on them, behaving with greater brutality and ferocity than even the most savage beasts, they destroyed every semblance of humanity about them, so that not even a fragment of them was left to which the rites of burial could be afforded.", "1437": "XX.", "1438": "But as the governor of the country, who by himself could, if he had chosen to do so, have put down the violence of the multitude in a single hour, pretended not to see what he did see, and not to hear what he did hear, but allowed the mob to carry on the war against our people without any restraint, and threw our former state of tranquillity into confusion, the populace being excited still more, proceeded onwards to still more shameless and more audacious designs and treachery, and, arraying very numerous companies, cut down some of the synagogues (and there are a great many in every section of the city), and some they razed to the very foundations, and into some they threw fire and burnt them, in their insane madness and frenzy, without caring for the neighbouring houses;", "1439": "for there is nothing more rapid than fire, when it lays hold of fuel.", "1440": "I omit to mention the ornaments in honour of the emperor, which were destroyed and burnt with these synagogues, such as gilded shields, and gilded crowns, and pillars, and inscriptions, for the sake of which they ought even to have abstained from and spared the other things ;", "1441": "but they were full of confidence, inasmuch as they did not fear any chastisement at the hand of Caius, as they well knew that he cherished an indescribable hatred against the Jews, so that their opinion was that no one could do him a more acceptable service than by inflicting every description of injury on the nation which he hated;", "1442": "and, as they wished to curry favour with him by a novel kind of flattery, so as to allow, and for the future to give the rein to, every sort of ill treatment of us without ever being called to account, what did they proceed to do?", "1443": "All the synagogues that they were unable to destroy by burning and razing them to the ground, because a great number of Jews lived in a dense mass in the neighbourhood, they injured and defaced in another manner, simultaneously with a total overthrow of their laws and customs;", "1444": "for they set up in every one of them images of Caius, and in the greatest, and most conspicuous, and most celebrated of them they erected a brazen statue of him borne on a four-horse chariot.", "1445": "And so excessive and impetuous was the rapidity of their zeal, that, as they had not a new chariot for four horses ready, they got a very old one out of the gymnasium, full of poison, mutilated in its ears, and in the hinder part, and in its pedestal, and in many other points, and as some say, one which had already been dedicated in honour of a woman, the eminent Cleopatra, who was the great grandmother of the last.", "1446": "Now what amount of accusation he brought against those who had dedicated this chariot on this very account is notorious to every one;", "1447": "for what did it signify if it was a new one and belonging to a woman ?", "1448": "Or what if it was an old one and belonging to a man ?", "1449": "And what, in short, if it was wholly dedicated to the name of some one else ?", "1450": "Was it not natural that those who were offering up a chariot of this sort on behalf of the emperor should be full of cautious fear, lest some one might lay an information against them before our emperor, who took such especial care that every thing which at all affected or related to himself should be done in the most dignified manner possible ?", "1451": "But these men expected to be most extravagantly praised, and to receive greater and more conspicuous advantages as rewards for their conduct, in thus dedicating the synagogues to Caius as new pieces of consecrated ground, not because of the honour which was done to him by this proceeding, but because in this way they exhausted every possible means of insulting and injuring our nation.", "1452": "And one may find undeniable and notorious proofs of this' having been the case.", "1453": "For, in the first place, one may derive them from about ten kings or more who reigned in order, one after another, for three hundred years, and who never once had any images or statues of themselves erected in our synagogues, though there were many of their relations and kinsmen whom they considered, and registered as, and spoke of as gods.", "1454": "And what would they not have done in the case of those whom they looked upon as men ?", "1455": "a people who look upon dogs, and wolves, and lions, and crocodiles, and numerous other beasts, both terrestrial and aquatic, and numerous birds, as gods, and erect in their honour altars, and temples, and shrines, and consecrated precincts, throughout the whole of Egypt ?XXI.", "1456": "Perhaps some people who would not have opened their mouths then will say now:", "1457": "\"", "1458": "They were accustomed to pay respect to the good deeds done by their govern­ ors rather than to their governors themselves, because the emperors are greater than the Ptolemies, both in their dignities and in their fortunes, and are justly entitled to receive higher honours.", "1459": "Then, 0 ye most foolish of all mankind!", "1460": "that I may not be compelled to utter any thing disrespectful or blasphemous, why did you never think Tiberius, who was emperor before Caius, who indeed was the cause that Caius ever became emperor, who himself enjoyed the supreme power by land and sea for three and twenty years, and who never allowed any seed of war to smoulder or to raise its head, either in Greece or in the territory of the barbarians, and who bestowed peace and the blessings of peace up to the end of his life with a rich and most bounteous hand and mind upon the whole empire and the whole world;", "1461": "why, I say, did you not consider him worthy of similar honour P Was he inferior in birth ?", "1462": "No ;", "1463": "he was of the most noble blood by both parents.", "1464": "Was he inferior in his education ?", "1465": "Who, of all the men who flourished in his time, was either more prudent or more eloquent P", "1466": "Or in his age ?", "1467": "What king or emperor ever lived to more prosperous old age than he ?", "1468": "Moreover, he, even while he was still a young man, was called the old man as a mark of respect because of his exceeding wisdom.", "1469": "This man, though he was so wise, and so good, and so great, was passed over and disregarded by you.", "1470": "Again, why did you not pay similar honour to him who exceeded the common race of human nature in every virtue, who, by reason of the greatness of his absolute power and his own excellence, was the first man to be called Augustus, not receiving the title after another by a succession of blood as a part of his inheritance, but who was himself the origin of his successors, having that title and honour ?", "1471": "He who first became emperor, when all the affairs of the state were in disorder and confusion;", "1472": "for the islands were in a state of war against the continents, and the continents were con­ tending with the islands for the pre-eminence in honour, each having for their leaders and champions the most powerful and eminent of the Romans who were in office.", "1473": "And then again, great sections of Asia were contending against Europe, and Europe against Asia, for the chief power and dominion ;", "1474": "* the European and Asiatic nations rising up from the extremities of the earth, and waging terrible wars against one another over all the earth, and over every sea, with enormous armaments, so that very nearly the whole race of mankind would have been destroyed by mutual slaughter and made utterly to disappear, if it had not been for one man and leader, Augustus, by whose means they were brought to a better state, and therefore we may justly call him the averter of evil.", "1475": "This is Cæsar, who calmed the storms which were raging in every direction, who healed the common diseases which were afflicting both Greeks and barbarians, who descended from the south and from the east, and ran on and penetrated as far as the north and the west, in such a way as to fill all the neighbouring districts and waters with unexpected miseries.", "1476": "This is he who did not only loosen but utterly abolish the bonds in which the whole of the habitable world was previously bound and weighed down.", "1477": "This is he who destroyed both the evident and the unseen wars which arose from the attacks of robbers.", "1478": "This is he who rendered the sea free from the vessels of pirates, and filled it with merchantmen.*", "1479": "This is he who gave freedom to every city, who brought disorder into order, who civilized and made obedient and harmonious, nations which before his time were unsociable, hostile, and brutal.", "1480": "This is he who increased Greece by many Greeces, and who Greecised the regions of the barbarians in their most important divisions:", "1481": "the guardian of peace, the distributor to every man of what was suited to him, the man who proffered to all the citizens favours with the most ungrudging liberality, who never once in his whole life concealed or reserved for himself any thing that was good or excellent.", "1482": "XXII.", "1483": "Now this man who was so- great a benefactor to them for the space of three and forty years, during which he reigned over Egypt, they passed over in silence and neglect, never erecting any thing in their synagogues to do him honour;", "1484": "no image, no statue, no inscription.", "1485": "And yet if ever there was a man to whom it was proper that new and unprecedented honours should be voted, it was certainly fitting that such should be decreed to him, not only because he was as it were the origin and fountain of the family of Augustus, not because he was the first, and greatest, and universal benefactor, having, instead of the multitude of governors who existed before, entrusted the common vessel of the state to himself as one pilot of admirable skill in the science of governments to steer and govern;", "1486": "for the verse, “ The government of many is not good,”* is very properly expressed, since a multitude of votes is the cause of every variety of evil;", "1487": "but also because the whole of the rest of the habitable world had decreed him honours equal to those of the Olympian gods.", "1488": "And we have evidence of this in the temples, and porticoes, and sacred precincts, and groves, and colonnades which have been erected, so that all the cities put together, ancient and modern, which exhibit magnificent works, are surpassed, by the beauty and magni­ tude of the buildings erected in honour of Cæsar, and especially by those raised in our city of Alexandria.", "1489": "For there is no sacred precinct of such magnitude as that which is called the Grove of Augustus, and the temple erected in honour of the disembarkation of Cæsar, which is raised to a great height, of great size, and of the most conspicuous beauty, opposite the best harbour;", "1490": "being such an one as is not to be seen in any other city, and full of offerings, in pictures, and statues;", "1491": "and decorated all around with silver and gold;", "1492": "being a very extensive space, orna­ mented in the most magnificent and sumptuous manner with porticoes, and libraries, and men's chambers, and groves, and propylæa, and wide, open terraces, and court-yards in the open air, and with everything that could contribute to use or beauty ;", "1493": "being a hope and beacon of safety to all who set sail, or who came into harbour.", "1494": "XXIII.", "1495": "Therefore, though they had such admirable pre­ texts for such conduct, and all the nations in every part of the world inclined to agree with them, they nevertheless neither made any innovations in their synagogues, but kept the law in every particular;", "1496": "and refused any marks of respect and veneration which might have been looked upon as due to Caesar.", "1497": "Perhaps some cautious and sensible person may ask:", "1498": "\" Why were all these honours denied to him?\"", "1499": "I will tell the reason, without suppressing any thing.", "1500": "They were aware of the attention which he paid to every thing, and of the very exceeding care which he took that the national laws and customs prevailing in each nation should be confirmed and preserved, being equally anxious for the preservation of the rights of foreign nations in this respect, as for those of the Romans;", "1501": "and that he received his honours, not for the destruction of the laws existing in any people, filling himself with pride and arrogance, but in a spirit of proper conformity with the magnitude of so vast an empire, which is dignified and honoured by such marks of respect being paid to the emperor.", "1502": "And there is most undeniable proof that he was never 'influenced or puffed up by the excessive honours paid to ihim, in the fact that he did not approve of any one's addressing him as master or god, but if any one used such expressions he was angry;", "1503": "and we may see it too in his approbation of the Jews, who he well knew most reli­ giously avoided all such language.", "1504": "How then did he look upon the great division of Rome which is on the other side of the river Tiber, which he was well aware was occupied and inhabited by the Jews ?", "1505": "And they were mostly Roman citizens, having been emancipated;", "1506": "for, having been brought as captives into Italy, they were manumitted by those who had bought them for slaves, with­ out ever having been compelled to alter any of their hereditary or national observances.", "1507": "Therefore, he knew that they had synagogues, and that they were in the habit of visiting them, and most especially on the sacred sabbath days, when they publicly cultivate their national philosophy.", "1508": "He knew also that they were in the habit of contributing sacred sums of money from their first fruits and sending them to Jerusalem by the hands of those who were to conduct the sacrifices.", "1509": "But he never removed them from Rome, nor did he ever deprive them of their rights as Roman citizens, because he had a regard for Judæa, nor did he ever meditate any new steps of innovation or rigour with respect to their synagogues, nor did he forbid their assembling for the interpretation of the law, nor did he make any opposition to their offerings of first fruits ;", "1510": "but he behaved with such piety towards our countrymen, and with respect to all our customs, that he, I may almost say, with all his house, adorned our temple with many costly and magnificent offerings, commanding that continued sacrifices of whole burnt offerings should be offered up for ever and ever every day from his own revenues, as a first fruit of his own to the most high God, which sacrifices are performed to this very day, and will be performed for ever, as a proof and specimen of a truly imperial disposition.", "1511": "Moreover, in the monthly divisions of the country, when the whole people receives money or corn in turn, he never allowed the Jews to fall short in their reception of this favour, but even if it happened that this distribution fell on the day of their sacred sabbath, on which day it is not lawful for them to receive any thing, or to give any thing, or in short to perform any of the ordinary duties of life, he charged the dispenser of these gifts, and gave him the most careful and special injunctions to make the distribution to the Jews on the day following, that they might not lose the effects of his common kindness.", "1512": "XXIV.", "1513": "Therefore, all people in every country, even if they were not naturally well inclined towards the Jewish nation, took great care not to violate or attack any of the Jewish customs or laws.", "1514": "And in the reign of Tiberius things went on in the same manner, although at that time things in Italy were thrown into a great deal of confusion when Sejanus was preparing to make his attempt against our nation;", "1515": "for he knew immediately after his death that the accusations which had been brought against the Jews who were dwelling in Rome were false calumnies, inventions of Sejanus, who was desirous to destroy our nation, which he knew alone, or above all others, was likely to oppose his unholy counsels and actions in defence of the emperor, who was in great danger of being attacked, in violation of all treaties and of all honesty.", "1516": "And he sent commands to all the governors of provinces in every country to comfort those of our nation in their respective cities, as the punishment intended to be inflicted was not meant to be inflicted upon all, but only on the guilty;", "1517": "and they were but few.", "1518": "And he ordered them to change none of the existing customs, but to look upon them as pledges, since the men were peaceful in their dispositions and natural characters, and their laws trained them and disposed them to quiet and stability.", "1519": "XXV.", "1520": "But Caius puffed himself up with pride, not only saying, but actually thinking that he was a god.", "1521": "And then he found no people, whether among the Greeks or among the barbarians, more suitable than the Alexandrians to confirm him in his immoderate and unnatural ambition;", "1522": "for they are in an extraordinary degree inclined to flattery, and trick, and hypocrisy, being thoroughly furnished with all kinds of cajoling words, and prone to confuse every thing with their unbridled and licentious talk.", "1523": "And the name of God is held in so little veneration among them, that they have given it to ibises, and to the poisonous asps which are found in their country, and to many other savage beasts which exist in it.", "1524": "So that they, very naturally, giving in to all kinds of addresses and invocations to him, addressed him as God, deceiving men of shallow comprehension, who were wholly inexperienced in the impiety prevailing in Egypt, though they are detected by those who are ac­ quainted with their excessive folly, or, I should rather say, with their preposterous impiety.", "1525": "Of which, Cams, having no experience, imagined that he was really believed by the Alexandrians to be God, since they, without any disguise, openly and plainly used all the appellations without any limitation, with which they were accustomed to invoke the other gods.", "1526": "In the next place, he believed that the innovations which they made with respect to their synagogues, were all made with a pure conscience, and from a sincere honour and respect for him, partly being influenced by the ephemerides in the way of memorial, which some persons sent him from Alexandria;", "1527": "for these things were what he very much delighted to read, to such a degree that the writings of all other authors, whether in prose or in poetry, were looked upon by him as absolutely odious in comparison with the delight which these documents afforded him, and partly by the language of some of his domestics, who were continually jesting with him and ridiculing all serious things.", "1528": "XXVI.", "1529": "The greater portion of these men were Egyptians, wicked, worthless men, who had imprinted the venom and evil disposition of their native asps and crocodiles on their own souls, and gave a faithful representation of them there.", "1530": "And the leader of the whole Egyptian troops, like the cory­ phæus of a chorus, was a man of the name of Helicon, an accursed and infamous slave, who had been introduced into the imperial household to its ruin;", "1531": "for he had acquired a slight smattering of the encyclical sciences, by imitation of and rivalry with his former master, who gave him to Tiberius Cæsar.", "1532": "And at that time he had no especial privilege, since Tiberius had a perfect hatred of all youthful sallies of wit for the mere purposes of amusement, as he, from almost his earliest youth, was of a solemn and austere disposition.", "1533": "But when Tiberius was dead, and Caius succeeded to the empire, he then, following a new master, who invited him to every description of relaxation and luxury, such as could delight every one of his outward senses, said to himself:", "1534": "\"Rise up, 0 Helicon!", "1535": "now is your opportunity.", "1536": "You have now an auditor, and a spectator, who is of all men in the world the best calculated to receive the exhibition of your talents favourably.", "1537": "You are a man of very attractive natural talents.", "1538": "You are able to joke graceful, and to say witty, things beyond any one else.", "1539": "You are skilful in all kinds of amusements, and trifling, and fashionable sports.", "1540": "And you are equally accomplished in those branches of encyclical education which are not so ordinarily met with.", "1541": "Moreover, you have a readiness of speech and repartee which is far from unpleasing.", "1542": "If therefore you mingle with your jestings any little stimulus which is in the least un­ welcome or painful, so as to excite not only laughter but any feelings of bitterness, on the part of one who is always ready to suspect evil, you will 'be deliberately alienating from yourself a master who is very well inclined by nature to listen to any accusations which are brought before him in a joking manner;", "1543": "for his ears, as you well know, are always open, and are constantly on the watch to listen to all those who are in the habit of interweaving accusations of others with their sycophancy, And do not seek for any more abundant causes ;", "1544": "for you have a sufficient foundation with respect to the customs of the Jews and the national laws of that people, in which you yourself were bred up, and in which you have been instructed from your very earliest childhood, not by one man only, but by that most chattering and vexatious portion of the city of Alexandria.", "1545": "So now, make an exhibition of your learning.", "1546": "\"XXVII.", "1547": "By these preposterous and accursed arguments he excited his own expectations, and trained himself, and inflamed his own wishes;", "1548": "and then he attended upon and courted Caius, day and night, never leaving him for a moment, but being with him at all times and on all occa­ sions, and employing every moment when he was by himself, or when he was resting, to pour forth accusations against our nation, like a most infamous man as he was, exciting pleasure in the mind of the emperor by ridiculing the Jews and their laws and customs, that thus his calumnies might wound us the more effectually;", "1549": "for he never openly con­ fessed himself to be our accuser, nor could he in fact make such a confession;", "1550": "but he went by all kinds of crooked paths, and practised every sort of manoeuvre, and thus was a more dangerous and formidable enemy than even those men who openly recorded their hatred of and hostility towards us.", "1551": "They say also that some of the ambassadors of the Alex­ andrians, being completely aware of this, had secretly hired him by considerable bribes, and not only by money but by hopes of future honours, which they led him to expect he might attain to at no distant period, when Caius should come to Alexandria.", "1552": "And he, being continually declaiming of that time in which, while his master was present, and in conjunction with him, he should be almost supreme in his power over a large portion of the world (for it was notorious enough that by his assiduous courting of Caius, he would be able to acquire power over the most illustrious portion of the citizens, and over all those who are held in especial honour by the most magnificent and glorious city,* promised every thing).", "1553": "We, therefore, being for a long time unsuspicious of this natural enemy, who was plotting against us from his con­ cealment, took precautions only against our external foes;", "1554": "but when we perceived that he too was to be guarded against, we searched into the matter carefully, considering every expedient to see if we could, by any means, propitiate and conciliate the man who was thus aiming and shooting at us, by every means and from every place, with great ac­ curacy of aim and power of injuring us;", "1555": "for he was in the habit of playing at ball with him, and of exercising himself in gymnastic sports with him, and of bathing with him, and breakfasting with him, and he was with Cams when he was wont to go to rest, filling the part of chamberlain and chief body-guard to him, an office which was not entrusted to any one else, so that he alone had all kinds of favourable oppor­ tunities for being listened to at leisure by the emperor, when he was removed from any external tumults and dis­ tractions, and able quietly to hear what he principally desired.", "1556": "And he mingled numbers of satirical and quizzing observ­ ations with his more formal and serious accusations, in order to excite pleasure in his hearers by that means, and to do us the greatest possible amount of injury;", "1557": "for the quizzing and ridiculing appeared, as he used it, to be the principal object at which he aimed, though it was in reality only his indirect one;", "1558": "and the accusations which he launched against us appeared to be mere casual observations, dropped acci­ dentally, though in reality they were his primary and sole object, while he was trying every expedient possible, and so, like sailors who have a fair wind blowing on their stern, he was borne onwards with a full sail before a favourable gale, heaping upon us and stringing together one accusation after another, while the mind of his hearer was fashioned in a more solid and retentive mould, so that the recollection ot the accusations was not easily eradicated.", "1559": "XXVIII.", "1560": "Accordingly, we being in a great strait and in most difficult circumstances, we, though we had availed ourselves of every expedient which we could possibly think of in order to propitiate and conciliate Helicon, could find no means of doing so and no access to him, since no one dared either to accost or to approach him, by reason of his exceeding insolence and cruelty with which he behaved to every one;", "1561": "and also because we were not aware, whether there was any especial reason for his alienation from the Jewish nation;", "1562": "since he was also exciting and exasperating his master against our people, and, accordingly, we left on labouring at this point, and turned our attention to what was of greater importance.", "1563": "For it appeared good to present to Caius a memorial, con­ taining a summary of what we had suffered, and of the way in which we considered that we deserved to be treated;", "1564": "and this memorial was nearly an abridgment of a longer petition which we had sent to him a short time before, by the hand of king Agrippa;", "1565": "for be, by chance, was staying for a short time in the city, while on his way into Syria to take pos­ session of the kingdom which had been given to him;", "1566": "but we, without being aware of it, were deceiving ourselves, for before also we had done the same, when we originally began to set sail, thinking that as we were going before a judge we should meet with justice;", "1567": "but he was in reality an irreconcilable enemy to us, attracting us, as far as appear­ ance went, with favourable looks and cheerful address;", "1568": "for, receiving us favourably at first, in the plains on the banks of the Tiber (for he happened to be walking about in his mother's garden), he conversed with us formally, and waved his right hand to us in a protecting manner, giving us sig­ nificant tokens of his good will, and having sent to us the secretary, whose duty it was to attend to the embassies that arrived, Obulus by name, he said, \" 1 myself will listen to what you have to say at the first favourable opportunity.", "1569": "\"So that all those who stood around congratulated usas if we had already carried our point, and so did all those of our own people, who are influenced by superficial appearances.", "1570": "But I myself, who was accounted to be possessed of superior prudence, both on account of my age and my education, and general information, was less sanguine in respect of the matters at which the others were so greatly delighted. \"", "1571": "For why,\" said I, after pondering the matter deeply in my own heart, \" why, when there have been such numbers of ambassadors, who have come, one may almost say, from every corner of the globe, did he say on that occasion that he would hear what we had to say, and no one else ?", "1572": "What could have been his meaning ?", "1573": "for he was not ignorant that we were Jews, who would have been quite content at not being treated worse than the others;", "1574": "but to expect to be looked upon as worthy to receive especial privileges and precedence, by a master who was of a different nation and a young man and an absolute monarch, would have seemed like insanity.", "1575": "But it would seem that he was showing civility to the whole district of the Alexandrians, to which he was thus giving a privilege, when promising to give his decision speedily;", "1576": "unless, indeed, disregarding the character of a fair and impartial hearer, he was intending to be a fellow suitor with our adversaries and an enemy of ours, instead of behaving like a judge.", "1577": "\"XXIX.", "1578": "Having these ideas in my mind, I resisted the sanguine hopes of the others, and had no rest in my mind day or night.", "1579": "But while I was thus giving way to de­ spondency and lamenting over my ignorance of the future (for it was not safe to postpone matters), on a sudden another most grievous and unexpected calamity fell upon us, bringing danger not on one section of the Jews only, but on all the nation together.", "1580": "For we had come from Rome to Dicæarchia attending upon Caius ;", "1581": "and he had gone down to the sea-side and was remaining near the gulf, having left for a while his own palaces, which were numerous and superbly furnished.", "1582": "And while we were anxiously considering his intentions, for we were continually expecting to be sum­ moned, a man arrived, with blood-shot eyes, and looking very much troubled, out of breath and palpitating, and leading us away to a little distance from the rest (for there were several persons near), he said, \" Have you heard the news?\"", "1583": "And then when he was about to tell us what it was he stopped, because of the abundance of tears that rose up to choke his utterance.", "1584": "And beginning again, he was a second and a third time stopped in the same manner.", "1585": "And we, seeing this, were much alarmed and agitated by suspense, and entreated him to tell us what the circumstance was on account of which he said that he had come ;", "1586": "for he could not have come merely to weep before so many witnesses. \"", "1587": "If, then,\" said we, \" you have any real cause for tears, do not keep your grief to yourself;", "1588": "we have been long ago well accustomed to misfortune.", "1589": "\"And he with difficulty, sobbing aloud, and in a broken voice, spoke as follows:", "1590": "\" Our temple is destroyed!", "1591": "Caius has ordered a colossal statue of himself to be erected in the holy of holies, having his own name inscribed upon it with the title of Jupiter!\"", "1592": "And while we were all struck dumb with astonishment and terror at what he had told us, and stood still deprived of all motion (for we stood there mute and in despair, ready to fall to the groud with fear and sorrow, the very muscles of our bodies being deprived of all ' strength by the news which we had heard);", "1593": "others arrived bearing the same sad tale.", "1594": "And then we all retired and shut ourselves up together and bewailed our individual and common miseries, and went through every circumstance that our minds could conceive, for a man in misfortune is a most loquacious animal, wrestling as we might with our misery.", "1595": "And we said to one another, \" We have sailed hither in the middle of winter, in order that we might not be all involved in violation of the law and in misfortunes proceeding from it, without being aware what a winter of misery was await­ ing us on shore, far more grievous than any storm at sea.", "1596": "For of the one nature is the cause, which has divided the seasons of the year and arranged them in due order, but nature is a thing which exerts a saving power;", "1597": "but the other storm is caused by a man who cherishes no ideas such as become a man, but is a young man, and a promoter of all kinds of innovation, being invested with irresponsible power over all the world.\"", "1598": "And youth, when combined with absolute power and yielding to irresistible and unrestrained passion, is an invincible evil.", "1599": "And will it be allowed to us to approach him or to open our mouth on the subject of the synagogues before this insulter of our holy and glorious temple ?", "1600": "For it is quite evident that he will pay no regard whatever to things of less importance and which are held in inferior estimation, when he behaves with insolence and contempt towards our most beautiful and renowned temple, which is respected by all the east and by all the west, and regarded like the sun which shines everywhere.", "1601": "And even if we were allowed free access to him, what else could we expect but an inexorable sentence of death ?", "1602": "But be it so;", "1603": "we will perish, For, indeed, a glorious death in defence of and for the sake of the preservation of our laws, is a kind of life.\"", "1604": "But, indeed, if no advantage is derived from our death, would it not be insanity to perish in addition to what we now have to endure, and this too, while we appear to be ambas­ sadors, so that the calamity appears rather to affect those who have sent us than those who remain ?", "1605": "Not but what those of our fellow countrymen who are by nature most inclined to detest all wickedness, will accuse us of impiety, as if we, in the extremity of dangers, when our whole country was tossed about and threatened, were remembering some private interests of our own out of selfishness.", "1606": "For it is necessary that small things must yield to great ones, and that private objects must yield to the general interests;", "1607": "since, when they are destroyed, there is an end of the con­ stitution and of the nation.", "1608": "For how can it be holy or lawful for us to struggle in any other manner, pointing out that we are citizens of Alexandria, over whom a danger is now impending, that namely, of the utter destruction of the general constitution of the Jewish nation;", "1609": "for in the de­ struction of the temple there is reason to fear that this man, so fond of innovation and willing to dare the most audacious actions, will also order the general name of our whole nation to be abolished.\"", "1610": "If, therefore, both the objects on account of which we were sent are overthrown, perhaps some one will say, What then, did they not know that they had to negotiate for a safe return ?", "1611": "But I would reply to such a man,", "1612": "You either have not the genuine feelings of a nobly born man, or else you were not educated like one, and have never been trained in the knowledge of the sacred scriptures;", "1613": "for men who are truly noble are full of hope, and the laws too implant good hopes in all those who do not study them superficially but with all their hearts.", "1614": "Perhaps these things are meant as a trial of the existing generation to see how they are inclined towards virtue, and whether they have been taught to bear evils with resolute and firm minds, without yielding at the first moment;", "1615": "all human considerations then are discarded, and let them be discarded, but let an imperishable hope and trust in God the Saviour remain in our souls, as he has often preserved our nation amid inextricable difficulties and distresses.\"XXX.", "1616": "These were the sort of things which we said, be­ wailing at the same time our unexpected calamities, and yet also encouraging one another with the hope of a change to a more tranquil and peaceful state of things.", "1617": "And after a little consideration and delay, we said to those who had brought us this doleful news, \" Why sit ye here quietly, having just kindled sparks of eagerness in our ears by which we are set on fire and rendered all in a blaze, when you ought rather to add

"1627": "for having come thither a poor man, and having amassed enormous riches of every imagin­ able description by plunder and extortion, he has now become afraid lest some accusation may be brought against him, and on this account he has contrived a design by which he may repel any such impeachment, namely, by calumni­ ating those whom he has injured;", "1628": "and a circumstance which we will now mention, has given him some pretext for car­ rying out his design.\"", "1629": "There is a city called Jamnia;", "1630": "one of the most populous cities in all Judasa, which is inhabited by a promiscuous multitude, the greatest number of whom are Jews ;", "1631": "but there are also some persons of other tribes from the neigh­ bouring nations who have settled there to their own destruction, who are in a manner sojourners among the original native citizens, and -who cause them a great deal of trouble, and who do them a great deal of injury, as they are continually violating some of the ancestral national customs of the Jews.", "1632": "These men hearing from travellers who visit the city how exceedingly eager and earnest Caius is about is own deification, and how disposed he is to look unfavour­ ably upon the whole race of Judæa, thinking that they have now an admirable opportunity for attacking them them­ selves, have erected an extemporaneous altar of the most contemptible materials, having made clay into bricks for the sole purpose of plotting against their fellow citizens;", "1633": "for they knew well that they would never endure to see their customs transgressed ;", "1634": "as was indeed the case.\"", "1635": "For when the Jews saw what they had done, and were very indignant at the holiness and sanctity and beauty of the sacred place being thus obscured and defaced, they col.", "1636": "lected together and destroyed the altar;", "1637": "so the sojourners immediately went to Capito who was in reality the contriver of the whole affair ;", "1638": "and he, thinking that be had made a most lucky hit, which he had been seeking for a long time, writes to Caius dilating on the matter and exaggerating it enormously;", "1639": "and he, when he had read the letter, ordered a colossal statue gilt all over, much more costly and much more magnificent than the rich altar which had been erected in Jamnia, by way of insult to be set up in the temple of the metropolis, having for his most excellent and sagacious counsellors Helicon, that man of noble birth, a chattering slave, a perfect scum of the earth, and a fellow of the name of Apelles, a tragic actor, who when in the first bloom of youth, as they say, made a market of his beauty, and when he was past the freshness of youth went on the stage;", "1640": "and in fact all those who go on the stage selling themselves to the spectators, and to the theatres, are not lovers of temperance and modesty, but rather of the most extreme shamelessness and indecency.\"", "1641": "On this account Apelles was taken into the rank of a fellow counsellor of the emperor, that Caius might have an adviser with whom he might indulge in mocking jests, and with whom he might sing, passing over all considerations of the general welfare of the state, as if everything in every quarter of the globe was enjoying profound peace and tran­ quillity under the laws.\"", "1642": "Therefore Helicon, this scorpion-like slave, discharged all his Egyptian venom against the Jews;", "1643": "and Apelles his Ascalonite poison, for he was a native of Ascalon;", "1644": "and between the people of Ascalon and the inhabitants of the holy land, the Jews, there is an irreconcileable and never- ending hostility although they are bordering nations.", "1645": "\"When we heard this we were wounded in our souls at every word be said and at every name he mentioned;", "1646": "but those admirable advisers of admirable actions a little while afterwards met with the fit reward of their impiety, the one being bound by Caius with iron chains for other causes, and being put to the torture and to the rack after periods of relief, as is the case with people affected with intermittent diseases;", "1647": "and Helicon was put to death by Claudius Ger­ manicus Cæsar, for other wicked actions, that, like a mad­ man as he was, he had committed;", "1648": "but these occurrences took place at a later date.", "1649": "XXXI.", "1650": "And the letter respecting the erection of the statue was written not in plain terms, but with as much caution and prudence as possible, taking every measure which could tend to security;", "1651": "for he commands Petronius, the lieutenant and governor of all Syria, to whom indeed he wrote the letter, to lead half the army which was on the Euphrates, to guard against any passage of that river by any of the eastern kings or nations, into Judæa as an escort to the statue ;", "1652": "not in order to honour its erection with any especial pomp, but to chastise with death any attempt that might be made to hinder it.", "1653": "What sayest thou, 0 master ?", "1654": "Are you making war upon us, because you anticipate that we will not endure such indignity, but that we will fight on behalf of our laws, and die in defence of our national customs ?", "1655": "For you cannot possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our temple;", "1656": "but having previously learnt with perfect accuracy what was likely to happen as well as if it had already taken place, and knowing the future as thoroughly as if it were actually present, you commanded your general to bring up an army in order that the statue when erected might be consecrated by the first sacrifice offered to it, being of a most polluted kind, stained with the blood of miserable men and women.", "1657": "Accordingly Petronius, when he had read what he was commanded to do in this letter, was in great perplexity, not being able to resist the orders sent to him out of fear, for he heard that the emperor's wrath was implacable not only against those who did not do what they were commanded to do, but who did not do it in a moment;", "1658": "and on the other hand, he did not see how it was easy to perform them, for he knew that the Jews would willingly, if it were possible, endure ten thousand deaths instead of one, rather than submit to see any forbidden thing perpetrated with respect to their religion;", "1659": "for all men are eager to preserve their own customs and laws, and the Jewish nation above all others;", "1660": "for looking upon their laws as oracles directly given to them by God himself, and having been instructed in this doctrine from their very earliest infancy they bear in their souls the images of the commandments contained in these laws as sacred;", "1661": "and secondly, as they continually behold the visible shapes and forms of them, they admire and venerate them in their minds and they admit such foreigners as are disposed to honour and worship them, to do so no less than their own native fellow citizens.", "1662": "But all who attempt to violate their laws, or to turn them into ridicule, they detest as their bitterest enemies, and they look upon each separate one of the commandments with such awe and reverence that, whether one ought to call it the invariable good fortune or the happiness of the nation, they have never been guilty of the violation of even the most insignificant of them;", "1663": "but above all other obser­ vances their zeal for their holy temple is the most predomi­ nant, and vehement, and universal feeling throughout the whole nation;", "1664": "and the greatest proof of this is that death is inexorably pronounced against all those who enter into the inner circuit of the sacred precincts (for they admit all men from every country into the exterior circuit), unless he be one of their own nation by blood.", "1665": "Petronius, having regard to these considerations, was very reluctant to attempt what he was commanded to do, con­ sidering what a great and wicked piece of daring he should be committing, and invoking all the deliberative powers of his soul as to a council, he inquired into the opinion of each of them, and he found every faculty of his mind agreeing that he should change nothing of these observances and customs which had been hallowed from the beginning of the world ;", "1666": "in the first place because of the natural principles of justice and piety by which they were dictated, and secondly because of the danger which threatened any attempt at innovation upon them, not only from God, but also from the people who would be insulted by such conduct.", "1667": "He also gave a thought to the circumstances of the nation itself, to its exceeding populousness, so that it was not contained as every other nation was by the circuit of the one region which was allotted to it for itself, but so that, I may almost say, it had spread over the whole face of the earth ;", "1668": "for it is diffused throughout every continent, and over every island, so that everywhere it appears but little inferior in number to the original native population of the country.", "1669": "Was it not, then, a most perilous undertaking to draw upon himself such innumerable multitudes of enemies ?", "1670": "And was there not danger of allies and friends from all quarters arriving to their assistance ?", "1671": "It would be a result of very formidable danger and difficulty, besides the fact that the inhabitants of Judæa are infinite in numbers, and a nation of great stature and personal strength, and of great courage and spirit, and men who are willing to die in defence of their national customs and laws with unshrinking bravery, so that some of those who calumniate them say that their courage (as indeed is perfectly true) is beyond that of any barbarian nation, being the spirit of free and nobly born men.", "1672": "And the state of all the nations which lie beyond the Euphrates added to his alarm;", "1673": "for he was aware that Baby­ lon and many others of the satrapies of the east were occu­ pied by the Jews, knowing this not merely by report but likewise by personal experience ;", "1674": "for every year sacred mes­ sengers are sent to convey large amounts of gold and silver to the temple, which has been collected from all the subor­ dinate governments, travelling over rugged, and difficult, and almost impassable roads, which they look upon as level and easy inasmuch as they serve to conduct them to piety.", "1675": "Therefore, being exceedingly alarmed, as was very natural, lest if they heard of the unprecedented design of erecting this colossal statue in the temple, they might on a sudden direct their march that way and surround him, some on one side and some on the other, so as to hem him in completely, and co-operating with and joining one another might treat the enemy who would be thus enclosed in the midst of them with terrible severity, he hesitated long, attaching great weight to all these considerations.", "1676": "Then again he was drawn in the opposite direction by considerations of a contrary character, saying to himself, \" This is the command of one who is mv master and a young man, and of one who judges everything which lie wishes to have done to be expedient and becoming, and who is resolved that everything which he has once decided on shall be at once performed even though it may be the most injurious measure possible and full of all contention and insolence;", "1677": "and now having passed beyond all human nature he has actually recorded himself to be God;", "1678": "and great danger of my life impends over me whether I oppose him or whether I comply with his commands;", "1679": "if I comply with them the result will very probably be war, and one that perhaps may be attended with doubtful success and which will be far from turning out as it is expected to do;", "1680": "and if I oppose him I shall then be exposed to the open and implacable hatred of Caius.", "1681": "\"And with this opinion of his, many of those Romans who were joined with him in the administration of the affairs of Syria coincided, knowing that the anger of Caius and the punishments which he would inflict would come upon them first as being accomplices in the disobedience to the injunc­ tions which he had sent;", "1682": "but at last when it arrived the fashion of the statue afforded them a pretext for delay dur­ ing which they might have time for a more deliberate con­ sideration of the matter;", "1683": "for they did not send any man from Rome (as it appears to me because the providence of God overruled the matter in this way, who thus invisibly stayed the hand of these wicked doers), nor did he command the most skilful man or him who was accounted so in Syria.", "1684": "to manage the matter, since while he was pressing on this lawless action with all speed a war was suddenly kindled.", "1685": "Therefore having now opportunity to consider what course would be most advantageous (for when great events sud­ denly come altogether, they break down and perplex the mind), he commanded the statue to be made in some one of the bordering regions.", "1686": "Therefore Petronius, sending for the most skilful and renowned artists in Phoenicia, gave them the materials requisite for the making of the statue;", "1687": "and they took them to Sidon, and there proceeded to make it.", "1688": "He also sent for the magistrates of the Jews and the priests and rulers of the people, both to announce to them the commands which he had received from Caius and also to counsel them to submit cheerfully to the commands which had been imposed by their master, and to give due considera­ tion to the dangers before their eyes ;", "1689": "for that the most war­ like ofthe military powers in Syria were all ready, and would soon cover all the country with dead bodies;", "1690": "for he thought that if he could previously weaken their resolution he would be able by their means to work upon all the rest of the mul­ titude and to persuade them not to oppose the will of the emperor;", "1691": "but, as was natural, he was wholly disappointed in his expectations;", "1692": "for it is said indeed that they were amazed at his first words, and that at first they were utterly over­ whelmed by his announcement of their real danger and misery, and that they stood speechless and poured forth a ceaseless abundance of tears as if from a fountain, tearing their beards and the hair of their head, and saying, \" We who were formerly very fortunate, have now advanced through many events to an exceeding old age that we might at last behold what no one of our ancestors ever saw.", "1693": "With what eyes can we endure to look upon these things ?", "1694": "Let them rather be torn out, and let our miserable lives and our afflicted existence be put an end to, before we behold such an evil as this, such an intolerable spectacle which it is impious to hear of or to conceive.", "1695": "\"XXXII.", "1696": "In this way did they bewail their fate;", "1697": "but when the inhabitants of the holy city and of all the region round about heard of the design which was in agitation, they all arrayed themselves together as if at a concerted signal, their common misery having given them the word, and went forth in a body, and leaving their cities and their villages and their houses empty, they hastened with one accord into Phcenicia, for Petronius happened to be in that country at the moment.", "1698": "And 'when some of the guards of Petronius saw a countless multitude hastening towards them they ran to their general to bring him the news, and to warn him to take precautions, as they expected war;", "1699": "and while they were relating to him what they had seen, he was still without any guards ;", "1700": "and the multitude of the Jews suddenly coming upon him like a cloud, occupied the whole of Phcenicia, and caused great consternation among the Phœnicians who thus beheld the enormous population of the nation;", "1701": "and at first so great an outcry was raised, accom.", "1702": "panied with weeping and beating of the breast, that the very ears of those present could not endure the vastness of the noise;", "1703": "for it did not cease when they ceased, but continued to vibrate even after they were quiet:", "1704": "then there were approaches to the governor, and supplications addressed to him such as the occasion suggested;", "1705": "for calamities are themselves teachers of what should be done in an existing emergency.", "1706": "And the multitude was divided into six companies, one of old men, one of young men, one of boys;", "1707": "and again in their turn one band of aged matrons, one of women in the prime of life, and one of virgins ;", "1708": "and when Petronius appeared at a distance all the ranks, as they had been appointed, fell to the ground, uttering a most doleful howling and lamenta­ tion, mingled with supplications.", "1709": "But when he commanded them to rise up, and to come nearer to him, they would for a long time hardly consent to rise, and scattering abundance of dust upon their heads, and shedding abundance of tears, they put both their hands behind them like captives who are fettered in this way, and thus they approached him.", "1710": "Then the body of the old men, standing before him, addressed him in the following terms :", "1711": "\"", "1712": "We are, as you see, without any arms, but yet as we passed along some persons have accused us as being enemies, but even the very weapons of defence with which nature has provided each individual, namely our hands, we have averted from you, and placed in a position where they can do nothing, offering our bodies freely an easy aim to any one who desires to put us to death.", "1713": "We have brought unto you our wives, and our children, and our whole families, and in your person we will prostrate ourselves before Caius, having left not one single person at home, that you may either preserve us all, or destroy us all together by one general and complete destruc­ tion.", "1714": "Petronius, we are a peaceful nation, both by our natural disposition and by our determined intentions, and the education which has been industriously and carefully instilled into us has taught us this lesson from our very earliest infancy.", "1715": "When Caius assumed the imperial power we were the first people in all Syria to congratulate him, Vitellius at that time being in our city, from whom you received the government as his successor, to whom writings concerning these matters were sent, and the happy news proceeding onwards from our city, where it had been re­ ceived with joy, reached the other cities with similar accept­ ance.", "1716": "Ours was the first temple which received sacrifices for the happy reign of Caius.", "1717": "Did it do so that it might be the first or the only temple to be deprived of its customary modes of worship ?\"", "1718": "We have now left our cities, we have abandoned our houses and our possessions, we will cheerfully contribute to you all our furniture, all our cattle, and all our treasures, everything in short which belongs to us, as a willing booty.", "1719": "We shall think that we are receiving them, not giving them up.", "1720": "We only ask one thing instead of and to counterbalance all of them, namely, that no innovations may take place in respect of our temple, but that it may be kept such as we have received it from our fathers and our forefathers.", "1721": "And if we cannot prevail with you in this, then we offer up our­ selves for destruction, that we may not live to behold a calamity more terrible and grievous than death.", "1722": "We hear that great forces of infantry and cavalry are being prepared by you against us, if we oppose the erection and dedication of this statue.", "1723": "No one is so mad as, when he is a slave, to oppose his master.", "1724": "We willingly and readily submit our­ selves to be put to death;", "1725": "let your troops slay us, let them sacrifice us, let them cut us to pieces unresisting and uncon­ tending, let them treat us with every species of cruelty that conquerers can possibly practise, but what need is there of any army ?", "1726": "We ourselves, admirable priests for the purpose, will begin the sacrifice, bringing to the temple our wives and slaying our wives, bringing our brothers and sisters and becoming fratricides, bringing our sons and our daughters, that innocent and guiltless age, and becoming infanticides.", "1727": "Those who endure tragic calamities must needs make use of tragic language.", "1728": "Then standing in the middle of our victims, having bathed ourselves deeply in the blood of our kinsfolk (for such blood will be the only bath which we shall have wherewith to cleanse ourselves for the journey to the shades below), we will mingle our own blood with it, slaughtering ourselves upon their bodies.", "1729": "And when we are dead, let this commandment be inscribed over us as an epitaph, ' Let not even God blame us, who have had a due regard to both considerations, pious loyalty towards the emperor and the reverential preservation of our established holy laws.'\"", "1730": "And this will be what will be deservedly said of us if we give up our miserable life, holding it in proper contempt.", "1731": "We have heard of a most ancient tradition, which has been handed down throughout Greece by their historians, who have affirmed that the head of the Gorgon had such mighty power, that those who beheld it immediately became stones and rocks.", "1732": "But this appears only to be a fiction and fable, the truth being that great, and unexpected, and wonderful events do often bring after them great disaster ;", "1733": "for instance, the anger of a master causes death, or calamities equivalent to death.\"", "1734": "Do you suppose (may God forbid that any such event should ever take place) that if any of our countrymen were to see this statue being brought into our temple, it would not change them into stones ?", "1735": "Their limbs being all con­ gealed, and their eyes becoming fixed so as not to be capable of motion, and their whole body losing all its natural motions in every one of its united parts arid limbs !", "1736": "We will, how­ ever, now, 0 Petronius, address to you one last and most righteous and just request;", "1737": "we say that you ought not to do what you are commanded, but we entreat you to grant us a respite, and we most earnestly supplicate you to delay a little while till we appoint an embassy, and send it to approach your master, and to convey our entreaties to him.", "1738": "Perhaps in our embassy we may find some argument or other to persuade him, either by bringing before him all the considerations respecting the honour of God, or the preser­ vation of our indestructible and unalterable laws, or by urging upon him that we ought not to be subjected to a worse fate than all the nations even in the very most remote extremities of the earth, who have been allowed to preserve their national customs;", "1739": "with reference to which his grand­ father and great-grandfather came to a righteous decision when they confirmed and set the seal to our customs with all care.", "1740": "Perhaps when he hears these arguments he will be more merciful to us.", "1741": "The intentions of the great do not always continue the same, and those which are adopted in anger are the quickest to change.", "1742": "We have been grievously calumniated.", "1743": "Suffer us to refute the false accusations which have been brought against us.", "1744": "It is hard to be condemned without being heard in our own defence.\"", "1745": "And if we fail to convince him, what will after that pre­ vent him from doing the things which he at present intends to do ?", "1746": "Until, then, we have sent this embassy, do not cut off all the hopes of so many myriads of men, since our zeal and earnestness is displayed not in the cause of gain, but in that of religion;", "1747": "though indeed we speak foolishly in using such an expression as that, for what can be a more real and beneficial gain to men than holiness ?", "1748": "\"XXXIII.", "1749": "They uttered these complaints and entreaties with great agony and misery of soul, with exceeding sobbing and difficulty of speech, for all their limbs sweated with apprehension, and their ceaseless tears flowed in torrents, so that all who heard them, and Petronius himself, sympathised with their sorrow, for he was by nature a man very kind and gentle in his natural disposition, so that he was easily influenced by what was now said or heard;", "1750": "and what was said appeared to be entirely just, and the misery of those whom he now beheld appeared most pitiable;", "1751": "and rising up, and retiring with his fellow counsellors, he took counsel as to what he ought to do, and he saw that those who a short time before opposed the wishes of the Jews with all their might were now wavering and perplexed, and that those who had previously been hesitating were now for the most part inclined to compassion, at which he was pleased.", "1752": "Nevertheless, though he was well acquainted with the disposition of the emperor, and how implacable and inexor­ able he was in his anger, he still had himself some sparks of the Jewish philosophy and piety, since he had long ago learnt something of it by reason of his eagerness for learning, and had studied it still more ever since he had come as governor of the countries in which there are vast numbers of Jews scattered over every city of Asia and Syria;", "1753": "or partly because he was so disposed in his mind from his spontaneous, and natural, and innate inclination for all things which are worthy of care and study.", "1754": "Moreover, God himself appears often to suggest virtuous ideas to virtuous men, by which, while benefiting others, they will likewise be benefited themselves, which now was the case with Petronius.", "1755": "What then was his resolution ?", "1756": "Not to hurry on the artists, but to persuade them to continue to finish the statue which they had in hand, taking pains and labouring as far as might be possible not to be inferior to the most renowned models, but to take plenty of time, so as to make their work perfect, since things which are done in a hurry are very often inferior, but things which are done with great pains and skill require a length of time.", "1757": "But the embassy which they entreated leave to send he determined not to permit, for he considered that it would not be safe for him to allow it;", "1758": "still he deter­ mined not to oppose those who wished to refer the whole matter to the supreme sovereign and master, but neither to agree with nor to contradict the multitude, for he considered that either line of conduct was fraught with danger.", "1759": "Moreover, he determined to write a letter to Caius, not in any respect accusing the Jews, and on the other hand not giving any accurate account of their entreaties and suppli­ cations, and to explain the delay which was taking place in the erection of the statue, partly because the preparation of it required a certain space of time for its completion, and partly, he reminded him, that the season of the year was in some degree the cause of unavoidable delay, in which there was no question but that Caius must of necessity acquiesce, for it was just at the moment the very height of the wheat harvest and of all the other cereal crops;", "1760": "and he said that he was afraid lest out of despair of the preservation of their national and hereditary laws and customs, the men might conceive such a contempt for life as either themselves to lay waste their lands, or to burn all the corn-bearing district, whether mountainous or champaign country, and, therefore, that he might require a guard to secure a careful gathering in of the crops, and that not only of such as were borne on the arable land but of those produced by fruit-bearing trees ;", "1761": "for he himself was intending, as is said, to sail to Alexandria in Egypt, but so great a general did not choose to cross the open sea both by reason of the danger and also of the numerous fleet which would be required as his escort, and also from his regard for his own person, as everything requisite for his comfort would be more easily provided if he took the circui­ tous route through Asia and Syria;", "1762": "for he would, if he coasted along, be able to sail every day and land every night, especially if he took with him a sufficient number of ships of war, and not transports, in which a coasting voyage is more successful, just as one across the open sea is better for merchantmen.", "1763": "Therefore it was necessary that abundant quantities of forage and food should be prepared for his cattle in every one of the Syrian cities, and especially in all such as were on the coast, for a numerous multitude would be proceeding both by land and sea, collected not only from Rome itself and from Italy, but that which had also followed him from all the other provinces of the empire as far as Syria, being partly the regular guard of the magistrates, and partly the regular army of infantry and cavalry, and the naval force, and also a troop of servants but little inferior in number to the army.", "1764": "Moreover, there was need not only of such an abundance of supplies as might be sufficient for all necessary purposes, but also for all the superfluous prodi­ gality of which Caius was fond.", "1765": "If he reads these writings perhaps he will not only not be angry, but will be even pleased with our prudential caution, as having caused this delay not from any regard for the Jews, but for the sake of providing for the collection of the harvest.", "1766": "XXXIV.", "1767": "And when his assessors had delivered their opinions, he commanded letters to be written, and appointed active men, who were accustomed to make rapid journeys, to convey them.", "1768": "And they, when they had arrived at their journey's end, delivered the letters;", "1769": "but the emperor, before he had finished reading them, became swollen with anger, and went on making marks at every page, in fury and indignation;", "1770": "and when he had come to the end of the letter, he clapped his hands together, saying, \" Of a truth, Pe­ tronius, you seem but little to comprehend that you are the subject of the emperor;", "1771": "the uninterrupted series of governments to which you have been preferred have filled you with guile.", "1772": "Up to the present time it seems to me that you have no notion of acknowledging that you know, even by hearsay, that Caius is emperor, but you shall very speedily find it out by your own experience, for you are careful about the laws of the Jews, a nation which I hate above every other, and you are indifferent about the imperial commands of your sovereign.", "1773": "You fear the multitude.", "1774": "Had you not with you then the military forces which all the eastern nations, and the chief of them all, the Parthians, fear ?", "1775": "But you pitied them, you paid more attention to feelings of compassion than to the express commands of Caius.\"", "1776": "Make your pretext of the harvest, but you yourself shall soon find that you have brought on your own head a punish­ ment which cannot be averted by any pretexts or excuses.", "1777": "Blame the necessity for collecting the crops, and for making adequate provision for my armies, for even if a complete scarcity were to oppress Judæa, still are there not vast regions on its borders of great fertility and productiveness, sufficient aDd able to supply all necessary food, and to make up for the deficiency of one district ?", "1778": "But why do I speak in this way before acting ?", "1779": "And why is there no one who anticipates my intentions ?", "1780": "He who delays shall first find out that he is receiving the wages of his delay by suffering in his own person.", "1781": "I will say no more, but I shall not forget the matter.", "1782": "\"And after a brief interval, he dictated to one of his secretaries an answer to Petronius, praising him in appear­ ance for his prudence, and for his careful and accurate consideration of the future, for he was very careful with respect to the governors of the provinces, seeing that they had at all times great facilities for making innovations or revolutions, especially if they happened to be in districts of importance, and in command of powerful armies such as was on the Euphrates for the protection of Syria.", "1783": "Therefore, being very civil to him in words and in his letters, he con­ cealed his anger till a favourable opportunity, though he was very much exasperated;", "1784": "but at the end of the letter, after having mentioned every other subject, he desired him not to be so anxious about anything as about the speedy erection and dedication of the statue, for that by this time the harvest must have been able to be got in, whether the excuse was originally an honest and true or only a plausible one.", "1785": "XXXV.", "1786": "However a short time afterwards King Agrippa arrived in Rome, according to custom, to pay his respects to Caius, and he knew absolutely nothing either of what Petronius had written in his letter, or of what Caius had written in his first or second epistle, but by his irregular motions and agitations, and by the excitement which shone in his eyes, lie conjectured that he had some anger smoulder­ ing beneath, and he considered, and pondered, and turned over every matter in every direction, racking his brain for every reason, whether great or small, to see whether he had said or done anything unbecoming, and when he felt sure that he had done absolutely nothing, he conjectured, as was natural, that it was some one else with whom he was offended.", "1787": "But again, when he saw that he looked morosely at him, and that he kept his eyes continually fixed on him, and on no one else who was ever present, he began to be alarmed, and though he often thought of putting the question to him, he restrained himself, reflecting in this manner:", "1788": "\" Perhaps by doing so I may draw down on myself the threats which as it is are destined for others, by bring­ ing upon myself a suspicion of being a busybody, and a rash and audacious man.", "1789": "\"Therefore, when Caius saw that he was in a state of great alarm and perplexity, for he was very acute at comprehend­ ing a man's inmost designs and feelings from his outward appearance and expression of countenance, he said, \" You arc embarrassed, 0 Agrippa.", "1790": "I will relieve you from your perplexity.", "1791": "Though you have lived with me for such a length of time, are you yet ignorant that I speak not only with my voice, but also with my eyes, intimating everything, to say the least of it, as much in one way as in the other ?", "1792": "Your loyal and excellent fellow citizens, the only nation of men upon the whole face of the earth by whom Caius is not esteemed to be a god,

their people, and quitted the city and the whole country in a (body, under pretence of addressing a petition to me, but in reality being determined to act in a manner contrary to the commands which I had imposed upon them.", "1793": "\"And when he was about to add other charges against them Agrippa fell into such a state of grief that he changed into all sorts of colours, becoming at the same moment bloodshot, and pale, and livid, for he was all over agitation and trembling from the top of his head down to his feet, and a quivering and shaking seized upon and disordered all nis limbs and every member of his body, all his sinews, and muscles, and nerves being relaxed and enfeebled, so that lie fainted away, and would have fallen down if some of the bystanders had not supported him.", "1794": "And they being commanded to carry him home, bore him to his palace, where he lay for some time in a state of torpor without any one understanding what sudden misfortune had brought him into this state.", "1795": "Therefore Caius was exasperated still more against our nation, and cherished a more furious anger against us than before, \" For,\" said he, \" if Agrippa, who is my most intimate and dearest friend, and one bound to me by so many benefits, is so completely under the influence of his national customs that he cannot bear even to hear a word against them, but faints away to such a degree as to be near dying, what must one expect will be the feelings of others who have no motive or influence to draw them the other way ?", "1796": "\"Agrippa, then, during all that day

short time opened, though with difficulty, his languid eyes, and with dim and indistinct vision looked upon the people who surrounded him, though he was not as yet able to distinguish clearly between their several forms and features;", "1798": "and then again relapsing into sleep, he became tranquil, getting into a better condition than at first, as those about him could conjecture from his breathing and from the state of his body.", "1799": "And afterwards, when he awoke again, and rose up, he asked, \" Where now am I ?", "1800": "Am I with Caius ?", "1801": "Is my lord himself here

the islands, on the coasts, and in the inland parts.", "1842": "And it corresponds well to the greatness of your good fortune, that, by conferring benefits on one city, you should also benefit ten thousand others, so that your renown may be celebrated in every part of the habitable world, and many praises of you may be combined with thanksgiving.\"", "1843": "You have thought the native

the number of benefits with which you have enriched me ;", "1846": "so that if I in consequence had felt confidence to implore you myself on behalf of ray country, if not to grant to it the Roman con­ stitution, at least to confer freedom and a remission of taxes on it, I should not have thought that I had any reason to fear your displeasure for preferring such a petition to you, and for requesting

violence, so as to disturb the peaceful condition of the country, but were rather schools of temperance and jus­ tice, as the men who met in them were studiers of virtue, and contributed the first

in no respect inferior to this one, and which is the most undeniable proof of the will of Augustus, for he commanded perfect sacrifices of whole burnt offerings to be offered up to the most high God

equivalent almost to a restoration, since they looked upon it that they had escaped the greatest of all evils, the danger of death.", "2002": "But no long period elapsed brfore he sent some soldiers after them, though no new circumstances had arisen, and put to death simultaneously the most excellent and nobly-born of the exiles who were living in the different islands as their own countries, and' who were bearing their misfortunes in the most contented manner, inflicting in this way the greatest and most pitiable and unexpected misery on many of the noblest families in Rome.", "2003": "And if he ever gave any one a sum of money as a gift, he demanded it back again at some future time, not a simple loan but he also required interest and compound interest, and often treating the persons themselves who had received it from him as thieves, and punishing them with the severest penalties for having stolen it;", "2004": "for he was not contented that those miserable men should return what had been given to them, but he compelled them also to give up all their property which they had inherited from their parents, or relations, or from any friends, or which, having selected a life of industry and profit, they had acquired by their own resources.", "2005": "And those who appeared to be in the greatest credit with him, and who lived with him in a round of pleasure, as one may say, with great appearances of friendship and good will, were greatly injured by him, being compelled to expend large sums in irregular, and illegal, and sudden journeys, and in entertainments;", "2006": "for they lavished whole properties in the preparation of a single banquet, so that they were compelled to have recourse to usurers, so vast was his pro­ digality ;", "2007": "therefore many men deprecated the receiving of any favours from him, thinking not only that it was of no advantage, but even that they were only a bait and a snare to lead them into intolerable suffering.", "2008": "So great therefore was his inequality of temper towards every one, and most especially towards the nation of the Jews to which he was most bitterly hostile, and accordingly beginning in Alexandria he took from them all their syna­ gogues there, and in the other cities, and filled them all with images and statues of his own form;", "2009": "for not caring about any other erection of any kind, he set up his own statue every where by main force;", "2010": "and the great temple in the holy city, which was left untouched to the last, having been thought worthy of all possible respect and preservation, he altered and transformed into a temple of his own, that he might call it the temple of the new Jupiter, the illustrious Caius.", "2011": "What is this that you say ?", "2012": "Do you, who are a man, seek to take to yourself the air and the heaven, not being content with the vast multitude of continents, and islands, and nations, and countries of which you enjoy the sove­ reignty ?", "2013": "And do you not think any one of the gods who are worshipped in that city or by our people worthy of any country or city or even of any small precinct which may have been consecrated to them in old time, and dedicated to them with oracles and sacred hymns, and are you intending to deprive them of that, that in all the vast circumference of the world there may be no visible trace or memorial to be found of any honour or pious worship paid to the true real living God ?", "2014": "Truly you are suggesting fine hopes to the race of mankind;", "2015": "are you ignorant that you are opening the fountains of evils of every kind, making innovations, and committing acts of audacious impiety such as it is wicked to do and even to think of ?XLIV.", "2016": "It is worth while to make mention of what we both saw and heard, when we were sent for to encounter a contest on behalf of our national constitution;", "2017": "for the mo­ ment that we entered into the presence of the emperor we perceived, from his looks and from the state of agitation in which he was, that we had come not before a judge but before an accuser, or rather I should say before the open enemy of those whom he looked upon as opposed to his will ;", "2018": "for it would have been the part of a judge to sit with assessors selected because of their virtue and learning, when a question of the greatest importance was being investigated which had lain dormant for four hundred years, and which was now raised for the first time among many myriads of Alexandrian Jews;", "2019": "and it would have been proper for the contending parties with their advocates to stand on each side of him, and for him to listen to them both in turn;", "2020": "first to the accusation and then in turn to the defence, according to a period measured by water,* and then retiring the judge should deliberate with his assessors as to what he ought publicly to deliver as his sentence on the justice of the case;", "2021": "but what was actually done resembled rather the conduct of an implacable tyrant, exhibiting uncontrolled authority and displeasure and pride.", "2022": "For besides that he in no particular behaved in the man­ ner which I have just been describing as proper, having sent for the managers of two gardens, the Mæcenatian and the Lamian garden, and they are near one another and close to the city, in which he had spent three or four days, for that was the place in which this theatrical spectacle, aimed at the happiness of a whole nation, was intended to be enacted in our presence, he commanded all the outer build­ ings to be opened for him, for that he wished to examine them all.", "2023": "minutely;", "2024": "but we, as soon as we were introduced into his presence, the moment that we saw him, bent to the ground with all imaginable respect and adoration, and saluted him calling him the emperor Augustus;", "2025": "and he replied to us in such a gentle and courteous and humane manner that we not only despaired of attaining our object, but even of pre­ serving our lives;", "2026": "for, said he, \" You are haters of God, inasmuch as you do not think that I am a god, I who am already confessed to be a god by every other nation, but who am refused that appellation by you.\"", "2027": "And then, stretching up his hands to heaven, he uttered an ejacula­ tion which it was impious to hear, much more would it be so to repeat it literally.", "2028": "And immediately all the ambassadors of the opposite portion were filled with all imaginable joy, thinking that their embassy was already successful, on account of the first words uttered by Caius, and so they clapped their hands and danced for joy, and called him by every title which is appli­ cable to any one of the gods.", "2029": "XLV.", "2030": "And while he was triumphing in these super­ human appellations, the sycophant Isidorus, seeing the temper in which he was, said, \" 0 master, you will hate with still juster vehemence these men whom you see before you and their fellow countrymen, if you are made acquainted with I their disaffection and disloyalty towards yourself;", "2031": "for when all other men were offering up sacrifices of thanksgiving for your safety, these men alone refused to offer any sacrifice at all;", "2032": "and when I say, ' these men,' I comprehend all the rest of the Jews.\"", "2033": "And when we all cried out with one accord, \" 0 Lord Caius, we are falsely accused;", "2034": "for we did sacrifice, and we offered up entire hecatombs, the blood of which we poured in a libation upon the altar, and the flesh we did not carry to our homes to make a feast and banquet upon it, as it is the custom of some people to do, but we committed the victims entire to the sacred flame as a burnt offering:", "2035": "and we have done this three times already, and not once only;", "2036": "on the first occasion when you succeeded to the empire, and the second time when you recovered from that terrible disease with which all the habitable world was afflicted at the same time, and the third time we sacrificed in hope of your victory over the Germans.", "2037": "\"\"Grant,\" said be, \"that all this is true, and that you did sacrifice;", "2038": "nevertheless you sacrificed to another god, and not for my sake;", "2039": "and then what good did you do me ?", "2040": "Moreover you did not sacrifice to me.\"", "2041": "Immediately a pro­ found shuddering came upon us the first moment that we heard this expression, similar to that which overwhelmed us when we first came into his presence.", "2042": "And while he was saying this he entered into the outer buildings, examining the chambers of the men and the chambers of the women, and the rooms on the ground floor, and all the apartments in the upper story, and blaming some points of their prepa­ ration as defective, and planning alterations and suggesting designs, and giving orders himself to make them more costly and then we being driven about in this way followed him up and down through the whole place, being mocked and ridiculed by our adversaries like people at a play in the theatre;", "2043": "for indeed the whole matter was a kind of farce:", "2044": "the judge assumed the part of an accuser, and the accusers the part of an unjust judge, who look upon the defendants with an eye of hostility, and act in accordance with the nature of truth.", "2045": "And when a judge invested with such mighty power begins to reproach the person who is on his trial before him it is necessary to be silent;", "2046": "for it is possible even to defend one's self in silence, and especially for people who are able to make no reply on any of the subjects which he was now investigating and desiring to understand, inasmuch as our laws and our customs restrained our tongues, and shut and sewed up our mouths.", "2047": "But when he had given some of his orders about the buildings, he then asked a very important and solemn ques­ tion;", "2048": "\"why is it that you abstain from eating pig's flesh?\"", "2049": "And then again at this question such a violent laughter was raised by our adversaries, partly because they were really delighted, and partly as they wished to court the emperor out of flattery, and therefore wished to make it appear that this question was dictated by wit and uttered with grace, that some of the servants who were following him were indignant at their appearing to treat the emperor with so little respect, since it was not safe for his most intimate ffriends to do so much as smile at his words.", "2050": "And when we made answer that, \" different nations have different laws, and there are some things of which the use is forbidden both to us and to our adversaries;", "2051": "\" and when some one said, \" there are also many people who do not eat lamb's flesh which is the most tender of all meat,\" he laughed and said, \" they are quite right, for it is not nice.\"", "2052": "Being joked with and trifled with and ridiculed in this manner, we were in great perplexity ;", "2053": "and at last he said in a rapid and peremptory manner, \" I desire to know what principles of justice you recognise with regard to your constitution.", "2054": "\"And when we began to reply to him and to explain it, he, as soon as he had a taste of our pleading on the principles of justice, and as soon as he perceived that our arguments were not contemptible, before we could bring forward the more important things which we had to say, cut us short and ran forward and burst into the principal building, and as soon as he had entered he commanded the windows which were around it to be filled up with the transparent pebbles very much resembling white crystal which do not hinder the light, but which keep out the wind and the heat of the sun.", "2055": "Then proceeding on deliberately he asked in a more moderate tone, \" What are you saying?\"", "2056": "And when we began to connect our reply with what we had said before, lie again ran on and went into another house, in which he had commanded some ancient and admirable pictures to be placed.", "2057": "But when our pleadings on behalf of justice were thus broken up, and cut short, and interrupted, and crushed as one may almost say, we, being wearied and exhausted, and having no strength left in us, but being in continual expect­ ation of nothing else than death, could no longer keep our hearts as they had been, but in our agony we took refuge in supplications to the one true God, praying him to check the wrath of this falsely called god.", "2058": "And he took compas­ sion on us, and turned his mind to pity.", "2059": "And he becoming pacified merely said, \" These men do not appear to me to be wicked so much as unfortunate and foolish, in not believing that I have been endowed with the nature of God;", "2060": "\" and so he dismissed us, and commanded us to depart.", "2061": "XLVI.", "2062": "Having then escaped from what was rather a theatre and a prison than a court of justice (for as in a theatre, there was a great noise of people hissing, and groaning, and ridiculing us in an extravagant manner, and as in a prison, there were many blows inflicted on our bodies, and tortures, and things to agitate our whole souls by the blasphemies which those around us uttered against the Deity, and the threats which they breathed forth against ourselves, and which the emperor himself poured forth with such vehemence, being indignant with us not in behalf of any one else, for in that case he would soon have been appeased, but because of himself and his great desire to beJ declared a god, in which desire he considered that the Jews were the only people who did not acquiesce, and who were unable to subscribe to it), we at last recovered our breath, not because we had been afraid of death from a base hankering after life, since we would have cheerfully embraced death as immortality if our laws and customs could have been established by such means, but because we knew that we should be destroyed with great ignominy, without any desirable object being secured by such means, for whatever insults ambassadors are subjected to are at all times referred to those who sent them.", "2063": "It was owing to these considerations that we were able to hold up our heads for a while, but there were other circum­ stances which terrified us, and kept us in great perplexity and distress to hear what the emperor would decide, and what he would pronounce, and what kind of sentence he would ultimately deliver;", "2064": "for he heard the general tenor of our arguments, though he disdained to attend to some of our facts.", "2065": "But would it not be a terrible thing for the-interests of all the Jews throughout the whole world to be thrown into confusion by the treatment to which we, its five embas­ sadors, were exposed ?", "2066": "For if he were to give us up to our enemies, what other city could enjoy tranquillity ?", "2067": "What city would there be in which the citizens would not attack the Jews living in it?", "2068": "What synagogue would be left uninjured ?", "2069": "What state would not overturn every principle of justice in respect of those of their countrymen who arrayed themselves in opposition to the national laws and customs of the Jews ?", "2070": "They will be overthrown, they will be shipwrecked, they will be sent to the bottom, with all the particular laws of the nation, and those too which are common to all and in accordance with the principles of justice recognized in every city.", "2071": "We, then, being overwhelmed with affliction, in our misery perplexed ourselves with such reasonings as these;", "2072": "for even those who up to this time had seemed to co-operate with us were now wearied of taking our part.", "2073": "Therefore, when we called them forth, they being within, did not remain, but came forth privily in fear, knowing well the desire which the emperor had to be looked upon as God.", "2074": "We have now related in a concise and summary manner the cause of the hatred of Cams to the

"A multitude of masters is not good, Let there one sovereign be, one king of all,\" t is not more appropriate to be said with respect to cities and men than to the world and God, for it follows inevitably that there must be one Creator and Master of one world;", "2079": "and this position having been laid down and conceded as a preliminary, it is only consistent with sense to connect with it what follows from it of necessity.", "2080": "Let us now, therefore, consider what inferences these are.", "2081": "God being one being, has two supreme powers of the greatest importance.", "2082": "By means of these powers the incor­ poreal world, appreciable only by the intellect, was put together, which is the archetypal model of this world which is visible to us, being formed in such a manner as to be perceptible to our invisible conceptions just as the other is to our eyes.", "2083": "Therefore some persons, marvelling at the nature of both these worlds, have not only worshipped them in their entirety as gods, but have also deified the most beautiful parts of them, I mean for instance the sun, and the moon, and the whole heaven, which, without any fear or reverence, they called gods.", "2084": "And Moses, perceiving the ideas which they entertained, says, \" O Lord, King of all gods,\"* in order to point out the great superiority of the Ruler to his subjects.", "2085": "And the original founder of the Jewish nation was a Chaldæan by birth, being the son of a father who was much devoted to the study of astronomy, and being among people who were great studiers of mathematical science, who think the stars, and the whole heaven, and the whole world gods;", "2086": "and they say that both good and evil result from their speculations and belief, since they do not believe in anything as a cause which is apart from those things which are visible to the outward senses.", "2087": "But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than the notion of causes in general being secondary and created causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is unable to apprehend ?", "2088": "but this founder of the Jewish nation having conceived an idea of him in his mind, and looking upon him as the true God, forsook his native country and his family, and his father's house, knowing that if he remained, the deceits of the polytheistic doctrine also re­ maining in his soul would render his intellect incapable of discovering the nature of the one God, who is alone ever­ lasting, and the father of everything else, whether appre­ ciable only by the intellect or perceptible to the outward senses;", "2089": "but if he departed and emigrated, then he saw that deceit would also depart from his mind, which would then change its erroneous opinions into truth.", "2090": "And at the same time the oracular commands of God, which had been given to him, did further excite the desire which he felt to become acquainted with the living God.", "2091": "And he went forth like a man under the immediate guidance of others, with the most unhesitating promptness, to search after the knowledge of the one God;", "2092": "and he did not relax in his search till he had arrived at a more accurate and correct perception, not indeed of his essences (for that is impossible), but of his existence and of his providence;", "2093": "on which account he is the first man of whom it is said that he believed in God, since he was the first who had an accurate and positive notion of him, believing that there is one supreme cause of all things, which by his providence takes care of the world and of all things that are therein.", "2094": "Since the Creator of the world bringing an essence pre­ viously without any order and in complete confusion, into distinct order and regularity, began to arrange and adorn the earth and the water, and established them in the middle of the world, and the trees, and air, and fire he drew up from the middle to the higher regions, and he fixed the regions of the sether all around, placing it as a boundary to and a pre­ server of the things which were inside, from which also it derived its name of heaven.*", "2095": "And these things, then, were the perfect seeds of the whole universe, but the great and all productive tree raised from this seed is this world, of which the aforesaid branches are the offshoots.", "2096": "II.", "2097": "Where, then, God placed the roots, and what founda­ tion it has upon which it is so firmly fixed like a statue, we must now consider.", "2098": "It is not natural that any body which is left behind should wander out of its limits, since God has made and arranged in its proper place, the materials of the whole universe.", "2099": "For it was fitting that the greatest of all works, being also the most perfect, should be created by the greatest of all workmen.", "2100": "And it would not have been com­ pletely perfect if it had not been completed in perfect parts.", "2101": "So that if this world consists of every kind of material, nothing being beyond, and not even the most insignificant thing being omitted, it follows of necessity that whatever is outside the world must either be vacuum or nothing at all.", "2102": "If it be a vacuum, then how can it be found to balance the world, which is full and closely packed, and the heaviest of all things, when there is nothing solid to support it P from which consideration it would appear to resemble a vision.", "2103": "Since the mind is always looking for a corporeal basis, it is natural to suppose that one whole should have such a thing if it happens to be put in motion, and the world above all things, inasmuch as it is the greatest of bodies, and as it embraces in its bosom a multitude of other bodies as its own appropriate parts.", "2104": "Therefore, if any one wishes to escape the perplexities which arise in treating of doubtful matters, let him speak his mind freely, and affirm that there is no material so strong as to be able to support the weight of the world.", "2105": "But the eternal law of the ever­ lasting God is the strong and lasting support of the universe.", "2106": "This law being extended from the centre of the world to its furthest extremities, and again back from its extremities to the centre, moves on in the unwearied irresistible course of nature, uniting and binding together all the parts of the universe.", "2107": "For the Father who established it made it to be the indissoluble bond of the universe.", "2108": "Therefore we are naturally led to conclude that the whole earth will not be dissolved by water, which its bosoms con­ tain ;", "2109": "nor again will fire be extinguished by the air, nor again will the air be burnt up and consumed by fire, since the divine law has placed itself as a boundary to keep all these elements distinct from one another.", "2110": "As yet the all­ productive plant was not rooted, and had not the power which was to be derived from being rooted.", "2111": "But of the subordinate, particular, and less important plants, some were moveable in such a way as easily to change their places, and some, without being liable to any change of places, were made as if they were to stand for ever in the same position.", "2112": "Those therefore which are exposed to a motion which involves a change of place, which we call animals, were added to the most entire and perfect parts of the universe.", "2113": "The earth receiving the terrestrial animals, the water the aquatic animals;", "2114": "the air those creatures which fly;", "2115": "and the stars being assigned to the heaven.", "2116": "III.", "2117": "But the Creator created two different kinds both in the earth, and in the water, and in the air.", "2118": "In the air he placed those animals which fly, and other powers also which cannot by any means, or on any occasion, be comprehended by the outward senses.", "2119": "Thus the company of incorporeal souls is arranged in regular order according to their nature.", "2120": "For it is said that some of them are separated off and assigned to mortal bodies, and that, at certain definite and predetermined periods, they again depart from them.", "2121": "But that others of a more divine nature are utterly regardless of any situation on earth, but are raised to a great height, and placed in the æther itself, being of the purest possible character, which those among the Greeks who have studied philosophy call heroes and dæmones, and which Moses, giving them a most felicitous appellation, calls angels, acting as they do the part of ambassadors and messengers, an­ nouncing to the subjects all kinds of blessings from their rulers, and acting as servants to the king to whom they are subject;", "2122": "and they, descending into the body as into a river, at one time are carried away by the violence of a most irre­ sistible current and swallowed up, and at other times, being wholly unable to resist the powers of destruction, at first, indeed, raise their heads above the flood, and afterwards sink down again to the place from whence they have started.", "2123": "These, then, are the souls of those who devote themselves to the vigorous study of philosophy respecting divine sub­ jects, from the beginning to the end of their existence studying things which may concern them after the life has left the body, that thus they may enjoy an incorporeal and endless life in the presence of the uncreated and im­ mortal God.", "2124": "But those souls of other men which I have spoken of as being overwhelmed, being such as have disre­ garded wisdom, giving themselves up to uncertain circum­ stances, such as depend wholly on chance, of which none have any reference to the soul or to the intellect, but all to the body, which is but a corpse to which we are joined, or to other things even more inanimate and insensible than that;", "2125": "I mean such things as glory, and riches, and power, and honour, and all such other things as through the de­ ceitfulness of false opinions are looked upon as real and living objects by people who do not see what is really beautiful.", "2126": "Therefore, if you look upon souls, and dæmones, and angels, as things differing indeed in name, but as meaning in reality one and the same thing, you will thus get rid of the heaviest of all evils, superstition.", "2127": "For as people in general speak of good dæmones and bad dæmones, in the same manner also do they speak of good and bad souls;", "2128": "and so they speak of some angels as being by their title worthy ambassadors from men to God, and from God to men, being sacred and in­ violable guardians on account of their blameless and most excellent service which they have allotted to them.", "2129": "And, again, if you look upon others as unholy and unworthy of any such appellation, you will not err.", "2130": "And the Psalmist himself is a witness in favour of what I have here asserted, where he speaks as follows:", "2131": "\" He sent among them the anger of his wrath, by the operation of evil angels.", "2132": "\"", "2133": "*Again, all animals that swim and zoophytes are allotted to the water, and all terrestrial animals and plants to the land.", "2134": "And the plants he placed with their heads downwards, fixing their heads in the deepest parts of the earth ;", "2135": "but the heads of the irrational animals he dragged up from the earth and placed upon a lofty neck, placing the fore-feet beneath them as a kind of pedestal.", "2136": "But man has had a separate forma­ tion of a higher character;", "2137": "for in the case of other animals, God has placed their eyes in the side of their heads and bent them down to the ground, on which account they are all inclined downwards to the earth.", "2138": "But the eyes of man, on the other hand, he has raised up, that he might behold the heavens, being not a terrestrial but a celestial plant, as the old saying is.", "2139": "tBut the other class, who affirm that our intellect is a portion of ethereal nature, connect man in a relationship with the air.", "2140": "Accordingly, the great Moses has not spoken of the rational soul as it resembled in its species any created thing, but he has called it the image of the divine and invi­ sible God, looking upon it to be a glorious and carefully wrought image, the seal of God, the character of which is the everlasting Word ;", "2141": "for, says he, \" God breathed into his face the breath of life.\"*",

God, and not in the likeness of any created thing.", "2144": "IV.", "2145": "But, taking up our discourse again at the beginning for the sake of clearness, let us say that of bodies some have put on habit, and others nature, and others soul, and others a rational soul.", "2146": "Therefore those stocks and stones which are torn from any intimate connection, have made for themselves that strongest of all forms, namely habit, and that is a breath returning constantly to itself;", "2147": "for it begins at the centre and extends to the furthest ex­ tremities, and when it has touched the outermost circum­ ference it turns back again until it arrives at the same place from which it originally started.", "2148": "This is the continued course of habit over which it runs and returns.", "2149": "And he has allotted a nature of their own to plants, having combined it of many powers, especially the nutritious and the generative power.", "2150": "And the Creator has made the soul different from nature in three particulars—the outward sense, and fancy, and impulse.", "2151": "Now plants have no participation in any of these things, but every living animal has a share in all of them.", "2152": "Therefore the outward sense, as its very name in my opinion shows, is a certain imposition which represents to the intellect the things which have appeared to it.", "2153": "And it represents to the fancy a sort of outline in the soul, being, as it were, a kind of representation of light;", "2154": "for those things which each of the outward senses has introduced, like a ring as it were or a seal, it impresses on them its own character, or else it preserves the impression which has been made until the rival of memory, forgetfulness, having softened the impression, at least makes it very dim, or else entirely effaces it;", "2155": "and what has appeared to have been impressed upon it disposes the soul at one time as if it belonged to it, and at another time as if it belonged to some other:", "2156": "and this feeling is called impulse, which those who have at­ tempted to give accurate definitions have called the primary motion of the soul.", "2157": "V.", "2158": "In such important particulars are animals superior to plants.", "2159": "Let us now therefore see in what man is superior to the other animals.", "2160": "He now has received as an especial and pre-eminent honour, the gift of intellect, by which he is accustomed to comprehend the natures of all things, whether they be bodies or things;", "2161": "for as the predominant part in the body is the sight, and as the nature of light is the most important part of the universe, so in the same manner the most important and influential of all the parts in us is the mind;", "2162": "for this is the light of the soul, being irradiated and enlightened by its own beams, by which that dense and pro­ found darkness, ignorance of facts which was shed around it, is dissipated.", "2163": "And this portion of the soul is not composed of the same elements as those of which the other parts are made, but it has a pure and more excellent essence, from which the divine natures were made;", "2164": "on which account the intellect alone, of all the parts within us, appears very reasonably and naturally to be imperishable, for that is the only portion which the Father who generated it has thought worthy of freedom, and loosing the bands of necessity, he has allowed it to roam at large without restraint, having endowed it with a share of his own most glorious and becoming attribute, free-will, the highest present

of his own nature, and exerting his energies in accordance with his own deliberate purpose, is very properly subject to blame for whatever unjust actions he commits from deliberate intention, and to praise for all the good deeds which he intentionally performs ;", "2167": "for as he has received from God a power of voluntary motion, and as he is in this respect like unto God himself, being delivered from all subservience to that most severe and grievous mistress, necessity, he very properly is open to accusa­ tion when he does not pay worship to that being who has thus delivered him.",

what is invisible.", "2170": "Since, therefore, it would be impossible to behold the attraction of the intellect towards the living God, excepting as far as those who are attracted towards him can them­ selves perceive it, for each man in an individual and especial degree knows what happens to himself, he has made a visible image of the invisible eye, namely, the eyes of the body which are thus able to look towards the sky.", "2171": "For when the eyes, which are made of perishable materials, have gone to such heights as even to soar upwards to the heaven which is removed to such an immense distance from the regions of the earth, and to touch its borders, to how great a distance must we not suppose that the eyes of the soul can reach ?", "2172": "which, being excited by a vehement desire to see the one Being clearly and distinctly, stretch forward not only to the furthest extremity of the sky, but, leaving beneath them the boundaries of the universal world, hasten onwards to the uncreated.", "2173": "VI.", "2174": "Having now, therefore, gone through the whole question of the more important plants in the world, let us see in what manner also the all-wise God has fashioned the trees which exist in man, that lesser world.", "2175": "Therefore im­ mediately having taken our body as a region of fertile soil, he has made in it the outward senses as so many channels ;", "2176":

school, leave the generation and also the destructibility of the world;", "2205": "but they do not all do so in the same manner.", "2206": "For some give a sketch of many worlds, the creation of which they attribute to the concourse and conflicting combination of atoms, and their destruc­ tion they attribute to the repercussion and shattering of what has been thus formed.", "2207": "But the Stoics affirm that there is one world, and that God is the cause of its creation, but that God is not the cause of its destruction;", "2208": "but that the power which is contained in existing things, in the long periods of never-ending time, attracts everything to itself, from which again a regeneration of the world is caused by the prudence of the Creator.", "2209": "But Aristotle pronounced the world to be both uncreated and imperishable, and he affirmed that those who maintained a contrary doctrine were guilty of terrible impiety, as they con­ sidered that so great a work of God was in no respect

have existed in any other manner than that in which it actually does exist as has been described, or else because it is in its creation and change that the parts are seen.", "2212": "But the fore mentioned opinion is better and truer, not only because throughout the whole treatise he affirms that the Creator of the gods is also the father and creator and maker of everything, and that the world is a most beautiful work of his and his offspring, being an imita­ tion visible to the outward senses of an archetypal model appreciable only by the intellect, comprehending in itself as many objects of the outward senses as the model does objects of the intellect, since it is a most perfect impression of a most perfect model, and is addressed to the outward sense as the other is to the intellect.", "2213": "But also because Aristotle bears witness to this fact in the case of Plato, who, from his great reverence for philosophy, would never have spoken falsely.", "2214": "But some

unsurpassable power, influences all its parts, and is not itself influenced or moved by any one of them;", "2239": "in the second place because, since there are two causes of corruption, the one being internal and the other external, those things which are competent to admit the one must also by all means be liable to the other;", "2240": "and a proof of this may be found in oxen, and horses, and

inevitably belong to everything which is un­ born ;", "2254": "since the poet who wrote the following iambic verse, \" All that is born must surely die,\" * appears to have spoken very correctly when

is seen.", "2359": "And the flame occupies the middle position between the coal and the light;", "2360": "for when it is extin­ guished it ends in coal, and when it is kindled it excites the light, which, being deprived of its burning power, blazes.", "2361": "If therefore, we affirm that the world is dissolved by conflagration, it would not be coal, because, in that case there will be a great deal of the earthy substance left behind, in which also fire must necessarily be contained.", "2362": "But we must agree, that none of the other bodies subsist any longer, but that earth, and water,

"2376": "since there is an odd there must inevitably be an even ;", "2377": "since there is a sweet there must be a bitter ;", "2378": "since there is day there must be night ;", "2379": "and so on in an infinite number of similar cases;", "2380": "but if a conflagra­ tion should take place, then something would ensue which is impossible;", "2381": "for then, of things in a pair, the one will happen and the other will not.", "2382": "Come, now, let us consider the matter thus:", "2383": "if everything is resolved into fire, there is then something light, and rare, and warm;", "2384": "for all these are the especial properties of fire;", "2385": "but there can be nothing heavy, or cold, or thick, which are the opposites of the qualities which I have just enumerated.", "2386": "How then can any one more completely overturn the idea of the universal disorder which would be involved in such a confla­ gration than by showing that those things which by a law of nature must exist together, are by this process separated from their natural conjunction?", "2387": "And the separation has extended to such a degree, that those who maintain this doctrine attri­ bute eternal durability to the one and deny any existence at all to the other.", "2388": "Again, there is this assertion made by some of those who diligently employ themselves in investigating truth which appears to me to be a sufficiently felicitous one ;", "2389": "if the world is destroyed it will either be destroyed by some other efficient cause, or by God;", "2390": "now there is certainly nothing else whatever from which it can receive its destruction, for there is nothing whatever which it does not surround and contain ;", "2391": "but that which is surrounded and confined within something else is manifestly inferior in power to that which surrounds and confines it, by which it is therefore mastered;", "2392": "on the other hand, to say that it is destroyed by God is the most impious of all possible assertions;", "2393": "for God is the cause not of disorder, and irregularity, and destruction, but of order, and beautiful regularity, and life, and of every good thiug, as is confessed by all those whose opinions are based on truth.", "2394": "XVII.", "2395": "But some of those persons who have fancied that the world is everlasting, inventing a variety of new arguments, employ also such a system of reasoning as this to establish their point:", "2396": "they affirm that there are four principal manners in which corruption is brought about, addition, taking away, transposition, and alteration;", "2397": "accordingly, the number two is by the addition of the unit corrupted so as to become the number three, and no longer remains the number two;", "2398": "and the number four by the taking away of the unit is corrupted so as to become the number three ;", "2399": "again, by transposition the letter Z becomes the letter H when the parallel lines which were previously horizontal are placed perpendicularly II, and when the line which did before pass upwards I, so as to connect the two is now made horizontal, and still extended between them so as to join them.", "2400": "And by alteration the word οἶνος, wine, becomes ὄξος, vinegar.", "2401": "But of the manner of corruption thus mentioned there is not one which is in the least degree whatever applicable to the world, since otherwise what could we say?", "2402": "Could we affirm that anything is added to the world so as to cause its destruc­ tion ?", "2403": "But there is nothing whatever outside of the world which, is not a portion of it as the whole, for everything is surrounded, and contained, and mastered by it.", "2404": "Again, can we say that anything is taken from the world so as to have that effect ?", "2405": "In the first place that which would be taken away would again be a world of smaller dimensions than the existing one, and in the second place it is impossible that any body could be separated from the composite fabric of the whole world so as to be completely dispersed.", "2406": "Again, are we to say that the constituent parts of the world are transposed ?", "2407": "But at all events they remain in their original positions without any change of place, for never at any time shall the whole earth be raised up above the water, nor the water above the air, nor the air above the fire.", "2408": "But those things which are by nature heavy, namely the earth and the water, will have the middle place, the earth supporting everything like a solid foundation, and the water being above it;", "2409": "and the air and the fire, which are by nature light, will have the higher position, but not equally, for the air is the vehicle of the fire ;", "2410": "and that which is carried by anything is of necessity above that which carries it.", "2411": "Once more:", "2412": "we must not imagine that the world is de­ stroyed by alteration, for the change of any elements is equi­ pollent, and that which is equipollent is the cause of unvarying steadiness, and of untroubled durability, inasmuch as it neither seeks any advantage itself, and is not subject to the inroads of other things which seek advantages at its expense ;", "2413": "so that this retribution and compensation of these powers is equalized by the rules of proportion, being the produce of health and endless preservation, by all which considerations the world is demonstrated to be eternal.", "2414": "XVIII.", "2415": "Theophrastus, moreover, says that those men who attribute a beginning and destructibility to the world are deceived by four particulars of the greatest importance, the inequalities of the earth, the retreat of the sea, the dissolution of each of the parts of the universe, and the destruction of different terrestrial animals in their kinds;", "2416": "and he proceeds to establish the first point thus:", "2417": "if the earth had never had any beginning of its creation, then there would have been no portion of it rising above the rest so as to be conspicuous, but all the mountains would have been level, and all the pieces of rising ground would have been even with the plain.", "2418": "For as there are such vast showers falling from heaven throughout all ages, it would be natural that of any places which were originally raised on high some would be broken down and washed away by torrents, and others would subside of their own accord and so become lowered, and that every place everywhere would be smoothed ;", "2419": "but now, as things are, the constant inequalities which exist, and the vast heights of many mountains, reaching up even to the sky, are so many proofs that the earth is not eternal.", "2420": "For otherwise, as I have said before, all the earth would long since have been rendered level from one extremity to the other by the vast rains which would have fallen from the eternal commencement of time;", "2421": "for it is the character of the nature of water, and especially of such as descends in a heavy fall from lofty places, to push some things away by force, and to cut out and hollow other places by its continual dropping.", "2422": "and in this manner to operate on the hard, rugged, stony ground not less than men digging.", "2423": "And again, the sea, as they affirm, is already somewhat diminished, and for proof of this fact we can appeal to the most celebrated islands, Rhodes and Delos, for these were in ancient times invisible, being overwhelmed by and sunk under the sea, but by lapse of time, as the sea gradually diminished, they by slow degrees rose above it and came into sight, as the histories which are written concerning them record.", "2424": "And they used to call Delos Anaphe, confirming the account here given by both names, since when it appeared above the waters * it became evident,!", "2425": "having been formerly invisible and unseen.", "2426": "And in addition to these arguments they adduce the facts that many great and deep bays and gulfs of vast seas have been dried up, and have become land, and have so turned out no insignificant addition to the adjacent country when sown and planted, and on that soil there is still left plenty of proof of such spots having formerly been sea, in the pebbles, and shells, and other things which are commonly washed up on the sea-shore being found in them.", "2427": "But if the sea is gradually being diminished then the earth also will be diminished;", "2428": "and in long revolutions of years every one of the elements will be entirely consumed and destroyed;", "2429": "and the whole air will be consumed, being diminished by little and little ;", "2430": "and all things will be absorbed and dissolved into the one substance of fire.", "2431": "And for the purpose of establishing the third alter­ native of this question they use the following argument:", "2432": "beyond all question that thing is destroyed all the parts of which are liable to destruction;", "2433": "but all the parts of the world are liable to destruction, therefore the world also is liable to destruction.", "2434": "But we must now proceed to consider the question which we postponed till the present time.", "2435": "What sort of a part of the earth is that, that we may begin from this, whether it is greater or less, that is not dissolved by time ?", "2436": "Do not the very hardest and strongest stones become hard and de­ cayed through the weakness of their conformation (and this conformation is a sort of course of a highly strained spirit, a bond not indissoluble, but only very difficult to unloose), in consequence of which they are broken up aud made fluid, so that they are dissolved first of all into a thin dust, and after­ wards are wholly wasted away and destroyed?", "2437": "Again, if the water were never agitated by the winds, but were left immoye­ able for ever, would it not from inaction and tranquillity become dead ?", "2438": "at all events it is changed by such stagnation, and becomes very foetid and foul-smelling, like an animal deprived of life.", "2439": "And so also the corruptions of the air are plain to everyone, for it is the nature of the atmosphere to become sick and to decay, and, as one may say, in a manner to die ;", "2440": "since what else is it which a man, who is not aiming at select­ ing plausible language, but only at truth, would call a plague except a death of the atmosphere, which diffuses its own disease and suffering to the destructiou of everything which is endowed with life ?", "2441": "And why need I speak at great length concerning fire ?", "2442": "for if it is deprived of nourishment it is immediately extinguished.", "2443": "If then, each of the separate parts of the world awaits utter destruction, it is plain that the world which is compounded of these can not be itself exempt from destruction.", "2444": "We must now consider with accuracy the fourth and remain­ ing argument.", "2445": "Thus they argue:", "2446": "if the world were eternal then the animals also would be eternal, and much more the human race, in proportion as that is more excellent than the other animals ;", "2447": "but, on the contrary, those who take delight in inves­ tigating the mysteries of nature consider that man has only been created in the late ages of the world;", "2448": "for it is likely, or I should rather say it is inevitably true, that the arts co-exist with man, so as to be exactly co-eval with him, not only because methodical proceedings are appropriate to a rational nature, but also because it is not possible to live without them ;", "2449": "let us therefore examine the dates of each of these, disregarding the fables invented by the tragedians about the gods;", "2450": "but if man is not eternal then neither is any other animal, so that then neither are the places which receive them, the earth, or the water, or the air;", "2451": "from all which considerations it is plain that this world is liable to destruction.", "2452": "XIX.", "2453": "But it is necessary to encounter such quibbling arguments as these, lest some persons of too little experience should yield to and be led away by them;", "2454": "and we must begin our refutation of them from the same point from which the Sophists begin their deceit.", "2455": "They say, \"", "2456": "There could no longer be any inequalities existing on the earth, if the world were eternal.\"", "2457": "Why not, my most excellent friends?", "2458": "For other persons will come up and say that the natures of trees are in no respect different from mountains;", "2459": "but just as they at certain seasons lose their leaves, and again at certain seasons recover their verdure again;", "2460": "(on which account there is admi­ rable truth in those lines of the poet ;", "2461": "­ \"Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;", "2462": "Another race the following spring supplies ;", "2463": "They fall successive and successive rise.\") *", "2464": "And so in like manner some portions of the mountains are broken off, and others grow in their stead :", "2465": "but after a long lapse of time the additional growth becomes conspicuous, because the trees having a more rapid nature display their increase with great rapidity;", "2466": "but mountains have a slower character, on which account it happens that the additions which take place in their case are not perceptible by the outward senses except after a long time.", "2467": "And these men appear to be ignorant of the manner in which they are produced, since if they had not been, perhaps they would have been silent out of shame ;", "2468": "but still there is no reason why we should not teach them;", "2469": "but there is nothing new in what is now said, neither are they our words but the ancient sayings of wise men, by whom nothing which was necessary for knowledge has been left uninvestigated;", "2470": "when the fiery principle which is contained beneath, in the earth, is thrust upwards by the natural power of fire, it proceeds to its own appropriate place;", "2471": "and if it meets with any respite or relaxation, though ever so slight, it draws up with it a large portion of the earthy substance, as much as it can;", "2472": "and when it has emerged from the earth it proceeds more slowly;", "2473": "but the earthy substance being compelled to follow it for a long time, being at last raised to an immense height, is contracted at the top, and at last comes to end on a sharp point imitating the general appearance of the flame of fire;", "2474": "for there arises then a most violent contention between two things which are natural adversaries, the lightest and the heaviest of things, each of them pressing onwards to reach its own place, and each striving against the violent efforts of the other;", "2475": "accord­ ingly the fire, which is drawing up the earth with it, is com­ pelled to sink down by its descending power;", "2476": "and the earth naturally inclining to the lowest point is nevertheless to a certain degree made light, and lifted up by the upward ten­ dencies of fire, and so is raised on high, and being at last overpowered by the more influential power which lightens it is thrust upwards towards the natural seat of fire, and established on high.", "2477": "Why then need we wonder if the mountains are not entirely washed away by the impetuosity of the rains, when so great a power, which keeps them together, and by which they are raised up, is very firmly and steadfastly connected with them ?", "2478": "For if they were released from the bond which holds them together, it would be natural for them to be entirely dissolved and to be dispersed by the water;", "2479": "but since they are bound together by this power of fire, they resist the impetuosity of the rains more surely.", "2480": "XX.", "2481": "These things, then, may be said by us with respect to the argument that the inequalities of the surface of the earth are no proof of the world having been created and being liable to destruction;", "2482": "but with respect to that argument which was endeavoured to be established by the diminution of the sea, we may reasonably adduce this statement in opposition to it:", "2483": "\" Do not look only at the islands which have risen up out of the sea, nor at any portions of land which, having been for­ merly buried by the waters, have in subsequent times become dry land;", "2484": "for obstinate contention is very unfavourable to the consideration of natural philosophy, which considers the search after truth to be the chief object of rational desire;", "2485": "but look rather at the contrary effects :", "2486": "consider how many districts on the main-land, not only such as were near the coast, but even such as were completely in-land, have been swallowed up by the waters;", "2487": "and consider how great a portion of land has become sea and is now sailed over by innumerable ships.\"", "2488": "Are you ignorant of the celebrated account which is given of that most sacred Sicilian strait, which in old times joined Sicily to the continent of Italy?", "2489": "and where vast seas on each side being excited by violent storms met together, coming from opposite directions, the land between them was over­ whelmed and broken away;", "2490": "from which circumstance the city built in the neighbourhood was called Rhegium,* and the result was quite different from what any one would have expected;", "2491": "for the seas which had formerly been separated now flowed together and were united in one expanse;", "2492": "and the land which had previously united was now separated into two portions by the strait which intersected it, in consequence of which Sicily, which had previously formed a part of the main­ land, was now compelled to be an island.", "2493": "XXI.", "2494": "And it is said that many other cities also have disap­ peared, having been swallowed up by the sea which overwhelmed them;", "2495": "since they speak of three in Peloponnesus­ \" Ægira and fair Bura's walls, And Helica's lofty halls, And many a once renowned town, With wreck and seaweed overgrown,\" as having been formerly prosperous, but now overwhelmed by the violent influx of the sea.", "2496": "And the island of Atalantes which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timæus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inun­ dation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.", "2497": "Therefore that imagi­ nary and fictitious diminution of the sea has no connection with the destruction or durability of the world ;", "2498": "for in fact it ap­ pears to recede indeed from some parts, but to rise higher in others;", "2499": "and it would have been proper rather not to look at only one of these results but at both together, and so to form one's opinion, since in all the disputed questions which arise in human life, a wise and honest judge will not deliver his opinion before he has heard the arguments of the advocates on both sides.", "2500": "XXII.", "2501": "And as for the third argument, it is convicted by itself, as being derived only from an unsound system of ques­ tioning proceeding from the assertions originally made;", "2502": "for in truth it does not necessarily follow that a thing, all the parts of which are liable to corruption, is likewise perishable itself;", "2503": "but this is only inevitably true of that thing of which all the parts are perishable when taken collectively and together in the same place and at the same time, since in the case of a person who has the tip of his finger cut off, he is not disabled from living, but if he had the whole collection of all his parts­ and limbs cut off at once, he would die immediately.", "2504": "There­ fore in the same manner, if all the elements of the world together were all to disappear at one and the same moment, then it would be necessary to admit that the world was liable to corruption and destruction;", "2505": "but if each of these elements separately only changes its nature so as to assimilate to that of its nature, it is then rendered immortal rather than destroyed, according to the philosophical statement of the tragic poet-", "2506": "Nought that has once existed dies, Though often what has been combine Before, we separated find, Invested with another form.\"", "2507": "For it is the greatest folly imaginable to estimate the antiquity of the human race from the state of art;", "2508": "for if any one were to follow the absurdity of such a system of reasoning as this, he will prove the world to be very young indeed, and to have been made scarcely a thousand years, since all those men whom we have heard of traditionally as the discoverers in different branches of science do not go back to a greater number of years than that which I have mentioned.", "2509": "But if we must speak of the arts as co-eval with the race of mankind, then we must speak, drawing our arguments from natural history, and not inconsiderately or carelessly.", "2510": "And what is this history?", "2511": "The destruction of the things on the earth, not all together, but of the greatest number of them, is attributed to two principal causes, the indescribable violence and power of fire and water.", "2512": "And they say that each of these elements attacks them in its turn, after very long periods of revolving years.", "2513": "When, therefore, a conflagration seizes upon things, a stream of ethereal fire being poured down from above is frequently diffused over them, overrunning many districts of the habitable world;", "2514": "and when a deluge draws down the whole of the rainy nature of water, the regular rivers and torrents overflowing, and not only that, but even far exceeding the ordinary measure of a common flood.", "2515": "Accordingly, when the greater part of mankind is destroyed in the manners above mentioned, besides an infinity of other ways of less power and importance, it follows of necessity that the arts also must fail, for it cannot be possible to discuss science by itself without some one to reduce it to method and practice.", "2516": "But when those common pestilences relax their fury, and when the human race begins again to recover vigour and to flourish, descending from those who have not been previously destroyed by the evils which pressed upon them, then the arts also begin again to exist, not indeed as they were at first, but in thinner numbers from the diminution of the numbers of those who practise them.", "2517": "I have now then set forth to the best of my ability what I have been able to learn or to understand concerning the indestructibility of the world.", "2518": "BUT that you may not think that I am here arguing in a sophistical manner, I will produce a man who is a Hebrew as the interpreter for you of the meaning of the scripture;", "2519": "a man

Philo.", "2521": "Listen then, to him, and hear how he inter­ prets the words of God.", "2522": "Why, then, does he use the expression, \" In the image of God I made man,\"* as if he were speaking of that of some other God, and not of having made him in the likeness of him­ self?", "2523": "This expression is used with great beauty and wisdom.", "2524": "For it was impossible that anything mortal should be made in the likeness of the most high God the Father of the universe;", "2525": "but it could only be made in the likeness of the second God, who is the Word of the other;", "2526": "for it was fitting that the rational type in the soul of man should receive the impression of the Word of God, since the God below the Word is superior to all and every rational nature;", "2527": "and it is not lawful for any created thing to be made like the God who is above reason, and who is endowed with a most excellent and special form ap­ propriated to himself alone.", "2528": "This is what I wish to quote from the first book of the ques­ tions and answers of Philo.", "2529": "And the Hebrew Philo, in his treatise on Providence, speaks in this way concerning matter.", "2530": "But concerning the quantity of the essence, if indeed it really has any existence, we must also speak.", "2531": "God took care at the creation of the world that there should be an ample and most sufficient supply of matter, so exact that nothing might be wanting and nothing superfluous.", "2532": "For it would have been absurd in the case of particular artisans, for them, when they are occupied in making anything, and especially anything of much value, to calculate the exact quantity of materials which they re­ quire;", "2533": "but for that being who is the original inventor of numbers and measures, and the qualities which exist and are found in them, to omit to take care to have just what was proper.", "2534": "I will speak now with all freedom, and say that the world had need for its fabrication of some precise quantity of materials, neither more nor less ;", "2535": "since otherwise it would not have been perfect, nor complete in all its parts, being thoroughly well made, nor would it have been made perfect of a perfect essence.", "2536": "For it is an indispensable part of a workman who is thoroughly well skilled in his art, before he begins making any thing, to see that his materials are exactly sufficient;", "2537": "therefore a man, even if he were most eminently skilled in the knowledge of other things, still if he were not able altogether to avoid error, which is so natural to mortals, would be very likely to be deceived in respect of the quantity of materials which he required when he was about to proceed to the exer­ cise of art;", "2538": "sometimes adding to it as too little, and sometimes taking away from it as too much.", "2539": "But that Being who is, as it were, a kind of fountain of all knowledge, was not likely to sup­ ply anything in deficient or in superfluous quantities, inasmuch as he employs measures elaborated in a most wonderful man­ ner, so as to display perfect accuracy, and all of the most praiseworthy character.", "2540": "But he who is inclined to talk nonsense, at random, will easily do it, looking upon the different works of all artisans as causes, and as having been made in a more excellent manner, either by the addition or by the subtraction of some material or other.", "2541": "But it is the peculiar occupation of sophistry to quibble and cavil;", "2542": "while it is the task of wisdom to investigate accurately everything that exists in nature.", "2543": "And this is the way in which Philo speaks on this subject.", "2544": "And first of all I will adduce what Philo says respecting the journey of the Jews into Egypt, of which he has given an account, following that which is given by Moses in the first book of the Pentateuch, to which he has affixed the superscrip­ tion, \" hypothetically;", "2545": "\" where, arguing in behalf of the Jews as if he were addressing himself to their accusers, he speaks in the following manner, affirming,-That their ancient ancestor, the original founder of their race, was a Chaldiean;", "2546": "and that this people emigrated from Egypt, after having in former times left its abode in Syria, being very numerous and consisting of countless myriads of people;", "2547": "and that when the land was no longer able to contain them, and moreover when a high spirit began to show itself in the dispositions of their young men, and when, besides this, God himself by visions and dreams began to show them that he willed that they should depart, and when, as the Deity brought it about, nothing was less an object of desire to them than their ancient native land;", "2548": "on that account this ancestor of theirs departed and journeyed into Egypt, whether in conse­ quence of some express determination of God, or whether it was in consequence of some prophetic instinct of his own;", "2549": "so that from that time to the present the nation has had an existence and a durability, and has become so exceedingly populous, as it is at this moment.", "2550": "And then, after a few more sentences, he says,-And they were led in this journey and emigration of theirs by a man who, if you will have it so, was in no respect superior to the generality of his fellow countrymen, so incessantly did they reproach him as a trickster and one who deceived them with words.", "2551": "An admirable amount and kind of trickery and deceit no doubt it was, by which he not only completely saved the whole people which was oppressed by want of water and hunger, and by ignorance of the way, and in a complete state of destitution of all things, and led them forward as if in all prosperity, and conducted them through all the nations lying around, and kept them without any quarrelling with one another, and in a state of complete subordination and obedience to him­ self.", "2552": "And this too, not for a short time, but for a period of such length, that it is not likely that even a single family would continue in perfect unanimity and prosperity for such a time;", "2553": "for no thirst, no hunger, no decay of body, no fear of the future, no ignorance of what was to befall them, ever excited that deceived people, who were being led, as some will have it, to their destruction, to rise against him who was deceiving them.", "2554": "Yet what would you have us say?", "2555": "That he had such excessive art, or such great eloquence of speech, or such shrewdness, that he could triumph over so many difficulties of such a nature, which seemed likely to lead to the destruction of them all ?", "2556": "Surely you must confess, either that the natures of the men under him were not utterly ignorant or obstinate, but were obedient and not inclined to neglect a prudent care of the future ;", "2557": "or else that they were as wicked and perverse as possible, but that God softened their obstinacy, and was, as it were, a leader to them in respect both of the present and of the future.", "2558": "For that of these alternatives which appears to you to be the truest of the two, appears equally to contribute to the praise, and honour, and admiration of the whole nation.", "2559": "These things, then, are what I have to say about this exodus.",

courage, and altogether deficient in point of numbers, and destitute of any supplies for war;", "2565": "but that they met with respect­ ful treatment from those nations, and obtained their land from them, who willingly surrendered it to them ?", "2566": "and that then immediately, or at no distant period, they built a temple, and did everything else which has any bearing on religion and piety ?",

of their obedience, or of their devotion, and justice, and holiness, and piety ?", "2572": "But in truth they looked upon that man, whoever he was, who gave them these laws, with such excessive admiration and veneration, that whatever he approved of they immediately thought best also.", "2573": "Therefore, whether he spoke, being influenced by his own reason, or because he was inspired by the Deity, they referred every word of his to God.", "2574": "And though many years have passed, I cannot tell the exact number, but more than two thousand, still they have never altered one word of what was written by him, but would rather endure to die ten thousand times than to do any thing in opposition to his laws and to the customs which he esta­ blished.", "2575": "After Philo has said this, he proceeds to give an abridgment of the constitution established in the nation of the Jews by the laws of Moses, speaking thus :", "2576": "-Now, is there anything among that people resembling these circumstances, anything which appears to be of a mild and gentle character, and which admits of invocations of justice, and pleas, and delays, and of assessments of damages, and on the other hand of counter assessments?", "2577": "Not a word, but every thing is simple, plain, and straightforward.", "2578": "If you indulge in illicit connexions, if you commit adultery, if you do violence to a child (for do not speak of doing so to a boy, but even to a female child);", "2579": "and in like manner, if you prostitute yourself, if you suffer any thing disgraceful contrary to what becomes your age, or appear to do so, or are about to do so, death is the penalty for such wickedness.", "2580": "Again, if you behave with insult towards a slave, or towards a free person, if you confine such an one in bonds, if you lead him away and sell him, if you steal any thing, whether common or sacred, if you commit acts of impiety, not only by your deeds but even by any chance word, I will not venture to say against God himself (may God be merciful to us, and of the same opinion about these matters), but against your father, or your mother, or your benefactor, death is equally the penalty.", "2581": "And that too, not a common, or ordinary, or natural death;", "2582": "but he who has merely uttered a single impious word must be stoned, as having committed no inferior impiety.", "2583": "He also gives many other injunctions, such as these, that wives shall serve their husbands, not indeed in any par­ ticular so as to be insulted by them, but in the spirit of reasonable obedience in all things;", "2584": "that parents shall govern their children for their preservation and benefit;", "2585": "that every one shall be the lord of his own possessions, provided he has not dedicated them to God, nor spoken of God as their owner;", "2586": "but if he has vowed them only by a single word, then it is not lawful for him to lay hands upon or to touch them, but he must at once separate himself from them all.", "2587": "May I never be guilty of plundering the things which belong to God, or of stealing what has been offered and dedicated to him by others.", "2588": "And even, as I have said before, if a single word to that effect has unintentionally fallen from a man, he must, instead of taking away from what is already dedicated, add some offering of his own ;", "2589": "for if he has said the word, he, by so speaking, deprives himself of every thing.", "2590": "But if he repents, or wishes to recall and amend what he has said, he shall be deprived also of his very life.", "2591": "And the same principle extends to other things, of which he is the owner.", "2592": "If a man by any words dedicates that which is requisite to support a wife, she shall be sacred and entitled to receive the support.", "2593": "If a father makes such a promise to his son, or a master to his servant, the rule is the same.", "2594": "And the way in which a man may be released from any promise or vow which he has made in such a manner can only be in the most perfect and complete way, when the high priest discharges him from it;", "2595": "for he is the person entitled to receive it in due subordi­ nation to God.", "2596": "And the next way is that which consists in propitiating the mercy of God in behalf of those who are the more immediate owners of the thing vowed, so that he may not accept of what is thus dedicated, since it is necessary to them.", "2597": "There are, besides these rules, ten thousand other precepts, which refer to the unwritten customs and ordinances of the nation.", "2598": "Moreover, it is ordained in the laws themselves that no one shall do to his neighbour what he would be unwilling to have done to himself.", "2599": "That a man shall not take up what he has not put down, neither out of a garden, nor out of a wine-press, nor out of a threshing-floor;", "2600": "and that absolutely no one shall take anything, whether it be great or small, out of a heap.", "2601": "That no one shall refuse fire to one who begs it of him.", "2602": "That no one shall cut off a stream of water, but that every­ one shall contribute food to beggars and cripples, and that such shall have favour with God.", "2603": "That no one shall keep any one from performing funeral honours to the dead, but shall even throw upon them so much earth as is sufficient to protect them from impiety:", "2604": "that no one shall violate or move, in any manner or degree whatever, the graves, or tombs, or memorials of those who are dead.", "2605": "That no one shall add bonds, or any evil, or heap any additional suffering on him who is in trouble.", "2606": "That no one shall eradicate the generative powers of a man.", "2607": "That no one shall cause the offspring of women to be abortive by means of miscarriage, or by any other contrivance.", "2608": "That no one shall treat animals, in any respect, in a manner contrary to the injunctions imposed, whether by God or by a lawgiver.", "2609": "That no one shall cause his seed to disappear.", "2610": "That no one shall enslave his offspring.", "2611": "That no one shall apply a false balance, or an inadequate measure, or bad money.", "2612": "That no one shall tell the secrets of his friends in a foreign land.", "2613": "Where, in God'a name, are these yokes of oxen of ours gone ?", "2614": "And look also at other commandments besides these.", "2615": "It is or­ dained, that no one shall fix the residence of the parents apart from that of the children, not even if they are prisoners of war;", "2616": "nor that of a wife from that of her husband, even though a man may be her master, having purchased her lawfully.", "2617": "These commandments now are of a more solemn and import­ ant character, but there are others of apparently a trivial and ordinary kind.", "2618": "It is not.", "2619": "lawful, says the lawgiver, to strip a nest wholly of its young;", "2620": "it is not lawful to reject the sup­ plication of animals of any kind whatever, which flee to you for refuge, not even if any of them are very insignificant.", "2621": "You may say, perhaps, that these things are of no consequence whatever, but still, at least, the law which speaks of these par­ ticulars is of importance, and deserving of all imaginable care and attention;", "2622": "and the declarations are important, and so are the curses which threaten those who violate these laws with destruction;", "2623": "and God looks over all such matters, and is an avenger and punisher on every occasion and in every place.", "2624": "And then after a few more sentences he adds,-And if it should happen that during a whole day, or I should rather say, not one day only but many, and those too not coming immediately one after another, but with intervals between them, even intervals of a week at a time, the custom, as is always natural, which is drawn from ordinary days pre­ vails.", "2625": "Do you not wonder, that not a single one of all these commandments has been violated ?", "2626": "Is not this a mark of great temperance and self-restraint, derived to them from practice alone, so that they act towards one another with perfect equality, and are able to derive strength from those actions if it be necessary ?", "2627": "Surely not so;", "2628": "but the lawgiver thought that it ought to be derived from some great and admirable circumstance, that they should not only be competent to do other things in the same manner, but should also be imbued with a thorough knowledge of their national laws and cus­ toms.", "2629": "What then did he do on this sabbath day ?", "2630": "he commanded all the people to assemble together in the same place, and sitting down with one another, to listen to the laws with order and reverence, in order that no one should be ignorant of any­ thing that is contained in them;", "2631": "and, in fact, they do con­ stantly assemble together, and they do sit down one with another, the multitude in general in silence, except when it is customary to say any words of good omen, by way of assent to what is being read.", "2632": "And then some priest who is present, or some one of the elders, reads the sacred laws to them, and inteprets each of them separately till eventide;", "2633": "and then when separate they depart, having gained some skill in the sacred laws, and having made great advances towards piety.", "2634": "Do not these objects appear to you to be of greater im­ portance than any other pursuit can possibly be ?", "2635": "Therefore they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought to do;", "2636": "and even without asking, they are in no ignorance respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their own inclinations, to do wrong;", "2637": "but if you violate or alter any one of their laws, or if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty;", "2638": "and the husband appears to be a master, en­ dowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children, and a master to his servants.", "2639": "And again, it is easy to speak in the same manner with respect to the seventh year, though, perhaps, one is not to say exactly the same things, for they do not abstain from all work as they do on the sabbath days, only they leave their land fallow till the next year, in order that so it may become pro. ductive ;", "2640": "for they think that thus it becomes much better after having had this rest, and then that it may be cultivated again, and not be dried up and exhausted by the uninterrupted con­ tinuance of cultivation ;", "2641": "and you may see that a similar prac­ tice conduces to strength of body, for not only do intervals of relaxation contribute to health, but you may see too that phy­ sicians also enjoin a degree of rest at times from work;", "2642": "for what is incessant, and uninterrupted, and always the same, is likely to be injurious, especially in the case of hard work, the cultivation of the land.", "2643": "And a proof of this is, that if any one were to recommend the people to cultivate the land itself much more, and to add this seventh year also, and should promise them that the usual crops of fruit should reward their labours, they still would not adopt his advice, for they think that they are not alone entitled to rest from their labours, and yet even if they were to do so, it would be nothing strange;", "2644": "but they think that their land also deserves a certain degree of rest and exemption, in order again to receive a fresh beginning of care and cultivation;", "2645": "since, in God's name, what could hinder them from letting it out during the year of jubilee thus proposed, and then receiv­ ing its annual produce once a year from those who rented and cultivated it ?", "2646": "But as 1 said before, they will not admit of any such expedient in any manner or degree whatever, out of care, as it seems to me, for the welfare of the land;", "2647": "and this is truly a very great proof of their humanity and moderation.", "2648": "For, since they themselves rest from their labours during that year, they think that it is not right either to collect the fruits or crops which are produced, nor to lay up any thing which has not accrued to them from their own labours;", "2649": "but, as if God provided for them while the land is thus enjoying rest and regulating itself according to its will, they think that any one who chooses or who is in want, any traveller or stranger, may gather the fruit that year with impunity.", "2650": "However, this is enough to say to you on these matters;", "2651": "for, as to the fact of this law existing among them with regard to the seventh day and seventh year, you will not inquire of me, as you have perhaps heard it often from many persons, both physicians,, and investigators of natural history, and philo­ sophers, who discuss this law about the seventh year, as to the effect which it has on the nature of the universe, and especially on the nature of man.", "2652": "This is what he says about the seventh day.", "2653": "I shall be contented with the testimony of Philo on the present occasion, which he has given about the matter which I am here explaining in many passages of his treatises.", "2654": "And now do you take that work which he has written in defence of the Jewish nation, and read the following sentences in it.", "2655": "But our lawgiver trained an innumerable body of his pupils to partake in those things, who are called Essenes.", "2656": "being, as I imagine, honoured with this appellation because of their exceeding holiness.", "2657": "And they dwell in many cities of Judaea, and in many villages, and in great and populous communities.", "2658": "And this sect of them is not an hereditary or family connexion;", "2659": "for family ties are not spoken of with reference to acts voluntarily performed ;", "2660": "but it is adopted because of their admiration for virtue and love of gentleness and humanity.", "2661": "At all events, there are no children among the Essenes, no, nor any youths or persons only just entering upon manhood;", "2662": "since the dispositions of all such persons are unstable and liable to change, from the imperfections incident to their age, but they are all full-grown men, and even already declining towards old age, such as are no longer carried away by the impetuosity of their bodily pas­ sions, and are not under the influence of the appetites, but such as enjoy a genuine freedom, the only true and real liberty.", "2663": "And a proof of this is to be found in their life of perfect freedom ;", "2664": "no one among them ventures at all to acquire any property whatever of his own, neither house, nor slave, nor farm, nor flocks and herds, nor any thing of any sort which can be looked upon as the fountain or provision of riches ;", "2665": "but they bring them together into the middle as a common stock, and enjoy one common general benefit from it all.", "2666": "And they all dwell in the same place, making clubs, and societies, and combinations, and unions with one another, and doing every thing throughout their whole lives with reference to the general advantage;", "2667": "but the different members of this body have different employments in which they occupy them­ selves, and labour without hesitation and without cessation, making no mention of either cold, or heat, or any changes of weather or temperature as an excuse for desisting from their tasks.", "2668": "But before the sun rises they betake themselves to their daily work, and they do not quit it till some time after it has set, when they return home rejoicing no less than those who have been exercising themselves in gymnastic contests ;", "2669": "for they imagine that whatever they devote themselves to as a practice is a sort of gymnastic exercise of more advantage to life, and more pleasant both to soul and body, and of more enduring benefit and equability, than mere athletic labours, inasmuch as such toil does not cease to be practised with delight when the age of vigour of body is passed;", "2670": "for there are some of them who are devoted to the practice of agricul­ ture, being skilful in such things as pertain to the sowing and cultivation of lands;", "2671": "others again are shepherds, or cowherds, and experienced in the management of every kind of animal ;", "2672": "some are cunning in what relates to swarms of bees;", "2673": "others again are artisans and handicraftsmen, in order to guard against suffering from the want of anything of which there is at times an actual need ;", "2674": "and these men omit and delay nothing, which is requisite for the innocent supply of the necessaries of life.", "2675": "Accordingly, each of these men, who differ so widely in their respective employments, when they have received their wages give them up to one person who is appointed as the universal steward and general manager ;", "2676": "and he, when he has received the money, immediately goes and purchases what is necessary and furnishes them with food in abundance, and all other things of which the life of mankind stands in need.", "2677": "And those who live together and eat at the same table are day after day contented with the same things, being lovers of frugality and moderation, and averse to all sumptuousness and extravagance as a disease of both mind and body.", "2678": "And not only are their tables in common but also their dress;", "2679": "for in the winter there are thick cloaks found, and in the summer light cheap mantles, so that whoever wants one is at liberty without restraint to go and take whichever kind he chooses ;", "2680": "since what belongs to one belongs to all, and on the other hand whatever belongs to the whole body belongs to each individual.", "2681": "And again, if any one of them is sick he is cured from the common resources, being attended to by the general care and anxiety of the whole body.", "2682": "Accordingly the old men, even if they happen to be childless, as if they were not only the fathers of many children but were even also particularly happy in an affectionate offspring, are accustomed to end their lives in a most happy and prosperous and carefully attended old age, being looked upon by such a number of people as worthy of so much honour and provident regard that they think themselves bound to care for them even more from inclination than from any tie of natural affection.", "2683": "Again, perceiving with more than ordinary acuteness and accuracy, what is alone or at least above all other things cal­ culated to dissolve such associations, they repudiate marriage ;", "2684": "and at the same time they practise continence in an eminent degree ;", "2685": "for no one of the Essenes ever marries a wife, because woman is a selfish creature and one addicted to jealousy in an immoderate degree, and terribly calculated to agitate and overturn the natural inclinations of a man, and to mislead him by her continual tricks;", "2686": "for as she is always studying deceitful speeches and all other kinds of hypocrisy, like an actress on the stage, when she is alluring the eyes and ears of her husband, she proceeds to cajole his predominant mind after the servants have been deceived.", "2687": "And again, if there are children she becomes full of pride and all kinds/of license in her speech, and all the obscure sayings which she previously meditated in irony in a disguised manner she now begins to utter with audacious confidence ;", "2688": "and becoming utterly shameless she proceeds to acts of vio­ lence, and does numbers of actions of which every one is hostile to such associations;", "2689": "for the man who is bound under the influence of the charms of a woman, or of children, by the necessary ties of nature, being overwhelmed by the impulses of affection, is no longer the same person towards others, but is entirely changed, having, without being aware of it, become a slave instead of a free man.", "2690": "This now is the enviable system of life of these Essenes, so that not only private individuals but even mighty kings, admiring the men, venerate their sect, and increase their dignity and majesty in a still higher degree by their approba­ tion and by the honours which they confer on them.", "2691": "These things then are what may be said on the subject of the world having been created.", "2692": "And the same man also says a great number of very novel and bold things in his treatise on Providence, on the subject of the universe being governed by prudence;", "2693": "first of all putting forward the propositions of the atheists, and then proceeding to reply to each of them in regular order.", "2694": "And I will now proceed to extract some of the arguments which he adduces, even though they may appear somewhat prolix, because they are nevertheless necessary and important, abridging indeed the greater portion of them.", "2695": "Now he conducts his argument in this way;", "2696": "these are his words.", "2697": "Do you say then that there is providence in such a vast confusion and disorder of affairs ?", "2698": "For, in fact, which of the circumstances and occurrences of human life is regulated by any principle of order ?", "2699": "which of them is not full of all kinds of irregularity and destruction ?", "2700": "Are you the only person who is ignorant that blessings in complete abundance are heaped upon the most wicked and worthless of mankind ?", "2701": "such, for instance, as wealth, a high reputation, honour in the eyes of the multitude, authority ?", "2702": "moreover, health, a good condition of the outward senses, beauty, strength, and unimpeded enjoy­ ment of all good things, by means of an abundance of supplies and resources and preparations of every kind, and in conse­ quence of the peaceful good fortune and good condition of the body?", "2703": "But all the lovers and practisers of wisdom and prudence, and every kind of virtue, everyone of them I may almost say, are poor, unknown, inglorious, and in a mean con­ dition.", "2704": "Having said thus much with respect to the outward circum­ stances of, and a vast number of other things affecting, these men, he then immediately proceeds to refute the objections of his adversaries by the following arguments.", "2705": "God is not a tyrant who practises cruelty and violence and all the other acts of insolent authority like an inexorable master, but he is rather a sovereign invested with a humane and lawful authority, and as such he governs all the heaven and the whole world in accordance with justice.", "2706": "And there is no form of address with which a king can more appropriately be saluted than the name of father ;", "2707": "for what, in human rela­ tionships, parents are to their children, that also sovereigns are to their states, and God towards the world, having adapted these two most beautiful things by the unchangeable laws of nature, by an indissoluble union, namely the authority of the leader with the anxious care of a relation;", "2708": "for as parents are not wholly indifferent to even ill-behaved children, but, having compassion on their unfortunate dispositions, they are careful and anxious for their welfare, looking upon it as the act of relentless and.", "2709": "irreconcileable enemies to insult and increase their misfortunes, but as the part of friends and rela.", "2710": "tions to lighten their disasters:", "2711": "and indeed in the excess of their liberality they even give more to such children than to those who have always been well conducted, knowing well that to these last their own moderation is at all times an abundant resource and means of riches, but that the others have no other hope except in their parents, and that if they are disap­ pointed in that they will be destitute of even the necessaries of life.", "2712": "So in the same manner, God, who is the father of all ra­ tional understanding, takes care of all those beings who are endowed with reason, and exercises a providential power for the protection even of those who are living in a blameable manner, giving them at the same time opportunity of correct­ ing their errors, and nevertheless not violating the dictates of his own merciful nature, of which virtue and humanity are the regular attendants, being willing to have their dwelling in the God-created world ;", "2713": "this one argument now, do thou, 0 my soul, take to thyself, and store up within thyself as a sacred deposit, and this other also as consistent with and in perfect harmony with it.", "2714": "Do not ever be so deceived and wander from the truth to such a degree as to think any wicked man happy, even though he may be richer than Crcesus, and more sharp-sighted than Lynceus, and more powerful than Milo of Crotena, and more beautiful than Ganymede, “Whom the immortal gods, for beauty's sake, Did raise up from the vile earth to heaven, To be the cup-bearer of mighty Jove.”", "2715": "*Accordingly, such a man, having shown his own dæmon, I mean to say his own mind, to be the slave of ten thousand thousand different masters, such as love, appetite, pleasure, fear, pain, folly, intemperance, cowardice, injustice, he can never possibly be happy, even if the multitude, being utterly misled and deprived of their judgment, were to think him so, being corrupted by a double evil, pride and vain opinion, by which souls without ballast must infallibly be tossed about and driven out of their course;", "2716": "for these evils, above all others, injure the chief multitude of mankind.", "2717": "If, then, fixing the eyes of the mind steadily upon the truth, you should be inclined to contemplate the providence of God as far as the powers of human reason are capable of doing it, then, when you have attained to a closer conception of the true and only good, you will laugh at those things which belong to men which you for some time admired;", "2718": "for what is worse is always honoured in the absence of what is better, as it then usurps its place;", "2719": "but when that which is better appears, then that which is worse retires, and is contented with the second prize.", "2720": "There­ fore, admiring that godlike excellence and beauty, you will by all means perceive that none of the things previously men­ tioned were by themselves thought worthy of the better portion by God.", "2721": "On which account the mines of silver and gold are the most worthless portion of the earth, which is altogether and wholly unfit for the production of fruits and food ;", "2722": "for abundance of riches is not like food, a thing without which one cannot live.", "2723": "And the one great and manifest test of all these things is hunger, by which it is seen what is in truth really necessary and useful;", "2724": "for a person when oppressed by hunger would gladly give all the treasures in the whole world in exchange for a little food;", "2725": "but when there is an abundance of necessary things poured out in a plentiful and unlimited sup­ ply, and flowing over all the cities of the land, then we, the citizens, indulging luxuriously in the good things provided by nature, are not contented to stop at them alone, but set up satiated insolence as the guide of our lives, and devoting ourselves to the acquisition of silver and gold, and of everything else by which we hope to acquire gain, proceed in everything like blind men, no longer exciting the eyes of our intellect by reason of our covetousness, so far as to see that riches are but the burden of the earth, and are the cause of continual and uninterrupted war instead of peace.", "2726": "Our garments are indeed, as some one of the poets says somewhere, \" the flower of the sheep ;", "2727": "” but with reference to the art displayed in their manufacture, they are the praise of the weavers.", "2728": "And if any one is proud of any glory which he may have acquired, being greatly delighted at his popularity among worthless people, he should know that he also is worth­ less, for he delights in them.", "2729": "And let such a man pray to receive purification so as to have the disease of his ears healed, as it is through his ears that his soul is affected with great diseases.", "2730": "Again:", "2731": "let those men who are proud of their personal strength and activity learn not to be high-minded on such an account, looking at countless kinds of both domes­ ticated and wild beasts, which are also endowed with great strength and power;", "2732": "for it is the most absurd thing imaginable for one who is a man to pride himself on the good qualities of beasts, and that too when the beasts themselves are thought of no importance whatever by him.", "2733": "Again :", "2734": "why should any man in his senses rejoice at beauty of person, which a short period must extinguish before it has flourished for any great length of time, since time always obscures its deceitful prime ?", "2735": "and this too, when he sees that even in lifeless things there are objects of surpassing beauty, such as the works of painters, and sculptors, and other artists, displayed in paintings, and statues, and all kinds of embroidery, and weaving, which are held in the greatest honour in Greece and in the countries of the barbarians in every city.", "2736": "Of these things, then, as I have said, not one is accounted by God worthy of the better portion.", "2737": "And why should we wonder if they are not highly esteemed by God?", "2738": "for they are not even by those men who are very religious and devout, among whom those things which are really good and virtuous are held in honour, inasmuch as they have a good and well-disposed nature, and have improved their natural good qualities by study and practice, of which a genuine true philosophy is the maker.", "2739": "But those who have devoted themselves to a bastard kind of philosophy have not even imitated physicians who give their attention to the body, the slave of the soul, though nevertheless they affirm that they are healing the mistress, that is to say, the soul itself;", "2740": "for then, when any such man is sick, even if he be the great king him­ self, passing over all the colonnades, and the men's chambers, and the women's chambers, and the pictures, and the silver and the gold, whether in money or in bullion, and the vast treasures of cups and works of embroidery, and all the rest of the celebrated ornaments of kings, and the multitude of his servants, and of his friends, or relatives, and subjects, and the chief officers who are about his person, and his bodyguards, they come up to his bed­ side, paying no attention even to the decorations of his person, and not stopping to notice with admiration that his bed is inlaid with precious stones, or that his coverlet is of the finest work­ manship and the most exquisite embroidery, nor that the fashion of his garments is of superlative beauty, but they even pull off the clothes in which he is wrapped, and lay hold of his hands, and press his veins, and feel his pulse, and note its beating accurately to see if it is in a healthy condition;", "2741": "very often too, they pull up his tunic and feel whether his stomach is too full, whether his chest is feverish, whether his heart beats irregularly.", "2742": "And then, when they have ascertained the symptoms, they apply the appropriate remedies.", "2743": "And in like manner, it would become philosophers who pro. fess to be versed in the healing science as applicable to the soul, which is by nature the dominant part of the man, to despise all the things which erroneous opinion raises up as objects of pride, and to penetrate within, and to lay their hands upon the intellect itself, to see whether through passion its pulses are of an uneven rapidity and moving in an irregular and unnatural manner, and to touch the tongue, and see whether it is rough and devoted to evil-speaking, whether it is prostituted to evil purposes and unmanageable;", "2744": "also to touch the belly, and see whether it is swollen with the insatiable characteristics of desire, and, in short, of any other passions, and diseases, and infirmities, and to examine every one of those feelings, if they appear to be in a state of confusion, so that they may not be ignorant of what is proper to be applied to the soul with a reference to its cure.", "2745": "But now being lightened up all round by the brilliancy of external things, as being unable to see that light which is perceptible only by the intellect, they have passed their whole existence in a state of error, not being able to penetrate as far as royal thought, but being with difficulty able to reach the outer courts, and admiring those servants who stand at the gates of virtue, wealth, and glory, and health, and other kindred circumstances, they fall down in adoration before them.", "2746": "But as it would be an extravagance of insanity to take blind men for judges of colour, or deaf men as judges of the sounds of music, so it is a most preposterous act to take wicked men as judges of real good.", "2747": "For these men are mutilated in the most important parts of themselves, namely, their intellect, over which folly has shed a deep darkness.", "2748": "Do we then now wonder if Socrates, and such and such a virtuous man, has lived in purity ?", "2749": "men who have never once studied any of the means of providing themselves with pecuniary resources, and who have never, even when it was in their power, condescended to accept great gifts which have been tendered to their accept­ ance by wealthy friends or mighty kings, because they looked upon the acquisition of virtue as the only good, the only beautiful thing, and have therefore laboured at that, and disre­ garded all other good things.", "2750": "And who is there who would not disregard spurious good things in comparison of genuine ones?", "2751": "But if while they received a mortal body, and were full of liability to all kinds of human disasters, and lived among such a number of unjust actions and unrighteous men, of which the very number is not easy to compute accurately, they were plotted against by their enemies, why do we blame nature when we ought rather to accuse the barbarity of those who thus set upon them ?", "2752": "For so in like manner, if they had been placed in a pestilential climate, they would inevitably have become sick ;", "2753": "and wicked­ ness is even more, or at all events not less, destructive than a pestilential state of the atmosphere.", "2754": "But as when there is rain the wise man, if he is in the open air, must inevitably get wet through, and if the cold north wind blows he must be oppressed by cold and shivering, and when summer is at its height he must feel the heat, for it is a law of nature that the bodies of men should be simultaneously affected by the changes of the seasons;", "2755": "so also in the same way a man who lives in such places, “Where slaughters dire and famines might prevail, And all the ills which thus mankind assail,\" must inevitably pay the penalty which such evils inflict upon him.", "2756": "Since in the case of Polycrates at least, in retaliation for the terrible acts of injustice and impiety which he committed, there fell upon him great misery in his subsequent life as a terrible requital for his previous good fortune.", "2757": "Add to this that he was chastised by a mighty sovereign, and was crucified by him, fulfilling the prediction of the oracle:", "2758": "\" I knew,\" said he, \" long before I took it into my head to go to consult the oracle, that I was anointed by the sun and washed by Jupiter,\" for these enigmatical assertions, expressed in symbol­ ical language having been originally couched in unintelligible language, afterwards receive a most manifest confirmation by the events which followed them.", "2759": "But it was not only at the end of his existence, but indeed during the whole period of his life from its earliest commencement that he was, though with­ out being aware of it, making his soul to depend wholly on his body;", "2760": "for as lie was always in a state of alarm and trepidation, he feared the multitude of enemies who might possibly attack him, being well assured that no one in the world was really well affected towards him, but that every one was hostile to him, and would turn out implacable enemies if he should be unfortunate.", "2761": "Again, of unsuccessful and yet of never-ending precautions those writers who have written the history of Sicily are wit­ nesses, for they say that the tyrant of Sicily suspected even his most affectionately loved wife;", "2762": "and a proof of this is that he ordered the entrance of his chamber by which she was about to have access to him to be strewed with planks, in order that she might never come upon him without being observed, but that the noise and tumult made by her stepping on these boards might indicate her approach beforehand;", "2763": "and besides this he compelled her to come not only without her robe, but even naked in every part, and even in those which ought not to be seen by men.", "2764": "And in addition to this he ordered the whole of the flooring along the road to be cut in width and depth like a trench made by farmers, out of fear lest anything should be secretly concealed so as to plot against him, which would inevitably be detected by the leaps and long steps which a person coming along this path would be compelled to take.", "2765": "Of how many miseries, then, was that man full who took all these precautions and practised all these contrivances against his own wife, whom he ought to have trusted above all other human beings ?", "2766": "But he was like those men who scale pre­ cipices and climb over abrupt and steep mountains for the purpose of attaining to a more accurate comprehension of the natures of things in heaven, who at last after they have with great difficulty ascended to some overhanging ridge, find them­ selves unable to advance any further as they are too much exhausted to think of attempting the remaining portion of the mountain, and also want courage to descend, being giddy at the sight of the chasms and ravines below them;", "2767": "for he, being in love with sovereign power as a godlike thing to be desired above all other objects, looked upon it as unsafe either to remain where he was or to retreat, for he considered that if he remained where he was innumerable other evils would come upon him in rapid and uninterrupted succession, while if he decided on retracing his steps his very life would be in danger, as there were enemies around, if not as to their bodies at all events in their minds, against him.", "2768": "And he also showed the truth of all this by the treatment to which he exposed a friend of his who spoke of the life of a tyrant as one of complete and absolute happiness;", "2769": "for, having invited him to a banquet which had been prepared in a most brilliant and costly manner, he ordered a sharp sword to be suspended over his head by a very fine thread, and when he, after he had sat down to the banquet, on a sudden perceived it, not daring to rise up and quit his place for fear of the tyrant, and not being able to enjoy any of the things which were prepared out of fear, he disregarded all the abundant and superb luxuries by which he was surrounded, and keeping his neck and his eyes turned upwards, sat in the expectation of instant death.", "2770": "*And when Dionysius perceived the state in which he was, he said to him, \" Do you then at last begin to understand the true character of that illustrious and enviable life of ours, for this is what it really is if a man chooses to speak of it without flattery or disguise, since it contains indeed a great abundance of resources and supplies, but no enjoyment of any real bless­ ing ;", "2771": "and it causes its possessor incessant fears and irremedi­ able and unavoidable dangers, and a disease worse than the most contagious or most fatal sickness, which is continually threatening inevitable death.", "2772": "But the inconsiderate multitude, being deceived by the outward brilliancy and splendour of the position, are like people who are attracted by showy looking courtesans, who, concealing their real deformity under fine clothes and golden ornaments, and pencilling their eyes from want of any real beauty, manufacture a spurious beauty in order to lie in wait for and catch the beholders.", "2773": "Now men who are placed in situations of great prosperity are full of such unhappiness as this, of the greatness of which they themselves are fully aware, and they do not at all keep it to themselves, but like men who under compulsion divulge secret things, they often utter the truest possible expressions, which are extorted from them by suffering, living in the con­ tinual company of punishment both present and expected, just like cattle who are being fattened up for sacrifice, for they too are treated with the greatest possible attention in order to be fit to be sacrificed by reason of their fleshiness and good con­ dition.", "2774": "There are also some men who have suffered punish­ ment, and that not concealed, but visible, and notorious for the impiety of the means by which they have acquired riches, the names and numbers of whom it would be superfluous to enumerate, but it will be sufficient to bring forward one instance as a specimen of the whole.", "2775": "It is said, then, by those who have written the History of the Sacred War in Phocis that as there was a law established that any one who was guilty of sacrilege should be either thrown down a precipice, or drowned in the sea, or burnt alive, that those men who had pillaged the temple at Delphi, by name Pbilomelus, and Onomarchus, and Phayllus, divided these punishments among them, for that the first fell down a rugged and precipitous rock and was dashed to pieces on the stones, and that the second, when the horse which he was riding grew restive and plunged down towards the sea, was overwhelmed by the waves, and so fell alive into a devouring gulf;", "2776": "and Phayllus was wasted away by a consumptive disease (for the way in which the story is told about him is twofold), or else perished in the temple at Abæ, being burnt in it when it was destroyed by fire.", "2777": "For it must be the mere spirit of obstinacy and arguing to say that all these events took place by mere chance, for if indeed one or two of them had been punished at different periods or by some other mode of punish­ ment, then it would have been reasonable to impute their fate to the uncertainty of fortune, but when they all died together and at one time, and by no other punishment but by that precise end which is appointed in the laws for the punishment of such crimes as those of which they had been guilty, it is surely fair to say that they perished by the direct condemnation of God.", "2778": "But if any of the violent men who are unmentioned, and who have at different times risen up against the people in their several states, and have enslaved not only other nations, but their own countries too, have still died without meeting with punishment, it is not to be wondered at, for in the first place man does not judge as God judges, because we investigate what is visible to ourselves, but he descends into the secret recesses of the soul without making any noise, and there con­ templates the mind in the clear light, as if in the sun;", "2779": "for stripping off from it all the ornaments in which it is enveloped, and seeing its devices and intentions naked, he immediately distinguishes between the bad and the good.", "2780": "Let not us then, preferring our own judgment to that of God, assert that it is more unerring or more full of wisdom than his, for that is not consistent with holiness;", "2781": "for in the one there are many things which deceive it, such as the treacherous outward senses, the insidious character of the passions, the most terrible attacks of vice, but in the other there is nothing which can at all conduce to deceit or error, but justice and truth, by which each separate action is deter­ mined on, and in this way is naturally rectified in the most praiseworthy manner.", "2782": "Do not thou, then, my good friend, consider tyrannical power, that most unprofitable of all things, to be a seasonable possession;", "2783": "for neither is punishment disadvantageous, but it is either more beneficial, or at all events not injurious to the good to suffer due punishment, on which account it is expressly comprehended in all laws which are wisely enacted, and those who have established such laws are praised by every one;", "2784": "for what a tyrant is in a people, that is punishment in a law.", "2785": "When therefore a want and terrible scarcity of virtue seizes upon cities, and when a great abundance of folly overwhelms everything, then God, like the stream of an overflowing torrent, being desirous to wash away all the power and impetuosity of wickedness, in order to purify our race, gives vigour and power to those men who by their natures are fitted to exercise dominion, for without a stern soul wickedness cannot be got rid of.", "2786": "And just as cities keep executioners for the punish­ ment of murderers, and traitors, and sacrilegious persons, not because they approve of the dispositions of the men, but because they have need of the serviceable part of their minis­ trations ;", "2787": "in the same manner the Ruler of this mighty city, the world, appoints tyrants, like ordinary executioners, to be over those cities in which he sees that violence, and injustice, and impiety prevail, and all other kinds of evils in abundance, that he may by these means put an end to their existence.", "2788": "And then he thinks it right to pursue the guilty, as men who have been serving these vices from the impulses of an impure and pitiless soul, with every punishment imaginable, as the ringleaders;", "2789": "for as the power of fire when it has consumed the fuel which was given to it, at last consumes itself also, so also do those who have received supreme power over nations, when they have exhausted the cities and rendered them destitute of inhabitants, at last perish themselves among them, suffering due punishment for all that they have done.", "2790": "And why should we wonder if God employs the agency of tyrants to get rid of wickedness when widely diffused over cities, and countries, and nations?", "2791": "For he very often uses other ministers, and himself brings about the same end by his own resources, inflicting upon the nation famine, or pestilence, or earthquakes, or any other heaven-sent calamity, by which great and numerous multitudes perish every day, and by which a great portion of the habitable world is made desolate, on account of his care for the preservation of virtue.", "2792": "Therefore I have now, as I conceive, spoken at sufficient length on the present subject, namely, that no wicked man is happy, by which fact above all others it may be established that there is such a thing as providence ;", "2793": "but if you are not thoroughly convinced, then tell me boldly what is the doubt which is still lurking in your mind, for then both of us by labouring together shall be able to see clearly what the real truth is.", "2794": "And after some more arguments, he proceeds thus :", "2795": "-God causes the violent storms of wind and, rain which we see, not for the injury of those who traverse the sea, as you fancied, or of those who till the earth, but for the general benefit of the whole of the human race, for with his water he cleanses the earth, and with his breezes he purifies all the regions beneath the moon, and by the united influence of both he nourishes and promotes the growth and brings to perfection both animals and plants.", "2796": "And if at times these things do injure those who put to sea or who till the land at unseason­ able moments, it is not to be wondered at, for these men are but a small portion of the human race, and the care of God is exerted for the benefit of all mankind.", "2797": "As, therefore, in a gymnastic school oil is placed there for the common benefit of every one, but still it often happens that the master of the school, by reason of some political necessity changes the arrangement of the usual hours of exercise, by which means some of those who wish to anoint themselves come too late;", "2798": "in like manner God, who takes care of the whole world as if it were a city committed to his charge, does sometimes cause the summer to resemble winter, and winter to assume the characteristics of spring, for the common benefit of the universe, even though some captains of ships, or some cultivators of the ground, may very likely be injured by this irregularity of the seasons.", "2799": "Therefore He, being aware that the occasional interchanges of the elements with one another, out of which the world was made, and of which it consists, are a work of the greatest importance and necessity, supplies them without allowing anything to be an obstacle to them ;", "2800": "and frost and snow-storms, and other things of that kind, follow the cooling of the air.", "2801": "And, again, light­ nings and thunders arise from the collision and repercussion of the clouds, none of which things are perhaps effected by any immediate exertion of providence, but the rains and winds are the causes of existence, and nourishment, and growth to all things which are upon the earth, and these phenomena are the natural consequences of those others", "2802": "For just as it often happens, when the master of a gymnas­ tic school, out of rivalry, has gone to extravagant expense, then some of those who are ignorant of all that is becoming, having been bespattered with oil instead of water, let all the drops from them fall upon the boards, and then a most slippery mud is the result:", "2803": "nevertheless a man, whose appreciations were just would not say that the hard and the slippery state of the ground was caused by the intention of the master of the school, but that these things had resulted accidentally, in con­ sequence of the abundant quantity of the things supplied.", "2804": "Again, the rainbow, and the halo, and all other things of that kind, are natural consequences of those things becoming mingled with the clouds, not being occurrences which lead and influence nature, but being the results and consequences of the operations of nature.", "2805": "Not but what these very things themselves do also afford some signs of great importance to wise men, for, guiding their conjectures by them, they predict calms and storms of wind, and fine weather, and tempests.", "2806": "Do you not see the porticoes which embellish the cities ?", "2807": "the greater part of these look towards the south, in order that those who walk under them may be warm in the winter, and may be cool in the summer.", "2808": "There is also another thing which does not happen through the intention of Him who made it, and what is this ?", "2809": "the shadows which fall from the feet indicate the hours to our experience.", "2810": "And again, fire is a most important work of nature, but the consequence of fire is smoke, and nevertheless even this too at times is of some service.", "2811": "At all events in the heat, in the middle of the day, when the fire is rendered invisible by the brilliancy of the beams of the sun, the ap­ proach of enemies is indicated by the smoke, and the principle which causes the rainbow is also the same which, in some degree, regulates eclipses.", "2812": "For eclipses are a natural consequence of the rules which regulate the divine natures of the sun and moon;", "2813": "and they are indications either of the impending death of some king, or of the destruction of some city, as Pindar also has told us in enigmatical terms, alluding to such events as the conse­ quences of the omens which I have now been mentioning.", "2814": "­And the circle of the Milky Way partakes of the same natural essences with the other stars ;", "2815": "but merely the fact that it is hard to account for, is no reason that those who are ac- customed to investigate the principles of nature should shrink from examining into it:", "2816": "for the discovery of those things is most beneficial, and the investigation of them is intrinsically most delightful for its own sake, to those who are fond of learning.", "2817": "For as the sun and moon exist in consequence of Provi­ dence, so also do all things in heaven, even though we are unable to trace out accurately the respective natures and pow­ ers of each, and are, therefore, reduced to silence about them;", "2818": "and earthquakes, and pestilences, and the fall of thunderbolts, and things of that kind, are said indeed to be sent by God, but, in reality, they are not so, for God is absolutely not the cause of any evil whatever of any kind, but the natural changes of the elements produce these effects, not as circumstances which guide nature, but as those which are followed by necessary results, and which do themselves follow naturally upon their antecedent causes.", "2819": "And if some people, who think themselves entitled to immunity meet with some injury from these things, they are still not to find fault with their management and dispensation;", "2820": "for, in the first place, it does not follow, that if some persons are reckoned virtuous among men, they are so in real truth;", "2821": "since the criteria by which God judges are far more accurate than any of the tests by which the human mind is guided.", "2822": "And, in the second place, prophetic wisdom loves to contemplate those things in the world which are of the most comprehensive nature, as in the case of monarchies, and in the governments of armies, we see that it is not any obscure, ignoble, or chance person who is appointed to govern the cities or the armies.", "2823": "And some persons say that as on occasion of the slaying of tyrants, it is lawful that their relations also should be put to death, in order that transgressions may be checked by the ter­ rible magnitude of the punishment inflicted:", "2824": "in like manner in pestilential diseases, it is necessary that some of those who are not guilty should be involved in the destruction, in order that others who are at a distance may learn moderation.", "2825": "Besides that, it is inevitable that those who are exposed to a pesti­ lential atmosphere must become diseased just as all persons who are exposed to a storm on board a ship must be all exposed to equal danger.", "2826": "But those wild beasts which are courageous have been created;", "2827": "for we must not suppress the truth (as if one were to anticipate the defence likely to be made by a man of powerful eloquence and tare it to pieces be­ forehand), in order that men may, by practising against them, acquire hardihood for the contests of war;", "2828": "for gymnastic exer­ cises and continued hunting train men and inure their souls in a greater degree even than their bodies to rely upon their own courage, and energy, and strength, so as to disregard the sudden attacks of their enemies.", "2829": "But those men who are of peaceable character are at liberty to keep themselves not only within their walls, but also even within tents, and there to live in privacy, safe from the designs of any enemies, having vast and countless herds of domestic' animals to help their enjoyment;", "2830": "since boars and lions, and animals of that kind, are by their own instinct driven to a dis­ tance from cities, not being inclined to expose themselves to danger in consequence of the devices of men.", "2831": "And if any men, being influenced by a spirit of laziness and indolence, living without arms and without preparation, dwell fearlessly among the haunts of wild beasts, then if anything happens to them they must blame not nature but themselves, because when they might have guarded against any such disasters, they have neglected them.", "2832": "Accordingly, before now, I have seen at the horse-races some persons acting in a most careless manner, who, when they ought to have sat still and to have beheld the races in an orderly manner, standing in the middle have been knocked down by the horses' feet and by the wheels, and have met with a proper reward for their folly.", "2833": "We have now, then, said enough on this subject.", "2834": "But of reptiles, those which are venomous have not been called into existence by an immediate providence, but by the natural consequences of events, as I said before;", "2835": "for they are brought into life when the moisture which is in them changes to a more violent heat;", "2836": "and some are vivified by putrefaction, as, for instance, the putrefaction of meat produces maggots, and that which is caused by perspiration produces lice;", "2837": "but all those which are produced out of a kindred substance, and which have their generation in.", "2838": "accordance with the usual spermatic principles which I have mentioned before, are very naturally ascribed to an immediate providence.", "2839": "And I have also heard two accounts given of them as having been created for the advantage of mankind, which I should not think it well to conceal.", "2840": "Now one of them is the following.", "2841": "Some persons have said that venomous animals contribute greatly to many of the objects of physicians, and that those who reduce that science to a regular system use them in a proper manner, and, acting with great wisdom and prudence, have discovered antidotes, so as to be able to contribute to the unexpected safety of those who were in the greatest possible danger;", "2842": "and even at the present time one may see thoSe persons who apply themselves to the study of medicine, in a careful and diligent manner, using all these animals and plants in a most skilful manner in the composition of drugs.", "2843": "The other account has no reference to the practice of phy­ sicians, but only as it would seem to the studies of philosophers.", "2844": "For it says that all these things have been prepared by God as engines of punishment against offenders, just as generals and rulers prepare halters and chains.", "2845": "On which account, though they are quiet at other times, they are brought out with great power in the case of people who have been condemned, and whom nature in her incorruptible tribunal has sentenced to death ;", "2846": "for that they lurk in secret holes and in houses, is a falsehood:", "2847": "for it is seen that these creatures flee out of the cities into the fields and into desert places, to avoid man as their master.", "2848": "Not but what, if this is true, there is a certain sense and principle in it;", "2849": "for rubbish is heaped up in recesses:", "2850": "and quantities of sweepings, and refuse, and such things, are what venomous reptiles love to lurk in, besides the fact that their smell has an attractive power over them.", "2851": "Again, if swallows live among us, it is not at all strange, for we abstain from hunting them ;", "2852": "and a desire of safety is im­ planted not only in the souls of rational creatures, but also in those of irrational animals.", "2853": "But of those animals which tend to our enjoyment, there is not one which lives with us by reason of the designs which we form against them, except that some do live with those nations to whom the use of them is forbidden by the law.", "2854": "There is a city of Syria, on the sea shore, Ascalon by name :", "2855": "when I was there, at the time when I was on my journey towards the temple of my native land for the purpose of offering up prayers and sacrifices therein, I saw a most incalculable number of pigeons on the roads and about every house ;", "2856": "and when I inquired the cause of their being there in such numbers, they said that it was not lawful to catch them, for that the use of them had been prohibited to the inhabitants from the earliest ages ;", "2857": "and so the bird had become so thoroughly tame through fearlessness, that it not only hovered about the roofs and came into the houses, but approached their tables also, and grew luxurious in the alliance which it had thus formed.", "2858": "And in Egypt we may see a still more marvellous thing;", "2859": "for the crocodile is the most odious of all animals, and one addicted to devour man ;", "2860": "and it is born and brought up in the most sacred way, and although residing in the depths, it feels the benefits which it receives from mankind ;", "2861": "for in those tribes, among which it is honoured, it multiplies in the greatest de­ gree, but among those who injure it it never appears at all:", "2862": "so that there are places where even the most timid persons when sailing by leap out of their ships and swim about with their children.", "2863": "And in the country of the Cyclops, since the race of these men is a fabulous invention, there is no eatable fruit whatever produced except such as is raised from seed and cultivated by husbandmen, just as nothing is produced from that which does not exist;", "2864": "but we must not accuse Greece as being sterile and unproductive, for there is a great deal of deep and rich soil in it;", "2865": "and if the land of the barbarians is superior in fruitfulness, though it is superior in the food which it produces, it is inferior in the men who are nourished by the food, and for whose sake the food is produced.", "2866": "For Greece is the only country which really produces man, that heavenly plant, that divine on'short, producing that most accurately refined reason which is appropriated by and akin to knowledge;", "2867": "and the cause is this, it is the nature of the intellect to be rendered acute by the lightness of the air;", "2868": "on which account Heraclitus said with great propriety, \" Where the soil is dry, there the soul is most wise and most excellent and any one may conjecture this from the fact, that men who are sober and contented with a little are wise, and that those who are continually filling themselves with meat and drink are the least sensible, as if their reasoning faculties were drowned by the quantity which they swallow.", "2869": "And on this account we see, in the countries of the bar­ barians, trees and plants grow to the greatest possible size, by reason of the abundance of nourishment which they receive ;", "2870": "and we see too, that the irrational animals which are found in these regions are the most prolific of any, but the mind is not so, or, at all events, it is so in a very slight degree, because it is elevated and raised out of the sether itself, while the inces­ sant and uninterrupted evaporations of earth and water have freely boiled over it.", "2871": "Again, the different kinds of fish, and birds, and terrestrial animals, are not grounds for accusing nature, which invites us to pleasure by those means, but are a terrible reproach to us for our intemperate use of them, for it was necessary, for the due completion of the universe, in order that there should be order and regularity in every portion of it, that there should be produced every possible species of animal.", "2872": "But it was not necessary that that animal, which of all others is most akin to wisdom, namely, man, should rush with such eagerness to the enjoyment of it, as to change his nature into something resembling the ferocity of wild beasts;", "2873": "on which account, even up to the present time, those who have any regard for temperance entirely abstain from such things, eating only vegetables, and herbs, and the fruits of trees, as the most delicious and wholesome food.", "2874": "And these men are instructors for those who look upon the practice of eating such animals to be in accordance with nature, and correct them, and are lawgivers to their respective cities, being men who take care to check the immoderate vehemence of the appetites, and who do not permit the unrestrained use of everything to everybody.", "2875": "Again, if roses, and crocuses, and all the other beautiful variety of flowers which we see, contribute to health, it would not follow that they all contribute to pleasure;", "2876": "for the inde­ scribable variety of them makes the powers of some of them more conspicuous than those of others, just as there is a com­ mingling of male and female, contributing to the generation of an animal;", "2877": "neither of them being calculated, by itself, to produce the effect which the two produce in combination.", "2878": "These things are said, in a most convincing manner, with reference to the rest of the questions raised by you, being quite sufficient to produce conviction in the minds of all who are not obstinately contentious on the subject of God taking great care of human affairs.", "2879": "Page 326.", "2880": "C.",

centre between the seven circles of heaven;", "3443": "but some affirm that it is the sun which is meant, as that is nearly in the centre, between the different planets, and is likewise the cause of the four seasons, and since it is owing to him that every thing which exists is called into existence.", "3444": "Others again understand by the tree of life the direction of the soul, for this it is which renders the sense nervous and solid, so as to produce actions corresponding to its nature, and to the community of the parts of the body.", "3445": "But whatever is in the middle is in a manner the primary cause and beginning of things, like the leader of a chorus.", "3446": "But still, the best and wisest authorities have considered that by the tree of life is indicated the best of all the virtues of man, piety, by which alone the mind attains to immortality.", "3447": "What is meant by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?", "3448": "*11.", "3449": "This indeed exhibits that meaning which is sought for in the letter of the Scriptures more clearly to the sight, as it bears a manifest allegory on the face of it.", "3450": "What is meant then under this figure is prudence,

wisdom ;", "3457": "since very often there are some shadows found which hinder the eyes from contem­ plating a brilliant light;", "3458": "since what the eye is in the body, such also is the mind and wisdom in the soul.", "3459": "What the river is which proceeded out of Adin by which the Paradise is watered, and from which the four rivers proceed, the Phison, and the Gihon, and the Tigris, and

place at a distance from this part of the world which we inhabit, and that it has a river running beneath the earth, which pours forth many veins of the largest size;", "3464": "so that they, rising up together, pour themselves forth into other veins, which receive them on account of their great size, and then those have been suppressed by the gulfs of the waves;", "3465": "on which account,

by all means we must consider the holy scriptures infallible, which point out the fact of four rivers ;", "3468": "for the river is the beginning, and not the spring.", "3469": "But perhaps this passage also contains an allegorical meaning;", "3470": "for the four rivers are the signs of four virtues:", "3471": "Phison being the sign of prudence, as deriving its name from parsimony;", "3472":

fortitude is that portion of the human character which is liable to degenerate into anger.", "3484": "And sobriety, again, may be impaired by the desires, but anger and concupiscence are the characteristics of beasts;", "3485": "therefore the sacred historian has here described those three rivers by the places which they flow round.", "3486": "But he has not described the Euphrates in that manner, as being the symbol of justice, for there is no certain and limited portion of it allotted to the soul, but a perfect harmony of the three parts of the soul and of the three virtues is possessed by it.", "3487": "Why God placed man in the Paradise with a twofold object, namely, that he might both till it and keep it, when the Paradise was in reality in need of no cultivation,

Pitch is so called by reason of its bird-lime like tenacity, because it glues together whatever was disunited before, so as to form one indissoluble and indivisible joint.", "4275": "For everything which is held together by bird-lime is immediately held to a natural union;", "4276": "but our body being composed of many parts is united on the outside, and is held together by its own proper habit,

back again from the surface to the centre, so that our spiritual nature is rolled up compactly in a double fold, being united in a firm solidity and union.", "4277": "Therefore this ark is smeared with pitch, both on the inside and the outside, for the reason here given.", "4278": "But that ark which is placed in the holy of holies, and is covered over with gold, is the similitude of the world

the holy of holies;", "4286": "and being stable it is akin to divine nature, as the other, which is tossed about in every direction, and moved from one place to another, is akin to and the emblem of created nature.", "4287": "Besides this, that ark of the flood being, as it were, an example of cor­ ruption, is raised on high, but the other, which is in the holy of holies, imitates the incorruptible condition of eternity", "4288": "Why did God give the measures of the ark in the following manner;", "4289": "the length to be of three hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof to be fifty cubits, and the height to be thirty cubits :", "4290": "and above it was to be raised to a point in one cubit, being brought together gradually like an obelisk ? *5.", "4291": "It was necessary that so vast a work should be con­ structed in conformity with literal directions, in order that so many animals, some of them of vast size, should be received into it, as indviduals of each class were introduced with the food necessary for them;", "4292": "but if the matter is considered pro­ perly with reference to its symbolical meaning, then, for the comprehension of the formation of our body, we shall require to make use not of the quantity of cubits, but of the certain principles and proportions which are observed in them.", "4293": "But the proportions which are contained in them are of sixfold, and double, and other portions are added.", "4294": "For three hundred is six times as many as fifty, and ten times as many as thirty;", "4295": "and again fifty is by two thirds a larger number than thirty.", "4296": "Such then are also the proportions of the body;", "4297": "for if any one should choose to investigate the matter and inquire into it carefully in all its points, he will find that man is made in an exact proportion of measurement, neither being too long or too little;", "4298": "and if a string be let down from his head to his feet, he will find that to reach that distance it requires a string six times as long as the width of his chest, and ten times as long as the depth of his ribs and thei r breadth as a second part of depth added thereto.", "4299": "Such is the certain proportion, received in accordance with nature, of the human body formed on exact measurement of the most excel­ lently made men, who are incorrect neither in the way of excess nor of defect.", "4300": "But again, it was with great wisdom and propriety that God ordained the summit to be completed in cne cubit;", "4301": "for the upper part of the ark imitates the unity of the body;", "4302": "the head being forsooth as the citadel of the king, having for its inhabitant the chief of all, the intellect.", "4303": "But those parts which are below the head are divided into separate portions, as for instance into the hands, and in an especial degree into the lower parts, since the thighs, and legs, and feet are all kept distinct from one another, therefore who­ ever

be ignorant that each of these different numbers of cubits has separately a certain ne­ cessary proportion and principle, beginning with the first, those in the length of the ark.", "4305": "Therefore in its length it is composed of three hundred units, placed next to one another in continuation, according to the augmentation of units, from these twenty-four numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty- one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four.", "4306": "But the twenty- fourth number is above all others a natural number, being distributed among the hours of day and night, and also among the characters of language,* and literal speech;", "4307": "and it is

beginning, and a mid­ dle, and an end, all of which are equal to one another;", "4309": "and eight is the first cube, because it again has declared its first equality with the rest.", "4310": "But the number twenty-four has likewise a great number of other virtues, since it is the substance of the number three hundred, as has been already pointed out;", "4311": "this then is its first virtue;",

five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, and twenty-three;", "4316": "but the quadrangular figure combines the following numbers, one, four, nine, sixteen, twenty-five, thirty-six, forty-nine, sixty-four, eighty-one, a hundred, a hundred and twenty-one, and a hundred and twenty-four.", "4317": "But those angular numbers which compose the other long

long figure.", "4325": "But the universe consists of a combination of equality and inequality, on which account the Creator himself, even amid the destruction of all earthly things, placed a sort of fixed pattern of stability in the ark.", "4326": "This then is enough to say about the number three hundred.", "4327": "We must now proceed to speak of the fifty cubits, on the fol­ lowing principle

twenty;", "4334": "and the quadrangles make thirty;", "4335": "and twenty and thirty added together make fifty.", "4336": "But if the triangle and the quadrangle are added together, they make a

things;", "4643": "more­ over that is the one which first laid open the road to philo­ sophy.", "4644": "For beholding the regular motion of the sun, and of the moon, and the erratic course of the other planets, and the uner­ ring circular motion of the whole heaven, and the order and harmony there existing beyond all calculation, as if it were the one real creator of the whole world, it by itself related to its one chief counsellor and director all that it saw:", "4645": "and then intellect, seeing those things with its acute eye, and by those things discerning superior demonstrative ideas, and the cause of all those things, immediately perceived that there was a God at the same moment that it arrived at the conception of generation and providence, because forsooth it was plain that this visible nature was not created by itself:", "4646": "for it was impos­ sible that such a harmony, and order, and reason, and most consistent analogy, and that a concord of such a character and extent, and that such true and perfect felicity should exist by its own power:", "4647": "but it was necessary that there must be some Creator and parent of it acting like a governor and director, who generated these things, and then having generated them preserves them safe and sound.", "4648": "Why did he send out a raven first ? f35.", "4649": "If we look to the literal statement, the raven is said to be an animal particularly set apart for being sent on messages and employed in offices;", "4650": "for to this very day many people watch its mode of flight and its chattering, judging that it gives some intimation of unknown facts ;", "4651": "but with respect to the hidden meaning, as a raven is a black, and arrogant, and speedy animal, it is a sign of wickedness, which brings night and darkness over the soul, and it is also swift to meet all the things of the world in its flight.", "4652": "And also that it is very bold, so as at times to cause the destruction of those who seek to catch it, since pride produces also rash impudence, the opposite of which is virtue, which is consistent with the brilliancy of light, and is by nature deco­ rated with a modest bashfulness;", "4653": "therefore it is quite natural that if there was any darkness remaining behind in the intel­ lect, darkness which exists in accordance with folly, he should expel that and send it out beyond his borders.", "4654": "Why did the raven after it had gone forth not return, when there was not yet any part of the earth dried ?*36.", "4655": "This passage admits of an allegorical interpretation since injustice is contrary to the light of justice;", "4656": "so that in comparison of the admirable actions of the man endued with virtue, it thinks it more desirable to rejoice with its kinsman the deluge;", "4657": "for injustice is a lover of confusion and corruption.", "4658": "Why does he speak here in an incorrect manner, “ Till the water was dried up from the earth;", "4659": "” when it was not the water which was dried up from the earth, but the earth which was dried from the water ?", "4660": "t37.", "4661": "He uses this expression in an allegorical sense, indicat­ ing by the fall of the waters the immensity of vices, by which when saturated and vigorous the soul is corrupted, but when they are dried up and withered, it is preserved;", "4662": "for then they cannot inflict any mischief upon it, since they are become impotent and dead.", "4663": "Why does he in the second place fend forth the dove, and why does he send it forth from himself to see whether the water had ceased, when he uses no such expressions about the raven ?", "4664": "‡In the first place, the dove is a clean animal, and in the second place it is tame, civilised, and one which associates with mankind, on which account also the honour has been allotted to it of being offered up upon the altar in sacrifices;", "4665": "and on this account the sacred writer, sanctioning this honour and adding the weight of his assertion, has said, he sent it forth from himself, declaring by this expression that it dwelt with him;", "4666": "and again, by the expression that it was to see whether the water was abated, he displays the common anxiety felt by both.", "4667": "But those birds, the raven and the dove, are symbols of wickedness and virtue:", "4668": "for the one, whether it is wickedness or the raven, has no house, nor habitation, nor city, being an insolent unsociable bird ;", "4669": "but the other, namely virtue, has a regard to humanity, and to the public good:", "4670": "and so the man endowed with virtue sends that bird forth as his ambassador for desirable and salutary objects, wishing to receive from it desirable information ;", "4671": "and she, like an ambassador, brings us back genuine pleasure, so that what is hurtful may be guarded against, and what is useful may be diligently and carefully admitted.", "4672": "Why did the dove, when it found no rest for its feet, return to Noah?*39.", "4673": "Is not the reason of this evident, and is it not a plain proof that wickedness and virtue are symbolically indicated by the raven and the dove ?", "4674": "For behold the dove, which is the last sent out, finds no rest.", "4675": "How, then, could the raven, who departed previously, while the calamity of the deluge was still prevailing, find any place, and make a settlement ?", "4676": "For the raven was neither a swan nor an ibis, nor did he belong to the class of aquatic birds.", "4677": "But the sacred writer here points out in an enigmatical manner, that wickedness, when it has gone forth out of doors, to the swelling whirlpools of the vices and passions which overflow and corrupt the soul and life, joyfully admits them, and dwells with and takes up its abode with them, as with its nearest friends and relations;", "4678": "but virtue, turning away with loathing from even the first sight of them, at once springs back, and does not return, scarcely finding rest for its feet;", "4679": "finding, in fact, no standing ground anywhere, and no place worthy of itself.", "4680": "For what other greater evil can there be than this, that virtue should not be able to find in the soul any place ever so small for rest and for abiding in ?", "4681": "What is the meaning of the statement, \" Putting forth his hand, he received her, and brought her in to himself ?\" *40. The literal meaning is plain, but with respect to the hidden sense we must elicit the truth carefully.", "4682": "The wise man employs truth as an overseer of and ambassador in im­ portant affairs, which, when it perceives that those natures are worthy of it, abides among and dwells with them, correcting them, and making them better, since wisdom is a very common, and equal, and useful thing.", "4683": "But when, with reference to the opposite natures, it sees that in some points they are prepos­ terously redundant and in others altogether deficient, it returns to its proper place;", "4684": "and the man endowed with virtue admits it in word, putting forth his hand to take it, and in fact opening all his intellect for its reception, and unfolding it by the perfect number, full and equal, with all imaginable prompti­ tude.", "4685": "Nor even then, when he had sent her forth from himself to examine the natures of other things, had he separated it from himself, but had only acted like the sun, which sends forth his beams to give light to all things, because it is not at all con­ sistent with the character of his boundless light to be separated at all.", "4686": "Why did he, after waiting yet seven other days, send forth the dove a second time ?f41.", "4687": "This is an excellent example for life, since although it will behold natures obstinate at first, still the hope of changing them into better natures is scarcely allowed to drop ;", "4688": "and as a prudent physician does not in a moment apply a perfect cure to a disease, or effect a complete restoration to health, but employs salutary medicines after he has given nature an opportunity of first opening the way to recovery, so too the man endowed with virtue behaves with respect to the employment of the word which is in accordance with the law of wisdom.", "4689": "But the number seven is the sacred and dominical number, according to which the Father of the universe, when he made the world, is said to have looked upon his work.", "4690": "And the contemplation of the world, and of all the things contained in it, is nothing else but philosophy, and that excellent and select portion of it which wisdom contains, comprehending within itself also a work still more necessary to be seen.", "4691": "What is the meaning of the expression, \" The dove returned a second time to him about evening, having in her mouth a leaf and a thin branch of olive ?\"*42. All these separate points are selected and approved signs-the returning, the returning about evening, the having an olive-leaf and a thin branch of that tree, and oil, and the having it in her mouth;", "4692": "but yet every one of these signs can be examined with a certainty beyond certainty, for the return is distinct from its previous return, for that one bore with it an announcement of nature being wholly corrupted and rebellious, and being wholly destroyed by the deluge, that is to say, by great ignorance and insolence;", "4693": "but this second return brings the news of the world beginning to repent, but to find repent­ ance is not an easy task, but is a difficult and laborious business.", "4694": "And it is on this account that the dove arrived in the evening, having passed the whole day from morning to evening in its visitations;", "4695": "in word, indeed, examining places, but in fact investigating the different parts of nature itself by con­ tinual visitation, and seeing them all clearly from beginning to end, for the evening is the indication of the end.", "4696": "The third sign, again, is its bringing a leaf;", "4697": "but a leaf is a small part of a tree, still it does not exist without a tree.", "4698": "And the beginning of displaying repentance is somewhat corre­ spending to this, since the beginning of correction has some slight indications about it, which we may call a leaf, by which it appears to receive guardianship, but can easily be shaken off;", "4699": "so that the hope shall in that case not be great of attain­ ing the desired improvement, which is typified by the leaf of no other tree but of the olive alone, and oil is the material of light.", "4700": "For wickedness, as I have said before, is profound darkness, but virtue is luminous brilliancy, and repentance is the beginning of light.", "4701": "But you must not yet suppose that the beginning of repentance is only visible in branches just germinating and beginning to look green, but that it exists too while they are still dry, and while the seminal principle is dry and quiescent.", "4702": "And it is on this account that the fifth sign is shown, that, namely, of the dove when it comes bearing a slender branch.", "4703": "And the sixth sign is that this slender branch was in its mouth, for the number six is the first perfect number, since virtue bears in its mouth, that is to say in its conversation, the seeds of wisdom and justice, or, in one word, of honesty of the soul;", "4704": "and not only bears this, but gives some portion of parti­ cipation in it even to the foolish, by drawing up water for their souls, and irrigating them with the desire of repentance for their sins.", "4705": "Why is it said, \"", "4706": "And Noah knew that the waters had ceased from off the earth?\"*43. The literal statement is plain, since if the leaf had been taken up from off the water it would have been wet and soaked, but now he says that it was dry and slender, as if it had become dry by being on the earth which was dried.", "4707": "But with reference to its inward meaning, the wise man takes it as a symbol of repentance, and wishes to check the calamities of excessive obstinacy by taking the leaf, since it was not yet green, but slender, for the reason which has been already mentioned.", "4708": "At the same time we may admire the Father on account of his exceeding kindness, for although corruption had prevailed over all the men who lived on the earth from the excess of their iniquities, still there remained some relics of antiquity and of that which was from the beginning, and a slight seed of previous virtues;", "4709": "by which it is intimated nevertheless that the memory of all the good deeds that have been done from the beginning is not wholly destroyed.", "4710": "On which account a certain prophet, the kinsman and friend of Moses, uttered an oracle of this kind, \" If the omnipotent Lord had not left us a seed, we should have been like blind and barren people,\" f able neither to know the truth nor to generate it.", "4711": "And the Chal. dæans in their native language call blindness and sterility Sodom and Gomorrah.", "4712": "Why, in the third place, after seven other days, did he again send forth the dove, which did not again return to him ?", "4713": "44.", "4714": "According to the word, the dove made no more return to him;", "4715": "but what in fact is meant is virtue, which, however, is not an indication of alienation, since, as I have said before, she was not separated from him at that time, but sent forth like a sun-beam to pay a visit of examination to the natures of others, but then, not finding any one to listen to her precepts of correction, she returns, and properly comes to him alone.", "4716": "But this time she is no longer the possession of one single individual, but is rather a common good to all those who have been willing to receive the emanations of wisdom as if coming up from the earth, those persons, that is, who from the very beginning have laboured under a great thirst of perfect wisdom.", "4717": "Why in the six hundred and first year of the life of Noah, and on the first day of the first month, did the waters of the deluge cease from off the earth ? *45.", "4718": "The word first, according to the defect of time, is spoken of with reference either to the month or the man, and each interpretation has reason to support it;", "4719": "for if we are bound to maintain that the water began to abate in the first mouth, we are equally obliged to consider that the sacred historian in­ tended also to speak of the seventh month, that is, of that month which is the second equinox, since the same month is both the first and the seventh;", "4720": "that is to say, the first as respects nature and virtue, and the seventh in point of time.", "4721": "Therefore in another place he says,t \" This month is unto you the beginning of months, the first among the months of the year;", "4722": "” calling that the first which is so in respect of nature and virtue, and which as to number is in time the seventh month, since the equinox has its appointed order in regular series, and in point of time is assigned the better season of the year.", "4723": "But if you take that word first to have reference to the man, then it will be used with more truth, and with strict propriety, for the just man was truly and properly the first, as in a vessel the captain is the first man, and in a state the prince.", "4724": "But he is first not only in virtue, but also in order, inasmuch as in the very circumstances of the regeneration of the second sowing of the human race he was the beginning and the first.", "4725": "Moreover, it is very admirably considered with reference to this passage, that the deluge took place during the life of the first man, and that again, when it abated, things returned to their former steadiness, since after the deluge took place he had to live by himself with his whole family, and after that evil was removed he alone was found upon the earth during the latter period of his life until the regeneration of mankind began.", "4726": "But it is not to no purpose that this testimony is given both of the preceding portion of his life, and also of the later period, for he alone burnt with a desire for that genuine life which is in accordance with virtue, while all the rest of the world were hastening on to death by reason of their fatal wickednesses.", "4727": "Therefore of necessity the evil ceased on the six hundred and first year of his life, since in truth the destruction came with reference to the sixth number, and safety was restored in unity, since unity is more a generative­ ness of the soul, and is the best for giving life, wherefore also a deficiency of water in the sea takes place at the new moon, in order that the units may be preferred in dignity both among months and years, when God saves those things which are upon the earth ;", "4728": "since the man who cultivates just habits is called by the Hebrews in their native language Noah, but by the Greeks he is named Δίхαιος ;", "4729": "however, he is not exempted from the laws affecting the body.", "4730": "For although he is not subordinate to the power of others, but is a prince, yet still, because he is nevertheless devoted to death, as he is dead, the principle of that number six is connected with unity ;", "4731": "since it was not in one year taken separately that the deluge ceased, but together with the number six (as contained in the number six hundred), which is connected with it according to corporeality and inequality;", "4732": "since the other being a long number is in the first place six (that is to say, six hundred) ;", "4733": "on which account it is said, in the six hundred and first year.", "4734": "But the just man is so in his generation, not in that which is general, nor again in that in which he is just by comparison with the general corruption, but according to some especial generation ;", "4735": "for his generation bears with it a certain comparison.", "4736": "But that man also is deserving of praise whom God selected beyond all other gene­ rations as being considered worthy of life, placing a limit to that life, and to him as being about to be both the end and the beginning of each generation and of each age;", "4737": "the end of that which is corruptible, the beginning of that which is to follow.", "4738": "And truly it is much more proper to praise him who, bending upwards with his whole body, looked up by reason of his friendship with God.", "4739": "What is the meaning of the expression, \"And Noah opened the roof of the ark ?”*46.", "4740": "The text stands in need of no explanation.", "4741": "But with reference to its meaning, because the ark is symbolically our body, we must consider that that is spoken of as the roof of our body, which covers it and for a long time preserves its strength;", "4742": "such is concupiscence, by which the body is pre­ served and made to last, in a moderate degree, that is, and in accordance with the law of nature;", "4743": "as also it is dissolved by pain.", "4744": "When therefore the intellect is attracted by a desire for heavenly things it wishes to spring upwards, and in that way it bursts asunder every appearance of concupiscence ;", "4745": "so that that thing being as it were removed which threw a veil of shade over it and obscured it, it might be able to apply its senses to undisguised and incorporeal natures.", "4746": "Why is it that the earth was dried up in the seventh month, and on the twenty-seventh day ?f47.", "4747": "Do you not see that he here calls that month the seventh, which a little while before he styles the first?", "4748": "for the seventh, as far as relates to time, is the same, as I have said before, as that which is the first in nature, being the beginning of the equinox.", "4749": "But it is with great propriety that the begin­ ning of the deluge is fixed to the seventh month, and the twenty-seventh day of the month;", "4750": "and again, the end and cessation of the deluge is fixed to the same seventh month aDd the same day;", "4751": "for, both the deluge and the removal of life took place at the equinox;", "4752": "the principle of which we have indicated a little time ago ;", "4753": "for the seventh month is found to be synonymous with months and days of this time, and then again, the twenty-seventh day occurs with the same meaning, when the ark rested on the mountains.", "4754": "This is the month which by nature is the seventh, but in point of time the first, which in fact is the month of the equinox.", "4755": "Therefore, at the equinoxes a power of selection is given for seven months and twenty-seven days;", "4756": "for the deluge took place in the seventh month, on which the vernal equinox takes place;", "4757": "so that it is in time the seventh, but in nature the first.", "4758": "And the cessation of the deluge and the display of mercy belong to the same measure, when the ark rested on the tops of the mountains ;", "4759": "again in truth in the seventh month, but not the same month, but in that in which the autumnal equinox occurs;", "4760": "that is to say, the seventh by nature, but the first in point of time.", "4761": "But the most perfect cure, the fact of the evil being wholly dried up, is again fixed to the seventh month and the twenty- seventh day of the vernal season;", "4762": "in order that both the beginning and the end of the deluge might find its boundary at the same season;", "4763": "and that the middle season when human life is repaired, is fixed to the intermediate season.", "4764": "In the meantime that expression is more certainly to be observed, namely, that the whole year, by a strict computation of days, made the deluge equal to the exact time of the remedy;", "4765": "for it began in the six hundredth year of Noah's age, in the seventh month, and on the twenty-seventh day;", "4766": "so that the whole space of the intermediate time completed a perfect year, the beginning being placed at the vernal equinox, and the flood also ending equally at the same epoch of the vernal equinox.", "4767": "And in this manner, after all things on earth, things full of fruit, had undergone destruction, as I have said before, now that the persons who used the fruits were also destroyed, the earth being wholly relieved of all evil was again found full of seeds and fruit-bearing trees, according to the production of spring;", "4768": "for he thought it reasonable that, as the earth after it had suffered the deluge was in a similar con­ dition when dried again to that in which it was before, so it should now show itself, and pay the debt which it owed to nature.", "4769": "Nor ought any one to wonder that in one day the earth when left to itself produced every thing by divine virtue, both seeds and trees, all complete, entirely and suddenly, with perfect and excellent herbs, and grain, and plants, and fruits ;", "4770": "since in the creation of the world on one day of the six he finished and brought to perfection the whole generation of plants.", "4771": "But the present fruits were already perfect in themselves, and produced all kinds of fruits in a manner suitable and corresponding to the season of spring;", "4772": "for all things are possible to God, who scarcely requires time to effect any thing.", "4773": "Why was it that after the earth was dried, Noah did not depart out of the ark, before he had received a fresh command from God, for God said to Noah:", "4774": "\" Go forth, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives, together with all the rest of the living creatures ?\" *48. Justice is commonly inspired with fear, as on the other hand injustice is rash and self-confident.", "4775": "But the proof of a fear of God is the not giving up more to, or guiding one's self more by one's own reason than by God.", "4776": "And above all other men it was natural for that man who had seen the whole earth suddenly become an immense sea, to suspect that it might be possible that the same misfortune would again return.", "4777": "Besides this, he also gave a thought to the corresponding consequence, namely, that as he had entered into the ark at the command of God, so it was fitting that he should also leave it at the command of the same being ;", "4778": "for let no one believe that he can ever do any thing perfectly unless", "4779": "God himself guides him by his preventing precepts.", "4780": "Why, when they entered into the ark was the order as fol­ lows :", "4781": "first himself and his sons, and after them his wife and his sons' wives, but when they went forth the order was changed, for the sacred historian says, \" Noah and his wife went forth, and after them his sons and his sons' wives ?\"t49.", "4782": "By the literal statement the sacred writer gives an obscure intimation, in the order in which they entered, that the propagation of seed was taken away, but by the order of their egress he implies the continuance of the process of generation ;", "4783": "since, while they are entering, the sons are mentioned together with their father, and the daughters-in-law with their mother­ in-law, but when they are going forth the wives are all mated again, the father being accompanied by his wife, and each of his sons also by his wife, since he chose to show by fact rather than by words everything which it is fitting for his friends to do.", "4784": "Moreover he had in express words, and not by any vague intimations, commanded the men, as they were about to enter into the ark, that they while there were to keep themselves from connection with women;", "4785": "but now that they were about to depart from it, he plainly intimates to them that offspring is to be begotten in accordance with nature, by the order in which he appoints their going forth;", "4786": "nor did he employ words only, in order to make his proclamation about the state of the ark, saying, “ After a destruction of all things on earth, of such a character and of such extent, do not indulge in pleasures, for that is not decorous.", "4787": "It is sufficient, however, for you to have received your lives;", "4788": "but while you are actually in the ark, to ascend up into the marriage- bed with your wives would be a proof of your being devoted to lasciviousness.", "4789": "\"And, indeed, it was natural for them, as being relations to those who were being destroyed, to be moved with compassion for the perishing human race, especially because they them­ selves also were still in doubt whether, from some quarter or other, calamity might not fall also upon themselves;", "4790": "and be­ sides these considerations it was absurd, while those who were alive were perishing, for those in the ark to be contriving that others who did not exist should be born, being warm at an unreasonable time, and burning with an inopportune desire.", "4791": "But after the anger of God ceased, then he commanded those who had been delivered from the calamity, when they had again gone forth out of the ark in order, to apply themselves to the procreation of a succeeding generation, when he tells us, that the men did not go forth with the men, nor the women with the women, but the wives with their husbands.", "4792": "But with respect to the inner meaning of this fact, we must say this, that when the mind is about to wash off and cleanse away its sins, then it is fit for male to live with male, that is to say, for the intellect, the chief part of the man, to be as a father, united to each separate thought, as a father to his sons, without any admixture of the female race, which is in accord­ ance with the outward sense;", "4793": "since it is a time of battle, in which it is necessary to keep the order of the cohort distinct.", "4794": "and to preserve it strictly in order, that the soldiers may not be mingled in confusion, and so, instead of gaining a victory over the enemy, be conquered themselves;", "4795": "but when the puri­ fication is completed, and when the soul is dried up from all ignorance, and when a complete deliverance from everything pernicious has taken place, then it becomes the man to collect his scattered forces together, not in order that masculine conn­ sels may be rendered effeminate by softness, but that the female race, that is to say, the outward senses, may clothe them­ selves with the vigour of the male, attaining to masculine coun­ sels, and from their receiving seed for the production of a generation ;", "4796": "so that, from this time forth they may cherish, in all things, sentiments of wisdom, and honour, and justice, and courage, and, in one word, of virtue.", "4797": "But, besides this, it will be reasonable also to take notice, that when once a confusion, in the similitude of a deluge, has overwhelmed the intellect, and when the different senses, being perplexed by the affairs of this world, like so many bulwarks erected against them, begin to quarrel, it is utterly impossible that any one should be able, either to sow, or to conceive, or to generate any good thing.", "4798": "But when all the hostile attacks of various agitations and passions are checked, and when the ceaseless invasions of lawless counsels are repressed, then the soul produces virtue and excellent works, as the most fertile portion of the earth, when dried, produces fruits.", "4799": "Why did Noah build an altar without having been com­ manded to do so ?*5 0.", "4800": "The requital of gratitude which is due to God ought to be offered to him without command, and without any delay or hesitation, showing the mind to be free from vices ;", "4801": "for it be­ comes that man, who has been endued with blessings by God, to offer him his thanks with a grateful and willing mind;", "4802": "but he who delays to do so, waiting for an express command, is ungrateful, being as it were compelled by necessity to honour his benefactor.", "4803": "Why is he said to have built an altar to God, and not to the Lord ?t51.", "4804": "In passages of beneficence and regeneration, as at the creation of the world, the sacred writer only refers to the be­ neficent virtue of the Creator, by which he makes everything in its integrity, and he implies this by concealing the royal name of Lord, as one which bears with it supreme authority;", "4805": "therefore now also, since what he is describing is the begin­ ning of the renewed generation of mankind, he borrows for his description the beneficent virtue, which bears the name of God;", "4806": "for he used the kingly attribute,

first to take these two female animals, the cow and the she-goat;", "5216": "since both these elements, earth and water, are material, and for the most part feminine.", "5217": "But the third he will

corporeal and external blessings, and the Euphrates of spiritual advantages, in which alone, it is plain, their real joy consists, which has wisdom and all the other virtues for its foundation;", "5427": "and the boundaries of this happiness are very rightly described as beginning with the Egyptus and ending with the Euphrates;", "5428": "for the things affecting the soul come at the end, which we usually approach with difficulty after we have passed through corporeal and external things, in such a manner that, by this progress, we have felt our unity, the integrity of our outward senses, and the beauty and strength which existed in our youth, advance, increase, and come to maturity.", "5429": "And in a similar manner, those things which relate to acquiring gain and to trafficking, as the management of ships, and agriculture, and commerce;", "5430": "for it is well said, that all things, especially these above-mentioned, become a young man.", "5431": "Who are the Kenites, the Kenezites, and the Kadmon­ ites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites ?*17.", "5432": "Ten nations of wickedness are here enumerated, which he here destroys because of their neighbourhood, since the number ten, when false and improperly stamped, is very near to that which is good and an object of affection;", "5433": "but the complete perfection of the number ten is exceedingly fit, as being the measure of infinite numbers, since the world is arranged in accordance with it, and so likewise is the mind of the wise man, the substance of which, nevertheless, wickedness perverts and overthrows, despising all very necessary powers, so that that alone remains which the sacred writer has said, namely, that the-pursuit of virtue is a blessing, for the wicked man is such that he embraces vague opinions rather than truth, and of such is Ishmael, though the seed of the prophets.", "5434": "Why it was that Sarah, the wife of Abraham, bore him no children Pf18.", "5435": "The mother of opinion is here spoken of as barren.", "5436": "In the first place in order that the son of generation might appear more wonderful, as being born by a miracle.", "5437": "In the second place in order that his conception and nativity might appear to be owing not more to the marriage of the man than to divine providence.", "5438": "For it is not owing to the faculty of conception that a barren woman should bear a son, but rather to the operation of divine power.", "5439": "This is the literal meaning of the statement.", "5440": "But if we look to its inward sense, then we shall say, in the first place, that to bring forth is peculiar to the female sex, as to beget is the office of the male :", "5441": "therefore", "5442": "God wills in the first place to render the mind, which is filled with virtue, like to the male sex rather than to the female, thinking it suited to its character to be active, not passive.", "5443": "In the second place both do generate, both the virtuous mind and the wicked one:", "5444": "but they generate in a different manner, and they produce contrary offspring, the virtuous mind producing good and useful things, but the depraved or wicked mind producing base and useless things.", "5445": "In the third place he who is still advancing and making progress is to be incited to the summit itself, and is near to the light which by some persons is said to be delivered to oblivion, and to be made unknown.", "5446": "He therefore, as he is making progress, does not generate bad things, nor yet good things, because he is not yet perfect;", "5447": "but he resembles that man who is neither sick nor yet thoroughly well, but who, after a long sickness, is at last proceeding to con­ valescence.", "5448": "What is the meaning of the statement, she had an Egyptian handmaid whose name was Hagar ?*19.", "5449": "Hagar is interpreted travelling, and she is the servant of a more perfect nature, being by nature an Egyptian less naturally;", "5450": "for the study of encyclical learning loves an abundance of knowledge, and abundant knowledge is, as it were, the handmaid of virtue, since the whole course and connection of sciences and arts is subservient to his use who is able to profit by their acquisition so as to attain to virtue, for virtue has the soul for its abode ;", "5451": "but the course of arts and sciences stands in need of bodily instruments.", "5452": "But the body is symbolically Egypt;", "5453": "therefore the sacred writer here properly asserts the likeness of encyclical knowledge to Egypt.", "5454": "Nevertheless he has also given it a name by reason of its travelling abroad, since sophistry is a foreign thing, unconnected with the acquisition of that wisdom which alone is native, and which alone is necessary, which is the mistress of intermediate wisdom, and which conducts itself in a beautiful course through the guidance of encyclical studies.", "5455": "Why did Sarah say to Abraham, Behold the Lord has shut me up so that I shall not bring forth:", "5456": "go in now unto my handmaid so as to beget a son by her?", "5457": "*20.", "5458": "In the actual letter of this statement it is the same thing to feel no envy, and also to provide for the welfare of the wise man who is her husband and her genuine brother;", "5459": "so that she, wishing to find a remedy for her own barrenness by means of her handmaid of whom she was mistress, gives her as a concubine to her husband.", "5460": "But there is a still greater abundance of her affection towards her husband indicated by this ;", "5461": "for as she herself was accounted barren, she did not think it reasonable that the family of her husband should be left entirely without offspring, but preferred his advantage to her own dignity.", "5462": "This is what is indicated by this statement taken literally.", "5463": "But if we look to the inner sense of the passage it bears such an interpretation as this:", "5464": "it becomes those persons who are unable in respect of their virtue to bring forth beautiful works deserving of praise, to apply themselves to the intermediate kind of study, and, if I may so express myself, to procure themselves children from the encyclical branches of knowledge;", "5465": "for an abundance of knowledge is as it were the whetstone of the mind and of the in­ tellect.", "5466": "And it is with great propriety that she says, The Lord has shut me up;", "5467": "for that which is shut up is generally opened again at a seasonable time.", "5468": "Therefore she was not destitute of hope, nor was her wisdom fixed in the belief that she should be for ever without offspring, but she knew that some day or other she should bring forth.", "5469": "Neverthe­ less she will not bring forth at present, but when the soul displays the purity of its perfection.", "5470": "But inasmuch as it is at present imperfect it is satisfied with using a milder kind of learning, such as is attainable by encyclical studies.", "5471": "On which account it is not without a purpose that in the sacred contests at Olympia also, those who are unable to attain to the first prize of victory are contented to be thought worthy of the second;", "5472": "for there is offered to the com­ petitors a first, and a second, and a third prize by the presidents of the games, who are representatives of nature.", "5473": "So now to her the sacred writer attributes the first prize of virtues, and the second prize of encyclical study.", "5474": "Why has he called Abraham's wife Sarah, for he says, Sarah the wife of Abraham, taking her handmaid Hagar the Egyptian, gave her into his hand ?*21.", "5475": "The sacred writer here sums up with his approbation the marriage of the good on account of those who are incontinent and lascivious ;", "5476": "for those • persons despise their wise wives for the sake of concubines, whom they love with a frantic passion:", "5477": "on which account he here introduces the man endued with virtue, the constant husband of one wife, at that time in which it was lawful for him to make use of her handmaid;", "5478": "and his wife in fact indicates that he is wise, that is to say temperate, when he enters into the bed of another woman, since his connection with his concubine was only a connection of the body for the sake of propagat­ ing children ;", "5479": "but his union with his wife was that of two souls joined together in harmony by heavenly affection.", "5480": "This is the literal effect of the statement.", "5481": "But if we look to the inner meaning of it, then he who has truly entrusted all his secret wishes to wisdom, and justice, and the other virtues, when once he has received the counsel of wisdom, and has tasted the joys of a matri­ monial connection with it, remains constant to it as the partner and companion of his life;", "5482": "although encyclical education would lead him in a beautiful course, since when the man eminent in virtue has become master of the sciences of geometry, and arithmetic, and grammar, and rhetoric, and the other exercises of the mind, he is not the less on that account mindful of the pursuit of honesty, but is borne on towards the one as to a necessary aim, to the other as an accessory.", "5483": "But it is altogether fair that that fact also should meet with our approbation,-the fact I mean of his calling his handmaid also by the name of wife, because he went up to her bed out of complacency to and at the exhortation of his real wife, and not of his own genuine inclination ;", "5484": "on which account he no longer calls her his handmaid, that even if it were not wholly deserved still his handmaid having been given to him to wife might at least obtain the same title.", "5485": "But those who study allegory may be allowed to say that the exercise of the middle discipline also stands in the place of a concubine, having nevertheless the shape and orna­ ments of a wife, for all encyclical learning re-produces in itselt and imitates genuine virtue.", "5486": "What is the meaning of, \" When she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised before her ?”*22.

object she was sought out.", "5538": "Nor was she found imperfect, but ready to the hand, since the soul was found which had fled from perfect virtue, not being able to submit to discipline.", "5539": "But the third symbol takes place after she is found and after the discovery has been made by an angel, namely, in the fact of her being found by a fountain, that is to say, by nature ;", "5540": "for it is nature which bestows on clever people abilities in proportion to the industry of each individual, effacing unseasonable learning, which is no learning at all:", "5541": "and praise is implied in

fountain.", "5543": "The fourth symbol is contained in the fact that the discovery took place in the desert;", "5544": "since difficulty coming over each of the outward senses, together with an influx of each separate desire, represses the mind, and does not permit it to drink pure water:", "5545": "but when it cannot avoid these things as in the desert, it acquiesces, and, abandoning the thoughts which agitated and perplexed it, it becomes convalescent, so as to receive a hope not only of life, but even of eternal life.", "5546": "The fifth symbol is contained in the fact that she was found in

symbolical, or indeed a legitimate, figure of an improving soul ?", "5551": "And, in fact, the soul which is improving does not perish as one which is wholly foolish does;", "5552": "for if tha divine

this if we recollect that when it is set in motion by counsels it sounds, and when they are absent it ceases to sound:", "5745": "and the evidences of this are the rhetoricians and philosophers who

wisdom, than which there is nothing more excellent in our nature ?", "5749": "because instead of the sublime erudition of astronomy he gave him intellect, that is to say, instead of a small part of

to whom the cooler portion of the habitable earth has been allotted, are not circumcised, for not only is the solar heat moderate in those regions, but so is also all inflammatory disease which affects the membranes of the members.", "5805": "Let every one take a firm judgment, and from that time when the disease comes in more vigorously;", "5806": "for it never comes at all in the winter, but in the summer it shows itself and flourishes and ripens;", "5807": "for it loves, if I may so say, like fire to burn in those parts.*", "5808": "In the second place, it was not only from a regard to sound health that our ancestors diligently employed this method of cure, but also from a regard to the multiplication of the human race, seeing that nature was very vivacious and too eager to propagate the human species.", "5809": "Therefore they knew, like wise men, how the seed when poured over the folds of the membrane is often accustomed to be wasted and so to become unfruitful;", "5810": "but if no impedi­ ment arises then it would easily be able to arrive at the situation suited to receive it.", "5811": "On which account also those nations which adopt the practice of circumcision have grown into an exceedingly numerous population:", "5812": "and our legislator, weighing the consequences also, commanded the circumcision of infants to be performed at an earlier age, keeping in view the same effect of circumcision with regard to the popula­ tion.", "5813": "Therefore it is in truth, as it seems to me, that the Egyptians also in the fourteenth year of their children's age, in which the desire to propagate the species usually begins, have said that it is suitable to circumcise them, with the view of increasing the population;", "5814": "but it was better and more carefully done in our nation, where the circumcision of infants was ordained, since perhaps the man when grown up would delay the operation out of fear, because he then has a will of his own.", "5815": "In the third place, he says this with a view to cleanliness in the sacred oblations;", "5816": "for in truth those who enter into the courts of the temples are made clean by sprinkling and ablutions.", "5817": "Moreover the Egyptians scrape the whole body, removing all the hairs which cover and envelop the body, so as to appear white all over;", "5818": "but the circumcision of the skin is no small assistance towards cleanliness, otherwise everyone would abhor it when he beheld it as it is in itself.", "5819": "In the fourth place, there are in us two generative prin­ ciples, one in the soul and one in the body;", "5820": "the generative principle of the soul is the intellect, and that of the body is the corporeal organ;", "5821": "therefore the ancients chose to refer the generative principle of the body to an imitation of the intellect which is rather the generative principle of the heart.", "5822": "And in truth there is nothing to which it is found more like than the circumcision of the heart;", "5823": "these therefore are real facts like the celebrated reasons for things which have been inves­ tigated.", "5824": "But we must now speak of those which have greater symbols belonging to them and which exhibit a certain principle.", "5825": "Therefore the circumcision of the skin is said to be a symbol, but as one indicating that it is proper to cut away all superfluous and extravagant desires, by studying conti­ nence and religion;", "5826": "for as the skin of the prepuce is quite superfluous for generation, and is moreover especially injurious by reason of the disease of inflammation which burns within it, so also an over abundance of desire is as super­ fluous as it is pernicious, superfluous because it is not necessary, and pernicious because it is the cause of diseases to both body and soul;", "5827": "and by the greater desire he also warns us that all the other desires are likewise to be cut off.", "5828": "And that is called the greater desire which has a regard to the matrimonial connexion of the male and the female ;", "5829": "since it is the beginning of a great thing, namely, of gene­ rating ;", "5830": "and since it creates a great affection on the part of the father towards her who is to bring forth ;", "5831": "for it is natural for them both to be influenced by love and affection for their offspring.", "5832": "Therefore, he here warns us to cut away not only all the superfluous desires, but also pride, as being a great wickedness and an associate of wickedness.", "5833": "For pride, as the language of the ancients tells us, is what keeps men back and hinders them in their im­ provement ;", "5834": "since it will not exhibit that honesty which it really possesses, thinking that it is itself an adequate cause for anything.", "5835": "Moreover it naturally influences those who think themselves the causes of generation;", "5836": "so that they scarcely ever turn their minds at all to behold the true Father of the universe.", "5837": "For he is in truth the one real and genuine Father of all;", "5838": "and we, who are called fathers, are only instruments of his, serving to generation;", "5839": "since, as in a wonderful resemblance, all things which are repre­ sented in appearance are yet in reality inanimate, but that which strengthens the nerves is invisible, and yet is itself the cause of virtue, and of motion, and of sight.", "5840": "So, in like manner, from everlasting and invisible space there extends the Creator of the universe, and we, like so many pup­ pets, are strengthened by him with nerves for the purpose which belongs to us, namely, sowing seed and raising a generation ;", "5841": "unless we choose to fancy that a flute is blown by itself, and is not made by an artist in a way adapted for the production of harmony, by whom it was constructed as an instrument for service and for its own necessary end.", "5842": "Why does he order circumcision to be performed on the eighth day?", "5843": "*49.", "5844": "The number eight has many beauties in it;", "5845": "for it is, in the first place, a cubic number.", "5846": "Secondly, it has beauties, because it everywhere contains in itself the form of equality, because longitude, and breadth, and depth, which are all equal to one another, are indicated by the first number eight.", "5847": "In the third place, the composition of the number eight produces agreement, namely, the number thirty-six, which the Pythagoreans call agreement, since that is the first number in which odd numbers being added together agree with even numbers.", "5848": "If, indeed, four odd numbers from the unit are separately taken and added together and four even numbers beginning with two, they united make thirty-six.", "5849": "Now the odd numbers are these:", "5850": "one, three, five, seven, which make sixteen.", "5851": "And the even numbers are these:", "5852": "two, four, six, eight, which make twenty.", "5853": "And the addition of the two together makes thirty-six, which is in truth a more fertile number.", "5854": "Since it is a square, having each side composed of the number six;", "5855": "the first of which is both odd and even;", "5856": "which some persons most correctly call harmony or matrimony;", "5857": "and it was by the employment of this number that the Cre­ ator of the universe made the world, as the holy and admirable book of Moses relates.", "5858": "In the fourth place, the idea of eight produces sixty- four, which is the first number, which is a cube and also a square, being the type of incorporeal substance appreciable only by the intellect and invisible, and also of corporeal substance.", "5859": "Of incorporeal substance, inasmuch as it produces superficies according to the square;", "5860": "and of corporeal sub­ stance, as producing a solid according to the cube.", "5861": "In the fifth place, it is always a kindred number to the virgin number seven, for seven makes up the parts of eight;", "5862": "because four is the half of it, two is the fourth part of it, one the eighth of it, and four, two, and one, added together, make seven.", "5863": "In the sixth place, the power of eight is sixty-four, which we call the first number, being both a cube and a square.", "5864": "In the seventh place, taken separately from the units by these doubled numbers, one, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, the sum makes sixty-four.", "5865": "And the number eight has also other more distinguished virtues still, which we have enumerated in another place;", "5866": "but now it seems better to explain the principle which cor­ responds to the present question, and which depends on the grounds now laid down.", "5867": "But in the first place we must premise this:", "5868": "that nation to whom it is enjoined, having the commandments given to it, that it should be circumcised on the eighth day, is called in the Chaldaic language Israel, that is to say, “ he that seeth by day.\"", "5869": "Therefore God wills, in the first place, that he should be a partaker both of his own just rights, and also of those which exist according to election, and according to the principle of Genesis (or creation), by that first number six, which immediately followed the creation.", "5870": "This number, in fact, the Father and Creator of all things evidently exhibited to the world as the festival of generation, com­ pleting the world on the sixth day.", "5871": "And the other number, that which is according to election, he exhibited by the number eight, which is the beginning of the second seven;", "5872": "as eight is seven and one, so the race which has been honoured is always a race receiving that number also in ad­ dition, so that it should be elect, both by nature and in accordance with the decree of the Father.", "5873": "In the second place, the number eight exhibits equality everywhere, showing that all its separations are equal, as has been aleady said, I mean its length, and breadth, and depth.", "5874": "And equality it is which is the parent of equity and justice, by which he shows that the nation which loves God is adorned with equity or justice, and has advanced to complete possession.", "5875": "In the third place, eight is not only a measure of com­ plete equity in all its dimensions, but is the very first number that is so, for it is the first cube;", "5876": "since the number eight indicates equality, and so it has the second and not the first rank:", "5877": "therefore it demonstrates in a symbolical manner that that nature", "5878": "Was the first which was ever com­ pletely furnished with consummate and perfect equity and justice, and that it is the first nature of the human race, not in point of creation or of time, but in the dignity of virtue, as if justice united with equality were a connatural part of it.", "5879": "In the fourth place, since there are four elements, the ap­ pearances of earth, water, air, and fire;", "5880": "fire has received for its figure a shape becoming a similar name, a pyramid;", "5881": "* and air has received for its figure an eight-sided one;", "5882": "water, a twenty-sided one;", "5883": "and the earth, a cube.", "5884": "Therefore he thought it necessary that the earth, which was to be the allotment of the race of man, who were endowed with virtue, should participate in the cubic number, as the whole earth has been formed in its figure.", "5885": "And a part of it receives the parts of that which should bring forth, because by nature the earth is very fertile, producing all the various and distinct species of every kind of animal and plant.", "5886": "Why does he order all slaves to be circumcised, those born in the family and also those who are bought ?+50.", "5887": "The literal meaning is plain;", "5888": "for it is fitting that servants should imitate their masters on account of their necessary employment, and the services to which they are bound in life.", "5889": "But with respect to the inner object of the command, those dispositions are what may be called born in the family which are influenced by nature itself, and those are bought which can be changed for the better by teaching and instruction.", "5890": "Each of these has its appropriate employ­ ment, and requires like a plant to be cleared and pruned in order that the good and fruitful parts may acquire constancy;", "5891": "for fertile plants produce many superfluous things by reason of their fecundity, and those superfluities must be cut away;", "5892": "but those who are taught by instructors cut away their ignorance.", "5893": "What is the meaning of, \" And it shall be my covenant (or agreement) in your flesh ? \" *51.

the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there.", "18": "And one man said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks, and let us burr them with fire;", "19": "and they had

accuse the laws, being impious men, use these and similar instances as foundations for their impiety, saying, .. Are ye even now speaking boastfully concerning your precepts, as if they contained the rules of truth itself?", "29": "For, behold, the books which you call the sacred scriptures do also contain fables, at which you are accustomed to laugh, when you hear others re­ lating them.\"", "30": "And what is the use of devoting our leisure to collecting the fables interspersed in so many places throughout the history of the giving of the law, as if we had especial leisure for the consideration of calumnies, and as if it were not better to attend merely to what is under our hands and before us ?", "31": "Certainly, this one fable resembles that which is composed about the Aloadæ, who the greatest and most glorious of all poets, Homer, says, had in contemplation to heap the three loftiest mountains on one another, and to build them into one mass, hoping that by this means there would be a road for them, as they were desirous to mount up to heaven, and that by these mountains it would be easy for them to be raised to the height of the sky.", "32": "And the verses of Homer on this sub­ ject are these :", "33": "— High on Olympus' top they strove to raise Gigantic Ossa;", "34": "and on Ossa's heights", "35": "To place the leafy Pelion, that heaven Might thus become accessible.", "36": "But Olympus and Ossa and Pelion are the names of moun­ tains.", "37": "But instead of these

grievous;", "39": "for even if every portion of the whole earth could he built over, a slight founda­ tion being first laid, and then if a superstructure could be raised in the fashion of a single pillar, it would still be an enormous distance removed from the heavenly sphere, and above all would it be so according to the tenets of those curious philosophers who have affirmed that the earth is the centre of the universe.", "40": "III.", "41": "And there is also another story akin to this, related by the devisers of fables, concerning the sameness of language existing among animals:", "42": "for they say that formerly, all the animals in the world, whether land animals, or aquatic ones.", "43": "or winged ones, had but one language, and that, just as among men Greeks speak the same language as Greeks, and the present race of barbarians speak the same language as barba­ flans, exactly in the same manner every animal was able to converse with every other animal with which it might meet, and with which it did anything, or from which it suffered any­ thing.", "44": "so that they sympathised with one another at their mutual misfortunes, and rejoiced whenever any of them met with any good fortune;", "45": "for they could impart their pleasures and their annoyances to one another by their sameness of lan­ guage.", "46": "so that they felt pleasure together and pain together;", "47": "and this similarity of manners and union of feelings lasted, until being sated with the great abundance of good things which they enjoyed, as often happens, they were at last drawn on to a desire of what was unattainable, and even sent an em­ bassy to treat for immortality, requesting to be released from old age, and to be always endowed with the vigour of youth, saying, that already one animal of their body, and that a rEp­ tile, the serpent, bad received this gift;", "48": "for he, having put off old age.", "49": "was allowed again to grow young;", "50": "and that it was absurd for the more important animals to be left behind by an inferior one, or for their whole body to be distanced by one.", "51": "However, they suffered the punishment suitable to their auda­ city, for they immediately were separated in their language, so that, from that time forth, they have not been able to under­ stand one another, by reason of the difference in the dialects into which the one common language of them all had been divided.", "52": "IV.", "53": "But he who brings his account nearer the truth, has dis­ tinguished between the rational and irrational animals, so that lie testifies that identity of language belonged to men alone :", "54": "and this also, as they say, is a fabulous story.", "55": "And indeed they affirm, that the separation of language into an infinite variety of dialects, which Moses calls the confusion of tongues.", "56": "was effected as a remedy for sins, in order that men might not be able to co-operate in common for deeds of wickedness through understanding one another;", "57": "and that they might not, when they were in a manner deprived of all means of communica­ tion with one another, be able with united energies to apply themselves to the same actions.", "58": "But this precaution does not appear to have turned out of any use;", "59": "for since that time, though men have been separated into different nations, and have no longer used one language, nevertheless, land and sea have been repeatedly filled with unspeakable evils.", "60": "For it was -.t the languages which were the causes of men's uniting for evil objects, but the emulation and rivalry of their souls in wrong-doing.", "61": "For even those who have had their tongues cut out can intimate what they wish by nods and looks, and other positions and motions of the body, not less than by a distinct utterance of words.", "62": "And besides this con­ sideration, there is the fact that, very often, one nation by it­ self, having not merely one language, but one code of laws, and one system of manners, has arrived at such a pitch of iniquity that, as to a superfluity of wickedness, it may counterbalance the sins of all the men in the world put together.", "63": "And again, through ignorance of foreign languages, many persons, having no foreknowledge of the future, have been anticipated and overwhelmed by those who were plotting against them;", "64": "as, on the other hand, by knowledge of foreign languages, men have been able to repel fears and dangers with which they have been threatened ;", "65": "so that a community of language is an advanta­ geous thing rather than an injurious one :", "66": "since, even at the present day, nothing contributes so greatly to the safety and protection of the people of each country, and particularly of the natives, as their being of one language.", "67": "For if a man has learnt many dialects, he immediately is looked upon with considera­ tion and respect by those who are also acquainted with them, as being already a friendly person, and contributing no small introduction and means of friendship by reason of his famili­ arity with words which they too understand ;", "68": "which familiarity very commonly imparts a feeling of security, that one is not likely to suffer any great evil at the hands of such a man.", "69": "Why, then, did God remove sameness of language from among men as a cause of evils, when it seems it should rather have been established as a most useful thing ?V.", "70": "Those, then, who put these things together, and cavil at them, and raise malicious objections, will be easily refuted separately by those who can produce ready solutions of all such questions as arise from the plain words of the law, arguing in a spirit far from contentious, and not encountering them by sophisms drawn from any other source, but following the con­ nection of natural consequences, which does not permit them to stumble, but which easily puts aside any impediments that arise, so that the course of their arguments proceeds without any interruption or mishap.", "71": "We say then that by the expression, that an the earth had but one pronunciation and one language,\" is intimated a sym­ phony of great and unspeakable evils, which cities have in­ flicted upon cities, nations upon nations, and countries upon countries, and through which men not only wrong one another, but also behave with impiety towards God, and yet these things are the iniquities of many ;", "72": "but let us consider the in­ enable multitude of evils which proceed from each individual man, and especially when he is under the influence of that ill-timed, and inharmonious, and unmusical agreement.", "73": "VI.", "74": "Now who is there who does not know the great in­ fluence of fortune, when men, in addition to the diseases or mutilations of the body, are attacked also by poverty and want of reputation ?", "75": "And again, when these things are further united to diseases of the soul, in consequence of moody melancholy, driving men beside themselves, or of extreme old age, or of any other severe calamity which presses upon them ?", "76": "For even one of these evils here mentioned by itself, when it opposes a man with violence, is sufficient to overthrow and to crush even one who is very proud and haughty;", "77": "but when all these evils, to wit, the evils of the body, and the evils of the soul, and external misfortunes, all come together as if in one regular battalion, moving by previous arrangement at the same time, so as to attack him in one body, what reso­ lution is there which they will not overpower?", "78": "For when the guards are slain, it follows of necessity that he who relies on his guards must fall.", "79": "Now the guards of the body are wealth, glory, and honours, which set it up and raise it on high, and make it proud, just as the contrary things, dishonour, want of reputation, and poverty, throw it down like so many enemies.", "80": "Again, the body-guards of the soul are hearing, and seeing, and smelling, and taste, and the whole band of the outward senses, and also health, and strength, and vigour, and energy.", "81": "For the mind, when walking among and living in the company of these things, as between well-fortified boundaries firmly standing and solidly established, triumphs and rejoices, meeting with no hindrance on any side to prevent it from exerting its own impulses, but having its road in every direc­ tion easy, and level, and open, and easy to be travelled.", "82": "But the things which are set in opposition and hostility to these guards are mutilation of the organs of the outward senses, and disease, as I have said before, by which the mind is often pre­ cipitated into disaster;", "83": "and these things are all the results of fortune, very grievous and intrinsically miserable, but still, if compared with those which are brought on ourselves by our own deliberate will, they are far lighter.", "84": "VII.", "85": "Let us now again in its turn consider what is the united body of evils voluntarily incurred.", "86": "Our soul being capable of being divided into three divisions, one division is said to have fallen to the lot of the mind and of reason, the second to passion, and the third to appetite ;", "87": "and each sepa­ rate one of these has its own peculiar evils, and also they have all common and mutual diseases.", "88": "Since the mind reaps the harvest which folly, and cowardice, and intemperance, and in­ justice sow;", "89": "and passion brings forth frantic and insane strife and conflict, and all the other numerous evils with which it is pregnant;", "90": "and appetite disseminates in every direction the impetuous and fickle loves of youth which descend upon every object, animate or inanimate, which it chances to meet with.", "91": "For then, as if in any vessel, the sailors, and the passengers, and the pilots, had all, under the influence of insanity, agreed to destroy it, those who have joined in the plot against it are none the less involved in the same destruction.", "92": "For the heaviest of all evils, and almost the only one that is incurable, is the unanimous energy of all the parts of the soul agreeing to commit sin, not one of the parts being able to act with soundness (just as is the case in an evil affecting the whole people), so as to heal those that are sick ;", "93": "but even the physicians being diseased as well as their patients, whom the pestilential disease has overwhelmed and weighs down under a confessed calamity.", "94": "Of this great evil, that great deluge described by the law­ giver is an image;", "95": "for the torrents from heaven continually pouring down cataracts of wickedness itself with impetuous violence, and springs from the ground (by which I mean the body) continually bursting up and pouring forth streams of every passion in great numbers and vast size, which, uniting and being mingled in the same stream with the other waters, are thrown into confusion, and overthrow the whole region of the soul which has received them with incessant eddies and whirlpools.", "96": "\"For,\" says Moses, \"the Lord God, seeing that the wickedness of men were multiplied upon the earth, and that every one did think continually in his heart nothing but evil all his days, determined to punish mail \" (and here by man I understand the mind, together with all the reptiles and winged creatures, and all the rest of the multitude of wild animals which surround him), by reason of his incurable wickedness;", "97": "and the punishment which God decided upon was the deluge.", "98": "For there was unbounded free­ dom in sinning, and unlimited licence in doing wrong, no one hindering it, but all restraints being shamelessly broken down in such a way that there was no fear left behind to restrain those who were thoroughly ready to snatch at abundant supplies for enjoyment of every kind.", "99": "And may we not say that this was natural ?", "100": "For it was not only one portion of the soul which was corrupted in such a way that it could still be preserved by the sound condition of the other parts ;", "101": "but there was no part whatever of it which was left free from disease or from cor­ ruption.", "102": "For the incorruptible Judge, says Moses, seeing that every thought of man's heart (not one single idea by itself) was evil continually, inflicted upon him a deserved punishment.", "103": "VIII.", "104": "These are they who made a treaty with one another in the valley of Salt.\"*", "105":

aloof;", "112": "but, as he says, “ The whole people surrounded the house all together, both old and young,\" having entered into a conspiracy against all those holy actions and words which it is customary to call angels.", "113": "IX.", "114": "But Moses, the prophet of God, will meet them and check them though they come on with exceeding boldness;", "115": "even though, placing in the front

stand still is regarded as characteristic of tranquillity.", "125": "But the prophet does not here say things which are incon sistent, but rather such as are exceedingly in accordance with nature;", "126": "for the man whose mind is naturally disposed to be tranquil, and is established undeviatingly, must necessarily be at variance with all those who delight in disorder and con­ fusion, and who by artificial storms seek to disturb him who is capable of enjoying tranquillity.", "127": "X.", "128": "It is very appropriately said that the meeting took place on the bank of the river;", "129": "but the banks are also called the lips, and the lips are the boundaries of the mouth, and are a sort of fence to the tongue, through which the stream of discourse is borne, when it begins to be uttered ;", "130": "but those who hate virtue and who love learning, use speech as their ally for the exposition of doctrines which are disapproved;", "131": "and again on the other hand, virtuous men employ it for the refutation of such doctrines, and for establishing the irresistible strength of the better and true wisdom.", "132": "When then, after having had recourse to every expedient of contentious doctrines, men are destroyed, being overwhelmed by the opposing violence of contrary arguments, then the wise man will very justly and suitably establish a most sacred chorus, and melodiously sing a triumphal song;", "133": "\" For,\" says Moses, \" Israel saw the Egyptians,\" not dead in any other place, but \"on the bank (χε̃ιλος) of the river;", "134": "\"* meaning here by death, not the separation of the soul from the body, but the impetuous onset of unholy doctrines and assertions, which men utter by the mouth, and tongue, and the other organs of speech.", "135": "But the death of speech is silence, not that silence which well-bred people cultivate, making it a symbol of modesty­ for this silence is itself a faculty and a sister of that one which is developed in speech, arranging what is to be said with reference to time-but that silence which the sick and the weary against their will endure, on account of the strength of their antagonists, because they cannot find any handle to answer them ;", "136": "for whatever they touch slips away from them, and whatever thing they seek to take their stand on does not remain, so that they of necessity fall before they stand, like that hydrostatic machine called the helix;", "137": "for in the middle of that engine there are some steps, which the husbandman when he desires to water his fields mounts up

things of clay with the most grievous and intolerable labours, at which it is very naturally pained, and at which it groans, having laid up this, as it were, to be its only treasure amid its evils,

eyes of our body look upon the appearance of the sun by day and of the moon by night as standing still, and yet who is there who does not know that the rapidity of movements of these two bodies is incomparable, since they go round the whole heaven in one day ?", "311": "Thus, indeed, the universal heaven itself also, while appearing to stand still, revolves in a circle ;", "312": "its move­

good will not permit their buildings to be esta.", "322": "blished in indissoluble safety, their work of melting zeal not being able to withstand, but becoming like soft mud.", "323": "For, if their

unalterable power;", "324": "but since, on the contrary, their mortar became mere slime, we must not despair, for there is in this, certain hope that the strong forti­ fications of vice may be

strong palace for the tyrant vice, whose feet shall walk upon the earth, and its head shall, through pride, be raised to such a height as to reach even to heaven ;", "350": "for, in good truth, it rests not only upon human sins, but it also hastens forward as far as heaven, pushing up its words of impiety and ungod­ liness, since it either speaks of God so as to assert that he has no existence,

reality most notorious, which are inflicted by God.", "376": "For all the most wicked of men adopt ideas that they can never escape the knowledge of the deity when doing wrong, and that they shall never be able to ward off alto­ gether the day of retribution.", "377": "Since otherwise, how do they know that they will be dispersed ?", "378": "And yet they say, \" Before we are dispersed.\"", "379": "But their conscience, which is within, con­ victs them, and pricks them vehemently, when devoting them­ selves to ungodliness, so as to draw them against their will to a confession that all the circumstances affecting men are over­ looked by a superior nature, and that justice is watching above, as an incorruptible chastiser, hating the unjust actions of the impious, and the reasonings and speeches which undertake their defence.", "380": "XXV.", "381": "But all these men are the offspring of that wicked­ ness which is always dying but which never dies, the name of which is Cain.", "382": "Is not Cain represented as having begotten a son whom he called Enoch,* and as building a city to which he gave the same name, and as after a fashion building up created and mortal things to the destruction of those things which have received a more divine formation ?", "383": "For the name Enoch, being interpreted, means \"thy grace.\"", "384": "But every impious man supposes that what he thinks and understands is owing to the bounty of his intellect towards him;", "385": "that what he sees is the gift of his eyes to him, what he hears of his ears, what he smells of his nostrils, and so that each of his outward senses bestows on him those perceptions which are in accordance with them.", "386": "Again, that it is the organs of the voice which endow him with the capacity of speaking, and that there is actually no such thing as a God at all, or at all events that he is not the primary cause of things.", "387": "Because of these views he assigns to himself the first fruits of the fruits which he extracts from the earth by his husbandry, being contented afterwards to offer to God some of the fruit, and that too though he has a sound example at hand ;", "388": "for his brother offers a sacrifice of the offspring of the flock, offer­ ing the firstborn, and not those which are of secondary value ;", "389": "confessing that the eldest causes of all existing things are suited to the eldest and first cause.", "390": "But the impious man thinks exactly the contrary, namely, that the mind is endowed with absolute power to do whatever it desires, and that the outward senses have absolute power as to all that they feel, for that both the mind and the outward senses decide in an irreproachable and unerring manner, the one on bodies, and the other on everything.", "391": "Now what can be more open to blame, or more capable of conviction by truth, than such ideas as these ?", "392": "Has not the mind been repeatedly convicted of innumerable acts of folly ?", "393": "And have not all the outward senses been convicted of bearing false witness, and that too not by irrational judges who, it is natural to suppose, may be deceived, but before the tribunal of nature herself, which it is impossible to corrupt or to pervert ?", "394": "And indeed as the criteria both of our mind and of our outward senses are liable to error respecting even ourselves, it follows of necessity that we must make the corresponding confession that God sheds upon the mind the power of intel­ lect, and on the outward senses the faculty of apprehension, and that these benefits are conferred upon us not by our own members but by him to whom also we owe our existence.", "395": "XXVI.", "396": "The children who have received from their father the inheritance of self-love are eager to go on increasing up to heaven, until justice, which loves virtue and hates iniquity, coming destroys their cities which they have built up by the side of their miserable souls, and the tower the name of which is displayed in the book which is entitled the Book of Judg­ ment.", "397": "And the name is, as the Hebrews say, Phanuel, which translated into our language means, “ turning away from God.\"", "398": "For any strong building which is erected by means of plausible arguments is not built for the sake of any other object except that of averting and alienating the mind from the honour due to God, than which object what can be more iniquitous?", "399": "But for the destruction of this strong fortifica­ tion a ravager and an enemy of iniquity is prepared who is always full of hostility towards it;", "400": "whom the Hebrews call Gideon;", "401": "which name being interpreted means, \" a retreat for robbers.\"", "402": "\"For,\" says Moses, \" Gideon swore to the men of Phanuel, saying, On the day when I return victorious in peace, I will overthrow this tower.\" *", "403": "A very beautiful and most becoming boast for the soul which hates wickedness and is sharpened against the impious, namely, that it is resolved to overthrow every reasoning which by its persuasions seeks to turn the mind away from holiness, and this indeed is the natural result.", "404": "For when the mind turns round, then that which turns away from it, and rejects it is again dissolved, and this is the opportunity for destroying it which (a most wonderful thing) he calls not war but peace.", "405": "For, owing to the stability and firmness of the mind which piety is accus­ tomed to produce, every reasoning which impiety has formed is overturned.", "406": "Many also have even erected the outward senses after the fashion of a tower, raising them to such a height as to be able to reach the very borders of heaven.", "407": "But the term heaven is here used symbolically to signify our mind, according to which the best and most divine natures revolve.", "408": "But they who dare such deeds prefer the outward senses to the intellect, and desire by means of the outward senses forcibly to destroy all the objects of intellect, compelling those things which are, at present masters to descend into the rank of servants, and rais­ ing those things which are by nature slaves to the rank of masters.", "409": "XXVII.", "410": "And the statement, \" The Lord went down to see that city and that tower \" must be listened to altogether as if spoken in a figurative sense.", "411": "For to think that the divinity can go towards, or go from, or go down, or go to meet, or, in short, that it has the same positions and motions as particular animals, and that it is susceptible of real motion at all, is, to use a common proverb, an impiety deserving of being banished beyond the sea and beyond the world.", "412": "But these things are spoken, as if of man, by the lawgiver, of God who is not invested with human form, for the sake of advantage to us who are to be instructed, as I have often said before with reference to other passages.", "413": "Since who is there who does not know that it is indispensable for a person who goes down, to leave one place and to occupy another ?", "414": "But all places are filled at once by God, who surrounds them all and is not surrounded by any of them, to whom alone it is possible to be everywhere and also nowhere.", "415": "Nowhere, because he himself created place and space at the same time that he created bodies, and it is impious to say that the Creator is contained in anything that he has created.", "416": "Again, he is everywhere, because, having extended his powers so as to make them pervade earth, and water, and air, and heaven, he has left no portion of the world desolate, but, hav­ ing collected everything together, he has bound them with chains which cannot be burst,* so that they are never eman­ cipated, on which account he is especially to be praised with hymns.", "417": "For that which is higher than all powers is understood to exceed them, not merely in the fact of its existence.", "418": "But the power of this being which made and arranged everything is with perfect truth called God, and it contains everything in its bosom, and pervades every portion of the universe.", "419": "But the divine being, both invisible and incomprehensible, is indeed everywhere, but still, in truth, he is nowhere visible or com­ prehensible.", "420": "But when he says, \" I am he who stands before thee, ”† he appears indeed to be displayed and to be compre­ hended, though before any exhibition or conception he was superior to all created things.", "421": "Therefore, no one of the words which implies a motion from place to place is appropriate to that God who exists only in essence ;", "422": "such expressions, I mean, as going upwards or downwards, to the right or to the left, forwards or backwards.", "423": "For he is not conceived of in any one of the above mentioned ideas, inasmuch as he never turns round or changes his place.", "424": "But, nevertheless, he is said to have come down and to have seen, he who by his foreknowledge comprehends everything, not only that has happened, but even before it happens;", "425": "and this expression is used for the sake of exhortation and instruc­ 'tion, in order that no man, indulging in uncertain conjectures about matters which he is not present to behold may, while standing afar off, be too prompt to believe idle fancies, but that every one may come close to the facts, and examining each one separately, may carefully and thoroughly consider them.", "426": "For certain sight is more deserving to be looked upon as a trustworthy witness than fallacious hearing.", "427": "On which account a law has been enacted among those nations which have the most excellent constitution, that one must not give evidence on hearsay, because by its own nature the tribunal of the sense of hearing is liable to be corrupted.", "428": "And Moses indeed says in the prohibitory part of his law, “Thou shalt not receive vain hearing.''*", "429": "Meaning not only this, that one ought not to receive false or silly reports by hearsay, but that, as far as the clear comprehension of the truth is concerned, the hearing is a long way behind the sight, being full of vanity.", "430": "XXVIII.", "431": "We say that this is the reason why it is said that God went down to see the city and the tower ;", "432": "and the

hidden meaning concealed under these apparently plain words which we must trace out.", "437": "What then is this hidden meaning ?", "438": "Those who, as it were, attribute many fathers to existing things, and who represent the company of the gods as nume­ rous, displaying great ignorance of the nature of things and causing great confusion, and making pleasure the proper object of the soul, are

seeds, all into one mass ;", "587": "but conbination is not a placing side by side, but rather a mutual penetration of dissimilar parts entering into one another at all points, so that the distinctive qualities are still able to be distinguished by some artificial skill, as they say is the case with respect to wine and water;", "588": "for these substances coming together form a combination, but that which is combined is not the less capable of being resolved again into the distinctive qualities from which it was originally formed.", "589": "For with a sponge saturated with oil it is possible for the water to be taken up and for the wine to be left behind, which may perhaps be because the origin of sponge is derived from water, and therefore it is natural that water being a kindred substance is calculated by nature to be taken up by the sponge out of the combination, but that that substance which is of a different nature, namely the wine, is naturally left behind.", "590": "But confusion is the destruction of all the original distinctive qualities, owing to their component parts penetrating one an­ other at every point, so as to generate one thing wholly differ­ ent, as is

acquired ;", "753": "for how can it be possible to acquire possession of those things which are endowed in the same degree with the diviner attributes ?", "754": "But it is not impos­ sible to see them, though it may not be given to all men to do so, for this may be permitted only to the purest and most acute-sighted race, to whom the father of the universe, when he displays his own works, is giving the greatest of all gifts.", "755": "For what life can be better than that which is devoted to speculation, or what can be more closely connected with rational existence ;", "756": "for which reason it is that though the voices of mortal beings are judged of by the faculty of hearing, nevertheless the scriptures present to us the words of God, to be actually visible to us like light;", "757": "for in them it is said that, .. All the people saw the voice of God;", "758": "”* they do not say, .. heard it,\" since what took place was not a beating of the air by means of the organs of the mouth and tongue, but a most exceedingly brilliant ray of virtue, not different in any respect from the source of reason, which also in another passage is spoken of in the following manner, \" Ye have seen that I spake unto you from out of heaven,”† not \"Ye have heard,\" for the same reason.", "759": "But there are passages where he distinguishes between what is heard and what is seen, and between the sense of seeing and that of hearing, as where he says, \" Ye heard the sound of the words, but ye saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice speaking here with excessive precision;", "760": "for the discourse which was divided into nouns and verbs, and in short into all the different parts of speech, he has very appropriately spoken of as something to be heard;", "761": "for in fact that is examined by the sense of hearing;", "762": "but that which has nothing to do with either nouns or verbs, but is the voice of God, and seen by the eye of the soul, he very properly represents as visible;", "763": "and having previously reminded them, \" Ye saw no similitude,\" he proceeds to say, “ Only ye heard a voice, which ye all saw;", "764": "\" for this must be what is understood as implied in those words.", "765":

speech, have for their judge the sense of hearing.", "767": "But as the writer being new in all kinds of knowledge, has also introduced this novelty both in his accounts of domestic and of foreign matters, saying that the voice is a thing to be judged of by the sight, which in point of fact is almost the only thing in us which is not an object of sight, with the single exception of the mind ;", "768": "for the things which are the objects ot the rest of the outward senses are, every one of them, visible to the sight, such as colours, tastes, smells, things that are hot or cold, things that are smooth or rough, things that are soft or hard, inasmuch as they are substantial bodies.", "769": "And what is meant by this I will explain more distinctly :", "770": "a flavour is appreciable by the sight, not inasmuch as it is flavour, but so far as it is a mere substance, for in so far as it is flavour the sense of taste will judge of it;", "771": "again a smell, in so far as it is a smell, will be decided upon by the nostrils, but inasmuch as it is a bodily substance, it will also be judged of by the eyes :", "772": "and the other objects of sense will be tested in this manner;", "773": "but voice is not appreciable by the sense of sight, neither inasmuch as it is a body, if indeed it is a body at all, nor inasmuch as it can be heard ;", "774": "but there are these two things in us which are wholly invisible-mind and speech ;", "775": "but the sound that proceeds from us does not the least resemble the divine organ of voice ;", "776": "for one organ of voice is mingled with the air, and flies to a kindred region with itself, namely to the ears ;", "777": "but the divine organ consists of unmixed and unalloyed speech, which outstrips the sense of hearing by reason of its fineness, and which is discerned by a pure soul, by means of its acuteness in the faculty of sight.X.", "778": "Therefore, after having left all mortal things, God, as I have said before, gives, as his first gift to the soul, an exhibition and an opportunity of contemplating mortal things:", "779": "and in the second place he gives it an improvement in the doctrines of virtue, in respect both of their numbers and of their im­ portance;", "780": "for he says, \"And I will make thee into a mighty nation,\" using this expression with reference to the multitude of the nation, and with reference to the increase and im­ provement of what was already great;", "781": "and that this quantity in each kind, that is to say, both as to magnitude and as to number, was greatly increased, is pointed out by the king of Egypt, where he says, “For behold,\" says he, .. the race of the children of Israel is a great multitude.", "782": "\"", "783": "*Since both these facts bear witness to the race which had the power of beholding the living God, that it had derived increase both in number and in magnitude, and as having done so, had met with prosperity, both in its life and in its language ;", "784":

subjects of speculation, unless each of them receives a power of growth to a suitable size;", "786": "for in like manner a field is not perfect in which there are in­ numerable plants growing on the ground, and no plant has grown up by means of the skill of the husbandman so as to arrive at perfection, unless it is now able to produce fruit.", "787": "But the beginning and the end of the greatness and numerousness of good things is the ceaseless and uninterrupted recollection of God, and an invocation of his assistance in the civil and domestic, confused and continual, warfare of life

near steadily, and without any amazement or display.", "796": "This is the definition of great, to be near to God, or at least to be near to that thing to which God is near;", "797": "forsooth the world and the wise citizen of the world are both full of many and great good things, but all the rest of the multitude of men is involved in numerous evils, and in but few good things;", "798": "for

plain maked truth by itself, whom the sacred scripture teaches not to neglect a good reputation, and not to break through any established customs which divine men of greater wisdom than any in our time have enacted or established.", "914": "For although the seventh day is a lesson to teach us the power which exists in the uncreated God, and also that the creature is entitled to rest from his

that earthly wealth which is perceptible by the outward senses, fat and fertile, having drained off its opposite, namely poverty, from the soul and from all its parts.", "945": "But if you examine the great high priest, that is to say reason, you will find him entertaining ideas in harmony with these, and having his sacred garments richly embroidered by all the powers which are comprehensible

outward senses;", "951": "of which the facul­ ties of hearing and of seeing are the judges.", "952": "And he adds, with exceeding accuracy of investigation, \" The voice of him shall be heard as he enters into the holy place,\" in order that when the soul enters into the places appreciable by theintel­ lect, and divine, and truly holy, the very outward senses may likewise be benefited, and may sound in unison, in accordance with virtue ;", "953": "and our whole system, like a melodious chorus of many men, may sing in concert one well-harmonised melody composed of different sounds well combined, the thoughts in­ spiring the leading notes (for the objects of intellect are the leaders of the chorus) ;", "954": "and the objects of the external senses, singing in melodies, accord the symphonies which follow, which are compared to individual members of the chorus.", "955": "For, in short, as the law says, it was not right for the soul to be deprived of \" its necessaries, and its garments, and its place of abode,”‡ these three things;", "956": "but it ought rather to have had each of them allotted to it in a durable manner.", "957": "Now the necessaries of the soul are those

deserving of blame.", "978": "But it is not so much the power of those who utter or who write praise or blame that is trusted to, as the real character of what is due ;", "979": "so that those persons

them with their mouths, but who are continually cursing them in their hearts ?", "981": "What, then, would any one in his senses say?", "982": "Would he not pronounce that those who speak thus are, in reality, enemies rather than friends, and do in reality blame them rather than praise them, even if they put together whole dramas full of panegyric and sing them in their honour ?", "983":

panegyrics on the seeing multitude, Israel, going through a countless body of particulars, is rightly judged by the wise lawgiver to have been an impious man and accursed, and to have been cursing rather than blessing;", "984": "for he says that he was hired for money by the enemy, and so be­ came an evil prophet of evil things, bearing in his soul most bitter curses against the God loving nature, but being com­ pelled to utter prophetically with his mouth and tongue the most exquisite and sublime prayers in their favour;", "985": "for the things that he said, being very excellent, were, in fact, suggested by the God who loves virtue ;", "986": "but the curses which he conceived in his mind (for they were wicked) were the offspring of his mind, which hated virtue.", "987": "And

created beings, from these secret things has passed a con­ demnatory decree, being in his own person at once the most indubitable of witnesses and the most incorruptible of judges, since even the contrary thing is praised, namely, for a man who appears to calumniate and to accuse with his mouth, in his heart to be blessing, and praising, and speaking words of good omen.", "991": "This, as it would seem, is the custom of those who correct youth, and of preceptors, and of parents, and of elders, and of rulers, and of laws ;", "992": "for they, at times, do each of them reprove and punish,

winged, and being animals accustomed to soar on high, still different from one another, as much as genus differs from species or a copy from the model;", "1784": "for divine wisdom is fond of lonely places, loving solitude, on account of the only God, whose possession she is;", "1785": "and this is called a turtle-dove, symbolically;", "1786": "but the other is quiet and tame, and gregarious,

these virtues when he calls the midwives of the Egyptians, Shiphrah and Puah,† for the name Shiphrah, being interpreted, means \" a little bird,\" and Puah means \" red.\"", "1789": "Now it is the especial property of divine wisdom, like a bird, to be always soaring on high;", "1790": "but it is the characteristic of human wisdom to study modesty and temperance, so as to blush at all objects

untaught God who divided them, and that he divided all the natures of bodies and of things one after another, which appeared to be closely fitted together and united by his word, which cuts through everything;", "1794": "which being sharpened to the finest possible edge, never ceases dividing all the objects of the outward senses, and when it has gone through them all, and arrived at the things which are called atoms and indivisible, then again this divider begins from them to divide those things which may be contemplated by the speculations of reason into unspeakable and indescriba­ ble portions, and to \" beat the gold into thin plates,”* like hairs, as Moses says, making them into one length without breadth, like unsubstantial lines.", "1795": "Each therefore of the three victims

comprehensible to what is incomprehensible, leaving the birds undivided;", "1797": "for it was impossible to divide the incorporeal and divine sciences into contrarieties at variance with one another.", "1798": "XXVII.", "1799": "But as the discussion on the subject of a division into equal portions, and on that of opposite contrarieties, is of great extent' and of necessary importance, we will not wholly pass it by.", "1800": "nor will we dwell on it with prolixity, but, investi­ gating it as it is, we will be content with such things as seem suitable to the occasion.", "1801": "For as the Creator divided our soul and our limbs in the middle, so also, in the same manner, did he divide the essence of the universe when he made the world;", "1802": "for, having taken it, he began to divide it thus :", "1803": "in the first instance, he made two divisions, the heavy and the light, separating that which was thick from that which was more subtle.", "1804": "After that, he again made a second division of each, dividing the subtle part into air and fire, and the denser portion into water and earth;", "1805": "and, first of all, he laid down those elements, which are perceptible by the outward senses, to be, as it were, the foundations of the world which is percep­ tible by the outward senses.", "1806": "Again, he subdivided heavy and light according to other ideas, for he divided the light into cold and hot;", "1807": "and the cold he called air, and that which was hot by nature he called fire.", "1808": "The heavy, again, he divided into wet and dry ;", "1809": "and the dry he called land, and the wet he called water-and each of these, again, received other further subdivisions ;", "1810": "for the land was divided into continents and islands, and the water into sea and rivers, and all drinkable springs, and the air was divided into the solstices of summer and winter;", "1811": "fire, also, was divided into what is useful (but fire is a most insatiable and destructive thing), and also by a dii­ ferent division into what is saving;", "1812": "and this division was assigned for the conformation of the heaven.", "1813": "But as he divided the things when entire, so also did he divide the particular divisions, some of which were animated and others inanimate;", "1814": "and of those which were inanimate he made a division into those which always remain in the same place, the bond of which is habit, and those which move, not indeed in the way of changing their place, but so as to grow, which indescribable nature has vivified.", "1815": "Again of these, those which are of wild materials are productive of wild fruits, which are the food of brute beasts;", "1816": "but others producing good fruit, the cultivation of which has called forth diligent superin­ tendence and care, and these produce fruit for the tamest of all animals, namely, for man, that he may enjoy them.", "1817": "And not only did he divide the inanimate things, and those which had received a soul and vitality in one manner-for of these he defined one species as that of irrational, and one as that of rational animals-but he also again subdivided each of these things, dividing the irrational into the wild and the tame species, and the rational into the mortal and the immortal.", "1818": "Again, of the mortal he made two divisions, one of which he called men, and the other women ;", "1819": "and, in the same manner, he divided the irrational animals into male and female.", "1820": "And these things were also subjected to other necessary divisions, which made distinctions between them;", "1821": "winged animals being distinguished from terrestrial, terrestrial from aquatic creatures, and aquatic creatures, again, from both extremities.", "1822": "Thus God, having sharpened his own word, the divider of all things, divides the essence of the universe which is destitute of form, and destitute of all distinctive qualities, and the four elements of the world which were separated from this essence, and the plants and animals which were consoli­ dated by means of these elements.", "1823": "XXVIII.", "1824": "But since Moses not only uses the expression, “ he divided,\" but says further, \" he divided in the midst,\" it is necessary to say a few words on the subject of equal divisions ;", "1825": "for that which is divided skilfully just in the middle makes two equal divisions.", "1826": "And no man could ever possibly divide anything into two exactly equal parts ;", "1827": "but it is inevitable that one of the divisions must fall a little short, or exceed a little, if not much, at all events by a small quantity, in every instance, which indeed escapes the perception of our outward senses which attend only to the larger and more tangible burdens of nature and custom, but which are unable to com­ prehend atoms and indivisible things.", "1828": "But it is established by the incorruptible word of truth that there is nothing equal in inequality.", "1829": "God alone therefore seems to be exactly just, and to be the only being able to divide in the middle bodies and things, in such a manner that none of the divisions shall be greater or less than the other by the smallest and most indivisible portion, and he alone is able to attain to sublime and perfect equality.", "1830": "If therefore there were but one idea of perfect equality, what has been said would be quite sufficient for the purpose.", "1831": "But as there are many, we must not hesitate to add some considerations which are suitable.", "1832": "For the word \" equal \" is used in one sense when speaking of numbers, as when we say that two are equal to two, and three to three;", "1833": "and speak of other numbers in the same manner.", "1834": "But in another sense when speaking of magnitude, as equal in length or breadth, or depth, which are all different proportions.", "1835": "For wrestler compared with wrestler, or cubit with cubit are equal in magnitude but different in power, as is the case also with measures and weights.", "1836": "But the idea of equality is a neces­ sary one, and so is that of equality in proportion, according to which a few things are looked upon as equal to many, and small things are equal to larger ones.", "1837": "And their proportion­ ate equality, cities are accustomed to use at suitable times, when they command every citizen to contribute an equal share of his property, not equal in number, but in proportion to the value of his assessment, so that in some cases he who contributes a hundred drachms will appear to have brought an equal sum with him who contributes a talent.", "1838": "XXIX.", "1839": "These things being thus previously sketched out, see now how God, dividing things in the middle, has divided them into equal portions according to all the ideas of equality which occur in the creation of the universe.", "1840": "He has divided the heavy things so as to make them equal in number to the light ones, two to two;", "1841": "that is to say, so that the earth and the water, being things of weight, are equal in number to those which are by nature light, air and fire.", "1842": "Again, he has made one equal to one, the driest thing to the wettest thing, the earth to the water;", "1843": "and the coldest thing to the hottest thing, the air to the fire, So, in the same manner, he has divided light from darkness, and day from night, and summer from winter, and autumn from spring;", "1844": "and so on.", "1845": "Again, he has divided things so as to make his divisions equal in point of magnitude;", "1846": "such as the parallel cycles in heaven, and those which belong to the equinoxes both of spring and autumn, and those which belong to the winter and summer solstice.", "1847": "And on the earth he has divided the zones, two being equal to one another, which being placed close to the poles are frozen with cold, and on this account are uninhabitable.", "1848": "And two he has placed on the borders between these two and the torrid zone, and these two they say are the abode of a happy temperature of the air, one of them lying towards the south and the other towards the north.", "1849": "Now the divisions of time are equal in point of length, the longest day being equal to the longest night, and again the shortest day being equal to the shortest night, and the mean length of day to the mean length of night.", "1850": "And the equal magnitude of other days and nights appears to be indicated chiefly by the equinoxes.", "1851": "From the spring equinox to the summer solstice, day receives an addition to its length, and night, on the other hand, submits to a diminution;", "1852": "until the longest day and the shortest night are both completed.", "1853": "And then after the summer solstice the sun, turning back again the same road, neither more quickly nor more slowly than he advanced, but always preserving the same difference in the same manner, having a constantly equal arrangement, proceeds on till the autumnal equinox ;", "1854": "and then, having made day and night both equal, it begins to increase the length of the night, diminishing the day until the time of the winter solstice.", "1855": "And when it has made the night the longest night, and the day the shortest day, then returning back again and adopting the same distances as before, he again comes to the spring equinox.", "1856": "Thus the differences of time which appear to be unequal, do in reality possess a perfect equality in respect of magnitude, not indeed at the same seasons, but at different seasons of the year.", "1857": "XXX.", "1858": "And a very similar effect is seen in the different parts of animals and especially of men.", "1859": "For hand is equal to hand, and foot to foot, and nearly all the other limbs of the body are equal to their corresponding members in magnitude, those on the left hand being equal to those on the right.", "1860": "And there are an exceeding number of things which are equal to one another in power, both among wet things and dry things, the judgment on which is seen in measures and scales, and things of that kind.", "1861": "And nearly all things are equal as respects proportion, even all the little and all the great things in the whole world.", "1862": "For those who have examined the questions of natural philosophy with some accuracy say that the four elements are all equal in propor­ tionate equality.", "1863": "And it is by proportion that the whole world is compounded together, and united, and endowed with consistency so as to remain firm for ever, proportion having distributed equality to each of its parts.", "1864": "And they say also that the four elements which are in us, dryness, and moisture, and cold, and heat have all been mixed together and well adapted by proportionate equality, and in fact that our whole composi­ tion is nothing but a mixture of the four powers combined together by an equality of proportion.", "1865": "XXXI.", "1866": "But any one who examines all these things might add an interminable list of arguments and instances to this one present discussion.", "1867": "If he considered he would find the very smallest animals equal to the largest as to proportion;", "1868": "as for instance he would find the swallow equal to the eagle, the herring equal to the whale, and the ant equal to the elephant.", "1869": "For body and soul, and again pains and pleasures, and more­ over affection for and dislike towards things, and all the other feelings which the nature of animals experience, are nearly all of them similar, being made equal by the rule of proportion.", "1870": "Thus some men have felt confidence even to declare that the smallest of animals, man, is equal to the whole world, considering that each of them consists of a body and a rational soul, so that, using a figurative expression, they have called man a little world, and the world a large man.", "1871": "And in teaching this they are not very wide of the mark, but they know that the art of God according to which he created all things, admitting neither any extraordinary intensity nor any relaxation ;", "1872": "but always remaining the same, made every single existing thing perfectly, according to its own excessive and consummate perfection, the Creator employing all numbers

reputation wish to work up whatever materials they take in an admirable manner, whether they are costly or whether they are inexpensive.", "1876": "And before now, some persons, having even an extraordinary love of distinction, have even spent more skill in working up materials of little value, than they have devoted to those which are costly, wishing to make up for the deficiencies of the material by the additional display of their skill.", "1877": "But there is no material which has any value in the eyes of God, because he has given all materials an equal share of his skill.", "1878":

all means held in equal estima­ tion by him who confers the praise ;", "1880": "and what God praised was not the materials which he had worked up into creation, destitute of life and of melody, and easily dissolved, and moreover in their own intrinsic nature perishable, and out of all proportion and full of iniquity, but rather his own skilful work, completed according to one equal and

an infinite manner, into an infinite number of parts, and which, in fact, never ceases from dividing.", "2144": "And this happens by reason of its resemblance to the Creator and Father of the universe;", "2145": "for the divine nature, being unmin­ gled, uncombined with any thing else, and most completely destitute of parts, has been to the whole world the cause of mixture, and combination, and of an infinite variety of parts :", "2146": "so that.", "2147": "very naturally, the two things which thus resemble each other, both the mind which is in us and that which is above us, being without parts and indivisible, will still be able in a powerful manner to divide and distribute all existing things.", "2148": "XL1X.", "2149": "Therefore, after Moses has mentioned the facts of birds not being cut in two pieces or divided, he proceeds to say, \" And the birds came down and descended upon the bodies which were divided;", "2150": "\"* using indeed expressions which are synonymous, but still representing the variance which exists in the facts in a most visible manner to those who are able to see.", "2151": "For it is contrary to nature that birds should come down, when they have been given wings for the purpose of soaring on high.", "2152": "For, as the earth is the most appropriate place for land animals, and above all for reptiles, which do not endure even to crawl upon it, but seek caves and lurking places, avoiding the regions which are above, on account of their kindred with the things which are below ;", "2153": "so, in the same manner, the air is the appro­ priate abode for the winged race, the element which is by nature light is the proper home for those creatures which are light by reason of their being feathered.", "2154": "When, therefore, those creatures, whose nature it is to traverse the air and who ought to roam through the æther, descend and come down upon the land, they are unable to live a life according to their nature.", "2155": "On the other hand, Moses approves, in no ordinary degree, of whatever reptiles are able to take a leap in an upward direction.", "2156": "At all events lie says, “Ye shall eat of these winged reptiles which go upon four feet, and which have legs above their feet so as to be able by them to leap up from the ground.”*", "2157": "But these reptiles are the emblems of souls, which like reptiles being rooted in the earthly body, when they are raised up, get strength to soar on high, taking the heaven in exchange for the earth, and immortality in exchange for destruction.", "2158": "We must, therefore, think that they are full of every description of misery, which, having been brought up in the air, and in the æther which is the purest of all things, have changed their abode (not being able to bear the satiety of divine things), and have descended to that mortal and evil district, the earth.", "2159": "And there are innumerable imaginations concerning an innumerable variety of things which roam about upon it also ;", "2160": "some voluntary, and some out of ignorance, which are in no respect different from winged creatures, and which Moses compares to the birds that come down.", "2161": "And of these imagina­ tions those which take the upward course belong to the better class, since virtue, which conducts the mind towards heaven and the divine country, travels with them.", "2162": "But those which take the downward course belong to the worse class, since wickedness guides them and drags them in the contrary direction by force.", "2163": "And their very names do, to a great extent, show the opposite character of the places.", "2164": "For virtue (ἀρετὴ) has derived its name not only from the word (αἵϱεϭις) choice, but also from the fact of its being lifted up (παϱὰ TO αἴϱεϭθαι), for it is lifted up (αἴϱεται) and borne on high because it always loves heavenly things;", "2165": "but wickedness (ϰαϰία) is so called from its tendency to go downwards (ἀπὸ του̃ ϰάτω ϰεχωϱηϰέναι), and also because it compels those who practise it to iall down to the bottom (ϰαταπίπτειν).", "2166": "Accordingly the thoughts of the soul which are at variance with one another, flying towards and descending upon the earth, both come down themselves and also throw the mind down too, mingling with bodies in a disgraceful degree, and with things which are perceptible by the outward senses, not discernible by the intellect, imperfect not entire, perishable and not living.", "2167": "For they mix themselves up not only with bodies, but also with the divisions of the bodies which have been divided in two parts.", "2168": "And it is quite impossible that things which have been divided in this way should ever again admit of adaptation and union ;", "2169": "since the nerves of the spirit, which were the strongest natural bond in them, are cut in two.", "2170": "L.", "2171": "Moreover, Moses introduces a very true opinion when he teaches us that justice and every virtue loves the soul, but that wickedness and every vice is attached to the body ;", "2172": "' and that what is friendly to the one is in every case of necessity hostile to the other, as is the case even now.", "2173": "For having figuratively represented the wars of the soul, he then intro­ duces birds as eager to involve themselves with and to cling to the bodies, and to satiate themselves with the flesh, the inroads and attacks of which the virtuous man, desiring to check, is said to sit by them as if he were a sort of curator or overseer of them.", "2174": "For when his domestic affairs were thrown into con­ fusion by domestic sedition, and when the armies of the enemy were proceeding against him, he collected a wise council and deliberated with respect to the adversaries ;", "2175": "in order that if he could possibly do so, using persuasion he might both put an end to the foreign war, and also remove the domestic confusion;", "2176": "for it was desirable to disperse those enemies who wore gathering over him like a cloud, and who were full of irre­ concileable enmity to him;", "2177": "and equally so to re-establish with the other party the relations which had previously existed.", "2178": "Now those who are irreconcilable and implacable enemies are set down thus ;", "2179": "the follies and intemperances of the soul, cowardice and injustice, and all the other irrational appetites which are accustomed to be generated by luxuriant and impo­ tent appetite, raising their heads high and becoming restiff, and preventing the mind from proceeding in its straight course ;", "2180": "and very often throwing its whole system into confusion and beating it down.", "2181": "But the attacks and conflicts of those powers which are not irreconcilable resemble the frequent effect of the discussions and quarrels about doctrines which arise among the Sophists.", "2182": "For inasmuch as they all labour for one end, namely the con­ templation of the things of nature, they may be said to be friends;", "2183": "but inasmuch as they do not agree in their particular investi­ gations they may be said to be in a state of domestic sedition ;", "2184": "as, for instance, those who affirm the universe to be uncreated are-at variance with those who insist upon its creation;", "2185": "and again those who urge that it will be destroyed are at strife with those who affirm that it is indeed perishable by nature but that it never will be destroyed, because it is held together by a more powerful chain, the will of the Creator.", "2186": "And again, those who affirm that there is nothing self-existent, but that everything has been created, are at variance with those who are of a contrary opinion, Those too, who say that man is he measure of all things, differ from those who would restrain the judicial faculties of the outward senses and of the intellect.", "2187": "And, in short, to sum up all these differences in a few words, those who represent everything as incomprehensible are at variance with those who say that a great number of things are properly understood.", "2188": "And the sun, and the moon, and the whole heaven, and the earth, and the air, and the water, and all the things that are connected with them, afford subject for strife and contention to those who are fond of examining into such subjects, and who investigate their essences, and distinctive qualities, and changes, and alterations, and moreover their origin and the method of their destruction :", "2189": "and making no superficial investigation into the magnitude and motion of the heavenly bodies, they adopt all sorts of different opinions, never agreeing together, until some man, who is at the same time skilful at disentangling controversies and calculated to judge, takes his seat on the tribunal, and comes to a clear perception of the progeny of each individual's soul, and discards those which do not deserve to be maintained, and preserves those which are good, and which be pronounces worthy of suitable providential care.", "2190": "And all the controversies of philosophy are full of disagreement, since the truth escapes the intellect which is given to plausibilities and conjectures:", "2191": "for it is the very difficulty of discovering and seizing hold of the nature of truth that, in my opinion, has given rise to so many quarrels.", "2192": "LI.", "2193": "\"And about the setting of the sun a trance fell upon Abraham, and, behold, fear with great darkness fell upon him.”*", "2194": "Now there is one kind of trance

hasten to pursue the desired object, and our faces are full of chagrin until we attain it.", "2414": "And how he has compared the soul of the man, who loves instruction and who cherishes a hope of arirving at perfection, to a furnace, because each is a vessel in which food is cooked, the one being the vessel in which those meats which are perish­ able are prepared, and the other that suited to the reception of the imperishable virtues.", "2415": "And the burning torches of fire which are lighted up are the judgments of God who bears the torch, being bright and radiant, which are accustomed

earthly and Egyptian body ;", "2488": "and that he stands in need of eyes in order to see and to read, and of ears in order to attend and to hear, and of his other external senses, in such a manner as

native and original inhabitants and citizens of the universe.", "2497": "And all the other kinds of instruction, which obtain the second, and third, and lowest honours, are on the confines, between foreigners and citizens.", "2498": "For they are not connected with either race without some alloy, and yet again they are connected with both according to a certain community and participation.", "2499": "For they are sojourners from the fact of their passing their time among citizens;", "2500": "but from the fact of their not being settled inhabitants, they also resemble foreigners.", "2501": "In the same manner, according to my idea, as adopted children, inasmuch as they inherit the property of those who have adopted them, resemble real legitimate children ;", "2502": "but inasmuch as they were not begotten by them, they resemble strangers.", "2503": "The same relation, then, that a mistress has to her handmaidens, or a wife, who is a cititzn, to a concubine, that same relation has virtue, that is Sarah, to education, that is Hagar.", "2504": "So that very naturally, since the husband, by name Abraham, is one who has an admiration for contemplation and knowledge ;", "2505": "virtue, that is Sarah, would be his wife, and Hagar, that is all kinds of encylical accomplishment, would be his concubine.", "2506": "Whoever, therefore, has acquired wisdom from his teachers, would never reject Hagar.", "2507": "For the acquisition of all the preliminary branches of education is wholly necessary.", "2508": "VI.", "2509": "But if any one, having determined on perseveringly enduring labours in the cause of virtue, devotes himself to continued study, practising and meditating without intermis­ sion, that man will marry two citizens, and also an equal number of concubines, the handmaidens of the citizens.", "2510": "And each of these has a different appearance and a different nature.", "2511": "For instance, of the two citizen wives, one is a most healthy and well established and peaceful motion, whom from the circumstances the historians called Leah:", "2512": "and the other resembles a whetstone and is called Rachel, in the pursuit of whom the mind, which is fond of labour and fond of exercises, is much sharpened.", "2513": "and excited ;", "2514": "and the name, being inter­ preted, means the .. sight of profanation ;", "2515": "˙’ not because she sees profanely, but, on the contrary, because she thinks the things which are seen and which are the objects of the external senses, not brilliant but common and profane in comparison of the pure and untainted nature of those things which are invi­ sible and which are only discernible by the intellect.", "2516": "For since our soul is composed of two parts, and since the one contains the rational faculties, and the other the irrational ones, it follows that each part must have its own peculiar virtue, Leah being the virtue of the rational part, and Rachel of the irra­ tional.", "2517": "For the one trains us, by means of the external senses and the parts of speech, to look contemptuously upon all things which it is proper to disregard, such as glory, and wealth, and pleasure, which the principal and general multitude of common men look upon as things to be admired and striven for, their sense of hearing being corrupted, and the tribunal of all the other external senses being corrupted likewise.", "2518": "But the other teaches us to turn away from that uneven and rough road which is never approached by souls that love virtue, and to go smoothly along the smooth road without any stumbling and without meeting any hindrances in the path.", "2519": "Therefore the handmaiden of the former of the two citizen wives will neces­ sarily be the power of interpretation as exercised by means of the organs of speech, and also the rational invention of sophisms, deceiving man by a well-imagined plausibility ;", "2520": "and its necessary nourishment is meat and drink.", "2521": "The historian has recorded for us the names of the two handmaidens, calling them Zilpah and Billah.*", "2522": "The name Zilpah, being interpreted, means \"a mouth going forth,\" a symbol of that nature which interprets and speaks.", "2523": "But Billah means “ a swallowing,\" which is the first and most necessary support of all mortal animals.", "2524": "For it is by swallow­ ing that our bodies are established firmly, and the cables of life are attached to this action as to a sure foundation.", "2525": "Accord­ ingly the practiser of virtue lives with all the aforesaid powers, with some as with free women and citizens, and with others as slaves and concubines.", "2526": "For he is enamoured of the motion of Leah;", "2527": "and a smooth (λεία) motion existing in a body would be calculated to produce health, and, when existing in a soul, it would produce virtue and justice.", "2528": "But he loves Rachel, wrest­ ling with his passions, and preparing himself for a struggle of temperance, arraying himself in opposition to all the objects of the external senses.", "2529": "For there are two kinds of advantage, either that according to which we enjoy blessings, as in peace, or else that which comes from arraying one's self in opposition to and from removing evils as in war.", "2530": "Now Leah is the wife according to whom it happens to the husband to enjoy the elder, and more important, and dominant blessings;", "2531": "and Rachel the wife, according to whom he obtains what resemble the sports of war.", "2532": "Such then is his way, if left with his citizen wives.", "2533": "But the practiser of virtue also wants Billah, that is, swallow­ ing, but as a slave and a concubine ;", "2534": "for without food and vitality, living well could not possibly be the lot of the mail, since things indifferent are always the foundation of what is better;", "2535": "and he also wants Zilpah, that is to say, interpre­ tation by means of utterance, in order that the rational part itself may, in a twofold manner, contribute to perfection, both from the fountain existing in the intellect, and also from the stream flowing therefrom in the organ of the voice.", "2536": "VII.", "2537": "But these men were husbands of many wives and con­ cubines, not only of such as were citizens, as the sacred scriptures tell us.", "2538": "But Isaac had neither many wives nor any concubine at all, but only his first and wedded wife, who lived with him all his life.", "2539": "Why was this?", "2540": "Because the virtue acquired by teaching, which Abraham pursues, requires many things, both such as are legitimate according to prudence, and such also as are illegitimate according to the exegetical con­ templations of preliminary instruction.", "2541": "And there is also a virtue which is made perfect by practice, to which Jacob ap­ pears to have been devoted;", "2542": "for exercises consist of many and various dogmas and doctrines, some leading and others follow­ ing, some leading the way, and others arriving later, and bringing at one time more serious, and at other times lighter labours.", "2543": "But the self-instructed race, of which Isaac was a partaker, the excellent country of the mastery over the pas­ sions, has received as its share a nature simple, and unmixed, and unalloyed, standing in no need of either practice or instruction in which there is Deed of the concubine sciences, and not only of the citizen wives,;", "2544": "for when God has showered down from above that most requisite benefit of knowledge, self- taught, and having no need of a preceptor, it would be impossible any longer for a man to live with the slavish and concubine arts, having a desire for bastard doctrines as his children.", "2545": "For the man who has arrived at this honour, is inscribed as the husband of the mistress and princess virtue;", "2546": "and she is called in the Greek language, perseverance, but among the Hebrews her name is

first-fruits to God, who has bestowed upon us this great abundance of power of exerting our intelligence.", "2756": "From this consideration it was, that Jacob, the practiser of virtue, at the beginning of.", "2757": "his prayers, says :", "2758": "“", "2759": "Of all that thou givest me, I will set apart and consecrate a tenth to thee.\"*", "2760": "And the sacred scripture, which was written after the prayers on occasion of victory, which Melchisedek, who had received a self-instructed and self- taught priesthood, makes, says :", "2761": "“ For he gave him a tenth of all the things,”† assigning to him the outward senses the faculty of feeling properly, and by the sense of speech the faculty of speaking well, and by the senses connected with the mind the faculty of thinking well.", "2762": "Very beautifully, therefore, and at the same time most unavoidably, does the sacred historian tell us in the fashion of an incidental narrative, when the memorial of that heavenly and divine food was consecrated in the golden urn, that \" gomor was the tenth part of three measures.”", "2763": "‡For in us men there appear to be three measures, the outward senses, and speech, and mind.", "2764": "The outward sense being the measure of the objects of outward sense, speech being the measure of nouns and verbs, and of whatever is said;", "2765": "and the mind being the measure of those things which can only be perceived by the intellect.", "2766": "We must therefore offer first-fruits of each of these three measures as a sacred tenth, in order that our powers of speaking, and of feeling, and of comprehending, may be seen to be irreproachable and sound, in reference to and in connection with God.", "2767": "For this is the true and just measure, and the things that relate to ourselves are false and unjust measures.", "2768": "XIX.", "2769": "Very appropriately, therefore, in the case of sacrifices also, the tenth part of the measure of fine wheat flour will be brought upon the altar, together with the victims.", "2770": "But the number of nine, which is what is left of the number ten, will remain among us.", "2771": "And the daily sacrifice of the priests corresponds also to these facts.", "2772": "For it is expressly commanded to them to offer every day the tenth part of an ephah *of fine wheat flour.", "2773": "For, passing over the ninth number, the god who was only discernible by the outward senses and by opinion, they learnt to worship the tenth, who is the only living and true God.", "2774": "For the world had nine portions assigned to it, eight in heaven, namely the portion of the fixed stars and the seven planets which are all borne forward in the same arrangement, and the ninth being the earth in conjunction with the air and water.", "2775": "For of these things there is only one bond and connection, though they admit all kinds of various changes and alterations.", "2776": "Therefore men in general have paid honours to these nine portions, and to the world which is compounded of them.", "2777": "But the perfect man honours only that being who is above the nine, and who is their creator, being the tenth portion, namely God.", "2778": "For having examined into the whole of his works, he has felt a love for the creator of them, and he has become anxious to be his suppliant and servant.", "2779": "On this account the priest offers up a tenth every day to the tenth, the only and everlasting God.", "2780": "This is, to speak properly, the spiritual passover of the soul, the passing over of all the passions and of every object of the outward senses to the tenth, which is the proper object of the intellect, and which is divine.", "2781": "For it is said in the scripture:", "2782": "\"", "2783":

which have been preserved in the soul, which is illuminated in two portions out of the three, until it is entirely changed in every part, and becomes a heavenly brilliancy like a full moon, at the height of its increase at the end of the second week, and so is able not only to guard, but even to sacrifice uninjured and faultless improve­ ments, that is to say, propitiations.", "2785": "For this propitiation also is established in the tenth day of the month, when the soul addresses its supplications to the tenth portion, namely to God, and has learnt, by its own sagacity and acuteness, the insigni­ ficance and nothingness of the creature, and also the excessive perfection and pre-eminent excellence in all good things of the uncreated God.", "2786": "Therefore God becomes at once propitious, and propitious too, even without any supplications being addressed to him, to those who abase and humble themselves, and who are not puffed up with vain arrogance and self-opinion.", "2787": "This is remission and deliverance, this is complete freedom of the soul, shaking off the wanderings in which it wandered, and fleeing for a secure anchorage to the one nature which cannot wander, and which rises up to return to the lot which it formerly received when it had brilliant aspirations, and when it vigorously toiled in labours which had virtuous ends for their object.",

what the wise Abraham supplicates for, when that which in word indeed is the land of Sodom, but in real fact is the soul made barren of all good things and blinded as to its reason, is about to be

connected with the number fifty, and terminates with the number ten, the lowest number for whose deliverance he can dare to entreat.", "2791": "XX.", "2792": "From which consideration it appears to me to have been, that Moses, after the appointment of chiliarchs, or com­ manders of thousands, and of centurians, and of captains of fifties,!", "2793": "thought proper to appoint captains of ten over all, in order that if the mind was not able to be improved by means of the elder orders, it might at least be purified by these last in order.", "2794": "And the son of the man who was devoted to learning, learnt a very beautiful doctrine when he went on that admirable embassy, asking in marriage for the self-taught wise man that most appropriate sister, namely, perseverance.", "2795": "For he takes ten camels,* a reminding of the number ten, that is to say, of right instruction, from among many and, indeed, infinite memorials of the Lord.", "2796": "He also takes of his good things,

of ten shekels weight of gold for the arms of her who is sought in marriage.t", "2800": "Oh the divine ornament!", "2801": "We may understand that the drachm means the faculty of hearing, and the unbroken unit, and the attractive nature ;", "2802": "for it is not becoming for hearing to have leisure to attend to anything except to that speech alone which sets forth in a suitable manner the virtues of the one and only God.", "2803": "And the ten shekels weight of gold mean attempts at works;", "2804": "for the actions, in accordance with wisdom, are esta­ blished in perfect numbers, and

scarlet,-four numbers, as I have said before.", "2815": "Now the fine flax is an emblem of the earth, for the flax grows out of the earth;", "2816": "and the hyacinthine colour is a symbol of the air,

"But when we have attained to intelligence and acuteness of comprehension, then we no longer have a light and superficial mind, but rather a firm and solid intellect which we can exercise on every sub­ ject.", "2832": "And it is for this reason that the expression which follows is added, in connection with the former statement, \" And he went in unto Hagar.\"", "2833": "For it was becoming for the scholar to go to his teacher, who was a man of learning, in order to learn such branches of instruction as are suited to the nature of man.", "2834": "For now, also, the pupil is represented as going to the place where he may obtain learning ;", "2835": "but learning very often anticipates him and runs forward to meet him, having driven out envy from her habitation, and she attracts those towards her who are well inclined to her.", "2836": "Accordingly, one may read that virtue, that is Leah, went forward to meet the practiser of virtue, and said unto him, \" To-day you shall come in to me,\"* when he was returning from the fields.", "2837": "For where was the man who had the care of the seeds and plants of knowledge found to come, except to that virtue which he himself had cultivated ?XXIII.", "2838": "But there are times when virtue, as if making experiment of those who come to her as pupils, to see how much eagerness and earnestness they have, does not come forward to meet them, but veiling her face like Tamar, sits down in the public road, giving room to those who are travel­ ling along the road to look upon her as a harlot, in order that those who are over curious on the subject may take off her veil and disclose her features, and may behold the untouched, and unpolluted, and most exquisite, and truly virgin beauty of modesty and chastity.", "2839": "Who then is he who is fond of in­ vestigating, and desirous of learning, and who thinks it not right to leave any of those things which are disguised or concealed unconsidered and unexamined?",

aside out of his road to Ler, and said unto her, Suffer me to come in unto thee.\" (but he was not inclined to offer her any violence), and to see what is that power which is thus veiled, and for what purpose it is thus adorned;", "2842": "and after they had come together it is written, “ And she conceived ;", "2843": "\" but the name of the person is not expressly mentioned.", "2844": "For art

whenever he is fond of learning.", "2846": "And it often happens that be who professes some one of the indifferent branches of knowledge, when he meets with a pupil of good natural qualifications, boasts of his success in teaching, thinking that he, by himself and alone, is the cause of his pupil's facility in learning.", "2847": "And then, becoming elated and puffing himself, up he holds his head high, and draws up his eyebrows and becomes full of pride, and asks very high terms from those who desire to become his pupils;", "2848": "but those whom he perceives to be poor but still to be eager for instruction, he rejects and repels, as if he were the only person who had found a treasure of wisdom.", "2849": "This is the meaning of the ex­ pression, \" to conceive,\" namely, to be full of pride, and to be puffed up with arrogance beyond all moderation, on which account some persons have appeared to dishonour the queen of all the intermediate and indifferent branches of knowledge, virtue, who deserves to be honoured, even for her own sake.", "2850": "All the souls, therefore, which, in connection with prudence, are pregnant of real things, do nevertheless bring forth, sepa­ rating and distinguishing between things previously in con­ fusion, like Rebekkah;", "2851": "for she having conceived in her womb ideas of two nations, the knowledge of virtue and the know­ ledge of wickedness, having a fortunate labour separated and distinguished between the nature of each;", "2852": "but those which have conceived without prudence either miscarry or else bring forth an offspring inclined to evil contention and so­ phistry, always either aiming darts and arrows at others, or having darts and arrows aimed at themselves.", "2853": "And may we not say that this is natural ?", "2854": "for some fancy that they are just conceiving, and others that they are actually pregnant, which is a very different thing;", "2855": "for those who think that they are already pregnant attribute their pregnancy and the birth of their offspring to themselves, and pride themselves upon it;", "2856": "but those who look upon themselves as now conceiving, admit that they have of themselves nothing which they can call peculiarly their own, but they receive the seed and the pros­ pects of posterity which are showered upon them from without, and they admire him who bestows it, and repel the greatest of evils, namely self-love, by that perfect good, piety towards the gods.", "2857": "XXIV.", "2858": "In this manner also the seeds of the legislative wis­ dom, which exists among men, were sown, \" For there was,\" says the same historian, \" a man of the tribe of Levi, named Amram, who took to wife one of the daughters of Levi, and had her, and she conceived and brought forth a male child;", "2859": "and seeing that he was a goodly child they concealed him for three months.”*", "2860": "This is Moses, the purest mind, the child that is really goodly ;", "2861": "the

flourishing both in the things relating to his mother and in those affecting his father, clings to the truth;", "2863": "and the greatest profession ever made by the author and chief of this tribe is this, for he makes bold to say, that \" the only God is alone to be honoured by me;", "2864": "\" and nothing besides of all the things that are inferior to Him, neither earth, nor sea, nor rivers,

moving about in well-arranged revolutions, nor the whole heaven, nor the entire world.", "2865": "This is a boast of a great and magnanimous soul, to rise above all creation, and to overleap its boundaries, and to cling to the great uncreated God alone, according to his sacred com­ mands, in which we are expressly enjoined \" to cleave unto him.\"t", "2866": "Therefore he, in requital, bestows himself as their in­ heritance upon those who do cleave unto him, and who serve him without intermission;", "2867": "and the sacred scripture bears its testimony in behalf of this assertion, where it says, \" The Lord himself is his inheritance.”", "2868": "‡Thus the souls which are already pregnant are naturally likely to bring forth children, rather than those which are now receiving the seed.", "2869": "But as the eyes of the body do oftentimes see obscurely, and often on the other hand see clearly, so in the same manner does the eye of the soul, at times, receive the particular impressions conveyed to it by things in a most confused and indistinct manner, and at other times it beholds them with the greatest purity and clearness;", "2870": "therefore an in­ distinct and not clearly manifested conception resembles an embryo which has not yet received any distinct character or similitude within the womb :", "2871": "but that which is clear and dis­ tinctly visible, is like one which is completely formed, and which is already fashioned in an artistic manner as to both its inward and its outward parts, and which has already received its suitable character.", "2872": "And

child, and her child should come from her before it is completely formed, he shall be mulcted in a fine, according to what the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall pay the fine deservedly.", "2875": "But if the child be fully formed, he shall pay life for life.", "2876": "\"", "2877": "*For it was not the same thing, to destroy a perfect and an imperfect work of the mind,

penalty is affixed to an uncertain action;", "2879": "in another, a definite punishment is enacted by law against an act which is perfected, but which is perfected not with respect to virtue, but with reference to what is done in an irreproachable manner, according to some act.", "2880": "For it is not she who has just received the seed, but she who has been for some time pregnant, who brings forth this offspring, professing boasting rather than modesty.", "2881": "For it is impossible that she who .has been pregnant some time should miscarry, since it is fitting that the plant should be conducted to perfection by him who sowed it;", "2882": "but it is not strange if some mishap should befall the woman who was pregnant, since she was afflicted with a disease beyond the art of the physician.", "2883": "XXV.", "2884": "And do not suppose that Hagar is represented as beholding herself as pregnant, by the words, \" seeing that she had conceived,\" but as beholding her mistress Sarah ;", "2885": "for after­ wards she speaks of herself, and says, \" Seeing that she was pregnant, she was despised before her.''*", "2886": "Why so?", "2887": "Because the intermediate and indifferent arts, and the sciences in accord ance with them, see indeed of what they are pregnant, but they nevertheless see in every respect but dimly;", "2888": "but the sciences comprehend clearly and very distinctly.", "2889": "For science is something beyond art, having derived from reason a certain firmness and exemption from error;", "2890": "for this is the definition ot art, a system of comprehensions well practised with reference to some desirable end, the word desirable being very properly added by reason of the abundance of evil arts.", "2891": "But the definition of science is a safe and firm comprehension, which, through reason, is not liable to any error.", "2892": "Therefore we call music and grammar, and other pursuits, arts;", "2893": "for those also who are made perfect in them, as musicians, or grammarians.", "2894": "are called artists.", "2895": "But we call philosophy and the other virtues, sciences, and those who are possessed of the knowledge of them we call scientific;", "2896": "for they are prudent, and temperate, and philosophical, not one of whom is ever deceived in the doctrines of a philosophy which he himself has cultivated, any more than the artists, whom I have mentioned before, err in their speculations with respect to their indifferent arts.", "2897": "For as the eyes see, and still the mind sees more clearly by means of the eyes;",

instrumentality of the nostrils ;", "2900": "and in like manner, as the other external senses comprehend their respective appropriate objects, still the mind comprehends them also more purely and distinctly by their ministration.", "2901": "For to speak properly, it is the mind which is the eye of eyes, the hearing of hearing, and the more pure external sense of each of the external senses, using them as ministers in a court of justice, and itself deciding on the nature of the objects submitted to it, so as to approve of some and to reject others.", "2902": "In the same way, those that are called the intermediate arts, resembling the faculties of the body, indulge in contemplations according to certain simple observations of them, but the sciences do so with greater accuracy and with an exceedingly careful investigation.", "2903": "For the same relation that the mind bears to the outward sense, that same does science bear towards art;", "2904": "for, as has been said before, the soul is as it were the outward sense of the outward sense;", "2905": "therefore each of them has attracted to itself some slight things of nature, concerning which it labours and occupies itself, geometry having appropriated lines, and music sounds, and philosophy the whole nature of existing things.", "2906": "For this world is its subject matter, and so is the whole essence, both visible and invisible, of existing things.", "2907": "What then is there wonderful if the soul, which sees both the whole and the parts, sees them too better than they do, as if it were furnished with larger and

"2909": "XXVI.", "2910": "And yet even this is not unknown to any one, namely, that philosophy has bestowed upon all the particular sciences their first principles and seeds, from which speculations respecting them appear to arise.", "2911": "For it is geometry which invented equilateral and scalene triangles, and circles, and polygons, and all kinds of other figures.", "2912": "But it was no longer geometry that discovered the nature of a point, and a line, and a superficies, and a solid, which are the roots and foundations of the aforementioned figures.", "2913": "For from whence could it define and pronounce that a point is that which has no parts, that a line is length without breadth ;", "2914": "that a super­ ficies is that which has only length and breadth ;", "2915": "that a solid is that which has the three properties, length, breadth, and depth?", "2916": "For these discoveries belong to philosophy, and the consideration of these definitions belongs wholly to the phi­ losopher.", "2917": "Again, to write and read is the undertaking of this more imperfect kind of grammar, which some people, pervert­ ing the name of, call grammatistica.", "2918": "But to the more perfect kind of grammar belongs the explanation of the great works of the poets and historians.", "2919": "When, therefore, men are going through the different parts of speech, are they not in so doing trying to drag over to themselves and appropriate as a kind of accessory the dis­ coveries of philosophy?", "2920": "For it is the peculiar province of philosophy to inquire what a conjunction, what a noun, what a verb, what a common noun, what a particular noun, what is deficient in a speech, what is superfluous, what is an affirma­ tive, what an interrogative, what an indirect question, what is a comprehensive expression, what is a supplicatory form of address.", "2921": "For this is a science which has been compounded for the purpose of the investigation of independent propo­ sitions, and axioms, and categorems.", "2922": "But, moreover, has not the whole question of semi-vowels, or vowels, or such elements as are completely mute, and the consideration of the sense in which each of these expressions is ordinarily used, and in short every notion connected with the voice, and the elements, and the parts of speech, been thoroughly worked out and brought to an accurate system by philosophy ?", "2923": "And those thieves, after having as it were carried off a few drops from her torrent, and having sought to impregnate their own shallow souls with what they have stolen, are not ashamed to bring forth her resources as their own.", "2924": "XXVII.", "2925": "On which account, being elated and proud, they disregard the mistress to whom in reality the

complete strength for it given to you, but still the nerves of your soul, like those of a child, are somewhat soft and weak.", "3176": "And it is for this reason that she calls him \" my child,\" which is a name of affection, and also one which indicates his tender age;", "3177": "for we look upon the disposition which is inclined to the practice of virtue, and which is young, as worthy of affection in comparison of the full-grown man.", "3178": "But such a person is worthy to carry off the prizes which are proposed for children, but he is not yet able to will the prizes offered for the men.", "3179": "But the best contest for men to engage in is the service of the only God.", "3180": "Therefore if, even before we have been completely purified, but while we appear only to have proceeded so far as to wash off the things which defile our life, we have arrived at the vestibule of God's service, we departed again more quickly than we approached, not being able to endure the austere way of living dictated by that service, nor the sleepless desire to please God, nor the con­ tinual and unwearied labour;", "3181": "flee, therefore, at this present time from what is best and from what is worst.", "3182": "What is worst are the fabulous inventions, the unmetrical and inharmonious poems, the conceptions and persuasions which from ignorance are hard and stubborn, of which Esau is the namesake.", "3183": "What is best is the offering ;", "3184": "for the race inclined to service is an offering meet for God, being consecrated to him alone in the great chief priesthood;", "3185": "for to dwell with what is evil is most pernicious, and to dwell with perfect good is most dangerous.", "3186": "Accordingly Jacob both flees from Esau, and also dwells apart from his parents;", "3187": "for being fond of practising virtue and still labouring at it, he flees from wickedness, and yet is un­ able to live in company with perfect virtue so as to have no need of an

of fortune ;", "3193": "for the word Syrian, being translated, means \" sublime.\"", "3194": "But now he does not recollect the Syrian Laban, but the brother of Rebekkah ;", "3195": "for the means of

recent ones, which are caused by the errors of the soul, he attributes to the servant of God.", "3291": "On this account, I imagine it is, that when Moses was speaking philosophically of the creation of the world, while he described every thing else as having been created by God alone, he mentions man alone as having been made by him in conjunction with other assistants ;", "3292": "for, says Moses, \" God said, Let us make man in our image.\"t", "3293": "The expression, \" let us make,\" indicating a plurality of makers.", "3294": "Here, therefore, the Father is conversing with his own powers, to whom he has assigned the task of making the mortal part of our soul, acting in imitation of his own skill while he was fashioning the rational part within us, thinking it right that the dominant part within the soul should be the work of the Ruler of all things, but that the part which is to be kept in subjection should be made by those who are subject to him.", "3295": "And he made us of the powers which were subordi­ nate to him, not only for the reason which has been mentioned, but also because the soul of man alone was destined to receive notions of good and of evil, and to choose one of the two, since it could not adopt both.", "3296": "Therefore, he thought it necessary to assign the origin of evil to other workmen than himself,-but to retain the generation of good for himself alone.", "3297": "XIV.", "3298": "Oil which account, after Moses had already put in God's mouth this expression, \" Let us make man,\" as if speak­ ing to several persons, he adds, as if he were speaking only of one, \" God made man.\"", "3299": "For, in fact, the one God alone is the sole Creator of the real man, who is the purest mind;", "3300": "but a plurality of workmen are the makers of that which is called man, the being compounded of external senses;", "3301": "for which reason the especial real man is spoken of with the article ;", "3302": "for the words of Moses are, \" The God made the man that is to say, he made that reason destitute of species and free from all admixture.", "3303": "But he speaks of mail in general without the addition of the article ;", "3304":

the virtuous and the cursing of the wicked to the same ministers, though both these offices receive praise.", "3306": "But since the blessing of the good has the precedence in panegyrics, and the affixing curses on the wicked is in the second rank of those who are appointed for these duties (and they are the chiefs, and leaders of the race, twelve in number, whom it is cus­ tomary to call the patriarchs), he has assigned the better six, who are the best for the task of blessing, namely, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin ;", "3307": "and the others he has appointed for the curses, namely, the first and last sons of Leah, Reuben, and Zabulon, and the four bastard sons by the handmaidens ;", "3308": "for the chiefs of the royal tribe, and of the tribe consecrated to the priesthood, Judah and Levi, are reckoned in the former class.", "3309": "Very naturally, therefore, does God give up those who have done deeds worthy of death to the hands of others for punish­ ment, wishing to teach us that the nature of evil is banished to a distance from the divine choir, since even punishment, which, though a good, has in it some imitation of evil, is con­ firmed by others.", "3310": "And the expression, \" I will give thee a place to which he who has slain a man unintentionally shall flee,\" appears to me to be spoken with exceeding propriety;", "3311": "for what he calls a place is not a region filled by the body, but is rather, in a figure, God himself, because he, surrounding all things, is not surrounded himself, and because he is that to which all things flee for refuge.", "3312": "It is proper, therefore, for him who appears to have been involuntarily changed to say that this change has come upon him by the divine will, just as it is not proper for him to say so who has done evil of his own accord;", "3313": "and lie says that he will give this place, not to him who has slain the man, but to him with whom he is con­ versing, so that the inhabitant of it shall be one person, but he who flees to it for refuge another;", "3314": "for God has given his own word a country to inhabit, namely, his own knowledge, as if it were a native of it.", "3315": "But to the man who is under the pollution of involuntary error he has given a foreign home as to a stranger, not a country as to a citizen.", "3316": "XV, Having now said thus much in a philosophical spirit with respect to involuntary offences, he proceeds to legislate concerning the man who rises up to attack another, or who treacherously plots his death, saying, \" But if any one attacks his neighbour so as to slay him by treachery, and he flees to God,\" that is to say to the place which has already been spoken of under a figure, from which life is given to all men.", "3317": "For he says also in another passage:", "3318": "\" Whosoever shall flee thither shall live.\"", "3319": "But is not everlasting life a fleeing for refuge to the living God ?", "3320": "and is not a fleeing from his presence death ?", "3321": "But if anyone sets upon another, he by all means is committing iniquity by deliberate purpose, and that which is done with treachery is liable to be accounted among voluntary actions, just as, on the other hand, that which is done without treachery is not subject to blame.", "3322": "There is nothing therefore of the wicked actions which are done secretly, and treacherously, and of malice aforethought, which we can properly say are done through the will of God, but they are done only through our own will.", "3323": "For, as I have said before, the storehouses of wickedness are in us ourselves, and those of good alone are with God.", "3324": "Whosoever therefore flees for refuge, that is to say, whoso­ ever accuses not himself, but God as the cause of his offence, let him be punished, being deprived of that refuge to the altar which tends to salvation and security, and which is meant for suppliants alone.", "3325": "And is not this proper ?", "3326": "For the altar is full of victims, in which there is no spot, I mean of innocent and thoroughly purified souls.", "3327": "But to pronounce the Deity the cause of evil is a spot which it is hard to cure, or rather which is altogether incurable.", "3328": "Those who have cultivated such a disposition as to be lovers of themselves rather than lovers of God, may remain at a distance from the sacred places, in order that as polluted and impure persons, they may not behold, not even from a distance, the sacred flame of the evil which is unextinguishably set on fire, and purified, and dedicated to God with entire and perfect power.", "3329": "Very beautifully, therefore, did one of the wise men of old, hastening on to this same conclusion, find confidence to say that \"", "3330": "God is in no respect and in no place unjust, but he is the most righteous being possible.", "3331": "There is nothing that more nearly resembles him than the man who is as just as possible.", "3332": "Around is the strength, and the real ability, and power of man, and also nothingness and unmanliness.", "3333": "For the knowledge of him is wisdom and true virtue ;", "3334": "but the ignorance of him is real ignorance and manifest wickedness.", "3335": "And all other things which appear to be cleverness or wisdom, if they be displayed in political affairs are troublesome, and if in acts, are sordid.*XVI.", "3336": "Therefore, having further commanded the unholy man who is a speaker of evil against divine things to be removed from the most holy places and to be given up to punishment, he proceeds to say, \" Whosoever hateth his father or his mother, let him die.\"†", "3337": "And in a similar strain he says, \"He who accuseth his father or his mother, let him die.\"", "3338": "He here all but cries out and shouts that there is no pardon whatever to be given to those who blaspheme the Deity.", "3339": "For if they who bring accusations against their mortal parents are led away to death, what punishment must we think that those men deserve who venture to blaspheme the Father and Creator of the universe ?", "3340": "And what accusation can be more dis­ graceful than to say that the origin of evil is not in us but in God ?", "3341": "Drive away, therefore, drive away, 0 ye who have been initiated in, and who are the hierophants of, the sacred mysteries, drive away, I say, the souls which are mixed and in a confused crowd, and brought together promiscuously from all quarters, those unpurified and still polluted souls, which have their ears not closed, and their tongues unrestrained, and which bear about all the instruments of their misery ready prepared, in order that they may hear all things, even those which it is not lawful to hear.", "3342": "But they who have been instructed in the difference between voluntary and involuntary offences, and who have received a tongue which speaketh good things instead of one which delighteth in accusation, when they do right are to be praised, and when they err contrary to their intention, they are not greatly to be blamed, for which reason cities have been set apart for them to flee unto for refuge.", "3343": "XVII.", "3344": "And it is worth while to examine with all the accu­ racy possible into some necessary points relating to this place.", "3345": "They are four in number.", "3346": "One, why it is that the cities which were set apart for the fugitives were not chosen out of those cities which the other tribes received as their portion, but only out of those which were assigned to the tribe of Levi.", "3347": "The second point is, why they were six in number, and neither more nor fewer.", "3348": "The third is, why three of them were beyond Jordan, and the other three in the land of the Canaanites.", "3349": "The fourth is, why the death of the high priest was appointed to the fugitives as a limit, after which they might return.", "3350": "We must, therefore, say what is suitable on each of these heads, beginning with the first in order.", "3351": "It is with exceeding propriety that the command is given to flee only to those cities which had been assigned to the tribe of Levi;", "3352": "for the Levites themselves are in a manner fugitives, inasmuch as they, for the sake of pleasing God, have left parents, and children, and brethren, and all their mortal relations.", "3353": "Therefore the original leader of this com­ pany is represented as saying to his father and mother, \" I have not seen you, and my brethren I do not know, and my sons I disown,\"* in order to be able to serve the living God without allowing any opposite attraction to draw him away.", "3354": "But real flight is a deprivation of all that is nearest and dearest to a man.", "3355": "And it introduces one fugitive to another, so as to make them forget what they have done by reason of the similarity of their actions.", "3356": "Either, therefore, it is for this reason alone, or perhaps for this other also, that the Levitical tribe of the persons set apart for the service of the temple ran up, and at one onset slew those who had made a god of the golden calf, the pride of Egypt, killing all who had arrived at the age of puberty, being inflamed with righteous anger, com­ bined with enthusiasm, and a certain heaven-sent inspiration:", "3357": "\" And every one slew his brother, and his neighbour, and him that was nearest to him.\"t", "3358": "The body being the brother of the soul, and the irrational part the neighbour of the rational, and the uttered speech that which is nearest to the mind.", "3359": "For by the following means alone can that which is most excellent within us become adapted for and inclined to the service of him who is the most excellent of all existing beings.", "3360": "In the first place, if man be resolved into soul, the body, which is akin to it as a brother, being separated and cut off from it, and also all its insatiable desires;", "3361": "and in the second place when the soul has, as I have already said, cast off the irrational part, which is the neighbour of the rational part;", "3362": "for this, like a torrent, being divided into five channels, excites the impetuosity of the passions through all the external senses, as so many aqueducts.", "3363": "Then, in regular order, the reason removes to a distance and separates the uttered speech which appeared to be the nearest to it of all things, in order that speech, according to the intention, might alone be left, free from the body, free from the entanglements of the outward senses, and free from all uttered speech;", "3364": "for when it is left in this manner existing in a solitary manner, it will embrace that which alone is to be embraced with purity, and in such a way that it cannot be drawn away.", "3365": "In addition to what has been said above, we must also mention this point, that the tribe of Levi is the tribe of the ministers of the temple and of the priests, to whom the service and ministration of holy things is assigned;", "3366": "and they also perform sacred service who have committed unintentional homicide, since, according to Moses, \" God gives into their hands\"* those who have done things worthy of death, with a view to their execution.", "3367": "But it is the duty of the one body to know the good, and of the other body to chastise the wicked.", "3368": "XVIII.", "3369": "These then are the reasons on account of which they who have committed unintentional homicide fly only to those cities which belong to the ministers of the temple.", "3370": "We must now proceed to mention what these cities are, and why they are six in number.", "3371": "Perhaps we may say that the most ancient, and the strongest, and the most excellent metropolis, for I may not call it merely a city, is the divine word, to flee to which first is the most advantageous course of all.", "3372": "But the other five, being as it were colonies of that one, are the powers of Him who utters the word, the chief of which is his creative power, according to which the Creator made the world with a word ;", "3373": "the second is his kingly power, according to which he who has created rules over what is created ;", "3374": "the third is his merciful power, in respect of which the Creator pities and shows mercy towards his own work ;", "3375":

"Who else could more greatly display the exceeding abun­ dance of his mercy, of all the powers which are able to benefit us, towards such an exceeding variety of persons who err by unintentional misdeeds, and who have neither the same strength nor the same weakness ?", "3380": "Therefore he exhorts him who is able to run swiftly to strain onwards, without stopping to take breath, to the highest word of God, which is the fountain of wisdom, in order that by drinking of that stream he may find everlasting life instead of death.", "3381": "But he urges him who is not so swift of foot to flee for refuge to the creative power which Moses calls God, since it is by that power that all things were made and arranged;", "3382": "for to him who compre­ hends that everything has been created, that comprehension alone, and the knowledge of the Creator, is a great acquisition of good, which immediately persuades the creature to love him who created it.", "3383": "Him, again, who is still less ready he bids flee to his kingly power ;", "3384": "for that which is in subjection is corrected by the fear of him who rules it, and by necessity which keeps it in order, even if the child is not kept in the right way by love for his father.", "3385": "Again, in the case of him who is not able to reach the boundaries which have been already mentioned, in respect of their being a long way off, there are other goals appointed for them at a shorter distance, the cities namely of the necessary powers, the city of the power of the mercy, the city of the power which enjoins what is right, the city of the power which forbids what is not right:", "3386": "for he who is already persuaded that the Deity is not implacable, but is merciful by reason of the gentleness of his nature, then, even if he has previously sinned, subsequently repents from a hope of pardon.", "3387": "And he who has adopted the notion that God is a lawgiver obeys all the injunctions which as such he imposes, and so will be happy;", "3388": "and lie who is last of all will find the last refuge, namely, the escape from evil, even though he may not be able to arrive at a participation in the more desirable good things.", "3389": "XIX.", "3390": "These, then, are the six cities which Moses calls cities of refuge, five of which have had their figures set forth in the sacred scriptures, and their images are there likewise.", "3391": "The images of the cities of command and prohibition are the laws in the ark;", "3392": "that of the merciful power of God is the covering of the ark, and he calls it the mercy-seat.", "3393": "The images of the creative power and of the kingly power are the winged cherubim which are placed upon it.", "3394": "But the divine word which is above these does not come into any visible appearance, inasmuch as it is not like to any of the things that come under the external senses, but is itself an image of God, the most ancient of all the objects of intellect in the whole world, and that which is placed in the closest proximity to the only truly existing God, without any partition or distance being interposed between them:", "3395": "for it is said, \" I will speak unto thee from above the mercy-seat, in the midst, between the two cherubim.\"*", "3396": "So that the word is, as it were, the charioteer of the powers, and he who utters it is the rider, who directs the charioteer how to proceed with a view to the proper guidance of the universe.", "3397": "Therefore, he who is so far removed from committing any intentional misdeeds, that he is even free from all uninten­ tional offence, will have God himself for his inheritance, and will dwell in him alone.", "3398": "But those who fall into errors which proceed not from wilful purpose, but which are done without premeditation, will have the aforesaid places of refuge in all abundance and fulness.", "3399": "Now of the cities of refuge there are three on the other side of Jordan, which are at a great distance from our race.", "3400": "What cities are they?", "3401": "The word of the Governor of the universe, and his creative power, and his kingly power:", "3402": "for to these belong the heaven and the whole world.", "3403": "But those which, as it were, participate in us, and which are near to us, and which almost touch the unfortunate race of mankind which is alone capable of sinning, are the three on this side of the river;", "3404": "the merciful power, the power -which enjoins what is to be done.", "3405": "the power which prohibits what ought not to be done:", "3406": "for these powers touch us.", "3407": "For what need can there be of pro­ hibition to persons who are not likely to do wrong ?", "3408": "And what need of injunction to people who are not by nature inclined to stumble ?", "3409": "And what need of mercy can those persons have who will absolutely never do wrong at all ?", "3410": "But our race of mankind has need of all these things because it is by nature inclined and liable to offences both voluntary and involuntary.", "3411": "XX.", "3412": "The fourth and last of the points which we proposed to discuss, is the appointing as a period for the return of the fugitives the death of the high priest, which, if taken in the literal sense, causes me great perplexity;", "3413": "for a very unequal punishment is imposed by this enactment on those who have done the very same things, since some will be in banishment for a longer time, and others for a shorter time;", "3414": "for some of the high priests live to a very old age, and others die very early, and some are appointed while young men, and others not until they are old.", "3415": "And again of those who are convicted of unintentional homicide, some have been banished 'at the beginning of the high priest's entrance into office, and some when the high priest has been at the very point of death.", "3416": "So that some are deprived of their country for a very long time, and others suffer the same infliction only for a day, if it chance to be so;", "3417": "after which they lift up their heads, and exult, and so return among those whose nearest relations have been slain by them.", "3418": "This difficult and scarcely explicable perplexity we may escape if we adopt the inner and allegorical explanation in accordance with natural philosophy.", "3419": "For we say that the high priest is not a man, but is the word of God, who has not only no participation in intentional errors, but none even in those which are involuntary.", "3420": "For Moses says that he cannot be defiled neither in respect of his father, that is, the mind, nor of his mother, that is, the external sense ;", "3421": "* because, I imagine, he has received imperishable and wholly pure parents, God being his father, who is also the father of all things, and wisdom being his mother, by means of whom the universe arrived at creation;", "3422": "and also because he is anointed with oil, by which I mean that the principal part of him is illuminated with a light like the beams of the sun, so as to be thought worthy to be clothed with garments.", "3423": "And the most ancient word of the living God is clothed with the word as with a garment, for it has put on earth, and water, and air, and fire, and the things which proceed from these elements.", "3424": "But the particular soul is clothed with the body, and the mind of the wise man is clothed with the virtues.", "3425": "And it is said that he will never take the mitre off from his head, he will never lay aside the kingly diadem, the symbol of an authority which is not indeed absolute, but only that of a viceroy, but which is nevertheless an object of admiration.", "3426": "Nor will he \"rend his clothes ;", "3427": "” for the word cf the living", "3428": "God being the bond of every thing, as has been said before, holds all things together, and binds all the parts, and prevents them from being loosened or separated.", "3429": "And the particular soul, as far as it has received power, does not permit any of the parts of the body to be separated or cut off contrary to their nature;", "3430": "but as far as depends upon itself, it preserves every thing entire, and conducts the differ­ ent parts to a harmony and indissoluble union with one another.", "3431": "But the mind of the wise mail being thoroughly purified, preserves the virtues in an unbroken and unimpaired condition, having adapted their natural kindred and commu­ nion with a still more solid good will.", "3432": "XXI.", "3433": "This high priest, as Moses says, \"shall not enter into any soul that is dead.\"", "3434": "But the death of the soul is a life according to wickedness;", "3435": "so that he must never touch any pollution such as folly is fond of dealing with.", "3436": "And to him also \" a virgin of the sacred race is joined ;", "3437": "” that is to say, an opinion for ever pure, and undefiled, and imperishable;", "3438": "for he \" may never become the husband of a widow, or of one who has been divorced, or of one who is a profane person, or of one who is a harlot,\" since he is always proclaiming an endless and irreconcileable war against them.", "3439": "For it is a hateful thing to him to be widowed with respect to virtue, and to be divorced and driven away by her;", "3440": "and in like manner all per­ suasion of this kind is profane and unholy.", "3441": "But that promiscuous evil abandoned to many husbands, and to the worship of many gods, that is, a harlot, he does not think fit even to look upon, being content with her who has chosen for herself one husband and father only, the all-govern­ ing God.", "3442": "There is a certain extravagance of perfection visible in this disposition.", "3443": "He has known* the man who has vowed the great vow in some instances offending unintentionally, even if not of deliberate purpose ;", "3444": "for he says, \" But if any one die before him suddenly, he shall be at once polluted.\"", "3445": "For if of things without deliberation anything coming from without strikes down suddenly, such things do at once pollute the soul, but not with a pollution which remains for any length of time, inasmuch as they are unintentional actions.", "3446": "And about these actions the high priest (standing above them, as he also does above those which are voluntary) is indifferent.", "3447": "But I am not saying this at random, but for the sake of proving that the period of the death of the high priest is a most natural termination of exile to be appointed by the law, so as to allow of the return of the fugitives.", "3448": "As long, there­ fore.", "3449": "as this most sacred word lives and survives in the soul, it is impossible for any involuntary error to enter into it;", "3450": "for it is by nature so framed as to have no participation in, and to be incapable of admitting any kind of error.", "3451": "But if it dies (not meaning by this that it is itself destroyed, but that it is separated from our soul), then a return is at once granted to intentional offences.", "3452": "For if while the word remained and was healthy in us, error was driven to a distance, by all means, when the word departs, error will be introduced.", "3453": "For the undefiled high priest, conscience, has derived from nature this most especial honour, that no error of the mind can find any place within him;", "3454": "on which account it is worth our while to pray that the high priest may live in the soul, being at the same time both a judge and a convictor, who having received jurisdiction over the whole of our minds, is not altered in his appearance or purpose by any of those things which are brought under his judgment.", "3455": "XXII.", "3456": "Having now, therefore, said what was proper on the subject of fugitives, we will proceed with what follows in the regular order of the context.", "3457": "In the first place it is said, “The angel of the Lord found her in the way,\"* pitying the soul which out of modesty had voluntarily committed the danger of wandering about, and very nearly becoming a con­ ductor of her return to opinion void of error.", "3458": "It is desirable also not to pass over in silence the things which are said in a philosophical strain by the lawgiver on the subject of discovery and investigation;", "3459": "for he represents some persons as neither investigating nor discovering anything, others as succeeding in both these paths, others as having chosen only one of them;", "3460": "of which last class some who seek do not find, and others find without having sought.", "3461": "Those, then, who have no desire for either discovery or investigation have shamefully debased their reason by ignorance and indifference, and though they had it in their power to see acutely, they have become blind.", "3462": "Thus he says that \"", "3463": "Lot's wife turning backwards became a pillar of salt not here inventing a fable, but pointing out the proper nature of the event.", "3464": "For whoever despises his teacher, and under the influence of an innate and habitual indolence forsakes what

political disposition is introduced, which, without being at all over ambitious of glory, has a desire for that better generation, which the virtues have received as their inheritance, and which consequently seeks and finds it;", "3475": "for, says the scripture, \" A man found Joseph in the plain, and asked him saying, What seekest thou ;", "3476": "and he said, I am seeking my brothers;",

to what is good, he is worthy of being received, if the dreams and visions of those things, which are fancied to be and which appear to be good, do not again overwhelm him and immerse him in luxury.",

attained to the objects of his wishes ;", "3488": "but he will find none of the things which he desires among the wicked.", "3489": "Why not ?", "3490": "Because they departed from hence.", "3491":

numbers of brilliant con­ stellations.", "3708": "The periodical revolution of the sun is another witness, for he accomplishes his circle in twelve months, and men also reckon the hours of the day and of the night as equal in number to the months of the year, and the passages are not few in which Moses celebrates this number, describing the twelve tribes of his nation, appointing by law the offering of the twelve cakes of shew'bread, and ordering twelve stones, on which inscriptions are engraved, to be woven into the sacred robe of the garment, reaching down to the feet of the high­ priest, on liis oracular dress.", "3709": "He also celebrates the number seven, multiplied by the number ten;", "3710": "at one time speaking of the seventy palm-trees by the fountains, and in other

demonstrate.", "4017": "The meanings now are three, \" the father,\" and \" elect,\" and “of sound.\"", "4018": "Now by the word \" sound \" here, we mean uttered speech ;", "4019": "for the sounding organ of the living animal is the organ of speech.", "4020": "Of this faculty we say that the father is the mind, for it is from the mind, as from a fountain, that the stream of speech proceeds.", "4021": "The word \" elect \" belongs to the mind of the wise man, for whatever is most excellent is found in him;", "4022": "therefore the man devoted to learning and occupied in the contemplation of sublime subjects, was sketched out according to the former characteristic marks, but the philoso­ pher, or I should rather say the wise man, was exhibited in accordance with those of which we have just given an outline.", "4023": "Think not, then, any longer that the Deity bestows a change of names, but consider that what lie gives is a correction of the moral character by means of symbols;", "4024": "for having invited the man who formerly busied himself about the subject of the nature of heaven, and whom some call a mathematician, to a participation in virtue, he made him wise and called him so.", "4025": "For having given an appropriate name to his transformed dis­ position, he named him, as the Hebrews would call it, \"Abra­ ham,\" but in the language of the Greeks, \" the elect

heavens?", "4028": "Is it merely that you may indulge your curiosity with respect to those matters ?", "4029": "And what advantage could accrue to you from all this curiosity ?", "4030": "What destruction of pleasure would it cause ?", "4031": "What defeat of appetite ?", "4032": "What dissolution of pain or fear ?", "4033": "What eradication of the passions which disturb and agitate the soul?", "4034": "For as there is no advantage in trees unless they are productive of fruit, so in the same way there is no use in the study of natural philosophy unless it is likely to confer upon a man the acquisition of virtue, for that is its proper fruit.", "4035": "On which account some of the ancients have compared the discussion and consideration of philosophy to a field, and have likened the physical portion of it to the plants, the logical part to the hedges and fences, the moral part to the fruit, thinking that the walls which are built around for the sake of protecting the fruit have been erected by the possessors of the land, and that the plants have been created for the sake of the produc­ tion of fruit;", "4036": "thus, therefore, they said that in philosophy it is requisite for the consideration of the physical and the logical part of philosophy to be referred to the moral part, by which the moral character is improved, which has a desire at the same time for both the acquisition and the use of virtue.", "4037": "This is the lesson which we have been taught concerning the man who in word indeed had his name changed, but who in reality changed his nature from the consideration of natural to that of moral philosophy, and who abandoned the contempla­ tion of the world itself for the knowledge of the Being who created the world ;", "4038": "by which knowledge he acquired piety, the most excellent of all possessions.", "4039": "XI.", "4040": "We will now speak of his wife, Sarah, for she too had her name changed to Sarrah by the addition of the one element, the letter rho.", "4041": "These, then, are the names, and we must now explain what they mean.", "4042": "Sarah, being interpreted, signifies \"my authority,\" but Sarrah signifies “ princess;", "4043": "” the former name, therefore, is a symbol of specific virtue, but the latter of generic virtue.", "4044": "But in proportion as genus is superior to species in regard of quantity, in the same propor­ tion does the latter name excel the former;", "4045": "for species is something small and perishable, but genus is numerous and immortal, and the intention of God is to bestow great and immortal things instead of such as are small and perishable, and this is a task suited to his dignity.", "4046": "Now the prudence which exists in the virtuous man is the authority of himself alone, and he who has it would not err if he were to say, my authority is the prudence which is in me;", "4047": "but that which has stretched out this authority is generic prudence, not any longer the authority of this or that person, but absolute intrinsic authority;", "4048": "therefore that which exists only in species will perish at the same time with its possessor, but that which, like a seal, has stamped it with an impression, is free from all mortality, and will remain for ever and ever imperishable.", "4049": "Thus also those arts which exist only in species perish along with those who have acquired them, such as geometricians, grammarians, and musicians, but the generic arts remain exempt from destruction.", "4050": "And, again, he gives an additional sketch of his meaning when he teaches by the same name that every virtue is a princess, and a queen, and a ruler of all the affairs of life.", "4051": "XII.", "4052": "But it has also happened that Jacob had his name changed to Israel;", "4053": "and this, too, was a felicitous alteration.", "4054": "Why so ?", "4055": "Because the name Jacob means “ a supplanter,\" but the name Israel signifies “ the man who sees God.\"", "4056": "Now it is the employment of a supplanter, who practises virtue, to move, and disturb, and upset the foundations of passion on which it is established, and whatever there is of any strength which is founded on them.", "4057": "But these things are not brought about without a struggle or without severe labour;", "4058": "but only when any one, having gone through all the labours of prudence, then proceeds to practise himself in the exercises of the soul and to wrestle against the reasonings which are hostile to it, and which seek to torment it ;", "4059": "but it is the part of him who sees", "4060": "God not to depart from the sacred contest without the crown of victory, but rather to carry off the prize of triumph.", "4061": "And what more flourishing and more suitable crown could be woven for the victorious soul than one by which it will be able acutely and clearly to behold the living God?", "4062": "At least a beautiful prize is thus proposed for the soul which delights in the practice of virtue, namely, the being endowed with sight adequate to the clear comprehension of the only thing which is really worth beholding.", "4063": "XIII.", "4064": "And it is worth while here to raise the question why Abraham, from the time that his name was changed, is always thought worthy of this same appellation, and is no longer called by his former name;", "4065": "but Jacob, who is also called Israel, is nevertheless called Jacob too, as he was before the change of his name;", "4066": "and, indeed, is called Jacob oftener than Israel.", "4067": "We must say, then, that these facts are characters by which it is seen that the virtue which is taught differs from that which is acquired by practice ;", "4068": "for the man who is improved by instruction, having received a happy and virtuous nature, uses that virtue alone which, by means of memory co-operating with it, implants in him an absence of forgetfulness, so that he comprehends and takes firm hold of all the\" things which he has once learnt ;", "4069": "but he who practises virtue, since he is con­ tinually exercising himself, stops to take breath, and relaxes his efforts for- a while, collecting himself and recovering the vigour which was a little impaired by his exertions, just as those men do who have oiled their bodies for the contests in the arena", "4070": "For these men, also, labouring at their training exercises, in order to prevent their powers being utterly broken down, anoint themselves with oil on account of the violent and continued nature of their exercise", "4071": "Then the man who is improved by instruction, having an immortal monitor, receives from him a harmonious and impe­ rishable advantage, without suffering any change ;", "4072": "but the practiser of virtue is impelled to action by his own inclination alone, and he exercises himself in it, and labours at it in order to change that passion, which is akin to a created being;", "4073": "and even if he attains to perfection, he still, being fatigued, returns to his ancient kind of labour;", "4074": "for he is more inclined to endure toil, but the other is more fortunate, for he has another person as a teacher.", "4075": "But this man, by his own unassisted efforts, investigates, and inquires, and pushes his examination, investi­ gating the mysteries of nature with great earnestness, and exerting continual and incessant labour.", "4076": "For this reason God, who never changes, altered the name of Abrabam, since he was about to remain in a similar condi­ tion, in order that that which was to be firmly established might be confirmed by him who was standing firmly, and who was remaining in the same state in the same manner.", "4077": "But it was an angel who altered the name of Jacob, being the Word, the minister of God ;", "4078": "in order that it might be confessed and ascertained, that there is none of the things whose existence is subsequent to that of the living God, which is the cause or unchangeable and unvarying firmness . . . . . .", "4079": "but of that harmony which, as in a musical instrument, contains the intensity and relaxation of sounds so as to produce an artistical combination of melody.", "4080": "XIV.", "4081": "But, there being three leaders and authors of this race, the two at each extremity of it had their names changed, namely Abraham and Jacob :", "4082": "but the one in the middle, Isaac, always retained the same appellation.", "4083": "Why was this?", "4084": "Because both that virtue which is derived from teaching and that which is attained to by practice, admit of improvement and advancement:", "4085": "for the man who receives instruction desires a knowledge of those matters of which he is ignorant and he who applies himself to practice desires the crowns of victory, and the prizes which -are proposed to his industrious and contemplation-loving soul.", "4086": "But the race which is self- taught and which derives all its learning from its own dili­ gence, inasmuch as it exists rather by nature than by study, was at the very beginning introduced as equal, and perfect, and even, there being no number whatever deficient of those which tend to completeness.", "4087": "Nor indeed does Joseph have any such need, he who is the president of the necessities of the body ;", "4088": "for he also changes his name, being called Psonthomphanech by the king of the country.", "4089": "And what the meaning of these names is we must explain;", "4090": "the name Joseph, being interpreted, signifies “ an addition”", "4091": "For things which are put by the side are an addition to those which exist by nature ;", "4092": "for instance, gold, silver, possessions, revenues, the ministrations of servants, abundant treasure of heirlooms, and furniture, and other superfluities, and the infinite multitude of the different efficients of pleasure which some persons possess;",

purveyor of the food of all the corporeal region, Egypt, having stored it up in his treasure-houses.", "4096": "XV.", "4097": "Such a person as this, then, Joseph is recognized as being by his distinctive marks and name.", "4098": "Let us now see what sort of person is indicated by the name Psonthomphanech.", "4099": "Now this name being interpreted means, \"a mouth judging in an answer ;",

which any one puts to him, aud com­ petent also of his own head to deliver advantageous and sagacious opinions.", "4101": "And, in short, by such men prudence is supposed to be identical with good fortune, while one ought, on the contrary, to consider good fortune as consisting in being prudent ;", "4102": "for it is fitting that what is unstable should be under the direction of that which stands firmly.", "4103": "And indeed his father gave to his own uterine brother the name of Benjamin :", "4104": "* but his mother called him the son of her sorrow, speaking most completely in

multitude.", "4109": "He therefore who is an admirer and desirer of such things is very appropriately called a soil of days:", "4110": "that is to say, of that light which is per­ ceptible by the

supposed in­ deed to be happy, but in real truth are unhappy.", "4116": "For the things which oppose their happiness are numerous, envy, discontent, emulation, continual strife, irreconcileable enmities lasting till death, hostilities handed down in succession to one's children's children—a destiny not at all to be desired.", "4117": "Very necessarily therefore did the divinely inspired prophet represent that vain glory as dying in the very act of bringing forth ;", "4118": "for says he, \" Rachel died, having had a bad delivery.\"", "4119": "* Since, in truth and reality, the sowing

divine, and customs above laws, and profane above sacred things, and mortal above immortal things, and, in short, appearances above reality;", "4143": "and it even ventures of its own accord to pass

offend in one's language either by speaking falsely, or by swearing falsely, or by deceiving, or by practising sophistry, or by laying false informations;", "4588": "or, in short, by letting loose

forced their way into it, than was itself acting.", "4600": "But whatever goes out through the mouth that he makes the utterer responsible for and brings him before the tribunal, since the act of

excellent part of man, the mind.", "4610": "And birds are an emblem of the purification of the speech :", "4611": "for speech is a light thing, and winged by nature, flying and penetrating in every

this view, can you find any more trustworthy than that of Moses ?", "4651": "And he says that the rest of mankind derive their food from the earth, but that he alone who is endowed with the power of

will be found to be not a simple one, but rather one of great complications and variety, not easy to be seized upon, but difficult to discover, difficult to master, hostile to delay, and indolence and indifference, full of earnestness and contention, and sweat, and care.", "4728": "For which reason \" those who dig in this well say that they cannot find even water in it;", "4729": "\" because the ends of science are not only hard to discover, but are even altogether undiscoverable ;", "4730": "and it is owing to this that one man is more thoroughy skilled in gram­ mar or in geometry than another, because of its being impossible to circumscribe, increase, and extend one within certain limits;", "4731": "for there is always more that is left behind than what comes to be learnt;", "4732": "and what is left watches for and catches the learner, so that even lie who fancies that he has comprehended and mastered the very extremities of know­ ledge would be considered but half perfect by another person who was his judge, and if he were before the tribunal of truth would appear to be only beginning knowledge;", "4733": "for life is short, as some one has said, but art is long;", "4734": "of which that man most thoroughly comprehends the magnitude, who sincerely and honestly plunges deeply into it, and who digs it out like a well.", "4735": "And such a man, when he is at the point of death, being now grey-headed and exceedingly old, it is said, wept, not that he feared death as being a coward, but out of a desire for instruc­ tion, as feeling that he was now, for the first time, entering upon it when lie was finally departing from life.", "4736": "For the soul flourishes for the pursuit of knowledge when the prime vigour of the body is withering away from the lapse of time;", "4737": "therefore, before one has arrived at one's prime and vigour by reason of a more accurate comprehension of things, it is not difficult to be tripped up.", "4738": "But this

"Therefore the well of knowledge is shown to be of this kind, having no boundary and no end.", "4741": "We must now explain why it was called the well of the oath.", "4742": "Those matters which are doubted about are decided by an oath, and those which are uncertain are confirmed in the same manner, and so, too, those which want certification receive it;", "4743": "from which facts this inference is drawn, that there is no subject respecting which any one can make an affirmation with greater certainty than he can respecting the fact that the race of wisdom is without limitation and without end.", "4744": "It is well, therefore, to enrol one's self under the banners of one who discusses these matters without an oath;", "4745": "but he who is not very much inclined to assent to the assertions or another will at least assent to them when he has made oath to their correctness.", "4746": "But let no one refuse to take an oath of this kind, well knowing that he will have his name inscribed on pillars among those who are faithful to their oaths.", "4747": "III.", "4748": "However, enough of this.", "4749": "The next thing must be to consider why it is that as four wells had been dug by the servants of Abraham and Isaac, the fourth and last was called the well of the oath.", "4750": "May it not be that the sacred historian here desires to represent, in a figurative manner, that as in the universe there are four elements of which this world is composed, and as there are an equal number in ourselves, of which we have been fashioned before we were moulded into our human shape, three of them are capable of being compre­ hended somehow or other, but the fourth is unintelligible to all who come forward as judges of it.", "4751": "Accordingly, we find that the four elements in the world are the earth, and the water, and the air, and the heaven, of which, even if some are difficult to find, they are still not classed in the utterly undiscoverable portion.", "4752": "For that the earth, because it is a heavy, and indissoluble, and solid substance, is divided into mountains and champaign districts, and intersected by rivers and seas, so that some portion of it consists of islands, and some portions are con­ tinent.", "4753": "And again, some of it has a shallow and some a deep soil;", "4754": "and some is rough, and rugged, and strong, and alto­ gether barren ;", "4755": "and some is smooth and delicate, and exceed­ ingly fertile ;", "4756": "and besides all these facts we know a great number of others relative to the earth.", "4757": "And again, there is the water, which we know has many of the aforesaid qualities in common with the earth, and many also peculiar to itself;", "4758": "for some of it is sweet, and some brackish, and some is mixed up of various characteristics ;", "4759": "and some is good to drink, and some is not drinkable ;", "4760": "and, moreover, neither of these last qualities is invariable with respect to every creature, but there are some to which it is the one and not the other, and vice versâ.", "4761": "Again, some water is by nature cold, and other water naturally hot;", "4762": "for there is in all sorts of places an infinite number of springs pouring forth hot water, not on the land only but even in the sea:", "4763": "at all events, there have appeared before now veins pouring up warm water in the middle of the sea, which all the enormous efflux of salt water in all the sea that encircles the world, pouring over them from all eternity, has never been able to extinguish, nor even in the least degree to diminish.", "4764": "Again, we know that the air has an attractive nature, yield­ ing to such bodies as surround it in an altitude of resistance, being the organ of life, and breath, and sight, and hearing, and all the rest of the external senses, admitting of rarifica­ tion, and condensation, and motion, and tranquillity, and changes, and variations of every kind, by which it is altered and modified, and generating summers and winters, and the seasons of autumn and spring, by means of which the circle of the year is at last brought to a conclusion.", "4765": "IV.", "4766": "All these things, then, we feel:", "4767": "but the heaven has a nature which is incomprehensible, and it has never conveyed to us any distinct indication by which we can understand its nature;", "4768": "for what can we say?", "4769": "that it is solid ice, as some persons have chosen to assert?", "4770": "or that it is the purest fire?", "4771": "or that it is a fifth body, moving in a circle having no partici­ pation in any of the four elements ?", "4772": "For what can we say?", "4773": "Has that most remote sphere of the fixed stars any density in an upward direction ?", "4774": "or is it merely a superficies devoid of all depth, something like a plane figure ?", "4775": "And what are the stars?", "4776": "Are they masses of earth full of fire?", "4777": "For some persons have said that they are hills, and valleys, and thickets, men who are worthy of a prison and a treadmill, or of any place where there are instruments proper for the punishment of impious persons ;", "4778": "or are they, as some one has defined them, a continuous and dense harmony, the closely packed, indissoluble mass of æther ?", "4779": "Again, are they animated and intelligent?", "4780": "or are they destitute alike of mind and vitality ?", "4781": "Have they their motions in consequence of any choice of their own ?", "4782": "or merely because they are compulsory?", "4783": "What, again, are we to say of the moon?", "4784": "Does she show us a light of her own, or a borrowed and illegitimate one, only reflected from the rays of the sun ?", "4785": "or is neither of these things true, but has she something mixed, as it were, so as to be a sort of combination of her own light and of that which belongs to some other body ?", "4786": "For all these things, and others like them, belonging to the fourth and most excellent of the bodies in the world, namely, the heaven, are uncertain and incomprehensible, and are spoken of in accordance with conjectures and guesses, and not with the solid, certain reasoning of truth, so that a person might venture to swear that no mortal man will ever be able to comprehend any one of these matters clearly.", "4787": "At all events, the fourth and dry well was called the well of the oath on this account, because the search after the fourth element in the world, that is to say the heaven, is without any result, and is in every respect fruitless.", "4788": "V.", "4789": "But let us now see in what manner that fourth element in us is by nature in such an especial and singular manner incomprehensible.", "4790": "There are, then, four principal elements in us, the body, the external sense, the speech, and the mind.", "4791": "Now of these, three are not uncertain or unintelligible in every respect, but they contain some indication in themselves by which they are comprehended.", "4792": "Now what is my meaning in this statement?", "4793": "We know already that the body is divisible into three parts.", "4794": "and that it is capable of motion in six directions, inasmuch as it has three dimensions, in length, in depth, in breadth;", "4795": "and twice as many motions, namely six, the upward motion, the downward motion, that to the right, that to the left, the forward, and the backward motion.", "4796": "But, moreover, we are not ignorant that it is the vessel of the soul;", "4797": "and we are also aware that it is subject to the changes of being young, of de­ caying, of growing old, of dying, of undergoing dissolution.", "4798": "And with respect to the outward senses, we are not.", "4799": "so far as that is concerned, utterly dull and mutilated, but we are able to say that that also is divided into five divisions, and that there are appropriate organs for the development of each sense formed by nature ;", "4800": "for instance, the eyes for seeing, the ears for hearing, the nostrils for smelling, and the other organs for the exercise of the respective senses to which they are adapted, and also that we may call these outward senses messengers of the mind which inform it of colours, and shapes, and sounds, and the peculiar differences of vapours, and flavours, and, in short, which describe to it all bodies, and all the distinctive qualities which exist in them.", "4801": "They also may be looked upon as body-guards of the soul, informing it of all that they see or hear;", "4802": "and if anything injurious attacks it from without, they foresee it, and guard against it, so that it may not enter by chance and unawares, and so become the cause of irremediable disaster to their mistress.", "4803": "Again, the voice does not entirely escape our compre­ hension ;", "4804": "but we know that one voice is shrill and another deep;", "4805": "that one is tuneful and harmonious, and another disso­ nant and very unmusical ;", "4806": "and again, one voice is more powerful, and another less so.", "4807": "And they differ also in ten thousand other particulars, in kind.", "4808": "in complexion, in distance, in combined 'and separate tension of the tones, in the sympho­ nies of fourths, of fifths, and of the diapason.", "4809": "Moreover, there are some things which we know also with respect to that articulate voice which has been allotted to man alone of all animals, as, for instance, we know that it is emitted by the mind, that it receives its articulate distinctness in the mouth, that it is by the striking of the tongue that articulate utterance is impressed upon the tones of the voice, and which renders the uttered sound not only a bare, naked, useless noise, void of all characteristic, and that it discharges the office of a herald or interpreter towards the mind which suggests it.", "4810": "VI.", "4811": "Now then is the fourth element which exists within us, the dominant mind, comprehensible to us in the same manner as these other divisions ?", "4812": "Certainly not;", "4813": "for what do we think it to he in its essence ?", "4814": "Do we look upon it as spirit, or as blood, or, in short, as any bodily substance !", "4815": "But it is not a substance, but must be pronounced incorporeal.", "4816": "Is it then a limit, or a species, or a number, or a continued act, or a harmony, or any existing thing whatever?", "4817": "Is it, the very first moment that we are born, infused into us from without, or is it some warm nature in us which is cooled by the air which is diffused around us, like a piece of iron which has been heated at a forge, and then being plunged into cold water, is by that process tempered and hardened ?", "4818": "(And perhaps it is from the cooling process (ψύξιςto which it is thus submitted that the soul (ἡ ψυχή) derives its name.)", "4819": "What more shall.", "4820": "we say ?", "4821": "When we die, is it extinguished and destroyed together with our bodies?", "4822": "or does it continue to live a long time ?", "4823": "or, thirdly, is it wholly incorruptible and immortal ?", "4824": "Again, where, in what part does this mind lie hid ?", "4825": "Has it received any settled habitation?", "4826": "For some men have dedi­ cated to it our head, as the principal citadel, around which all the outward senses have their lairs;", "4827": "thinking it natural that its body-guards should be stationed near it, as near the palace of a mighty king.", "4828": "Some again contend earnestly in favour of the position which they assign it, believing that it is enshrined like a statue in the heart.", "4829": "Therefore now the fourth element is incomprehensible, in the world the heaven, in comparison of the nature of the earth, of the water, and of the air;", "4830": "and the mind in man, in comparison of the body and the outward sense, and the speech, which is the interpreter of the mind;", "4831": "may it not be the case also, that for this reason the fourth year is described as holy and praiseworthy in the sacred scriptures ?", "4832": "For among created things, the heaven is holy in the world, in accordance with which body, the imperishable and indestructible natures revolve;", "4833": "and in man the mind is holy, being a sort of frag­ ment of the Deity, and especially according to the statement of Moses, who says, \" God breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.", "4834": "\"", "4835": "*And it appears to me, that it is not without reason that both these things are called praiseworthy ;", "4836": "for these two things, the heaven and the mind, are the things which are able to utter, with all becoming dignity, the praises, and hymns, and glory, and beatitude of the Father who created them:", "4837": "for man has received an especial honour beyond all other animals, namely, that of ministering to the living God.", "4838": "And the heaven is always singing melodies, perfecting an all-musical harmony, in accordance with the motions of all the bodies which exist therein ;", "4839": "of which, if the sound ever reached our ears, love, which could not be restrained, and frantic desires, and furious impetuosity, which could not be put an end to or pacified, would be engendered, and would compel us to give up even what is necessary, nourishing ourselves no longer like ordinary mortals on the meat and drink, which is received by means of cur throat, but on the inspired songs of music in its highest perfection, as persons about to be made im­ mortal through the medium of their ears:", "4840": "and it is said that Moses* was an incorporeal hearer of these melodies, when he went for forty days, and an equal number of nights, without at all touching any bread or any water.", "4841": "VII.", "4842": "Therefore the heaven, which is the archetypal organ of music, appears to have been arranged in a most perfect manner, for no other object except that the hymns sung to the honour of the Father of the universe, might be attuned in a musical manner;", "4843": "and we hear that virtue, that is to say, Leah,† after the birth of her fourth son, was no longer able to bring forth any more, but restrained, or perhaps I should say.", "4844": ".. was restrained, as to her generative powers;", "4845": "for she found, I conceive, all her generative power dry and barren, after she had brought forth Judah, that is to say, \" confession,\" the perfect fruit:", "4846": "and the phrase, \" Leah desisted from bearing children,\" differs in no respect from the statement, that the children of Isaac found no water in the fourth well.\"‡", "4847": "Since it appears from both these figurative expressions, that every creature thirsts for Got!, by whom all their births take place, and from whom nourishment is bestowed to them when they are born.", "4848": "Perhaps therefore some petty cavilling critics will imagine that all this statement about the digging of the wells is a superfluous piece of prolixity on the part of the lawgiver :", "4849": "but those who deserve a larger classification, being citizens not of some petty state but of the wide world, being men of more perfect wisdom, will know well that the real question is not about the four wells, but about the parts of the universe that the men who are gifted with sight, and are fond of contem­ plation exercise their powers of investigation ;", "4850": "namely, about the earth, the water, the air, and the heaven.", "4851": "And examin­ ing each of these matters with the most accurately refined conception, in three of them they have found some things within the reach of their comprehension;", "4852": "on which account they have given these names, injustice, enmity, and latitude to what they have discovered.", "4853": "But in the fourth, that is to say in heaven, they have found absolutely nothing whatever, which they could comprehend;", "4854": "as we explained a little time ago :", "4855": "for the fourth is found to be a well destitute of water, and dry;", "4856": "and for the reason above mentioned it is called a well.", "4857": "VIII.", "4858": "We will now investigate what comes next, and inquire what Charran is, and why the man who went up from the well came to it.", "4859": "Charran then, as it appears to me, is a sort of metropolis of the outward senses :", "4860": "and it is interpreted at one time a pit dug, at another time holes ;", "4861": "one fact being intimated by both these names;", "4862": "for our bodies are in a man­ ner dug out to furnish the organs of the outward senses, and each of the organs is a sort of hole for the corresponding out­ ward sense in which it shelters itself as in a cave :", "4863": "when there­ fore any one goes up from the well which is called the well of the oath, as if he were leaving a harbour, he immediately does of necessity come to Charran :", "4864": "for it is a matter of necessity that the outward senses should receive one who comes on an emigration from that most excellent country of knowledge, unbounded as it is in extent, without any guide.", "4865": "For our soul is very often set", "4866": "In motion by its own self after it has put off the whole burden of the body, and has escaped from the multitude of the outward senses;", "4867": "and very often too, even while it is still clothed in them.", "4868": "Therefore by its own simple motion it has arrived at the comprehension of those things which are appreciable only by the intellect;", "4869": "and by the motion of the body, it has attained to an understanding of those things which are perceptible by the outward senses ;", "4870": "therefore, if any one is unable altogether to associate with the mind alone, he then finds for himself a second refuge, namely, the external senses;", "4871": "and whoever fails in attaining to a comprehension of the things which are intel­ ligible only by the intellect is immediately drawn over to the objects of the outward senses;", "4872": "for the second organ is always to the outward senses, in the case of those things which are not able to make a successful one as far as the dominant mind.", "4873": "But it is well for man not to grow old or to spend all his time in this course either, but rather, as if they were straying in a foreign country like sojourners, to be always seeking for second migration, and for a return to their native land.", "4874": "Therefore Laban, knowing absolutely nothing of either species or genus, or form, or conception, or of anything else whatever which is comprehended by the intellect alone, and depending solely on what lies externally visible, and such things as come under the notice of the eyes, and the ears, and the other hundred faculties, is thought worthy of Charran for his country, which Jacob, the lover of virtue, inhabits as a foreign land for a short time, always bearing in his recollection his return homewards ;", "4875": "therefore his mother, perseverance, that is Rebecca, says to him, \" Rise up and flee to Laban, my brother, to Charran, and dwell with him certain days.\"*", "4876": "Do you not perceive then that the practiser of virtue will not endure to live permanently in the country of the outward senses, but only to remain there a few days and a short time, on account of the necessities of the body to which he is bound ?", "4877": "But a longer time and an entire life is allotted to him in the city which is appreciable only by the intellect.", "4878": "IX.", "4879": "In reference to which fact, also, it appears to me to be that his grandfather also, by name Abraham, so called from his knowledge, would not endure to remain any great length of time in Charran, for it is said in the scriptures that \"", "4880": "Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Charran ;", "4881": "\" t although his father Terah, which name being interpreted means, the investigation of a smell, lived there till the day of his cleath.‡", "4882": "Therefore it is expressly stated in the sacred scriptures that \"Terah died in Charran,\" for he was only a reconnoitrer of virtue, not a citizen.", "4883": "And he availed himself of smells, and not of the enjoyments of food, as he was not able as yet to fill himself with wisdom, nor indeed even to get a taste of it, but only to smell it;", "4884": "for as it is said that those dogs which are calculated for hunting can by exerting their faculty of smell, find out the lurking places of their game at a great distance, being by nature rendered wonderfully acute as to the outward sense of smell;", "4885": "so in the same manner the lover of instruction tracks out the sweet breeze which is given forth by justice, and by any other virtue, and is eager to watch those qualities from which this most admirable source of delight proceeds, and while he is unable to do so he moves his head all round in a circle, smelling out nothing else, but seeking only for that most sacred scent of excellence and food, for he does not deny that he is eager for knowledge and wisdom.", "4886": "Blessed therefore are they to whom it has happened to enjoy the delights of wisdom, and to feast upon its speculations and doctrines, and even of the being cheered by them still to thirst for more, feeling an insatiable and inceasing desire for knowledge.", "4887": "And those will obtain the second place who are not allured indeed to enjoy the sacred table, but who never­ theless refresh their souls with its odours ;", "4888": "for they will be excited by the fragrances of virtue like those languid invalids who, because they are not as yet able to take solid food.", "4889": "nevertheless feed on the smell of such viands as the sons of the physicians prepare as a sort of remedy for their impotency.X.", "4890": "Therefore, having left the land of the Chaldæans, Terah is said to have migrated to Charran ;", "4891": "bringing with him his son Abraham and the rest of his household who agreed with him in opinion, not in order that we might read in the account of the historical chronicles that some men had become emigrants, leaving their native country and becoming inhabitants of a foreign land as if it were their own country, but in order that a lesson of the greatest importance to life and full of wisdom, and adapted to man alone, might not be neglected.", "4892": "And what is the lesson ?", "4893": "The Chaldæans are great astro­ nomers, and the inhabitants of Charran occupy themselves with the topics relating to the external senses.", "4894": "Therefore the sacred account says to the investigator of the things of nature, why are you inquiring about the sun, and asking whether he is a foot broad, whether he is greater than the whole earth put together, or whether he is even many times as large ?", "4895": "And why are you investigating the causes of the light of the moon, and whether it has a borrowed light, or one which proceeds solely from itself?", "4896": "Why, again, do you seek to under­ stand the nature of the rest of the stars, of their motion, of their sympathy with one another, and even with earthly things ?", "4897": "And why, while walking upon the earth do you soar above the clouds ?", "4898": "And why, while rooted in the solid land, do you affirm that you can reach the things in the sky ?", "4899": "And why do you endeavour to form conjectures about matters which cannot be ascertained by conjecture ?", "4900": "And why do you busy yourself about sublime subjects which you ought not to meddle with ?", "4901": "And why do you extend your desire to make discoveries in mathematical science as far as the heaven ?", "4902": "And why do you devote yourself to astronomy, and talk about nothing but high subjects?", "4903": "My good man, do not trouble your head about things beyond the ocean, but attend only to what is near you;", "4904": "and be content rather to examine yourself without flattery.", "4905": "How, then, will you find out what you want, even if you are successful ?", "4906": "Go with full exercise of your intellect to Charran, that is, to the trench which is duct, into the holes and caverns of the body, and investigate the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, and the other organs of the external senses ;", "4907": "and if you wish to be a philosopher, study philosophically that branch which is the most indispensable and at the same time the most becoming to a man,

see;", "4909": "what it is to hear, and how you hear;", "4910": "what it is to smell, or to taste, or to touch, and how each of these operations is ordinarily effected.", "4911": "But is it not the very extravagance of insane folly to seek to comprehend the dwelling of the universe, before your own private dwelling is accurately known to you ?", "4912": "But I do not as yet lay the more important and extensive injunction upon you to make yourself acquainted with your own soul and mind, of the know­ ledge of which you are so proud;", "4913": "for in reality you will never be able to

Socrates;", "4918": "for they say also that the latter grew old in the most accurate study by which he could hope to know him­ self, never once directing his philosophical speculations to the subjects beyond himself.", "4919": "But he was really a man ;", "4920": "but Terah is the principle itself which is proposed to every one, according to which each man should know himself, like a tree full of good branches, in order that these persons who are fond of virtue might without difficulty gather the fruit of pure morality, and thus become filled with the most delightful and saving food.", "4921": "Such, then, are those men who reconnoitre the quarters of wisdom for us;", "4922": "but those who are actually her athletes, and who practise her exercises, are more perfect.", "4923": "For these men think fit to learn with complete accuracy the whole question connected with the external senses, and after having done so, then to proceed to another and more important speculation, leaving all consideration of the holes of the body which they call Charran.", "4924": "Of the number of these men is Abraham, who attained to great progress and improvement in the comprehen­ sion of complete knowledge ;", "4925": "for when he knew most, then he most completely renounced himself in order to attain to the accurate knowledge of him who was the truly living God.", "4926": "And, indeed, this is a very natural course of events ;", "4927": "for he who completely understands himself does also very much, because of his thorough appreciation of it, renounce the uni­ versal nothingness of the creature;", "4928": "and he who renounces himself learns to comprehend the living God.XI.", "4929": "We have now, then, explained what Charran is, and why he who left the well of the oath came thither.", "4930": "We must now consider the third point which comes next in order, namely, what the place is to which this man came ;", "4931": "for it is said, \" He met him in the place.\"*", "4932": "Now place is considered in three ways :", "4933": "firstly, as a situation filled by a body;", "4934": "secondly, as the divine word which God himself has filled wholly and entirely with incorporeal powers;", "4935": "for says the scripture, \"I have seen the place in which the God of Israel stood,\"† in which alone he permitted his prophet to perform sacrifice to him, forbidding him to do so in other places.", "4936": "For he is ordered to go up into the place which the Lord God shall choose, and there to sacrifice burnt offerings and sacrifices for salvation, and to bring other victims also without spot.", "4937": "According to the third signification, God himself is called a place, from the fact of his surrounding the universe, and being surrounded himself by nothing whatever, and from the fact of his being the refuge of all persons, and since he himself is his own district, containing himself and resembling himself alone.", "4938": "I, indeed, am not a place, but I am in a place, and every existing being is so in a similar manner.", "4939": "So that which is surrounded differs from that which surrounds it;", "4940": "but the Deity, being surrounded by nothing,

height as to penetrate to the essence of God, but sees him afar off:", "4949": "or, rather, I should say, he is not able even to behold him afar off, but he only discerns this fact, that God is at a distance from every creature, and that any comprehension of him is removed to a great distance from all human intellect.", "4950": "Perhaps, however, the historian, by this allegorical form of expression, does not here mean by his expression, \" place,\" the Cause of all things;", "4951": "but the idea which he intends to convey may be something of this sort ;", "4952": "-he came to the place, and looking up with his eyes he saw the very place to which he had come, which was a very long way from the God who may not be named nor spoken of, and who is in every way incom­ prehensible.",

that;", "4957": "nor the third and most excellent kind of place, of which it was scarcely possible for that man to form an idea who made his abode at the well which was entitled the \" well of the oath,\" where the self-taught race, Isaac, abides, who never abandons his faith in God and his .invisible comprehension of him, but who keeps to the intermediate divine word, which affords him the best suggestions, and teaches him everything which is suit­ able to the times.", "4958": "For God, not condescending to come down to the external senses, sends his own words or angels for the sake of giving assistance to' those who love virtue.", "4959": "But they attend like physicians to the diseases of the soul, and apply themselves to heal them, offering sacred recommendations like sacred laws, and inviting men to practise the duties inculcated by them, and, like the trainers of wrestlers, implanting in their pupils strength, and power, and irresistible vigour.", "4960": "Very properly, therefore, when he has arrived at the external sense, he is represented no longer as meeting God, but only the divine word, just as his grandfather Abraham, the model of wisdom, did;", "4961": "for the scripture tells us, \"The Lord departed when he had finished conversing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.", "4962": "\"", "4963": "*From which expression it is

subordinate powers.", "4964": "And it is with exceeding beauty and propriety that it is said, not that he came to the place, but that he met the place:", "4965": "for to come is voluntary, but to meet is very often involuntary;", "4966": "so that the divine Word appearing on a sudden, supplies an unexpected jov, greater than could have been hoped, inasmuch as it is about to travel in company with

perceptible by the external senses overshadowed ;", "4973": "but when he departs in a different direction, then they all rise and shine.", "4974": "And do not wonder if, according to the rules of allegorical description, the sun is likened to the Father and Governor of the universe ;", "4975": "for in reality nothing is like unto God ;", "4976": "but those things which by the vain opinion of men are thought to be so, are only two things, one invisible and the other visible ;", "4977": "the soul being the invisible thing, and the sun the visible one.", "4978": "Now he has shown the similitude of the soul in another passage, where he says, \" God made man, in the image of God created he him.\"", "4979": "And again, in the law enacted against homi­ cides, he says, \" Whoso

sense a second sun, inasmuch as it shows all the objects of which it is able to form a judg­ ment to the intellect, concerning which he speaks thus, \" The sun rose upon him when he passed by the appearance of God.\"†", "4997": "For in real truth, when we are no longer able to endure to pass all cur time with the most sacred appearances, and as it were with incorporeal images, but when we turn aside in another direction, and forsake them, we use another light, that, namely, in accordance with the external sense, which in real truth, is in no respect different from darkness, which, after it has arisen, arouses as if from sleep the senses of seeing, and of hearing, and also of taste, and of touch, and of smell, and sends to sleep the intellectual qualities of prudence, and justice, and knowledge, and wisdom, which were all awake.", "4998": "And it is for this reason that the sacred scripture says, that no one can be pure before the evening,‡ as the disorderly motions of the outward senses agitate and confuse the in­ tellect Moreover, he establishes a law for the priests also which may not be avoided, combining with it an expression of a grave opinion when it says, \" He shall not eat of the holy things unless he have washed his body in water, and unless the sun has set, and he has become pure.\"§", "4999": "For by these words it is very clearly shown that there is no one whatever completely pure, so as to be fit to be initiated into the holy and sacred mysteries, to whose lot it has fallen to be honoured with these glories of life which are appreciable by the external senses.", "5000": "But if any one rejects these glories, he is deservedly made conspicuous by the light of wisdom, by means of which he will be able to wash off the stains of vain opinion and to become pure.", "5001": "Do you not see that even the sun itself produces opposite effects when he is setting from those which he causes when rising ?", "5002": "For when he rises everything upon the earth shines, and the things in heaven are hidden from our view ;", "5003": "but, on the other hand, when be sets then the stars appear and the things on earth are overshadowed.", "5004": "In the same manner, also, in us, when the light of the outward senses rises like the sun, the celestial and heavenly sciences are really and truly hidden from view;", "5005": "but when this light is near setting,

everything, should sill secretly and in dark places, and should after that, either by reason of its own notions or through the suggestions of some one else, conceive that it is impossible that anything should be otherwise than clear to God, and should disclose itself and all its actions, and should bring them forward, as it were, out of the light of the sun, and display them to the governor of the universe, saying, that it repents of the perverse conduct which it formerly exhibited when under the influence of foolish opinion (for that nothing is indistinct before God, but all things are known and clear to him, not merely such as have been done, but even such are merely hoped or designed, by reason of the boundless character of his wisdom), it then is purified and benefited, and it propitiates the chastiser who was ready to punish it, namely, conscience, who was previously filled with just anger towards it, and who now admits repent­ ance as the younger brother of perfect innocence and freedom from sin.XVI.", "5021": "Moreover, it appears that Moses has in other passages also taken the sun as a symbol of the great Cause of all things, of which I see an instance in the law which is enacted with respect to those who borrow on pledges :", "5022": "let us recite the law, \"", "5023": "If thou takest as a pledge the garment of thy neighbour, thou shalt give it back

to the borrower by the lender?\"", "5028": "These are the opinions and notions of men who have never had the least conception or comprehension of the virtue of the almighty God, and who, contrary to all human and divine law, impart the triviality of human affairs to the uncreate and immortal nature, which is full of happiness, and blessedness, and per­ fection ;", "5029": "for in what respect do those lenders act unreasonably, who retain in their own hands the pledges which are deposited with them as security, until they receive back their own which they have lent?", "5030": "The debtors are poor, some one will perhaps say, and it is right to pity them :", "5031": "would it not then have been reasonable and better to enact a law in accordance with which a contribution should be made to assist their necessities, rather than allow them to appear as debtors, or else one which should forbid the lending on pledges at all ?", "5032": "But the law which has permitted the lending on pledges, cannot fairly be indignant against those who will not give up the pledges which they have received before the proper time, as if they were acting unjustly.", "5033": "But if any one having

garment?", "5037": "For no one is unprovided with necessary food as long as the springs of the rivers bubble up, and the torrents flow abundantly, and the earth gives forth its annual fruits.", "5038": "Again, is any creditor so covetous of riches, or so very cruel, or so perverse, as not to be willing to contribute a tetradrachm, or even less, to one in distress ?", "5039": "Or is anyone so stingy as to be willing to lend it, but to refuse to give it ?", "5040": "or as to take the only garment that the poor man has as a pledge ?", "5041": "which indeed under another name may fairly be called running away with a man's clothes for men who do this are accustomed to put on other peoples' clothes, and steal them, and to leave the proper owners naked.", "5042": "And why has the law provided so carefully that the debtor may not be without his clothes by night, and that he may not lie down to sleep without them, but has not paid the same attention to the fact of his being indecorously naked by day ?", "5043": "Are not all things concealed by night and darkness, so as to cause less shame, or rather none at all at that time, but are they not disclosed by day and by light, so as then to compel persons to blush more freely ?", "5044": "And why does the law not use the expression \"to give,\" but \"to restore?\"", "5045": "For restoration takes place with respect to the property of other persons, but pledges belong rather to those who have lent on them than to those who have borrowed on them.", "5046": "Moreover, do you not perceive that the law has not enjoined the debtor, who has received back his garment that it may serve as bed-clothes, to bring it back again to his creditor at the return of daylight ?", "5047": "And, indeed, if the exact propriety of the language be con­ sidered, even the most stupid person may see that there is something additional meant beyond what is formally expressed.", "5048": "For the injunction rather resembles a maxim than a re­ commendation.", "5049": "For, if a person had been giving a re­ commendation, he would have said:", "5050": "\" Give back to your debtor, at the approach of evening, the garment which has been pledged to you, if it be the only garment that he is possessed of, that he may have something with which to cover himself at night.\"", "5051": "But one who was laying down a

other things of the same kind, may be urged in reply to those assertors of the literal sense of a passage;", "5054": "and who superciliously reject all other explanations.", "5055": "We will now, in accordance with the usual laws of allegorical speaking, say what is becoming with respect to these subjects.", "5056": "We say, therefore, that a garment is here spoken of symbolically, to signify speech;", "5057": "for clothes keep off the injuries which are wont to visit the body, from cold and heat, and they also conceal the unmentionable parts of nature, and moreover, a cloak is a fitting garment for the body.", "5058": "In much the same manner, speech has been given to man by God, as the most excellent of gifts ;", "5059": "for in the first place, it is a defensive weapo:", "5060": "against those who-would attack him with innovations.", "5061": "For as nature has fortified all other animals with their own appro­ priate and peculiar means of defence, by which they are able to repel those who attempt to injure them, so also has it bestowed upon man that greatest defence and most impregnable pro­ tection of speech, with which, as with a panoply, every one who is completely clothed, will have a domestic and most appropriate bodyguard ;", "5062": "and employing it as a champion, will be able to ward off all the injuries which can be brought against him by his enemies.", "5063": "In the second place, it is a most necessary defence \"against shame and reproach;", "5064": "for speech is very well calculated to conceal and obscure the faults of men.", "5065": "In the third place, it conduces to the whole ornament of life :", "5066": "for this is the thing which improves every one, and which conducts every one to what is best;", "5067": "for there are many disgraceful and mischievous men, who take conversation as a pledge, and deprive its proper owners of it, and utterly cut off what they ought to seek to increase;", "5068": "like men who ravage the lands of their enemies, and who attempt to destroy their corn and all the rest of their crops, which, if it were left unhurt, would be a great advantage to those who would use it.", "5069": "For some men carry on an irreconcilable and never-ending war against rational nature, and utterly extirpate its every shoot and beginning, and destroy all its first appearances of propa­ gation, and render it, as one may say, utterly unproductive and barren of all good practices.", "5070": "For sometimes, when it is borne onwards towards sacred instruction with irresistible impetuosity, and when it is smitten with a love of the speculations of true philosophy, they-out of jealousy and envy, fearing lest, when it has derived strength from its noble aspirations and has been elevated to a splendid height, it may overwhelm all their petty cavils and plausible devices against the truth, like an irresistible torrent-turn its energy in another direction by their own evil artifices, guiding it in another channel to vulgar and illiberal acts:", "5071": "and very often they seek to blunt it or to hedge it in, and in this way leave the nobility of its nature uncultivated, just as at times wicked guardians of orphan children have rendered a deep-soiled and fertile land barren.", "5072": "And these most pitiless of all men have not been restrained by shame from stripping the man of his only garment, namely, speech;", "5073": "\" For,\" says the scripture, \" it is his only covering.\"-", "5074": "What is a man's only covering, except speech?", "5075": "For, as neighing is the peculiar attribute of a horse, and barking of a do-, and lowing of an ox, and roaring of a lion, so also is speaking, and speech itself, the peculiar property of man:", "5076": "for this is what man has received above all other animals as his peculiar gift, as a protection, and bulwark, and panoply, and wall of defence ;", "5077": "he being, of all living creatures, the most beloved by God.", "5078": "XVIII.", "5079": "On which account the scripture adds, \" This is the only covering of his nakedness;", "5080": "\" for what can so becomingly overshadow and conceal the reproaches and disgraces of life, as speech?", "5081": "For ignorance is a disgrace akin to irrational nature, but education is the brother of speech, and an orna­ ment properly belonging to man.", "5082": "In what then will a man lie down to rest ?", "5083": "That is to say, in what will a man find tranquillity and a respite from his labours, except in speech?", "5084": "For speech is a relief to our most miserable and afflicted race ?", "5085": "As therefore, when men have been overwhelmed by grief, or by fear, or by any other evil, tranquillity, and constancy, and the kindness of friends have often restored them;", "5086": "so it happens, not often, but invariably, that speech, the only real averter of evil, wards off that most heavy burden which the necessities of that body in the which we are bound up, and the unforeseen accidents of external circumstances which attack us, impose upon us;", "5087": "for speech is a friend, and an acquaintance, and a kinsman, and a companion bound up within us;", "5088": "I should rather say, fitted close and united to us by some indissoluble and invisible cement of nature.", "5089": "On this account it is, that it forewarns us of what will be expedient for us, and when any unexpected event befalls us it comes forward of its own accord to assist us ;", "5090": "not only bringing advantage of one kind only, such as that which he who is an adviser without acting, or an agent who can give no advice, may supply, but of both kinds:", "5091": "for he does not display a half­ complete power, but one which is perfect in every part.", "5092": "Inasmuch, as even if it were to fail in his endeavour, and in any conceptions which may have been formed, or efforts which may have been made, it still can have recourse to the third species of assistance, namely, consolation.", "5093": "For speech is, as it were, a medicine for the wounds of the soul, and a saving remedy for its passions, which, \" even before the setting of the sun,\" the lawgiver says one must restore:", "5094": "that is to say, before the all-brilliant beams of the almighty and all-glorious God are obscured, which he, out of pity for our race, sends down from heaven upon the human mind.", "5095": "For while that most God-like light abides in the soul, we shall be able to give back the speech, which was deposited as a pledge, as if it were a garment, in order that he who has received this peculiar possession of man, may by its means conceal the discreditable circumstances of life, and reap the benefit of the divine gift, and indulge in a respite combined with tranquillity, in consequence of the presence of so useful an adviser and defender, who will never leave the ranks in which he has been stationed.", "5096": "Moreover, while God pours upon you the light of his beams, do you hasten in the light of day to restore his pledge to the Lord;", "5097": "for when the sun has set, then you, like the whole land of Egypt,* will have an everlasting darkness which may be felt, and being stricken with blindness and ignorance, you will be deprived of all those things of which you thought that you had certain possession, by that sharp-sighted Israel, whose pledges you hold, having made one who was by nature exempt from slavery a slave to necessity.", "5098": "XIX.", "5099": "We have discussed this subject at this length with no other object except that of teaching that the mind, which is inclined to practise virtue, having irregular motions towards prolificness and sterility, and as one may say, being in a manner always ascending and descending, when it becomes prolific and is elevated to a height is illuminated with the archetypal and incorporeal beams of the rational spring of the all-perfecting sun;", "5100": "but when it descends and becomes unpro­ ductive, then it is again illuminated by those images of those beams, the immortal words which it is customary to call angels.", "5101": "On which account we now read in the scripture, \" He met the place ;", "5102": "for the sun was set.\"", "5103": "tFor when those beams of God desert the soul by means of which the clearest comprehensions of affairs are engendered in it, then arises that second and weaker light of words, and the light of things is no longer seen, just as is the case in this lower world.", "5104": "For the moon, which occupies the second rank next to the sun, when that body has set, pours forth a some­ what weaker light than his upon the earth;", "5105": "and to meet a place or a word is a most sufficient gift for those who cannot discern that God is superior to every place or word;", "5106": "because they have not a soul wholly destitute of light, but because, since that most unmixed and brilliant light has set, they have been favoured with one which is alloyed.", "5107": "\"For the children of Israel had light in all their dwell­ ings,\"* says the sacred historian in the book of the Exodus, so that night and darkness were continually banished from them, though it is in night and darkness that those men live who have lost the eyes of the soul rather than those of the body, having no experience of the beams of virtue.", "5108": "But some persons-supposing that what is meant here by the figura­ tive expression of the sun is the external sense and the mind, which are looked upon as the things which have the power of judging ;",

set;", "5111": "for as long as the mind thinks that it attains to a firm comprehension of the objects of intellect, and the out­ ward sense conceives that it has a similar understanding of its appropriate objects, and that it dwells amid sublime objects, the divine word stands aloof at a distance;", "5112": "but when each of these comes to confess its own weakness, and sets in a manner while availing itself of concealment, then immediately the right reason of a soul well-practised in virtue comes in a wel­ come manner to their assistance, when they have begun to despair of their own strength, and await the aid which is invi­ sibly coming to them from without.", "5113": "XX.", "5114": "Therefore, the scripture says in the next verses, \" That he took one of the stones of the place and placed it at his head, and slept in that place.\"†", "5115": "Any one may wonder not only at the interior and mystical doctrine contained in these words, but also at the distinct assertion, which gives us a lesson in labour and endurance :", "5116": "for the historian does not think it becoming, that the man who is devoted t) the study of virtue should adopt a luxurious life, and live softly, imitating the pursuits and rivalries of those who are called indeed happy, but who are in reality full of all unhappiness;", "5117": "whose entire life is a sleep and a dream, according to the holy lawgiver.", "5118": "These men, after they have during the whole day been doing all sorts of injustice to others, in courts of justice, and council halls, and theatres, and everywhere, then return

seat beneath the belly, the offspring of satiety, rise up, being carried away by unrestrained frenzy, and falling upon, and vehemently attacking all that they meet with, are only at last appeased after they have worked off their excessive violence of excitement.", "5122": "But by night, when it is time to turn towards rest, having prepared costly couches and the most exquisite of beds, they lie down in the most exceeding softness, imitating the luxury of women, whom nature has permitted to indulge in a more relaxed system of life, inasmuch as their maker, the Creator of the universe, has made their bodies of a more delicate stamp.", "5123": "Now no such person as this is a pupil of the sacred word, but those only are the disciples of that who are real genuine men, lovers of temperance, and orderliness, and modesty, men who have laid down continence, and frugality, and fortitude, as a kind of base and foundation for the whole of life;", "5124": "and safe stations for the soul, in which it may anchor without danger and without changeableness :", "5125": "for being superior to money, and pleasure, and glory, they look down upon meats and drinks, and everything of that sort, beyond what is necessary to ward off hunger:", "5126": "being thoroughly ready to undergo hunger, and thirst, and heat, and cold, and all other things, however hard they may be to be borne, for the sake of the acquisition of virtue.", "5127": "And being admirers of whatever is most easily pro­ vided, so as not to be ashamed of ever such cheap or shabby clothes, thinking rather, on the other hand, that sumptuous apparel is a reproach and great scandal to life.", "5128": "To these men, the soft earth is their most costly couch;", "5129": "their bed is bushes, and grass, and herbage, and a thick layer of leaves;", "5130": "and the pillows for their, head are a few stones, or any little mounds which happen to rise a little above the surface of the plain.", "5131": "Such a life as this, is, by luxurious men, denominated a life of hardship, but by those who live for virtue, it is called most delightful;", "5132": "for it is well adapted, not for those who are called men, but for those who really are such.", "5133": "Do you not see, that even now, also, the sacred historian represents the practiser of honourable pursuits, who abounds in all royal materials and appointments, as sleeping on the ground, and using a stone for his pillow;", "5134": "and a little further on, he speaks of him as asking in his prayers for bread and a cloak, the necessary wealth of nature ?", "5135": "like one who has at all times held in contempt, the man who dwells among vain opinions, and who is inclined to revile all those who are disposed to admire him ;", "5136": "this man is the archetypal pattern of the soul which is devoted to the practice of virtue, and an enemy of every effeminate person.", "5137": "XXI.", "5138": "Hitherto I have been uttering the praises of the man

should know, that the divine place and the sacred region are full of incorporeal intelligences ;", "5141": "and these intelligences are immortal souls.", "5142": "Taking then one of these intelligences, and selecting one of them according as it appears to be the most excellent, this lover of virtue, of whom we are speaking, applies it to our 'own mind, to it as to the head of a united body;", "5143": "for, indeed, the mind is in a manner the head of the soul;", "5144": "and he does this, using the pretext in­ deed as if he were going to sleep, but, in reality, as being about to rest upon the word of God, and to place the whole of his life as the lightest possible burden upon it;", "5145": "and it lis tens to him gladly, and receives the labourer in the paths of virtue at first, as if he were going to become a disciple ;", "5146": "then when he has shown his approbation of the dexterity of his nature, he gives him his hand, like a gymnastic trainer, and invites him to the gymnasia, and standing firmly, compels him to wrestle with him, until he has rendered his strength so great as to be irresistible, changing his ears by the divine influ­ ences into eyes, and calling this newly-modelled disposition Israel, that is, the man who sees.", "5147": "*Then also he crowns him with the garland of victory.", "5148": "But this garland has a singular and foreign, and, perhaps, not alto­ gether a well-omened name, for it is called by the president of the games torpor, for it is said, that the breadth became tor­ pidt of all the rewards and of the proclamations of the heralds, and of all those most wonderful prizes for pre-eminent excel­ lence which are had in honour;", "5149": "for the soul which has received a share of irresistible power, and which has been made perfect in the contests of virtue, and which has arrived at the very furthest limit of what is honourable, will never be unduly elated or puffed up by arrogance, nor stand upon tip­ toes, and boast as if it were well to make vast strides with bare feet;", "5150": "but the breadth which was extended wide by opinion, will become torpid and contracted, and then will vo­ luntarily succumb and yield to tameness, so as being classed in an inferior order to that of the incorporeal natures, it may carry off the victory while appearing to be defeated;", "5151": "for it is accounted a most honourable thing to yield the palm to those who are superior to one's self, voluntarily rather than through compulsion;", "5152": "for it is incredible how greatly the second prize in this contest is superior in real dignity and importance to the first prize in the others.", "5153": "XXII.", "5154": "Such then may be said, by way of preface, to the discussion of that description of visions which are sent from God.", "5155": "But it is time now to turn to the subject itself, and to investigate, with accuracy, every portion of it.", "5156": "The scripture therefore says, \" And he dreamed a dream.", "5157": "And behold a ladder was planted firmly on the ground, the head of which reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending along it.\"‡", "5158": "By the ladder in this thing, which is called the world, is figuratively understood the air, the foundation of which is the earth, and the head is the heaven ;", "5159": "for the large interior space, which being extended in every direction, reaches from the orb of the moon, which is described as the most remote of the order in heaven, but the nearest to us by those who contemplate sublime objects, down to the earth, which is the lowest of such bodies, is the air.", "5160": "This air is the abode of incorporeal souls, since it seemed good to the Creator of the universe to fill all the parts of the world with living creatures.", "5161": "On this account he prepared the ter­ restrial animals for the earth, the aquatic animals for the sea and for the rivers, and the stars for the heaven;", "5162": "for every one of these bodies is not merely a living animal, but is also pro­ perly described as the very purest and most universal mind extending through the universe;", "5163": "so that there are living crea­ ures in that other section of the universe, the air.", "5164": "And if these things are not comprehensible by the outward senses, what of that ?", "5165": "For the soul also is invisible.", "5166": "And yet it is probable that the air should nourish living animals even more than the land or the water.", "5167": "Why so ?", "5168": "Because it is the air which has given vitality to those animals which live on the earth and in the water.", "5169": "For the Creator of the universe formed the air so that it should be the habit of those bodies which are immoveable, and the nature of those which are moved in an invisible manner, and the soul of such as are able to exert an impetus and visible sense of their own.", "5170": "Is it hot then absurd that that element, by means of which the other elements have been filled with vitality, should itself be destitute of living things?", "5171": "Therefore let no one deprive the most excellent nature of living creatures of the most excellent of those elements which surround the earth ;", "5172": "that is to say, of the air.", "5173": "For not only is it not alone deserted by all things besides, but rather, like a populous city, it is full of imperishable and immortal citizens, souls equal in number to the stars.", "5174": "Now of these souls some descend upon the earth with a view to being bound up in mortal bodies, those namely which are most nearly connected with the earth, and which are lovers of the body.", "5175": "But some soar upwards, being again distinguished according to the definitions and times which have been appointed by nature.", "5176": "Of these, those which are influenced by a desire for mortal life, and which have been familiarised to it, again return to it.", "5177": "But others, condemning the body of great folly and trifling, have pronounced it a prison and a grave, and, flying from it as from a house of correction or a tomb.", "5178": "have raised themselves aloft on light wings towards the æther, and have devoted their whole lives to sublime speculations.", "5179": "There are others, again, the purest and most excellent of all, which have received greater and more divine intellects, never by any chance desiring any earthly thing whatever, but being as it were lieutenants of the Ruler of the universe, as though they were the eyes and ears of the great king, beholding and listening to everything.", "5180": "Now philosophers in general are wont to call these demons, but the sacred scripture calls them angels, using a name more in accordance with nature.", "5181": "For indeed they do report (διαγγέλλουσι) the injunctions of the father to his children, and the necessities of the children to the father.", "5182": "And it is in reference to this employment of theirs that the holy scripture has represented them as ascending and descending, not because God, who knows everything before any other being, has any need of interpreters ;", "5183": "but because it is the lot of us miserable mortals to use speech as a mediator and intercessor;", "5184": "because of our standing in awe of and fearing the Ruler of the universe, and the all-powerful might of his authority;",

not only are we unable to endure his chastisements, but we cannot bear even his excessive and unmodified benefits, which he himself proffers us of his own accord, without employing the ministra­ tions of any other beings.", "5189": "Very admirably therefore does Moses represent the air under the figurative symbol of a ladder, as planted solidly in the earth and reaching up to heaven.", "5190": "For it comes to pass that the evaporations which are given forth by the earth becoming rarefied, are dissolved into air, so that the earth is the founda­ tion and root of the air, and that the heaven is its head.", "5191": "Accordingly it is said that the moon is not an unadulterated consolidation of pure aether, as each of the other stars is, but is rather a combination of the aether-like and air-like essence.", "5192": "For that black spot which appears in it, which some call a face, is nothing else but the air mingled with it, which is by nature black, and which extends as far as heaven.", "5193": "XXIII.", "5194": "The ladder therefore in the world which is here spoken of in this symbolical manner, was something of this sort.", "5195": "But if we carefully investigate the soul which exists in men, the foundation of which is something corporeal, and as it were earth-like, we shall find that foundation to be the outward sense;", "5196": "and the head to be something heavenly, as it were the most pure mind.", "5197": "But all the words of God move incessantly upwards and downwards through the whole of it, dragging it upwards along with them whenever they soar aloft, and sepa­ rating it from whatever is mortal, and exhibiting to it a sight of those things which alone are worthy of being beheld;", "5198": "but yet not casting it down when they descend.", "5199": "For neither is God himself, nor the word of God, worthy of blame.", "5200": "But they ioin with them in their descent, by reason of their love for mankind and compassion for our race, for the sake of being their allies and rendering them assistance, in order that by breathing in a saving inspiration they may recall to life the soul which was still being tossed about in the body as in the river.", "5201": "Now the God and governor of the universe does by him­ self and alone walk about invisibly and noiselessly in the minds of those who are purified in the highest degree.", "5202": "For there is extant a prophecy which was delivered to the wise man, in which it is said:", "5203": "\"I will walk among you, and I will be your God.\"*", "5204": "But the angels-the words of God—move about in the minds of those persons who are still in a process of being washed, but who have not yet completely washed off the life which defiles them, and which is polluted by the contact of their heavy bodies, making them look pure and brilliant to the eyes of virtue.", "5205": "But it is plain enough what vast numbers of evils are driven out, and what a multitude of wicked inhabitants is expelled in order that one good man may be introduced to dwell there.", "5206": "Do thou, therefore, 0 my soul, hasten to become the abode of God, his holy temple, to become strong from having been most weak, powerful from having been powerless, wise from having been fool­ ish, and very reasonable from having been doting and childless.", "5207": "And perhaps too the practiser of virtue represents his own life as like to a ladder;", "5208": "for the practice of anything is natu­ rally an anomalous thing, since at one time it soars up to a height, and at another it turns downwards in a contrary direc­ tion ;", "5209": "and at one time has a fair voyage like a ship, and at another has but an unfavourable passage ;", "5210": "for, as some one says, the life of those who practise virtue is full of vicissitudes;", "5211": "being at one time alive and waking, and at another dead or sleeping.", "5212": "And perhaps this is no incorrect statement;", "5213": "for the wise have obtained the heavenly and celestial country as their habitation ;", "5214": "having learnt to be continually mounting upwards, but the wicked have received as their share the dark recesses of hell, having from the beginning to the end of their existence practised dying, and having been from their infancy to their old age familiarised with destruction.", "5215": "But the practisers of virtue, for they are on the boundary between two extremities, are frequently going upwards and downwards as if on a ladder, being either drawn upwards by a more powerful fate, or else being dragged down by that which is worse;", "5216": "until the umpire of this contention and conflict, namely God, adjudges the victory to the more excellent class and utterly destroys the other.", "5217": "XXIV.", "5218": "There is also in this dream another sort of simili­ tude or comparison apparent, which must not be passed over in silence;", "5219": "the affairs of mankind are naturally compared to a ladder, on

affairs move upwards and downwards, meeting with an unstable and variable fortune, the anomalous character of which, unerring time proves by evidence which is not indistinct but manifest and legible.", "5229": "XXV.", "5230": "But the dream also represented the archangel, namely the Lord himself, firmly planted on the ladder;", "5231": "for wo must imagine that the living God stands above

heaven, and above all the powers of the outward senses, and above the invisible natures, in short, above all things whether visible or invisible ;", "5233": "for having made the whole to depend upon himself, he governs it and all the vastness of nature.", "5234": "But let no one who hears that he was firmly planted thus suppose that any thing at all assists", "5235": "God, so as to enable him to stand firmly, but let him rather consider this fact that what is here indicated is equivalent to the assertion that the firmest position, and the bulwark, and the strength, and the steadiness of everything is the immoveable God, who stamps the charac­ ter of immobility on whatever he pleases ;", "5236": "for, in consequence of his supporting and consolidating things, those which he does combine remain firm and indestructible.", "5237": "Therefore he who stands upon the ladder of heaven says to him who is beholding the dream, \" I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac :", "5238": "be not afraid.\"*", "5239": "This oracle and this vision were also the firmest support of the soul devoted to the practice of virtue, inasmuch as it taught it that the Lord and God of the universe is both these things also to his own race, being entitled both the Lord and God of all men, and of his grandfathers and ancestors, and being called by both names in order that the whole world and the man devoted to virtue might have the same inheritance ;", "5240": "since it is also said, \" The Lord himself is his inheritance.\"", "5241": "†XXVI.", "5242": "But do not fancy that it is an accidental thing here for him to be called in this place the God and Lord of Abraham, but only the God of Isaac;", "5243": "for this latter is the symbol of the knowledge which exists by

beneficence only ;", "5249": "for it has not derived any improvement from the autho­ rity which admonishes it, inasmuch as it naturally claims virtue as its own, but by reason of the bounty which is

warring on others and being warred against, and being aimed at, and attacked, and shot at by all the unexpected chances which be­ fall him.", "5477": "Examine now the man who has great influence with the people, on whom the affairs of the city depend.", "5478": "Do not be alarmed at those who look with admiration upon him ;", "5479": "and you will find many diseases lurking within him, and you will see that he is entangled in many disasters, and that fortune is dragging him violently in different directions, though he bends his neck the other way, and resists, although invisibly, and in fact that fortune is seeking to overthrow and destroy him;", "5480": "or else the people themselves are impatient at his supremacy, or he is exposed to the attacks of some more powerful rival.",

reason is there then for our congratulating ourselves on the administration of political affairs as if we were clothed in a garment of many colours, deceived by its external splendour, and not perceiving its ugliness, which is kept out of sight, and hidden, and full of treachery and guile?", "5484": "Let us then put off this flowery robe, and put on that sacred one woven with the embroideries of virtue;", "5485": "for thus we shall escape the snares which want of skill, and ignorance, and want of know­ ledge, and education lay for us, of which Laban is the com­ panion.",

us to that man who has stood the test, has made us genuine, and conspicuous, and shining, it blames the treacherous disposition which seeks to raise itself up to invalidate what is said.", "5487":

regard to the advantage of those who are to learn from it;", "5515": "for the writers knew that some men are very dull in their natures, so as to be utterly unable to form any conception whatever of God apart from a body, whom it would he impossible to admonish if they were to speak in any other style than the existing one, of representing God as coming and departing like a man;", "5516": "and as

themselves to him, not allowing any mortal thing to drag them in an opposite direction, are never weary of hallowing their own life, and adorning it with every kind of beauty as a meet offering for him.", "5537": "And he is a foolish man who does not set up a pillar to God, but who erects one to himself instead, attributing stability to the things of creation, which is tossed about in every direction, and thinking those things worthy of inscriptions and panegyrics, which are in reality full of matter for blame and accusation, and which as such had better never have been mentioned in an inscription at all, or if they had, had better have been speedily erased again.", "5538": "On which account the holy scripture says distinctly, \" Thou shalt not set up a pillar to thyself;", "5539":

from the path which leads to virtue, the outward sense leads them still more astray, that is to say, the woman who is akin to them, she also compels them to run ashore;", "5542": "therefore, the whole soul, like a ship,* being shut in all around, is offered up as a pillar;", "5543": "for the sacred scriptures tell us that Lot's wife having turned back to look behind her, became a pillar of salt, and this is said very naturally and fitly;", "5544": "for if any one does not look forwards at those things which are worthy of being seen and heard (and these things are the virtues and the actions done in accordance with virtue), but looks backwards at the things which are behind him, at deaf glory, and blind riches, and senseless vigour of body, and an empty elegance of mind, pursuing these objects only, and such as are akin to them, he will lie as a lifeless pillar melting away by itself;", "5545": "for salt is not a thing to preserve his firmness.", "5546": "XLIII.", "5547": "Very admirably therefore does the practiser of vir­ tue, having learnt by continued study that creation is a thing in its own nature moveable, but that the uncreated God is unchangeable and immoveable, erect a pillar to God, and anoint it after he has erected it;", "5548": "for God says, \" Thou hast anointed my pillar.\"t", "5549": "But do not fancy that that stone was anointed with oil, but understand rather that that opinion, that God is the only being who stands firmly, was thoroughly hardened by exercise, and established in the soul by the science of wrestling, not that science by which bodies are made fat, but that by which the mind acquires strength and irresistible vigour;", "5550": "for the man who is eager in the pursuit of good studies and virtuous objects is fond of labours, and fond of exercises;", "5551": "so that very naturally, having worked out the science of training- which is the sister of the art of medicine, he anoints and brings to perfection all the reasonings of virtue and piety, and dedicates them, as a most beautiful and lasting offering to God.", "5552": "For this reason, after mentioning the dedication of the pillar, God adds that, \" Thou vowedst avow to me.\"", "5553": "Now a vow also is, to speak properly, a dedication, since he who makes a vow is said to offer up, as a gift to God, not only his own posses­ sions, but himself likewise, who is the owner of them ;", "5554": "for says the scripture, \" the man is holy who nourishes the locks of the hair of his head;", "5555": "who has vowed a vow.\"", "5556": "But if he is holy he is undoubtedly an offering to God, no longer meddling with anything unholy or profane ;", "5557": "and there is an evidence in favour of my argument, in the conduct of the prophetess, and

being set in motion by itself, and agitating itself, is filled with frenzy and inspiration, so as to predict future events by a certain prophetic power.", "5568": "For the first kind of dreams which we mentioned, was that which proceeded from God as the author of its motion, and, as some invisible manner prompted us what was indistinct to us, but well known to him­ self.", "5569": "The second kind was when our own intellect was set in motion simultaneously with the soul of the universe, and became filled with divine madness, by means of which it is allowed to prognosticate events which are about to happen;", "5570": "and for this reason the interpreter of the sacred will very plainly and clearly speaks of dreams, indicating by this expres­ sion the visions which appear according to the first species, as if God, by means of dreams, gave suggestions which were equivalent to distinct and precise oracles.", "5571": "Of the visions according to the second species he speaks neither very clearly nor very obscurely;", "5572": "an instance of which is afforded by the vision which was exhibited of the ladder reaching up to heaven;", "5573": "for this vision was an enigmatical one ;", "5574": "nevertheless, the meaning was not hidden from those who were able to see with any great acuteness.", "5575": "But these visions which are afforded according to the third species of dreams, being less clear than the two former kinds by reason of their having an enigmatical meaning deeply seated and fully coloured, require the science of an interpreter of dreams.", "5576": "At all events

"and on this foundation let us raise up the rest of the building, following the rules of that wise architect, allegory, and accurately investigating each particular of the dreams;", "5590": "but first we must mention what it is requisite should be attended to before the dreams.", "5591": "Some persons have extended the nature of good over many things, and others have attributed it to the most excellent Being atone ;", "5592": "some again have mixed it with other things, while others have spoken of it as unalloyed.", "5593": "Those then who have called only what is honourable good, have preserved this nature free from alloy, and have attributed it only to what is most excellent, namely to the reason that is in us;", "5594": "but those who have mixed it have combined it with three things, the soul, the body, and external circumstances.", "5595": "And they who act thus are persons of a somewhat effeminate and luxurious way of life, being bred up the greater part of their time, from their earliest infancy, in the women's apartments and among the effeminate race which is found in the women's apartments.", "5596": "But those who argue differently are men inclined to a harder regimen, being bred up from their boyhood among men, and being themselves men in their minds, embracing what is right in preference to what is pleasant, and devoting themselves to nourishment fit for athletes for the sake of strength and vigour, not of pleasure.", "5597": "Moses moreover represents two persons as leaders of these two companies.", "5598": "The leader of the noble and good company is the self-taught and self-instructed Isaac;", "5599": "for he records that he was weaned, not choosing to avail himself at all of ten­ der, and milk-like, and childish, and infantine food, but only of such as was vigorous and perfect, inasmuch as he was formed by nature, from his very infancy, for acts of virtue, and was always in the prime and vigour of youth and energy.", "5600": "But the leader of the company, which yields and which is inclined to softer measures, is Joseph;", "5601": "for he does not indeed neglect the virtues of the soul, but he likewise shows anxiety about the stability and permanence of the body, and also de­ sires an abundance of worldly treasures;", "5602": "and it is in strict accordance with natural truth, that he is represented as drawn in different directions, since he proposes to himself many dif­ ferent objects in life;", "5603": "and being attracted by each of them, he is kept in a state of commotion and agitation, without being able to stand firm.", "5604": "And his case is not like that of cities, which having made a truce enjoy peace, and yet after a time are again attacked, so as to gain the victory and to be defeated alternately;", "5605": "for at times a great influx of riches and glory coming upon them, subdues all their cares for the body and the soul, but after­ wards, being repelled by both these things, they are conquered by the adversary ;", "5606": "and in the same manner all the pleasures of the body coming upon the soul in a compact array over­ whelm and efface all the objects of the intellect one after the other;", "5607": "and then, after a short time, wisdom, changing its course and blowing in the opposite direction with a fresh and violent breeze, causes the stream of the pleasures to slacken, and altogether moderates all the eagerness, and impetuosity, and rivalry of the external senses.", "5608": "Such a circle then of never-ending war revolves around the soul, subject as it is to so many changes;", "5609": "for when one enemy has been destroyed, then immediately there springs up another more powerful, after the fashion of the many-headed hydra;", "5610": "for they say, that in the case of this monster, instead of the head which was cut off another sprung up, by which statement they mean to intimate the multiform, and prolific, and almost invincible character of undying wickedness.", "5611": "Do not, therefore, answer Joseph .......* but know that he is the image of multiform and mixed knowledge.", "5612": "For there appears in him a rational species of continence, which is of the masculine kind, being fashioned in accordance with his father Jacob;", "5613": "and also that kind which is devoid of reason is likewise visible, that of the outward sense I mean, being made in the likeness of his maternal race, according to Rachel.", "5614": "There appears in him also the seed of bodily plea­ sure, which his association with the chief butlers, and chief bakers, and chief cooks has stamped upon him.", "5615": "There is, also visible the seed of vain opinion, on which he mounts as on a chariot by reason of his levity, being puffed up, and elated, and raising himself to a height to the destruction of equality.", "5616": "III.", "5617": "Now the character of Joseph is sketched out by the foregoing outlines.", "5618": "But each of his dreams must be investi­ gated with accuracy;", "5619": "and first of all we must examine the one about the sheaves. \" I thought,\" says he, \" that we were all binding sheaves.\"", "5620": "The expression, \"I thought,\" is clearly that of a person who is not certain, but who is hesitating and supposing with some amount of indistinctness, not of one who sees positively and clearly;", "5621": "for it is very natural for persons just awakening out of a deep sleep, and still dozing as it were, to say, \" I thought;", "5622": "\" but not so for people who are thoroughly awake, and who can see distinctly.", "5623": "And the practiser of virtue, Jacob, does not say, \" I thought,\" but his language is, \" Behold, a ladder firmly set, the head of which reached up to heaven.\"*", "5624": "And again he says, when \" the sheep conceived 1 saw them with my eyes in my sleep, and behold the lie-goats and the rams leapt upon the ewes and upon the she-goats, white, and variegated, and ring-straked, and speckled.\"t", "5625": "For it happens of necessity that the sleeping conceptions also of those who think what is honourable eligible for its own sake are more distinct and more pure, just as their waking actions are also more deserving of approbation.", "5626": "IV.", "5627": "But when I hear Joseph relating his dream I marvel at his having fancied that he was binding up the sheaves, and not reaping the corn;", "5628": "for the one is the task of the lower classes and of servants, but the other is the occupation of the employers, and of men more skilled in agriculture.", "5629": "For to be able to distinguish what is necessary from what is mischievous, and what is nutritious from what is not so, and what is genuine from what is spurious, and useful fruit from a worth­ less root, not only in reference to those things which the land bears, but also in those which the intellect bears, is the work of most perfect virtue.", "5630": "Accordingly the holy scripture repre­ sents those who see, that is the sons of Israel, as reaping, and what is a most extraordinary thing, as reaping not barley or wheat, but the harvest itself;", "5631": "accordingly the language of Moses is, \" When you reap your harvest, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your harvest.\"*", "5632": "For he means here that the virtuous man is not merely the judge of things which differ from one another, and that he does not only distinguish the things from which some produce is derived from the produce itself;", "5633": "bat that he is able also to distinguish while reaping the harvest, to remove this opinion of his ability to distinguish, and to eradicate a man's own opinion of himself;", "5634": "because he is firmly persuaded, and believes Moses when he affirms that judgment belongs to God alone,\"t with whom are the comparisons and distinctions between all things ;", "5635": "to whom it is well for a man to confess that he is inferior, a con­ fession more glorious than the most renowned victory.", "5636": "Now the reaping a harvest is like cutting a second time what has been cut already ;", "5637": "which when some persons fond of novelty applied themselves to they found a circumcision of circumcision, and a purification of purification;", "5638": "‡ that is to say, they found that the purification of the soul was itself purified, attributing the power of making bright to God, and never fancying that they themselves were competent, without the assistance of the divine wisdom, to wash and cleanse a life which is full of stains.", "5639": "Akin to this is the double cave, which is a symbol of the twofold and excellent recollections (the one existing in refer­ ence to the creature, and the other to the Creator), in which the virtuous mail is bred up, contemplating the things which are in the world, and being also fond of inquiring about the father who made them;", "5640": "and it is owing to these twofold recollections, in my opinion, that the double symphony in music, that of the double diapason, was invented.", "5641": "For it was necessary that the work and the creator should be made happy in two most perfect melodies, and not both in the same one.",

his essence, is separated from every creature, namely, to God.", "5645": "Moreover, the interpreter of the sacred will again enunciates an opinion friendly to virtue, saying that it is not proper \"

praiseworthy speech is likened to a river;", "6251": "but speech which is deserving of blame is the very river of Egypt itself, untracta­ ble, unwilling to learn, as one may say In a word, lifeless

taken place on earth by the agency of fire and water ;", "6388": "or, on the contrary, to the birth and rapid propagation of animals and plants in accordance with the admirable arrangement of the atmosphere, and the seasons of the year, and of men, some of whom lived in accordance with virtue, while others were associated with wickedness.", "6389": "But since of these things some are portions

emulate their conduct;", "6394": "for these men have been living and rational laws;", "6395": "and the lawgiver has magnified them for two reasons ;", "6396": "first, because he was desirous to show that the injunctions which are thus given are not inconsistent with nature;", "6397": "and, secondly, that he might prove that it is not very difficult or laborious for those who wish to live according to the laws established in these books, since the earliest men easily and spontaneously obeyed the unwritten principle of legislation before any one of the particular laws were written down at all.", "6398": "So that a man may very properly say, that the written laws are nothing more than a memorial of the life of the ancients, tracing back in an antiquarian spirit, the actions and reason­ ings which they adopted;", "6399": "for these first men, without ever having been followers or pupils of any one, and without ever having been taught by preceptors what they ought to do or say, but having embraced a line of conduct consistent with nature from attending to their own natural impulses, and from being prompted by an innate virtue, and looking upon nature herself to be, what in fact she is, the most ancient and duly established of laws, did in reality spend their whole lives in making laws, never of deliberate purpose doing anything open to reproach, and for their accidental errors propitiating God, and appeasing him by prayers and supplications, so as to procure for themselves the enjoyment of an entire life of virtue and prosperity, both in respect of their deliberate actions, and those which proceeded from no voluntary purpose.", "6400": "II.", "6401": "Since then the beginning of all participation in good things is hope, and since the soul devoted to virtue pioneers and opens this path as a plain and easy one, being anxious to attain to that which is really honourable, the sacred historian has named the first lover of hope, Enos, giving him the

established in good hopes;", "6404": "from which it is evident that they do not look upon the man devoid of hope as a man at all, but rather as an animal resembling a man, inasmuch as he is deprived of that most peculiar possession of the human soul, namely hope.", "6405": "For which reason, being desirous to deliver an admirable panegyric on the hopeful man, the sacred historian tells us, first, that \" he hoped in the father and creator of the universe,\" * and adds in a subsequent passage, \" This is the book of the generation of men,\"t and of their fathers, and grand-fathers who had existed previously;", "6406": "but he conceived that they were the ancestors of the mixed race, that is to say, of that purer and thoroughly sifted race which is the really rational one ;", "6407":

archons, from whom the chronology is dated;", "6409": "so in the same manner the sacred historian calls him who indulges in hope, \"a man,\" by way of pre-eminence, passing over in silence the rest of the multitude of human beings, as not being worthy to receive the same appellation.", "6410": "And he has very properly called his first volume, the Book of the Generation of the Real Man, speaking with perfect cor­ rectness ;", "6411": "because the man who is full of good hope is worthy of being described and remembered, not with such a memory as is given by a record in papers, which are hereafter to be destroyed by bookworms, but by that which exists in immortal mature, where the virtuous actions are regularly recorded.", "6412": "If then any one were to reckon the generations, from the first man, who was made out of the earth, he will find him who, by the Chaldæans is called Enos, and in the Greek lan­ guage ἂνθςωπος (the man), to be the fourth in succession, and in numbers the number four is honoured among other philoso­ phers, who have studied and admired the incorporeal essences, appreciable only by the intellect, and especially by the all-wise Moses, who magnifies the number four, and says that it is \" holy and praiseworthy and the reasons for which this cha­ racter has been given to it are mentioned in a former treatise.", "6413": "And the man who is full of good hope is likewise holy and praiseworthy;", "6414": "as, on the contrary, he who has no hope is ac­ cursed and blameable, being always associated with fear, which is an evil counsellor in any emergency;", "6415": "for they say, that there is no one thing so hostile to another, as hope is to fear and fear to hope, and perhaps this may be correctly said, for both fear and hope are an expectation, but the one is an ex­ pectation of good things, and the other, on the contrary, of evil things;", "6416": "and the natures of good and evil are irreconcileable, and such as can never come together.", "6417": "III.", "6418": "What has now been said about hope is sufficient;", "6419": "and nature has placed her at the gates to be a sort of doorkeeper to the royal virtues within, which no one may approach who has not previously paid homage to hope.", "6420": "Therefore the law­ givers, and the laws in every state on earth, labour with great diligence to fill the souls of free men with good hopes ;", "6421": "but he who, without any recommendation and without being enjoined to be so, is nevertheless hopeful, has acquired this virtue by an unwritten, self-taught law, which nature has implanted in him.", "6422": "That which is placed in the next rank after hope is repent­ ance for errors committed, and improvement;", "6423": "in reference to which principle Moses mentions next in order to Enos, the man who changed from a worse system of life to a better, who is called among the Hebrews Enoch, but as the Greeks would say, \" gracious,\" of whom the following statement is made, \" that Enoch pleased God, and was not found, because God transported him.\"t", "6424": "For transportation shows a change and alteration :", "6425": "and such a change is for the better, because it takes place through the providence of God;", "6426": "for every thing that is with God is in every case honourable and advantageous, since that which is destitute of any divine superintendence is useless and unprofitable.", "6427": "And the expression, \" lie was not found,”* is very appro­ priately employed of him whose place was changed, either from the fact of his ancient blameable life being wiped out and effaced, and being no longer found, just as if it had never existed at all, or else because he whose place has been changed, and who is enrolled in a better class, is naturally difficult to be disco­ vered.", "6428": "For wickedness is a very multiform and extensive thing, on which account it is known to many persons;", "6429": "but virtue is rare, so that it is not comprehended even by a few.", "6430": "And besides, the bad mail runs about through the market- place, and theatres, and courts of justice, and council halls.", "6431": "and assemblies, and every meeting and collection of men what­ ever, like one who lives with and for curiosity, letting loose his tongue in immoderate, and interminable, and indiscriminate conversation, confusing and disturbing every thing, mixing up what is true with what is false, what is unspeakable with what is public, private with public things, things profane with things sacred, what is ridiculous with what is excellent, from never having been instructed in what is the most excellent thing in season, namely silence.", "6432": "And pricking up his ears, because of the abundance of his leisure, and his superfluous curiosity, and love of interference, he is eager to make himself acquainted with the business of other people, whether good or bad, so as at once to envy those who are prosperous, and to rejoice over those who are not so;", "6433": "for the bad man is by nature envious and a hater of all that is good, and a lover of all that is evil.", "6434": "IV.", "6435": "But the good man, on the contrary, is a lover of that mode of life which is not troubled by business, and withdraws, and loves solitude, desiring to escape the notice of the many, not out of misanthropy, for he is a lover of mankind, if any one in the world is so, but because he eschews wickedness, which the chief multitude eagerly embraces, rejoicing at what it ought to mourn over, and grieving at what it is becoming rather to rejoice.", "6436": "On which account the good man shuts him­ self up, and remains for the most part at home, scarcely going over his threshold, or if he does go out, for the sake of avoiding the crowds who come to visit him.", "6437": "he generally goes out of the city, and makes his abode in some country place, living more pleasantly with such companions as are the most virtuous of all mankind, whose bodies, indeed, time has dissolved, but whose virtues the records which are left of them keep alive, in poems and in prose, histories by which the soul is naturally improved and led on to perfection.", "6438": "It is on this account that the sacred historian has said that the man whose place was changed was not found, inasmuch as he is difficult to find and hard to seek out.", "6439": "Therefore, such a man emigrates from ignorance to instruction, and from folly to wisdom, and from cowardice to courage, and from impiety to piety;", "6440": "and, again, from devotion to pleasure to temperance, and from vain-gloriousness to simplicity, qualities superior to all riches, and more valuable as a possession than any royal or imperial power.", "6441": "For if one may speak the plain truth, that wealth which is not blind, but which is clear-sighted, is the abundance of virtues, which we must at once conclude to be the genuine and legitimate predominance of good in compari­ son of all other bastard and falsely named powers, and to be the just and lawful superior of them all.", "6442": "But we must not be ignorant that repentance occupies the second place only, next after perfection, just as the change from sickness to convales­ cence is inferior to perfect uninterrupted health.", "6443": "Therefore, that which is continuous and perfect in virtues is very near divine power, but that condition which is improvement advancing in process of time is the peculiar blessing of a well- disposed soul, which does not continue in its childish pursuits, but by more vigorous thoughts and inclinations, such as really become a man, seeks a tranquil steadiness of soul, and which attains to it by its conception of what is good.", "6444": "V.", "6445": "For which reason the sacred historian very naturally classes the lover of God and the lover of virtue next in order to him who repents;", "6446": "and this man is in the language of the Hebrews called Noah, but in that of the Greeks, \"rest,\" or “ the just man,\" both being appellations very well suited to the wise man.", "6447": "That of \" the just man \" most evidently so, for nothing is better than justice, which is the chief among virtues, and which receives the highest honours like the most beautiful member of a company;", "6448": "and the appellation \" rest ” is likewise appropriate, since the opposite quality to rest is unnatural agitation, the cause of confusions, and tumults, and seditious, and wars, which the wicked pursue;", "6449": "while those who pay due honour to excellence cultivate a tranquil, and quiet, and stable, and peaceful life.", "6450": "And in strict consistency with himself, the lawgiver also calls the seventh day \" rest, \" which the Hebrews call \" the sabbath;", "6451": "\" not as some persons fancy, because after six days the multitude was restrained from its habitual employments, but because in real truth, the number seven is both in the world and in ourselves free from seditions and from wars, and is of all the numbers that which is the most averse to contention, and the greatest lover of peace.", "6452": "And a proof of what I have here asserted may be found in the powers which exist in us;", "6453": "for six of those powers, namely the five outward senses and uttered speech, stir up continued and ceaseless war, both by sea and land, some of them doing so from a desire for the objects of the outward senses, which if they cannot obtain they are grieved, and the last by divulging with unbridled mouth numbers of things which ought to be buried in silence.", "6454": "But the seventh power is that which proceeds from the domi­ nant mind, which is more glorious than the other six powers, and which has by pre-eminent vigour obtained the mastery over them all, and when that retires, choosing solitude, and its own society, and living by itself, as one that has no need of any other, and that is all-sufficient for itself, being then emancipated from the cares and troubles that are found in the human race, embraces a calm and tranquil life.", "6455": "VI.", "6456": "And the lawgiver magnifies the lover of virtue in such a way, that even when he is giving his genealogy, he does not trace him as he usually does other persons, by giving a cata­ logue of his grandfathers and great grandfathers, and ances­ tors who are numbered as men and women, but he gives a list of certain virtues;", "6457": "and almost asserts in express words that there is no other house, or kindred, or country whatever to a wise man, except the virtues and the actions in accordance with virtues.\"", "6458": "For these,\" says he, \" are the generations of Noah ;", "6459": "Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation, and one who pleased God.\"*", "6460": "But we must not be ignorant that when he says man here, he does not mean merely to use the common expression for a rational mortal animal, but that he means to indicate in an eminent degree him who verifies the name, having driven away all the untameable and furious passions and brutal wickednesses of the soul;", "6461": "and as a proof of this, after the word man he adds as an epithet, “ the just,” saying, \" a just man,\" as if no unjust person were a man at all, but to speak more properly a beast in the likeness of a man, and as if he alone were a man who is an admirer of justice ;", "6462": "he also says that he was \"perfect,\" intimating by this expression that he was pos­ sessed not of one virtue only but of all, and that being so possessed of them, he constantly exhibited every one of them according to his power and opportunities ;", "6463": "and finally crown­ ing him like a wrestler who has gained a glorious victory, he honours him moreover with a most noble proclamation, saying that \" he pleased God,\" (and what can there be in nature that is more excellent than this panegyric?)", "6464": "which is the most visible proof of excellence;", "6465": "for if they who displease God are miserable, those who please him are by all means happy.", "6466": "VII.", "6467": "It is not then without great correctness that after he has praised the man as being possessed of such great virtues he adds, “ that he was perfect in his generation.\"", "6468": "Showing that he was not perfect absolutely, but that he was good in comparison with the others who lived at that time ;", "6469": "for in a little time he will also speak of other wise men who were possessed of unconquerable and incomparable virtue, not merely if contrasted with the wicked, nor because they were better than the other men of their age, and as such were considered worthy of acceptance and pre-eminence, but because having received a well disposed nature, they preserved it with­ out any error or change for the worse;", "6470": "not fleeing from evil habits, but never having once fallen into them, and being by deliberate purpose practisers of all virtuous actions and speeches, by which system they have adorned their life.", "6471": "Those then are the most admirable of all men who have adopted free and noble inclinations, not in imitation of or by way of contrast to others, but from an inclination to genuine virtue and justice for its own sake ;", "6472": "he also is to be admired who is superior to his own generation and his own age, and who is overcome by none of those things which the multitude follows;", "6473": "and he will be classed in the second rank, and nature will give to such men the best of her prizes;", "6474": "and the second prize is of itself a great thing;", "6475": "for what is not a great and most desirable object which God offers to, and bestows upon men ?", "6476": "And the greatest proof of this is to be found in the exceeding graces which this man attained to ;", "6477": "for as that time bore an abundant crop of injustice and impiety, and so every country, and nation, and city, and house, and every separate individual was full of wicked practices, all men of free will and of deliberate purpose, as if in an arena, living with one another for the first rank in iniquity, and strove with all possible zeal and rivalry, every one seeking to surpass his neighbour in the magnitude of his wickedness, and failing in nothing which might render life blameable and accursed.", "6478": "VIII.", "6479": "At whom God, being naturally indignant, and being angry that that which appeared to be the most excellent of animals, and which had been thought worthy of being reckoned akin to himself by reason of his participation in reason, when he ought to have practised virtue, devoted himself rather to wickedness, and to every species of vice, appointed a fitting punishment for them, and determined to destroy the whole race at that time existing by a deluge;", "6480": "and not only those who dwelt in the champaign country and in the lower districts, but those also who lived in the most lofty mountains, for the great deep,* being raised to a height which it had never reached before, burst through its mouths with its whole col­ lective impetuosity into the seas existing among us, and 'they overflowed and inundated all the islands and continents;", "6481": "and incessant floods of everlasting fountains, and of native rivers and torrents combined together, mingled with one another, and rising to a vast height, so as to surmount everything.", "6482": "Nor indeed was the air tranquil, for a deep and unbroken cloud overspread the whole heaven, and there were fearful storms of wind, and roarings of thunder, and flashes of light­ ning, and rapid hurlings of thunderbolts, ceaseless storms of rain being poured forth, so that one might have thought that all the parts of the universe were hastening to dissolve them­ selves into the one element of the nature of water, until, while the water from above kept pouring down, and that below kept bursting up, the streams were raised to a height above everything, so that they not only overwhelmed and hid from sight all the plains and all the level ground, but even the tops of the highest mountains, for every part of the earth was under water, so that it was wholly buried and carried away, and the world was mutilated of huge portions, and appeared in all its wholeness and integrity, fearful as it is to say or even to imagine such a thing, to be utterly crippled and destroyed.", "6483": "And likewise the air, with the exception of that small portion which is about the moon, was wholly obscured, being overcast by the violence and impetuosity of the water which overran all the region belonging to it with irresistible might.", "6484": "Then were speedily destroyed all the crops and all the trees, for an unlimited quantity of water is as destructive to them as a scarcity, and innumerable flocks of animals, both tame and wild, perished at the same time;", "6485": "for it was natural when the most excellent race of all, that of man, had been destroyed, that none of the inferior races should be left, since they were only created to be slaves to his necessities, and to be in a manner subject to his authoritative commands as their master.", "6486": "When such numbers then of such mighty evils had burst forth which that time poured out-for all the portions of the world, except the heaven itself, were moved in an unnatural manner-as if they were stricken with a terrible and deadly disease.", "6487": "And one house alone, that of the aforesaid just and God- loving man who had received the two highest of all gifts, was preserved ;", "6488": "one gift being, as I have said already, the not being destroyed with all the rest of mankind, the other that of becoming himself, at a subsequent period, the founder of a new generation of mankind ;", "6489": "for God thought him worthy to be both the end of our race and the beginning of it, the end of those men who lived before the deluge, and the beginning of those who lived after the deluge.", "6490": "IX.", "6491": "Such was he who was the most virtuous of all the men of his age, and such were the rewards which were allotted to him which the holy scriptures enumerate ;", "6492": "and the arrangement and classification of the aforesaid three, whether you call them men or dispositions of the soul, is very symmetrical, for the perfect man is entire from the beginning;", "6493": "but he who has his place changed is but half entire, having appropriated the earlier period of his life to wickedness, and the subsequent time to virtue to which he afterwards came over, and with which at that subsequent time he lived.", "6494": "But he who hopes, as his very name shows, has still a defect, for though he is always wishing for what is good, he is not as yet able to attain to it, but he is like those who are on a voyage, who while they are eager to reach the harbour, are still kept at sea without being able to anchor in port.X.", "6495": "I have now then explained the character of the first triad of those who desire virtue.", "6496": "There is also another more important company of which we must now proceed to speak, for the former resembles those branches of instruction which are allotted to the age of childhood, but this resembles rather the gymnastic exercises of athletic men, who are really prepar­ ing themselves for the sacred contests, who, despising all care of getting their body into proper condition, labour to bring about a healthy state of the soul, being desirous of that victory which is to be gained over the adverse passions.", "6497": "The particulars then on which each individual differs from the other, though all are hastening to one and the same end, we will hereafter examine more minutely;", "6498": "but it is necessary not to pass over in silence what it seems desirable to premise concerning the whole three taken together.", "6499": "It happens then that they are all three of one household and of one family, for the last of the three is the son of the middle one, and the grandson of the first;", "6500": "and they are all lovers of God, and beloved by God, loving the only God, and being loved in return by him who has chosen, as the holy scriptures tell us, by reason of the excess of their virtues in which they lived, to give them also a share of the same appel­ lation as himself;", "6501": "for having added his own peculiar name to their names he has united them together, appropriating to himself an appellation composed of the three names:", "6502": "\"For,\" says God, \" this is my everlasting name:", "6503": "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,\"* using there the relative term instead of the absolute one ;", "6504": "and this is very natural, for God stands in no need of a name.", "6505": "But though he does not stand in any such need, nevertheless he bestows his own title on the human race that they may have a refuge to which to betake themselves in supplications and prayers, and so may not be destitute of a good hope.", "6506": "XI.", "6507": "This then is what appears to be said of these holy men;", "6508": "and it is indicative of a nature more remote from our knowledge than, and much superior to, that which exists in the objects of outward sense;", "6509": "for the sacred word appears thoroughly to investigate and to describe the different dispo­ sitions of the soul, being all of them good, the one aiming at what is good by means of instruction, the second by nature, the last by practice;", "6510": "for the first, who is named Abraham, is a symbol of that virtue which is derived from instruction;", "6511": "the intermediate Isaac is an emblem of natural virtue;", "6512": "the third, Jacob, of that virtue which is devoted to and derived from practice.", "6513": "But we must not be ignorant that each of these men was endowed with all these powers, but that each derived his name from that one which predominated in him and mastered the others ;", "6514": "for neither is it possible for instruc­ tion to be made perfect without natural endowments and practice, nor is nature able to arrive at the goal without instruction and practice, nor is practice unless it be founded on natural gifts and sound instruction.", "6515": "Very appropriately, therefore, has he represented, as united by relationship, these three, which in name indeed are men, but in reality, as I have said before, virtues, nature, instruction, and practice, which men also call by another name, and entitle them the three graces (χάϱιτες), either from the fact of God having bestowed (ϰεχαϱίσθαι) on our race those three powers, in order to produce the perfection of life, or because they themselves have bestowed themselves on the rational soul as the most glorious of gifts, so that the eternal name, as set forth in the scriptures, may not be used in conjunction with three men, but rather with the aforesaid powers;", "6516": "for the nature of mankind is mortal, but that of the virtues is im­ mortal ;", "6517": "and it is more reasonable that the name of the ever­ lasting God should be conjoined with what is immortal than with what is mortal, since what is immortal is akin to what is imperishable, but death is hostile to it.", "6518": "XII.", "6519": "We must, however, not remain in ignorance that the sacred historian has represented the first man, him who was formed out of the earth as the father of all those who existed before the deluge;", "6520": "and him who, with his whole family, was the only person left out of so universal a destruction, because of his justice and his other excellencies and virtues, as the founder of the new race of men which was to flourish hereafter.", "6521": "And that venerable, and estimable, and glorious triad is compre­ bended by the sacred scriptures under one class, and called, \"A royal priesthood, and a holy nation.\"*", "6522": "And its name shows its power;", "6523": "for the nation is further called, in the lan­ guage of the Hebrews, Israel, which name being interpreted means, \" seeing God.", "6524": "\"But of sight, that which is exercised by means of the eyes is the most excellent of all the outward senses, since by that alone all the most beautiful of existing things are compre­ hended, the sun and the moon, and the whole heaven, and the whole world;", "6525": "but the sight of the soul which is exercised, through the medium of its dominant part excels all the other powers of the soul, as much as the powers of the soul excel all other powers ;", "6526": "and this is prudence, which is the sight of the mind.", "6527": "But he to whose lot it falls, not only by means of his knowledge, to comprehend all the other things which exist in nature, but also to behold the Father and Creator of the universe, has advanced to the very summit of happiness.", "6528": "For there is nothing above God;", "6529": "and if any one, directing towards him the eye of the soul, has reached up to him, let him then pray for ability to remain and to stand firm before him;", "6530": "for the roads which lead upwards to him are laborious and slow, but the descent down the declivity, being rather like a rapid dragging down than a gradual descent, is swift and easy.", "6531": "And there are many things urged downwards, in which there is no use whatever, when God having made the soul to depend on his own powers, drags it up towards himself with a more vigorous attraction.", "6532": "XIII.", "6533": "Let thus much, then, be said generally about the three persons, since it was absolutely necessary ;", "6534": "but we must now proceed in regular order, to speak of those qualities in which each separate individual surpasses the others, beginning with him who is first mentioned.", "6535": "Now he, being an admirer of piety, the highest and greatest of all virtues, laboured earnestly to follow God, and to be obedient to the injunctions delivered by him, looking not only on those things as his com­ mands which were signified to him by words and facts, but those also which were indicated by more express signs through the medium of nature, and which the truest of the outward senses comprehends before the uncertain and untrustworthy hearing can do so;", "6536": "for if any one observes the arrangement which exists in nature, and the constitution according to which the world goes on, which is more excellent than any kind of reasoning, he learns, even though no one speaks to him, to study a course of life consistent with law and peace, looking to the example of good men.", "6537": "But the most manifest demon­ strations of peace are those which the scriptures contain;", "6538": "and we must mention the first which also occurs the first in the order in which they are set down.", "6539": "XIV.", "6540": "He being impressed by an oracle by which he was commanded to leave his country, and his kindred, and his father's house, and to emigrate like a man returning from a foreign land to his own country, and not like one who was about to set out from his own land to settle in a foreign district, hastened eagerly on, thinking to do with promptness what he was commanded to do was equivalant to perfecting the matter.", "6541": "And yet who else was it likely would be so un­ deviating and unchangeable as not to be won over by and as not to yield to the charms of one's relations and one's country ?", "6542": "The love for which has in a manner­ \" Grown with the growth and strengthened with the strength,” of every individual, and even more, or at all events not less than the limbs united to the body have done.", "6543": "And we have witnesses of this in the lawgivers who have enacted the second punishment next to death, namely, banish ment, against those who are convicted of the most atrocious crimes:", "6544": "a punishment which indeed is not second to any, as it appears to me, if truth be the judge, but which is, in fact, much more grievous than death, since death is the end of all misfortunes, but banishment is not the end but the beginning of new calamities, inflicting instead of our death unaccompanied by pain ten thousand deaths with acute sensation.", "6545": "Some men also, being engaged in traffic, do out of desire for gain sail over the sea, or being employed in some embassy, or being led by a desire to see the sights of foreign countries, or by a love for instruction, having various motives which attract them outwards and prevent their remaining where they are, some being led by a love of gain, others by the idea of being able to benefit their native city at its time of need in the most necessary and important particulars, others seeking to arrive at the knowledge of matters of which before they were ignorant, a knowledge which brings, at the same time, both delight and advantage to the soul.", "6546": "For men who have never travelled are to those who have, as blind men are to those who see clearly, are nevertheless anxious to behold their father's threshold and to salute it, and to embrace their acquaintances, and to enjoy the most delightful and wished-for sight of their relations and friends;", "6547": "and very often, seeing the affairs, for the sake oi which they left their country, protracted, they have abandoned them, being influenced by that most powerful feeling of longing for a union with their kindred.", "6548": "But this man with a very few companions, or perhaps I might say by himself, as soon as he was commanded to do so, left his home, and set out on an expedition to a foreign country in his soul even before he started with his body, his regard for mortal things being overpowered by his love for heavenly things.", "6549": "Therefore giving no consideration to anything whatever, neither to the men of his tribe, nor to those of his borough, nor to his fellow disciples, nor to his companions, nor to those of his blood as sprung from the same father or the same mother, nor to his country, nor to his ancient habits, nor to the customs in which lie had been brought up, nor to his mode of life and his mates, every one of which things has a seductive and almost irresist­ ible attraction and power, he departed as speedily as possible, yielding to a free and unrestrained impulse, and first of all he quitted the land of the Chaldaeans, a prosperous district, and one which was greatly flourishing at that period, and went into the land of Charran, and from that, after no very distant interval, he departed to another place, which we will speak of hereafter, when we have first discussedt he country of Charran.", "6550": "XV.", "6551": "The aforesaid emigrations, if one is to be guided by the literal expressions of the scripture, were performed by a wise man;", "6552": "but if we look to the laws of allegory, by a soul devoted to virtue and busied in the search after the true God.", "6553": "For the Chaldæans were, above all nations, addicted to the study of astronomy, and attributed all events to the motions of the stars, by which they fancied that all the things in the world were regulated, and accordingly they magnified the visible essence by the powers which numbers and the analogies of numbers contain, taking no account of the invisible essence appreciable only by the intellect.", "6554": "But while they were busied in investigating the arrangement existing in them with refer­ ence to the periodical revolutions of the sun, and moon, and the other planets, and fixed-stars, and the changes of the seasons of the year, and the sympathy of the heavenly bodies with the things of earth, they were led to imagine that the world itself was God, in their impious philosophy comparing the creature to the Creator.", "6555": "The man who had been bred up in this doctrine, and who for a long time had studied the philosophy of the Chaldæans, as if suddenly awakening from a deep slumber and opening the eye of the soul, and beginning to perceive a pure ray of light instead of profound darkness, followed the light, and saw what he had never seen before, a certain governor and director of the world standing above it, and guiding his own work in a salutary manner, and exerting his care and power in behalf of all those parts of it which are worthy of divine superin­ tendence.", "6556": "In order, therefore, that he may the more firmly establish the sight which has thus been presented to him in his mind, the sacred word says to him, My good friend, great things are often- made known by slight outlines, at which he who looks increases his imagination to an unlimited extent;", "6557": "therefore, having dismissed those who bend all their attention to the heavenly bodies, and discarding the Chaldaean science, rise up and depart for a short time from the greatest of cities, this world, to one which is smaller ;", "6558": "for so you will be the better able to comprehend the nature of the Ruler of the universe.", "6559": "It is for this reason that Abraham is said to have made his first migration from the country of the Chaldæans into the land of Charran.", "6560": "XVI.", "6561": "But Charran, in the Greek language, means “holes,\" which is a figurative emblem of the regions of our outward senses ;", "6562": "by means of which, as by holes, each of those senses is able to look out so as to comprehend the objects which belong to it.", "6563": "But, some one may say, what is the use of these holes, unless the invisible mind, like the exhibition of a puppet show, does from within prompt its own powers, which at one time losing and allowing to roam, and at another time holding back and restraining by force ?", "6564": "He gives sometimes an harmo­ nious motion, and sometimes perfect quiet to his puppets.", "6565": "And having this example at home, you will easily comprehend that being, the understanding of whom you are so anxious to arrive at;", "6566": "unless, indeed, you fancy that the world is situated in you as the dominant part of you, which the whole common powers of the body obey, and which each of the outward senses fol­ lows ;", "6567": "but that the world, the most beautiful, and greatest, and most perfect of works, of which everything else is.", "6568": "but a part, is destitute of any king to hold it together, and to regulate it, and govern it in accordance with justice.", "6569": "And if it be invisible, wonder not at that, for neither can the mind which is in thee be perceived by the sight.", "6570": "Any one who considers this, deriving his proofs not from a distance but close at hand, both from himself and from the circumstances around him, will clearly see that the world is not the first God, but that it is the work of the first God and Father of all things, who, being himself invisible, displays every thing, showing the nature of all things both small and great.", "6571": "For he has not chosen to be beheld by the eyes of the body, perhaps because it was not consistent with holiness for what is mortal to touch what is everlasting, or perhaps because of the weakness of our sight;", "6572": "for it would never have been able to stand the rays which are poured forth from the living God, since it cannot even look straight at the rays of the sun.", "6573": "XVII.", "6574": "And the most visible proof of this migration in which the mind quitted astronomy and the doctrines of the Chaldæans, is this.", "6575": "For it is said in the scriptures that the very moment that the wise man quitted his abode, \" God appeared unto Abraham,\"* to whom, therefore, it is plain that he was not visible before, when he was adher.", "6576": "ing to the studies of the Chaldæans, and attending to the motions of the stars, not properly comprehending any nature whatever, which was well arranged and appreciable by the intellect only, apart from the world and the essence perceptible by the outward senses.", "6577": "But after he changed his abode and went into another country he learnt of necessity that the world was subject, and not independent;", "6578": "not an absolute ruler, but governed by the great cause of all things who had created it, whom the mind then for the first time looked up and saw;", "6579": "for previously a great mist was shed over it by the objects of the external senses, which she, having dissipated by fervent and vivid doctrines, was scarcely able, as if in clear fine weather, to perceive him who had previously been concealed and invisible.", "6580": "But he, by reason of his love for mankind, did not reject the soul which came to him, but went forward to meet it, and showed to it his own nature as far as it was possible that he who was looking at it could see it.", "6581": "For which reason it is said, not that the wise man saw God but that God appeared to the wise man ;", "6582": "for it was impossible for any one to comprehend by his own unassisted power the true living God, unless he himself displayed and revealed himself to him.", "6583": "XVIII.", "6584": "And there is evidence in support of what has here been said to be derived from the change and alteration of his name :", "6585": "for he was anciently called Abram, but afterwards he was named Abraham :", "6586": "the alteration of sound being only that which proceeds from one single letter, alpha, being doubled, but the alteration revealing in effect an important fact and doctrine ;", "6587": "for the name Abram being interpreted means \" sub­ lime father;", "6588": "\" but Abraham signifies, \" the elect father of sound.\"", "6589": "The first name being expressive of the man who is called an astronomer, and one addicted to the contemplation of the sublime bodies in the sky, and who was versed in the doctrines of the Chaldæans, and who took care of them as a father might take care of his children.", "6590": "But the last name intimating the really wise man;", "6591": "for the latter name, by the word sound, intimates the uttered speech;", "6592": "and by the word father, the dominant mind.", "6593": "For the speech which is con­ ceived within is naturally the father of that which is uttered, inasmuch as it is older than the latter, and as it also suggests what is to be said.", "6594": "And by the addition of the word elect his goodness is intimated.", "6595": "For the evil disposition is a random and confused one, but that which is elect is good, having been selected from all others by reason of its excellence.", "6596": "Therefore, to him who is addicted to the contemplation of the sublime bodies of the sky there appears to be nothing whatever greater than the world;", "6597": "and therefore he refers the causes of all things that exist to the world.", "6598": "But the wise man, beholding with more accurate eyes that more perfect being that rules and governs all things, and is appreciable only by the intellect, to whom all things are subservient as to a master, and by whom every thing is directed, very often reproaches himself for his former way of life, and if he had lived the existence of a blind man, leaning upon objects perceptible by the outward senses, on things by their very nature worthless and unstable.", "6599": "The second migration is again undertaken by the virtuous man under the influence of a sacred oracle, but this is no longer one from one city to another, but it is to a desolate country, in which he wandered about for a long time without being discontented at his wandering and at his unsettled condi­ tion, which necessarily arose from it.", "6600": "And yet, what other man would not have been grieved, not only at departing from his own country but also at being driven away from every city into an inaccessible and impassable district ?", "6601": "And what other man would not have turned back and returned to his former home, paying but little attention to his former hopes, but desiring to escape from his present perplexity, thinking it folly for the sake of uncertain advantages to undergo admitted evils?-", "6602": "But this man alone appears to have behaved in the contrary manner, thinking that life which was remote from the fellowship of many companions the most pleasant of all.", "6603": "And this is naturally the case;", "6604": "for those who seek and desire to find God, love that solitude which is dear to him, labouring for this as their dearest and primary object, to become like his blessed and happy nature.", "6605": "Therefore, having now given both explanations, the literal one as concerning the man, and the allegorical one relating to the soul, we have shown that both the man and the mind are deserving of love ;", "6606": "inasmuch as the one is obedient to the sacred oracles, and because of their influence submits to be torn away from things with which it is hard to part;", "6607": "and the mind deserves to be loved because it has not submitted to be for ever deceived and to abide permanently with the essences perceptible by the out­ ward senses, thinking the visible world the greatest and first of gods, but soaring upwards with its reason it has beheld another nature better than that which is visible, that, namely, which is appreciable only by the intellect;", "6608": "and also that being who is at the same time the Creator and ruler of both.", "6609": "XIX.", "6610": "These, then, are the first principles of the man who loves God, and they are followed by actions which do not deserve to be lightly esteemed.", "6611": "But the greatness of them is not evident to every one, but only to those who have tasted of virtue, and who are wont to look with ridicule upon the objects which are admired by the multitude, by reason of the great­ ness of the good things of the soul.", "6612": "Therefore, God, having approved of his conduct which I have mentioned, presently rewarded the virtuous man with a great gift, inasmuch as he preserved sound and free from all pollution his marriage, which was in danger of being plotted against by a powerful and incontinent man.", "6613": "And the cause of this man's design upon it arose from this beginning;", "6614": "there having been a barrenness and scarcity of crops for a long time, owing to a long and immoderate period of rain which prevailed at one time, and to a great drought and heat which ensued afterwards.", "6615": "The cities of Syria being oppressed by a long continuance of famine, became destitute of inhabitants, all of them being dispersed in different direc­ tions for the purpose of seeking food and providing themselves with necessaries.", "6616": "Therefore, Abraham, hearing that there was unlimited abundance and plenty in Egypt, since the river there irrigated the fields with its inundations at the proper season, and since the winds by their salutary temperature brought up and nourished rich and heavy crops of corn, rose up with all his household to quit Syria and to go thither.", "6617": "And he had a wife of a most excellent disposition, who was also the most beautiful of all the women of her time.", "6618": "The Egyptian magistrates, seeing her and admiring her exquisite form, for nothing ever escapes the notice of men in authority, gave information to the king.", "6619": "And the king, sending for the woman and beholding her extraordinary beauty, gave but little heed to the dictates of modesty or to the laws which had been established with respect to the honour due to strangers, but yielding to his incontinent desires, conceived the intention in name, indeed, to marry her in lawful wedlock, but, in fact to seduce and defile her.", "6620": "But she, being destitute of all succour, as being in a foreign land, before an incontinent and cruel- minded ruler (for her husband had no power to protect her, fearing the danger which impended over him from princes mightier than he), at last, with him, took refuge in the only alliance remaining to her, the protection of God.", "6621": "And the merciful and gracious God, who takes compassion on the stranger, and who fights on behalf of those who are unjustly oppressed, inflicted in a moment painful sufferings and terrible chastisements on the king, filling his body and soul with all kinds of miseries difficult to be escaped or remedied, so that all his inclinations tending to pleasure were cut short, and, ou the contrary, he was occupied with nothing but cares, seeking an alleviation from his endless and intolerable torments by which he was harassed and tortured day and night;", "6622": "and his whole household also received their share of his punishment, because none of them had felt any iudigna­ tion at his lawless conduct, but had all consented to it, and had all but co-operated actively in his iniquity.", "6623": "In this manner the chastity of the woman was preserved, and God condescended to display the excellence and piety of her husband, giving him the noblest reward, namely, his marriage free from all injury, and even from all insult, so as no longer to be in danger of being violated;", "6624": "a marriage which however was not intended to produce any limited number of sons and daughters, but an entire nation-the most God-loving of all nations- and one which appears to me to have received the offices of priesthood and prophecy on behalf of the whole human race.", "6625": "XX.", "6626": "I have heard men versed in natural philosophy in­ terpreting this passage in an allegorical manner with no inconsiderable ingenuity and propriety;", "6627": "and their idea is, that the man here is a symbolical expression for the virtuous mind, conjecturing from the interpretation of his name that what is intended to be indicated is the virtuous disposition existing in the soul;", "6628": "and that by his wife is meant virtue, for the name of his wife is, in the Chaldæan language, Sarah, but in Greek \" priucess,\" because there is nothing more royal or more worthy of pre-eminence than virtue.", "6629": "And the marriage in which pleasure unites people compre­ bends the connection of the bodies, but that which is brought about by wisdom is the union of reasonings which desire purification, and of the perfect virtues ;", "6630": "and the two kinds of marriage here described are extremely opposite to one another;", "6631": "for in the marriage of the bodies it is the male partner which sows the seed and the female which receives it, but in the union which takes place with regard to the soul it is quite the contrary, and it is virtue which appears to be there in the place of the woman, which sows good counsels, and virtuous speeches, and expositions of doctrines profitable to life ;", "6632": "but the reason which is con­ sidered to be classed in the light of the man receives the sacred and divine seed, unless, indeed, there is any error in the names usually given;", "6633": "for certainly, in the grammatical view of the words, the word reason is masculine, and the word virtue has a feminine character.", "6634": "But if, any one, discarding the considerations of the names which tend to throw darkness over the subject, chooses to look at the plain facts without any disguise, he will know that virtue is masculine by nature, inasmuch as it puts things in motion, and arranges them, and suggests good conceptions of noble actions and speeches ;", "6635": "but reason is feminine, inasmuch as it is put in motion by another, and is instructed and benefited, and, in short, is altogether the patient, as its passive state is its only safety.", "6636": "XXI.", "6637": "All men, therefore, even the most vile, in word honour and admire virtue as far as appearance goes ;", "6638": "but it is the virtuous alone who obey its injunctions;", "6639": "on which account the king of Egypt, who is a figurative representa­ tion of the mind devoted to the body, as if he were acting in a theatre, assumes the character of a pretended partici­ pation in temperance though being an intemperate man, and in continence though being an incontinent man, and in justice though an unjust man, and he invites justice to himself, being eager to obtain a good report from the multitude ;", "6640": "and the governor of the universe seeing this, for God alone has power to look into the soul, hates him and rejects him, and by the most cruel tests and powers convicts him of an utterly false disposition.", "6641": "But by what instruments are these tests carried out ?", "6642": "Surely altogether by the parts of virtue which, whenever they enter, inflict great pain and severe wounds;", "6643": "for a torture is a deficiency of supply to that which is insatiable, and the torture of greediness is temperance;", "6644": "moreover, the man who is fond of glory is tortured while simplicity and humility are in the ascendent, and so is the unjust man when justice is extolled ;", "6645": "for it is impossible for two hostile natures to inhabit one soul, namely, for wickedness and virtue, for which reason, when they do come together, end­ less and irreconcilable seditions and wars are kindled between them ;", "6646": "and yet this is the case though virtue is of' a most peaceful disposition, and, as they say, is anxious whenever it is about to come to a contest of strength to make trial of its own powers first, so as only to contend if it has a prospect of being able to gain the victory;", "6647": "but if it finds its power unequal to the conflict, then it will never dare to descend into the arena at all, for it is not disgraceful to wickedness to be defeated, inasmuch as ingloriousness is akin to it;", "6648": "but it would be a shameful thing for virtue, to which glory is the most appropriate and the most peculiarly belonging of all things, on which account it is natural for virtue either to secure the victory, or else to keep itself un­ conquered.", "6649": "XXII.", "6650": "It has been said then that the disposition of the Egyptians is inhospitable and intemperate;", "6651": "and the human­ ity of him who has been exposed to their conduct deserves admiration, for he* in the middle of the day beholding as it were three men travelling (and he did not perceive that they were in reality of a more divine nature), ran up and entreated them with great perseverance not to pass by his tent, but as was becoming to go in and receive the rites of hospitality:", "6652": "and they knowing the truth of the man not so much by what he said, as by his mind which they could look into, assented to his request without hesitation;", "6653": "and being filled as to his soul with joy, he took every possible pains to make their extemporaneous reception worthy of them ;", "6654": "and he said to his wife, \" Hasten now, and make ready quickly three measures of fine meal,\" and he himself went forth among the herds of oxen, and brought forth a tender and well-fed heifer, and gave it to his servant;", "6655": "and he having slain it, dressed it with all speed.", "6656": "For no one in the house of a wise man is ever slow to perform the duties of hospitality, but both women and men, and slaves and freemen, are most eager in the performance of all those duties towards strangers ;", "6657": "therefore, after having feasted, and being delighted, not so much with what was set before them, as with the good will of their entertainer, and with his excessive and unbounded zeal to please them, they bestow on him a reward beyond his expectation, the birth of a legitimate son in a short time, making him a promise which is to be confirmed to him by one the most excellent of the three ;", "6658": "for it would have been inconsistent with philosophy for them all to speak together at the same moment, but it was desirous for all the rest to assent while one spoke.", "6659": "Nevertheless he did not completely believe them even when they made him this promise, by reason of the incredi­ ble nature of the thing promised;", "6660": "for both he and his wife, through extreme old age, were so old as utterly to have abandoned all hope of offspring;", "6661": "therefore the scriptures record that Abraham's wife, when she first heard what they were saying, laughed;", "6662": "and when they said after­ wards, \" Is anything impossible to God?\" they were so ashamed that they denied that they had laughed;", "6663": "for Abraham knew that everything was possible to God, having almost learnt this doctrine as one may say from his cradle ;", "6664": "then for the first time he appears to me to have begun to entertain a different opinion of his guests from that which he conceived at first, and to have imagined that they were either some of the prophets or of the angels who had changed their spiritual and soul-like essence, and assumed the appearance of men.", "6665": "XXIII.", "6666": "We have now then described the hospitable temper of the man, which was as it were a sort of addition to set off his greater virtue;", "6667": "but his virtue was piety towards God, concerning which we have spoken before, the most evident instance of which is to be found in his conduct now recorded towards the strangers ;", "6668": "but if any per­ sons have fancied that house happy and blessed in which it has happened that wise men have stopped and abode, they should consider that they would not have done so, and would not even have looked into it at all, if they had seen any incurable disease in the souls of those who were therein, but I know not what excess of happiness and blessedness, I should say, existed in that house in which angels conde­ scended to tarry and to receive the rites of hospitality from men, angels, those sacred and divine natures, the ministers and lieutenants of the mighty God, by means of whom, as of ambassadors, he announces whatever predictions he con­ descends to intimate to our race.", "6669": "For how could they ever have endured to enter a human habitation at all, unless they had been certain that all the inhabitants within, like the well-managed and orderly crew of a ship, obeyed one signal only, namely, that of their master, as the sailors obey the command of the captain ?", "6670": "And how would they ever have condescended to assume the appearance of guests and men feasted hospitably, if they had not thought that their entertainer was akin to them, and a fellow servant with them, bound to the service of the same master as themselves ?", "6671": "We must think indeed that at their entrance all the parts of the house became improved and advanced in goodness, being breathed upon with a certain breeze of most perfect virtue.", "6672": "And the entertainment was such as it was fitting that it should be, the persons who were being feasted displaying at the banquet their own simplicity towards their entertainer, and addressing him in a guileless manner, and all of them holding conversation suited to the occasion.", "6673": "And it is a thing that deserves to be looked on as a prodigy, that though they did not drink they seemed to drink, and that though they did not eat they presented the appearance of persons eating.", "6674": "But this was all natural and consistent with what was going on.", "6675": "And the most miraculous circum­ stance of all was, that these beings who were incorporeal.", "6676": "presented the appearance of a body in human form by reason of their favour to the virtuous man, for otherwise what need was there of all these miracles except for the purpose of giving the wise man the evidence of his external senses by means of a more distinct sight, because his cha­ racter had not escaped the knowledge of the Father of the universe.", "6677": "XXIV.", "6678": "This then is sufficient to say by way of a literal explanation of this account:", "6679": "we must now speak of that which may be given if the story be looked at as figurative and symbolical.", "6680": "The things which are expressed by the voice are the signs of those things which are conceived in the mind alone;", "6681": "when, therefore, the soul is shone upon by God as if at noonday, and when it is wholly and entirely filled with that light which is appreciable only by the intellect, and by being wholly surrounded with its brilliancy is free from all shade or darkness, it then perceives a threefold image of one subject, one image of the living God, and others of the .", "6682": "other two, as if they were shadows irradiated by it.", "6683": "And some such thing as this happens to those who dwell in that light which is perceptible by the outward senses, for whether people are standing still or in motion, there is often a double shadow failing from them.", "6684": "Let not any one then fancy that the word shadow is applied to God with perfect propriety.", "6685": "It is merely a cata­ chrestical abuse of the name, by way of bringing before our eyes a more vivid representation of the matter intended to be intimated.", "6686": "Since this is not the actual truth, but in order that one may when speaking keep as close to the truth as possible, the one in the middle is the Father of the universe, who in the sacred scriptures is called by his proper name, I am that I am ;", "6687": "and the beings on each side are those most ancient powers which are always close to the living God, one of which is called his creative power, and the other his royal power.", "6688": "And the creative power is God, for it is by this that be made and arranged the universe ;", "6689": "and the royal power is the Lord, for it is fitting that the Creator should lord it over and govern the creature.", "6690": "Therefore the middle person of the three, being attended by each of his powers as by body-guards, presents to the mind, which is endowed with the faculty of sight, a vision at one time of one being, and at another time of three;", "6691": "of one when the soul being com­ pletely purified, and having surmounted not only the multi­ tudes of numbers, but also the number two, which is the neighbour of the unit, hastens onward to that idea which is devoid of all mixture, free from all combination, and by itself in need of nothing else whatever;", "6692": "and of three, when, not being as yet made perfect as to the important virtues, it is still seeking for initiation in those of less con­ sequence, and is not able to attain to a comprehension of the living God by its own unassisted faculties without the aid of something else, but can only do so by judging of his deeds, whether as creator or as governor.", "6693": "This then, as they say, is the second best thing;", "6694": "and it no less partakes in the opinion which is dear to and devoted to God.", "6695": "But the first-mentioned disposition has no such share, but is itself the very God-loving and God-beloved opinion itself, or rather it is truth which is older than opinion, and more valuable than any seeming.", "6696": "But we must now explain what is intimated by this statement in a more perspicuous manner.", "6697": "XXV.", "6698": "There are three different classes of human dispo­ sitions, each of which has received as its portion one of the aforesaid visions.", "6699": "The best of them has received that vision which is in the centre, the sight of the truly living God.", "6700": "The one which is next best has received that which is on the right hand, the sight of the beneficent power which has the name of God.", "6701": "And the third has the sight of that which is on the left hand, the governing power, which is called lord.", "6702": "Therefore, the best dispositions cultivate that being who exists of himself, without the aid of any one else, being themselves attracted by nothing else, by reason of all their entire attention being directed to the honour of that one being.", "6703": "But of the other dispositions, some derive their existence and owe their being recognized by the father to his beneficent power;", "6704": "and others, again, owe it to his governing power.", "6705": "My meaning in this statement is this :", "6706": "—Men when they perceive that, under the pretext of friend­ ship, some persons come to them, being in reality only desirous to get what they can from them, look upon them with suspicion, and turn away from them, fearing their insincere, and flattering, and caressing behaviour, as very pernicious.", "6707": "But God, inasmuch as he is not liable to any injury, gladly invites all men who choose, in any way what­ ever to honour him, to come unto him, not choosing alto­ gether to reject any person whatever;", "6708": "and, in truth, he almost says in express words to those who have ears in the soul, \" The most valuable prizes shall be offered to those who worship me for my own sake:", "6709": "the second best to those who hope by their own efforts to be able to attain to good, or to find a means of escape from punishments.", "6710": "For oven if the service of this latter class is mercenary and not wholly incorrupt, still it nevertheless revolves within the divine circumference, and does not stray beyond it.", "6711": "But the rewards which shall be laid up for those who honour me for my own sake are rewards of affection;", "6712": "while those which are given to those who do so with a view to their own advantage are not given through affection, but because they are not looked upon as aliens.", "6713": "For I receive him who wishes to be a partaker of my beneficent power to a partici­ pation in my good things, and him who out of fear seeks to propitiate my governing and despotic power, I receive so far as to avert punishment from him.", "6714": "For I am not unaware that, in addition to these men not becoming worse, thev will become better, by gradually arriving at a sincere and pure piety by their constant perseverance in serving me.", "6715": "For even if the original dispositions, under the influence of which they originally endeavoured to please me, differ widely, still they must not be blamed, because they have in conse­ quence only one aim and object, that of serving me.", "6716": "\"But that what is seen is in reality a threefold appearance of one subject is plain, not only from the contemplation of the allegory, but also from that of the express words in which the allegory is couched.", "6717": "For when the wise man entreats those persons who are in the guise of three travel­ lers to come and lodge in his house, he speaks to them not as three persons, but as one, and says, \" My lord, if I have found favour with thee, do not thou pass by thy servant.\"*", "6718": "For the expressions, \" my lord,\" and \" with thee,\" and \" do not thou pass by,\" and others of the same kind, are all such as are naturally addressed to a single individual, but not to many.", "6719": "And when those persons, having been entertained in his house, address their entertainer in an affectionate manner, it is again one of them who promises that he by himself will be present, and will bestow on him the seed of a child of his own, speaking in the following words :", "6720": "“ I will return again and visit thee again, according to the time of life, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son.”", "6721": "†XXVI.", "6722": "And what is signified by this is indicated in a most evident and careful manner by the events which ensued.", "6723": "The country of the Sodomites was a district of the land of Canaan, which the Syrians afterwards called Pales­ tine, a country full of innumerable iniquities, and espe­ cially of gluttony and debauchery, and all the great and numerous pleasures of other kinds which have been built up by men as a fortress, on which account it had been already condemned by the Judge of the whole world.", "6724": "And the cause of its excessive and immoderate intemperance was the unlimited abundance of supplies of all kinds which its inhabitants enjoyed.", "6725": "For the land was one with a deep soil, and well watered, and as such produced abundant crops of every kind of fruit every year.", "6726": "And he was a wise man and spoke truly who said-", "6727": "The greatest cause of all iniquity Is found in overmuch prosperity.", "6728": "\"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intem­ perate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections;", "6729": "for not only did they go mad after women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring ;", "6730": "but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire;", "6731": "and so, by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, an intolerable evil;", "6732": "for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they made also their souls most ignoble, cor­ rupting in this way the whole race of man, as far as depended on them.", "6733": "At all events, if the Greeks and barba­ rians were to have agreed together, and to have adopted the commerce of the citizens of this city, their cities one after another would have become desolate, as if they had been emptied by a pestilence.", "6734": "XXVII.", "6735": "But God, having taken pity on mankind, as being a Saviour and full of love for mankind, increased, as far as possible, the natural desire of men and women for a connexion together, for the sake of producing children, and detesting the unnatural and unlawful commerce of the people of Sodom, he extinguished it, and destroyed those who were inclined to these things, and that not by any or­ dinary chastisement, but he inflicted on them an astonish­ in, novelty, and unheard of rarity of vengeance;", "6736": "for, on a sudden, he commanded the sky to become overclouded and to pour forth a mighty shower, not of rain but of fire ;", "6737": "and as the flame poured down, with a resistless and unceasing violence, the fields were burnt up, and the meadows, and all the dense groves, and the thick marshes, and the impe­ netrable thickets;", "6738": "the plain too was consumed, and all the crop of wheat, and of everything else that was sown;", "6739": "and all the trees of the mountain district were burnt up, the trunks and the very roots being consumed.", "6740": "And the folds for the cattle, and the houses of the men, and the walls, and all that was in any building, whether of private or public property, were all burnt.", "6741": "And in one day these populous cities became the tomb of their in­ habitants, and the vast edifices of stone and timber became thin dust and ashes.", "6742": "And when the flames had consumed everything that was visible and that existed on the face of the earth, they proceeded to burn even the earth itself, pone­ trating into its lowest recesses, and destroying all the vivifying powers which existed within it so as to produce a complete and everlasting barrenness, so that it should never again be able to bear fruit, or to put forth any verdure ;", "6743": "and to this very day it is scorched up.", "6744": "For the fire of the lightning is what is most difficult to extinguish, and creeps on pervading everything, and smouldering.", "6745": "And a most evident proof of this is to be found in what is seen to this day:", "6746": "for the smoke which is still emitted, and the sulphur which men dig up there, are a proof of the calamity which befell that country;", "6747": "while a most con­ spicuous proof of the ancient fertility of the land is left in one city, and in the land around it.", "6748": "For the city is very populous, and the land is fertile in grass and in corn, and in every kind of fruit, as a constant evidence of the punish­ ment which was inflicted by the divine will on the rest of the country.", "6749": "XXVIII.", "6750": "But I have not gone through all these par­ ticulars for the sake of showing the magnitude of that vast and novel calamity, but because I desired to prove that of the three beings who appeared to the wise Abraham in the guise of men, the scriptures only represent two as having come to the country which was subsequently de­ stroyed for the purpose of destroying its inhabitants, since the third did not think fit to come for that purpose.", "6751": "Inas­ much as lie, according to my conception, was the true and living God, who thought it fitting that lie being present should bestow good gifts by his own power, but that he should effect the opposite objects by the agency and service of his subordinate powers, so that he might be looked upon as the cause of good only, and of no evil whatever antecedently.", "6752": "And kings too appear to me to imitate the divine nature in this particular, and to act in the same way, giving their favours in person, but inflicting their chastisements by the agency of others.", "6753": "But since, of the two powers of God, one is a beneficent power and the other a chastising one, each of them, as is natural, is manifested to the country of the people of Sodom.", "6754": "Because of the five finest cities in it four were about to be destroyed by fire, and one was des­ tined to be left unhurt and safe from every evil.", "6755": "For it was necessary that the calamities should be inflicted by the chastising power, and that the one which was to be saved should be saved by the beneficent power.", "6756": "But since the portion which was saved was not endowed with entire and complete virtues, but was blessed with kindness by the power of the living God, it was deliberately accounted un­ worthy to have a sight of his presence afforded to it.", "6757": "XXIX.", "6758": "This, then, is the open explanation which is to be given of this account, and which is to be addressed to the multitude.", "6759": "But there is another esoteric explanation to be reserved for the few who choose for the subjects of their investigation the dispositions of the soul, and not the forms of bodies ;", "6760": "and this shall now be mentioned.", "6761": "The five cities of the land of Sodom are a figurative repre­ sentation of the five outward senses which exist in us, the organs of the pleasures, by the instrumentality of which all the pleasures whether great or small are brought to perfection;", "6762": "for we are pleased either when we behold the varieties of colours and forms, both in things inanimate and in those endowed with vitality, or when we hear melodious sounds, or again, we are delighted by the exercise of the faculty of taste in the things which relate to eating and drinking, or by that of the sense of smell in fragrant flavours and vapours, or in accordance with our faculty of touch when conversant with soft, or hot, or smooth things.", "6763": "Now of these five outward senses there are three which have the greatest resemblance to the brute beasts and to slaves, namely the senses of taste, smell, and touch:", "6764": "as it is with reference to these that those species of beasts and cattle which arc the most greedy and the most strongly inclined to sexual connections are the most vehemently excited.", "6765": "For all day and all night they are either glutting themselves in­ satiably with food, or else in a state of eagerness for sexual connection.", "6766": "But there are two of these outward senses which have something philosophical and pre-eminent in them, namely, sight and hearing.", "6767": "But the ears are in some degree more slow and more effeminate than the eyes, since the latter go with promptness and courage to what is to be seen, and do not wait until the objects themselves are in motion, but go forward to meet them, and desire to move themselves so as to face them.", "6768": "But the sense of hearing, inasmuch as that is slow and more effeminate, may be classed in the second rank, and the sense of seeing may be allowed an especial pre-eminence and privilege:", "6769": "for God has made this sense a sort of rqueen of the rest, placing it above them all, and stationing it as it were on a citadel, has made it of all the senses in the closest connection with the soul;", "6770": "and any one may conjecture this from the common changes which take place in its essential organs;", "6771": "for when grief exists in the soul of man, the eyes are full of concern and melancholy;", "6772": "and on the other hand, when joy is in our heart the eyes smile and rejoice;", "6773": "and when fear gets the upper hand they are full of turbulent and disorderly confusion, and are subject to all kinds or irregular motions, and quiverings, and distortions.", "6774": "Again, if anger occupies us, the sight becomes more fierce and bloodshot;", "6775": "and when we are considerating or deliberat­ ing, the eyes are tranquil and motionless, and almost as intent as the mind itself;", "6776": "just as at moments of the relaxa­ tion and indifference of the mind, the eyes also are relaxed and indifferent;", "6777": "when a friend approaches the feeling of good- will towards him is proclaimed by a calm and serene look ;", "6778": "on the other hand, if we meet with an enemy, the eyes give an early indication of the displeasure of the soul;", "6779": "when our mind is inspired by boldness, our eyes bound forward and are ready to start from our heads;", "6780": "when we are oppressed with feelings of shame or modesty, they are gentle and repressed.", "6781": "And, in short, we may say that the sight has been created to be an exact image of the soul, which is thus beautifully represented by it through the perfection of the Creator's skill, the eyes showing a visible representation of it, as in a mirror, since the soul has no visible nature in itself;", "6782": "but it is not in this particular alone that the beauty of the eyes exceeds the rest of the outward senses, but also because the use of the other senses is interrupted during our waking moments;", "6783": "for we must not include in our statement the inactivity which results from sleep;", "6784": "for they are at rest whenever there is not some external object to put them in motion;", "6785": "but the energies of the eyes when they are open are continuous and uninterrupted, as the eyes are never sati­ ated or wearied, but continue to operate in accordance with the connection which they have with the soul;", "6786": "and the soul itself is everlastingly awake, and is in perpetual motion both night and day;", "6787": "but to the eyes, as being to a great degree partakers of the fleshly nature, a self sufficient gift was given, to be able to continue exercising their appro­ priate energies during one half of the entire period of life.", "6788": "XXX.", "6789": "But we must now proceed to speak of that which is the most necessary part of all, the advantage which we derive from the eyes.", "6790": "For it is to sight alone of the exter­ nal senses that God has caused light to arise, which is both the most beautiful of all existing things, and is, moreover, the first thing which is pronounced in the sacred scriptures to be good.", "6791": "Now the nature of light is twofold :", "6792": "for there is one light which proceeds from the fire which we use, a perishable light proceeding from a perishable material, and one which admits of being extinguished.", "6793": "But the other kind is inextinguishable and imperishable, descending to us from above from heaven, as if every one of the stars was pouring down its beams upon us from an everlasting spring.", "6794": "And the sense of sight associates with each of these kinds of light, and through the medium of both of them does it approach the objects of sight so as to arrive at a most accurate comprehension of them.", "6795": "Why now need we attempt to panegyrize the eyes further by a speech, when God has engraved their true praises on pillars erected in heaven, namely, the stars ?", "6796": "For for what purpose were the rays of the sun, and the beams of the moon, and the light of all the other planets and fixed stars called into existence, except as fields for the energies of the eyes in their service of seeing ?", "6797": "On which account men, using the most excellent of all gifts, contemplate the things which exist in the world, the earth, the plants, the animals, the fruits of the earth, the seas, the effusion of waters springing from the earth and gushing forth in torrents and floods, and the varieties of fountains, some of which give forth cold and others hot water, and the natures of all things that exist in the air;", "6798": "and all the different species, of which we thus arrive at the knowlege, are innumerable and indescrib­ able, and cannot be comprised in speech.", "6799": "And above all these things, the eyes can behold the heaven, which is truly a world created in another world, and it can also sur­ vey the beauties and divine images existing in heaven.", "6800": "Which now of the other external senses can boast that it has arrived at such a pitch of power as this ?XXXI.", "6801": "But now, dismissing the consideration of those of the outward senses which are in the stables, as it were, fattening up an animal which is born with us, namely, appetite, let us investigate the nature of that sense which receives speech, namely, hearing;", "6802": "the continued and vigo­ rous, and most perfect course of which exists in the atmo­ sphere which surrounds the earth, when the violence of the winds and the noise of thunder sound with a great dragging noise and terrible crash.", "6803": "But the eyes in a single moment can reach from earth to heaven, and taking in the extremest boundaries of the universe, reaching at the same moment to the east and to the west, and to the north and to the south, so as to survey them all at once, drag the mind towards what is visible.", "6804": "And the mind, at once receiving a similar impression, does not continue quiet, but being in perpetual motion, and never slumbering, receiving from the sight the power of observing the objects appreciable by the intellect, comes to consider whether these things which are brought visibly before it are uncreated, or whether they have derived their origin from creation ;", "6805": "also, whether they are bounded or infinite.", "6806": "Again, whether there are many worlds or only one;", "6807": "also, whether there are five elements of the whole universe, or whether heaven and the heavenly bodies have a peculiar and separate nature of their own, having received a more divine conformation, differing from that of the rest of the world.", "6808": "Again, by these means it considers if the world has been created, by whom it has been created, and who the creator is as to his essence or quality, and with what design he made it, and what he is doing now, and what his mode of existence or cause of life is;", "6809": "and all other such questions as the excellently-endowed mind when cohabiting with wisdom is accustomed to examine.", "6810": "These, and similar subjects, belong to philosophers, from which it is plain that wisdom and philosophy have not derived their origin from anything else that exists in us except from that queen of the outward senses, the sight, which God saved alone of the region of the body when he destroyed the other four, because these last were slaves to the flesh and to the passions of the flesh;", "6811": "but the sight alone was able to raise its head and to look up, and to find other sources of delight far superior to those proceeding from the bodily pleasures, those, namely, that are derived from the contemplation of the world and the things in it.", "6812": "Therefore it was appro­ priate for one of the five outward senses, namely, the sight, like one eity in the Pentapolis, to receive an especial reward and honour, and to remain while the others were destroyed, because it is not only conversant with mortal objects as they are, but is able also to forsake sueh, and to depart to the imperishable natures, and to rejoice in the sight of them.", "6813": "On which account the holy scriptures very beautifully represent it as \" a little city, and yet not a little one,”* describing the power of sight under this figure.", "6814": "For it is said to be little, inasmuch as it is but a small portion of the faculties which exist in us;", "6815": "and yet great, inasmuch as it desires great things, being eager to behold the entire heaven and the whole world.", "6816": "XXXII.", "6817": "AVe have now, then, given a full explanation concerning the vision which appeared to Abraham, and con­ cerning his celebrated and all-glorious hospitality, in which the entertainer, who appeared to himself to be entertaining others, was himself entertained ;", "6818": "expounding every part or the passage with as much accuracy as we were able.", "6819": "But we must not pass over in silence the most important action of all, which is worthy of being listened to.", "6820": "For I was nearly saying that it is of more importance than all the actions of piety and religion put together.", "6821": "So we must say what seems to be seasonable concerning it.", "6822": "A legitimate son is borne to the wise man by his wedded wife, a beloved and only son, very beautiful in his person, and very excellent in his disposition.", "6823": "For he was already beginning to display the more perfect exercises of his age, so that his father felt a most strong and vehement affection for him, not only from the impulse of natural regard, but also from the influence of deliberate opinion, from being, as it were, a judge of his character.", "6824": "To him, then, being con­ scious of such a disposition, an oracular command suddenly comes, which was never expected, ordering him to sacrifice this son on a certain very lofty hill, distant three days' journey from the city.", "6825": "And he, although attached to his child by an indescribable fondness, neither changed colour, nor wavered in his soul, but remained firm in an unyielding and unalterable purpose, as he was at first.", "6826": "And being wholly influenced by love towards God, he forcibly repressed all the names and charms of the natural relationship :", "6827": "and without mentioning the oracular command to any one of his household out of all his numerous body of servants, he took with him the two eldest, who were most thoroughly attached to their master, as if he were bent upon the cele­ bration of some ordinary divine rite, and went forth with his son, making four in all.", "6828": "And when, looking as it were from a watch-tower, he saw the appointed place afar off, he bade his servants remain there, and he gave his son the fire and the wood to carry, thinking it proper for the victim himself to be burdened with the materials for the sacrifice, a very light burden, for nothing is less troublesome than piety.", "6829": "And as they pro­ ceeded onwards with equal speed, not marching more rapidly with their bodies than with their minds along that short road of which holiness is the end, they at last arrive at the appointed place.", "6830": "And the father collected stones wherewith to build the altar;", "6831": "and when his son saw everything else prepared for the celebration of the sacrifice, but no animal, he looked to his father and said, “My father, behold the fire and the wood, but where is the victim for the burnt sacrifice ?\" *", "6832": "Therefore, any other father, knowing what he was about to do, and being depressed in his soul, would have been thrown into confusion by his son's words, and being filled with tears, would, out of his excessive affliction, by his silence have betrayed what was about to be done;", "6833": "but Abraham, betraying no alteration of voice, or countenance, or intention, looking at his son with steady eye, answered his question with a determination more steady still, “ My child,\" said he, \" God will provide himself a victim for the burnt offering,\" although we are in a vast desert where perhaps you despair of such a thing being found;", "6834": "but all things are possible to God, even all such things as are im­ possible and unintelligible to men.", "6835": "And even while saying this, he seizes his son with all rapidity, and places him on the altar, and having taken his knife in his right hand, he raised it over him as if to slay him;", "6836": "but God the Saviour stopped the deed in the middle, interrupting him by a voice from heaven, by which he ordered him to stay his hand, and not to touch the child:", "6837": "calling the father by name twice, so as to turn him and divert him from his purpose, and forbid him to complete the sacrifice.", "6838": "XXXIII.", "6839": "And so Isaac is saved, God supplying a gift in­ stead of him, and honouring him who was willing to make the offering in return for the piety which he had exhibited.", "6840": "But the action of the father, even though it was not ultimately given effect to, is nevertheless recorded and engraved as a complete and perfect sacrifice, not only in the sacred scrip­ tures, but also in the minds of those who read them.", "6841": "But to those who are fond of reviling and disparaging every­ thing, and who are by their invariable habits accustomed to prefer blaming to praising the action which Abraham was enjoined to perform, it will not appear a great and admirable deed, as we imagine it to have been.", "6842": "For such persons say that many other men, who have been very affectionate to their relations and very fond of their children, have given up their sons;", "6843": "some in order that they might be sacrificed for their country to deliver it either from war, or from drought, or from much rain, or from disease and pestilence;", "6844": "and others to satisfy the demands of some habitual religious observances, even though there may be no real piety in them.", "6845": "At all events they say that some of the most celebrated men of the Greeks, not merely private individuals but kings also, caring but little for the children whom they have be­ gotten, have, by means of their destruction secured safety to mighty and numerous forces and armies, arrayed together in an allied body, and have voluntarily slain them as if they had been enemies.", "6846": "And also that barbarous nations have for many ages practised the sacrifice of their children as if it were a holy work and one looked upon with favour by God, whose wickedness is mentioned by the holy Moses.", "6847": "For he, blaming them for this pollution, says, that \"", "6848": "They burn their sons and their daughters to their gods.\"*", "6849": "And they say that to this very day the Gymnosopbists among the Indians, when that long or incurable disease, old age, begins to attack them, before it has got a firm hold of them, and while they might still last for many years, kindle a fire and burn themselves.", "6850": "And, moreover, when their husbands are already dead, they say that their wives rush cheerfully to the same funeral pile, and whilst living endure to be burnt along with their husbands' bodies.", "6851": "One may well admire the exceeding courage of these women, who look thus contemptuously on death, and disdain it so exceedingly that they hasten and run impetuously towards it as if they were grasping immortality.", "6852": "XXXIV.", "6853": "But why, say they, ought one to praise Abra­ ham as the attempter of a wholly novel kind of conduct, when it is only what private men and kings, and even whole nations do at appropriate seasons ?", "6854": "But I will make the following reply to the envy and in-temper of these men.", "6855": "Of those who sacrifice their childen, some do so out of habit, as they say some of the barbarians do;", "6856": "others do it because they are unable by any other means to place on a good footing some desperate and important dangers threat­ ening their cities and countries.", "6857": "And of these men, some have given up their children because they have been con­ strained by those more powerful than themselves:", "6858": "and others, out of a thirst for glory, and honour, and for renown at the present moment, and celebrity in all future ages.", "6859": "Now those who sacrifice their children out of deference to custom, perform, in my opinion, no great exploit;", "6860": "for an inveterate custom is often as powerful as nature itself;", "6861": "so that it diminishes the terrible impression made by the action to be done, and makes even the most miserable and intolerable evils light to bear.", "6862": "Again :", "6863": "surely, they who offer up their children out of fear deserve no praise;", "6864": "for praise is only given to voluntary good actions, but what is involuntary, is ascribed to other causes than the immediate actors-to the occasion, or to chance, or to compulsion from men.", "6865": "Again, if any one, out of a desire for glory, abandons his son or his daughter, he would justly be blamed rather than praised ;", "6866": "seeking to acquire honour by the death of his dearest relations, while, even if he had glory, he ought rather to have risked the loss of it to secure the safety of his children.", "6867": "We must investigate, therefore, whether Abraham was under the influence of any one of the aforesaid motives, custom, or love of glory, or fear, when he was about to sacri­ fice his son.", "6868": "Now Babylon, and Mesopotamia, and the nation of the Chaldæans, do not receive the custom of sacrificing their children;", "6869": "and these are the countries in which Abraham had been brought up and had lived most of his time ;", "6870": "so that we cannot imagine that his sense of the misfortune that he was commanded to inflict upon himself was blunted by the frequency of such events.", "6871": "Again, there was no fear from men which pressed upon him, for no one knew of this oracular command which had been given to him alone, nor was there any common calamity pressing upon the land in which he was living, such as could only be remedied by the destruction of his most excellent son.", "6872": "May it not have been, however, from a desire to obtain praise from the multitude that he proceeded to this action ?", "6873": "But what praise could be obtained in the desert, when there was no one likely to be present who could possibly say any­ thing in his favour, and when even his two servants were left at a distance on purpose that he might not seem to be hunting after praise, or to be making a display by bringing witnesses with him to see the greatness of his devotion ?XXXV.", "6874": "Therefore putting a barrier on their unbridled and evil-speaking mouths, let them moderate that envy in themselves which hates everything that is good, and let them forbear to attack the virtues of men who have lived excellently, which they ought rather to reward and decorate with panegyric.", "6875": "And that this action of Abraham's was in reality one deserving of praise and of all love, it is easy to see from many circumstances.", "6876": "In the first place, then, he laboured above all men to obey God, which is thought an excellent thing, and an especial object for all men's desire, by all right-minded persons, to such a degree, that he never omitted to perform anything which God commanded him, not even if it was full of arrogance and ingloriousness, or even of positive pain and misery;", "6877": "for which reason he also bore, in a most noble manner, and with the most unshaken fortitude, the command given to him respecting his son.", "6878": "In the second place, though it was not the custom in the land in which he was living, as perhaps it is among some nations, to offer human sacrifices, and custom, by its frequency, often removes the horror felt at the first appear­ ance of evils, he himself was about to be the first to set the example of a novel and most extraordinary deed, which I do not think that any human being would have brought himself to submit to, even if his soul had been made of iron or of adamant;", "6879": "for as some one has said,­ \" 'Tis a hard task with nature to contend.", "6880": "\"In the second place, after he had become the father of this his only legitimate son, he, from the moment of his birth, cherished towards him all the genuine feelings of affection, which exceeds all modest love, and all the ties of friendship which have ever been celebrated in the world.", "6881": "There was added also, this most forcible charm of all, that he had become the father of this son not in the prime of his life, but in his old age.", "6882": "For parents become to a cer­ tain degree insane in their affection for children of their old age, either from the circumstance of their having been wishing for their birth a long time, or else because they have no longer any hope that they shall have any more;", "6883": "nature having taken her stand there as at the extreme and furthest limit.", "6884": "Now there is nothing unnatural or extraordinary in de­ voting one child to God out of a numerous family, as a sort of first fruits of all one's children, while one still has plea­ sure in those who remain alive, who are no small comfort and alleviation of the grief felt for the one who is sacri­ ficed.", "6885": "But the man who gives the only beloved son that he is possessed of performs an action beyond all powers of language to praise, as he is giving nothing to his own natural affection, but inclining with his whole will and heart to show his devotion to God.", "6886": "Accordingly this is an extraordinary and almost unprecedented action which was done by Abraham.", "6887": "For other men, even if they have yielded up their chil­ dren to be sacrificed on behalf of the safety of their native land or of their armies, have either remained at home them­ selves, or have kept at a distance from the altar of sacri­ fice ;", "6888": "or at least, if they have been present they have averted their eyes, and left others to strike the blow which they have not endured to witness.", "6889": "But this man, like a priest of sacrifice himself, did himself begin to perform the sacred rite, although he was a most affectionate father of a son who was in all respects most excellent.", "6890": "And, perhaps, ac­ cording to the usual law and custom of burnt offerings he was intending to solemnise the rite by dividing his son limb by limb.", "6891": "And so he did not divide his feelings and allot one part of his regard to his son and another part to piety to G-od :", "6892": "but he devoted his whole soul, entire and un­ divided, to holiness;", "6893": "thinking but little of the kindred blood which flowed in the victim.", "6894": "Now of all the circumstances which we have enumerated what is there which others have in common with Abraham ?", "6895": "What is there which is not peculiar to him, and excellent beyond all power of language to praise ?", "6896": "So that every one who is not by nature envious and a lover of evil must be struck with amazement and admiration for his excessive piety, even if he should not call at once to mind all the particulars on which I have been dwelling, but only some one of the whole number ;", "6897": "for the conception of any one of these particulars is sufficient by a brief and faint outline to display the greatness and loftiness of the father's soul ;", "6898": "though there is nothing petty in the action of the wise man.", "6899": "XXXVI.", "6900": "But the things which we have here been say­ ing do not appear solely in the plain and explicit language of the text of the holy scriptures ;", "6901": "but they appear, more­ over, to exhibit a nature which is not so evident to the multitude, but which they who place the objects of the in­ tellect above those perceptible by the outward senses, and who are able to appreciate them, recognise.", "6902": "And this nature is of the following description.", "6903": "The victim who was about to be sacrificed is called in the Chaldæan language, Isaac;", "6904": "but if this name be trans­ lated into the Grecian language, it signifies \"laughter;", "6905": "\" and this laughter is not understood to be that laughter of the body which is frequent in childish sport, but is the result of a settled happiness and rejoicing of the mind.", "6906": "This kind of laughter the wise man is appropriately said to offer as a sacrifice to God ;", "6907": "showing thus, by a figure, that to rejoice does properly belong to God alone.", "6908": "For the human race is subject to sorrow and to exceeding fear, from evils which are either present or expected, so that men are either grieved at unexpected evils actually pressing upon them, or are kept in suspense, and disquietude, and fear with respect to those which are impending.", "6909": "But the nature of God is free from grief, and exempt from fear, and enjoys an immunity from every kind of suffering, and is the only nature which possesses complete happiness and bless­ edness.", "6910": "Now to the disposition which makes this confession in sincerity, God is merciful, and compassionate, and kind, driving envy to a distance from him;", "6911": "and to it he gives a gift in return, to the full extent of the power of the person benefited to receive it, and he all but gives such a person this oracular warning, saying \"", "6912": "I well know that the whole species of joy and rejoicing is the possession of no other being but me, who am the Father of the universe;", "6913": "nevertheless, though it belongs to me, I have no objection to those who deserve it enjoying a share of it.", "6914": "But who can be deserving to do so, save he who obeys me and my will ?", "6915": "for to this man it shall be given to feel as little grief as possible and as little fear as possible, proceeding along that road which is inaccessible to passions and vices, but which is frequented by excellence of soul and virtue.\"", "6916": "And let no one fancy that that unmixed joy, which is without any alloy of sorrow, descends from heaven to the earth, but rather, that it is a combination of the two, that which is the better being predominant in the mixture ;", "6917": "in the same manner as the light in heaven is unalloyed and free from any admixture of darkness, but in the sublunary atmosphere it is mingled with dark air.", "6918": "For this reason, it seems to me to have been, that Sarah,* the namesake of virtue, who had previously laughed, denied her laughter to the person who questioned her as to the cause of it, fearing lest she might be deprived of her rejoicing, as belonging to no created being, but to God alone;", "6919": "on which account the holy Word encouraged her, and said, \" Be not afraid,\" thou hast laughed a genuine laugh, and thou hast a share in real joy;", "6920": "for the Father has not permitted the race of mankind to be wholly devoured by griefs, and sorrows, and incurable anguish, but has mingled in their existence something of a better nature, thinking it fitting that the soul should sometimes enjoy rest and tranquillity;", "6921": "and he has also designed that the souls of wise men should be pleased and delighted for the greater portion of their existence with the contemplation of the soul.", "6922": "XXXVII.", "6923": "This is enough to say about the piety of the man, though there is a vast abundance of other things which might be brought forward in praise of it.", "6924": "We must also investigate his skill and wisdom as displayed towards his fellow men;", "6925": "for it belongs to the same character to be pious towards God and affectionate towards man ;", "6926": "and both these qualities, of holiness towards God and justice towards man, are commonly seen in the same individual.", "6927": "Now it would take a long time to go through all the instances and actions which form this;", "6928": "but it is not out of place to record two or three.", "6929": "Abraham, being rich above most men in abundance of gold and silver, and having numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, and being equal in his affluence and abund­ ance to any of the men of the country, or of the original inhabitants, who were the most wealthy, and being, in fact, richer than any sojourner could be expected to be, was never unpopular with any of the people among whom he was dwelling, but was continually praised and beloved by all who had any acquaintance with him ;", "6930": "and if, as is often the case, any contention or quarrel arose between his ser­ vants and retinue and those of others, he always endea­ voured to terminate it quietly by his gentle disposition, discarding and driving to a distance from his soul all quarrelsome, and turbulent, and disorderly things.", "6931": "And there is no wonder, if he was such towards strangers, who might have agreed together and with a heavy and power­ ful hand have repelled him, if he had begun acts of violence, when he behaved with moderation towards those who were nearly related to him in blood, but very far removed from him in disposition, and who were desolate and isolated, and very inferior in wealth to himself, willingly allowing him­ self to be inferior to them in the very things in which he might have been superior;", "6932": "for there was his brother's son, when he departed from his country, who went forth with him, an inconstant, variable, whimsical man, inclining now to one side and now to another ;", "6933": "and at one time caressing him with friendly salutations, and at another, being restive and obstinate, by reason of the inequality of his disposi­ tion ;", "6934": "on which account his household also was a quarrel­ some and turbulent one, as it had no one to correct it, and especially his shepherds were so, because they were removed to a great distance from their master.", "6935": "Accordingly, they, in their self.", "6936": "willed manner, behaving as if they claimed complete liberty, were always quarrel­ ling with the managers of the flocks of the wise Abraham, who yielded a great many points, because of the gentle dis­ position of their master;", "6937": "in consequence of which, the shepherds of his nephew turned to folly and to shameless audacity, and gave way to anger, cherishing ill-temper, and exciting a spirit of irreconcilable enmity in their hearts, until they compelled those whom they injured to turn to their own defence;", "6938": "and when a somewhat violent battle had taken place, the good Abraham, hearing of the attack made by his servants on the others, though only in self­ defence, and knowing as he did that his own household was superior both in numbers and in power, would not allow the contest to be protracted till victory declared for his party, in order that he might not grieve his nephew by the defeat of his men;", "6939": "but standing between the two bodies of combatants, he, by his pacific speeches, reconciled the contending parties, and that not only for the moment, but for all future time too;", "6940": "for he knew that if they continued to dwell together, and to abide in the same place, they would be always differing in opinion and quar­ relling with one another, and continually raising up quar­ rels and wars with one another.", "6941": "In order that this might not be the case, he thought it desirable to abandon the custom of dwelling together, and to separate his habita­ tion from that of his nephew.", "6942": "So, sending for his nephew, he gave him the choice of the better country, cheerfully agreeing himself to abandon whatever portion the other selected, as he should thus acquire the greatest of all gains, namely, peace;", "6943": "and yet, what other man would ever have yielded in any point whatever to one weaker than himself, while he was stronger ?", "6944": "and who that was able to gain the victory would ever have been willing to be de­ feated, without availing himself of his power ?", "6945": "But this man alone placed the object of his desires, not in strength and superiority, but in a life free from dissension and blessed with tranquillity, as far as depended on himself;", "6946": "for which reason he appears the most admirable of all men.", "6947": "XXXVIII.", "6948": "Since then this panegyric, if taken lite­ rally, is applied to Abraham as a man, and since the dis­ position of the soul is here intimated, it will be well for us to investigate that also, after the fashion of those men who go from the letter to the spirit of any statement.", "6949": "Now there is an infinite variety of dispositions which arise from different circumstances and opportunities in every kind of action and event;", "6950": "but in this instance, we must distinguish between two characters, one of which is the elder and the other the younger.", "6951": "Now the elder of the two is that disposition which honours those things which are by nature principal and dominant;", "6952": "the younger is that which regards the things which are subject to others, and which are considered in the lowest rank.", "6953": "Now the principal and more dominant things are wisdom, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and every descrip­ tion of virtue, and the actions in accordance with virtue;", "6954": "the younger things are wealth, and authority, and glory, and nobility, not real nobility, but that which the multi­ tude think so, and all those other things which belong to the third class, next after the things of the soul, and the things of the body;", "6955": "the class which is in fact the last.", "6956": "Each then of these dispositions has, as it were, flocks and herds.", "6957": "The one which desires external things has for its flock, gold and silver, and all those things which are the materials and furniture of wealth ;", "6958": "and, moreover, arms, engines, triremes, armies of infantry and cavalry, and fleets of ships, and all kinds of provisions to procure dominion, by which firm authority is secured.", "6959": "But the lover of excellence has for his flock the doctrines of each individual virtue, and its speculations respecting wisdom.", "6960": "Moreover, there are overseers and superintend­ ents of each of these flocks, just as there are shepherds to flocks of sheep.", "6961": "Of the flock of external things, the superintendents are those who are fond of money, those who are fond of glory, those who are eager for war, and all those who love authority over multitudes.", "6962": "And the managers of the flock of things concerning the soul are all those who are lovers of virtue and of what is honour­ able, and who do not prefer spurious good things to genuine ones, but genuine to spurious good.", "6963": "There is therefore a certain natural contest between them, inasmuch as they have no opinions in common with one another, but are always at variance and difference respecting the matter which has of all others the greatest influence in the main­ tenance of life as it should be, that is to say, the judgment of what things are truly good.", "6964": "Now, for some time the soul was warred against by some enemy, and was full of this quarrelsome principle, inasmuch as it had not yet been completely pacified, but was still troubled by some passions and diseases which prevailed over sound reason.", "6965": "But from the time when it began to be more powerful, and with its superior force, to destroy the fortification of the opposite opinions, becoming elated and puffed up with pride, it in a most marvellous manner began to separate and detach the disposition in itself, which admires the external materials, and as if conversing with man, says to him, Thou art unable to dwell with-it is impossible that thou shouldest be connected by alliance with-a lover, of wisdom and virtue.", "6966": "Come, then, and migrating from thy present abode, depart to a distance, since you have no communion with me, and, indeed, cannot possibly have any.", "6967": "For all the things which you conceive to be on the right he imagines to be on the left;", "6968": "and on the contrary, whatever you think is on the left, is looked upon by him as on the right.", "6969": "XXXIX.", "6970": "Therefore the virtuous man was not only peaceful and a lover of justice, but also a man of courage and of a warlike disposition ;", "6971": "not for the sake of making war, for he was not of a contentious and quarrelsome character, but for the sake of a lasting peace for the future, which hitherto his adversaries had destroyed.", "6972": "And the most con­ vincing proof of this is to be found in what he did.", "6973": "Four great kings had received for their inheritance the eastern portion of the inhabited world ;", "6974": "and they were obeyed by all the eastern nations, both on this and on the other side of the Euphrates.", "6975": "Now all the other parts remained un­ harassed by contentions, obeying the commands of these kings, and contributing their yearly taxes and tribute with­ out seeking for any excuses ;", "6976": "but the land of the inhabitants of Sodom alone before it was destroyed by fire began to break the peace, having been designing to revolt for a long time.", "6977": "For as it was a very rich country it was ruled by five kings, who had divided the cities and the land among them, though the district was not an extensive one, but fertile in corn and trees, and abounding in all kinds of fruit.", "6978": "What then their size gives to other cities, that the excellence of its soil gives to Sodom;", "6979": "on which account it had many princes for lovers who admired its beauty.", "6980": "These, on all other occasions, had paid the appointed revenues to the collectors of the taxes, honouring and at the same time fearing those more powerful sovereigns of whom they were the viceroys.", "6981": "But when they were completely sated with good things, and when, as is ordinarily the case, satiety had begotten insolence, they, cherishing a pride beyond their power!", "6982": "began at first to lift up their heads and to become restive.", "6983": "Then, like wicked servants, they set upon their masters, trusting more to their factious spirit than to their strength.", "6984": "But their sovereigns, remembering their own nobleness and being fortified with superior power, went against them with great disdain, as if they would be able to defeat them by the mere cry of battle.", "6985": "And having engaged them in battle, they in a moment put some of them to flight, and others they slew in the flight, and so they destroyed their army to a man.", "6986": "And also they led away a vast multitude captive, which they distributed among themselves with much other booty.", "6987": "Moreover, they led away captive the brother's son of the wise Abraham, who had a little while before emigrated into one of the cities of the Pentapolis.", "6988": "XL.", "6989": "This was communicated to Abraham by some one of those who escaped from the defeat of his countrymen, and it grieved him exceedingly, and he would not be quiet any longer, being much concerned at what had happened, and mourning more for him alive and in captivity than if he had heard that he had been killed.", "6990": "For he knew that death (τελετὴ) as its very name imports, was the end τέλος) of all living beings, and especially of the wicked, and that there are innumerable unexpected evils which lie, as it were, in ambush for the living.", "6991": "But when he was preparing to pursue them for the purpose of delivering his brother's son, he found himself in want of allies, inasmuch as he himself was a stranger and a sojourner and as no one could dare to oppose the irresistible power of such mighty monarchs flushed with recent victory.", "6992": "And he devised for himself a most novel alliance.", "6993": "For necessity is the mother of invention, and expedients are found in the most difficult circumstances when a man has set his heart on just and humane objects.", "6994": "For having collected together all his servants, and ordering the slaves whom he had purchased to remain at home (for he was afraid of desertion on their part), he assembled all his domestic servants, and divided them into centuries, and marched forward in their battalions;", "6995": "not, indeed, trusting to them, for his was still a most insignificant force, in com­ parison with that of the king's, but placing his confidence in the champion and defender of the just, namely in God.", "6996": "Therefore putting forth all his exertions he hastened on, in nowise relaxing his speed, until, watching his oppor­ tunity, he fell upon the enemy by night, after they had supped, and when they were just on the point of betaking themselves to sleep.", "6997": "And some he slew in their beds, and those who were arrayed against him he utterly destroyed, and with great vigour he defeated them all, more by the courage of his soul than by the adequacy of his means.", "6998": "And he did not cease from attacking them until lie had utterly destroyed the hostile army with their kings, and slain them all to a man in front of their camp, and had brought back his brother's son after this splendid and most glorious victory, bringing back also as fair booty all their cavalry, and all the multitude of their beasts of burden, and a most enormous quantity of spoil.", "6999": "And when the great high priest of the most high God beheld him returning and coming back loaded with trophies, in safety himself, with all his own force uninjured, for he had not lost one single man of all those who went out with him ;", "7000": "marvelling at the greatness of the exploit, and, as was very natural, considering that he had never met with this success but through the favour of the divine wisdom and alliance, he raised his hands to heaven, and honoured him with prayers in his behalf, and offered up sacrifices of thanksgiving for his victory, and splendidly feasted all those who had had a share in the expedition;", "7001": "rejoicing and sym­ pathising with

"7006": "But as many as are able to contemplate the facts related in them in their incorporeal and naked state, living rather in the soul than in the body, will say that of the nine kings the four are the powers of the four passions which exist within us, the passion of pleasure, of desire, of fear, and of grief;", "7007": "and that the other five kings are the outward senses, being equal in number, the sense of sight, of hearing, of smell, of taste, and of touch.", "7008": "For these in some degree are sovereigns and rulers, having acquired a certain power over us, but not all to an equal extent;", "7009": "for the five are subordinate to the four, and are compelled to pay them taxes and tribute, such as are appointed by nature.", "7010": "For it is from the things which we see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or touch, that pleasures, and pains, and fears, and desires arise;", "7011": "as there is no one of the passions which has any power to exist of itself, if it were not supplied by the materials furnished by the outward senses.", "7012": "For it is in these things that their powers consist, either in figures and in colours, or in the faculty of speaking or hearing which depends on the voice, or in flavours, or in odours, or by the subjects of touch, whether they are soft or hard, or rough, or smooth, or hot, or cold.", "7013": "For all these things are supplied to each of the passions by means of the outward senses.", "7014": "And as long as the taxes beforementioned are paid the alliance among the kings remains ;", "7015": "but when they are no longer contributed, as they were before, then immediately do quarrels and wars arise.", "7016": "And this appears to happen when painful old age supervenes, in which none of the passions becomes weaker, but rather perhaps stronger than their ancient power;", "7017": "but the sight becomes dim, and the ears hard of hearing, and every one of the other out­ ward senses more blunt, being no longer equally able as before to judge and decide accurately of every subject sub­ mitted to them, nor any longer to pay a tribute which will be equal to the number of the passions.", "7018": "So that it happened very naturally that they being thoroughly exhausted and laid prostrate by them were easily put to flight by the adverse passions ;", "7019": "and the statement that follows is in strict consistency with what might be naturally expected, namely, that of the five kings two fell into wells, and three took to flight.", "7020": "For touch and taste reach to the very deepest portions of the body, sending down into the entrails those things which are suitable for diges­ tion ;", "7021": "but the eyes, and the ears, and the smell, roaming abroad for the most part, escape the slavery of the body.", "7022": "The good man—threatening to attack all of these, when he saw that those who had lately been friends and con­ federates were now in a state of.", "7023": "disease, and that there was

instead of lawlessness and injustice, which had prevailed up to that time.", "7025": "And what its here said is not a cunningly devised fable, but is rather one of the most completely true facts, which may be seen to be true in our own selves.", "7026": "For it very often happens that the outward senses observe a sort of confederacy which they have formed with the passions, supplying them with objects perceptible by the outward senses ;", "7027": "and very often also, they raise contentions, no longer choosing to pay the tribute fairly due from them, or else being unable to do so, by reason of the presence of corrective reason ;", "7028": "which when it has taken up its complete armour, namely, the virtues, and their doctrines and contemplations, which form an irresistible power, conquers all things in the most vigorous manner.", "7029": "For it is not lawful for perishable things to dwell with what is immortal.", "7030": "Therefore the nine sovereignties of the four passions and the five outward senses are both perishable themselves and also the causes of mortality.", "7031": "But the truly sacred and divine word, which uses the virtues as a starting place, being placed in the number ten, that perfect number, when it descends into the contest and exerts that more vigorous power which it has in accordance with God, subdues by main force all the aforesaid powers.",

her endurance of want and scarcity, and in her accompanying him in his warlike expeditions.", "7035": "For she was always with him at all times, and in all places, never being absent from any spot, or failing to share any of his fortune, being truly the partner of his life, and of all the circumstances of his life;", "7036": "judging it right equally to share all his good and evil fortune together

desisted from all connection with her, by reason of his natural continence, and also of the honour in which he held his wife.", "7057": "So then he speedily had a son by this handmaid, but at a very distant period after this he had also a legitimate son, after he and his wife had both despaired of any offspring from one another.", "7058": "The bounteous God having thus bestowed on them a reward

of the wise man himself are more numerous, some of which I have lately enumerated.", "7062": "Moreover I will mention also one circumstance connected with the death of the wife, which ought not to be buried in silence.", "7063": "For when Abraham had lost such a partner of his whole life, as our account has shown her to have been, and as the scriptures testify that she was, he still like a wrestler prevailed over the grief which attacked him and threatened to overwhelm his soul;", "7064": "strengthening and encouraging with great virtue and reso­ lution, reason, the natural adversary of the passions, which indeed he had always taken as a counsellor during the whole of his life ;", "7065": "but at this time above all others, he thought fit to be guided by it, when it was giving him the best and most expedient advice.", "7066": "And the advice was this;", "7067": "not to afflict himself beyond all measure, as if he were stricken down with a novel and unprecedented calamity;",

sharp-sighted than a falcon or an eagle ?", "7100": "And what man is so richly endowed with the sense of hearing as that stupidest of all animals, the ass ?", "7101": "Also what man is more accurate in his sense of smell than a hound, who huntsmen say can trace out by means of his n se animals who are lying at a distance, and can run up to them with perfect correctness, and course, though he has not seen them;", "7102": "for what sight is to other animals that is the sense of smell to hounds and to all the dogs which pursue game.", "7103": "Moreover, the greater part of the irrational animals enjoy excellent health, and are as far as possible entirely exempt from disease.", "7104": "And also in any competition in respect of beauty, some things which are even destitute of vitality, ap­ pear to me to surpass the elegance of either men or women;", "7105": "as, for instance, images, and statues, and pictures, and in a word all the works of either the pictorial or plastic art which arrive at excellence in either branch, and which are the ob­ jects of study and desire both to Greeks and barbarians, who erect them in the most conspicuous places for the orna­ ment of their cities.", "7106":

all things, who is able to do everything but who wills only to do what is best.", "7108": "For as men who are going along a slippery road stumble and fall, but they who proceed by a dry, and level,

let all recollec­ tion of these visions which have appeared to you be for­ gotten, and let them pass from your mind ;", "7157": "for to hope and expect a superiority over those of your family and kindred, is a detestable thing in my opinion, and I think, indeed, in that of every one else, who has any regard for equality and the principles of justice that subsist among kinsmen.", "7158": "\"But his father, being afraid lest from his meeting with his brothers there might arise some quarrel and disturbance with them, inasmuch as they bore ill will against him on account of the dreams which he had seen, sent them away to keep their flocks at a distance, but retained him at home till a fitting season, knowing that time is said to be a power­ ful physician for all the passions and diseases of the soul, and a remover of grief, and an extinguisher of anger, and a healer of fear;", "7159": "for it softens and mitigates everything, even such things as are, according to their own nature, hard to be cured.", "7160": "But when he conjectured that no hatred was any longer abiding in their hearts he sent this his son forth to salute his brethren, and also to bring him word how they and their flocks of sheep were.", "7161": "III.", "7162": "This expedition of his was the origin both of great evils and also of great good, each of them being excessive beyond all expectation ;", "7163": "for he, obeying the commands of his parents, went to visit his brethren ;", "7164": "but they, seeing him coming towards them while at a great distance, conversed one with another, saying nothing of good omen, inasmuch as they did not choose even to call him by his name, but called him a dreamer, and a seer of visions, and such appellations as these.", "7165": "And to such a height did they carry their rage that (1 will not say all of them, but) the greater portion of them plotted his death;", "7166": "and designed, after having slain him, for the sake of not being detected, to throw him into a deep pit dug in the earth, for there are a great many such places in that district dug as receptacles for the rain water.", "7167": "And they were very near incurring that most ex­ cessive pollution of fratricide, as they would have done if they had not been, though with difficulty, persuaded by the advice of their eldest brother, who counselled them not to meddle with such a pollution but merely to cast him into one of these pits, thinking then to contrive some means of saving him, so that when they had all departed he might send him back again to his father without having suffered any harm.", "7168": "And after they agreed to this he came forward and saluted them;", "7169": "and they took him as though he had been an enemy, and stripped him of all his garments, and let him down into a vast pit, and then, having stained his cloak with the blood of a kid, they sent it to their father on the pretence that he had been slain by a wild beast.", "7170": "IY.", "7171": "But on that day it happened by some chance that certain merchants who were accustomed to convey their merchandise from Arabia to Egypt were travelling that way, and so the eleven brethren drew Joseph up out of the pit and sold him to them;", "7172": "the one of them who was the fourth in respect of age instigating this contrivance ;", "7173": "for in my opinion, he was afraid lest his brother might be treacherously slain by the others, who had conceived an irreconcilable hatred against him, and therefore he pro­ posed that he should be sold, substituting slavery for death, the lighter evil for the greater.", "7174": "But the eldest, for he was not present when he was sold, looking down into the pit, and not seeing him whom lie had left there a short time before, cried out and lamented loudly, and rent his clothes, and tossed his hands up and down like a madman, and beat his breast and tore his hair, saying, \" What has become of him ?", "7175": "Tell me, is he alive, or is he dead ?", "7176": "If he is dead, show me his corpse that I may weep over his body, and so al­ leviate my grief.", "7177": "When I see him lying dead I shall be com­ forted ;", "7178": "for why should we bear ill will to the dead ?", "7179": "There is no envy excited against those who are out of sight.", "7180": "And if he is alive, to what country has he departed ?", "7181": "Where is he kept ?", "7182": "for I am not, as he was, an object of suspicion, so as to be distrusted by you.\"", "7183": "And when they replied that he had been sold, and when they showed him the money which they had received for him, he said, “ A fine trade, indeed, you have been driving ?", "7184": "Let us divide the gain:", "7185": "let us wear crowns of victory after thus rivalling the slave-dealers, and bearing off from them the prizes of iniquity;", "7186": "we may well pride ourselves now that we have surpassed them in barbarity, for they indeed traffic in the liberty of strangers, but we in that of those who are most nearly related to and most dear to us.", "7187": "Surely here is newly contrived a great disgrace and a shame which will be known far and wide.", "7188": "Our fathers left be­ hind them in every part of the world memorials of their virtue and excellence;", "7189": "we shall leave behind us the guilt of a charge of faithlessness and treacherous inhumanity which can never be effaced ;", "7190": "for the reputation of extraordinary actions penetrates everywhere ;", "7191": "those which are praiseworthy being admired, and those which are blameable meeting with blame and accusation.", "7192": "In what manner now will our father receive the news of what has happened ?", "7193": "You will now, as far as depends upon us, have made the life of him who has hitherto been wonderfully happy and fortunate, not worth living;", "7194": "which will he pity, the child who has been sold, for his slavery ?", "7195": "or those who have sold him, for their inhumanity ?", "7196": "I am sure he will pity us much the most;", "7197": "since to do wrong is a more terrible evil than to suffer wrong, for the one has for an alleviation two consolations of the greatest influence, hope and pity ;", "7198": "but the other is destitute of both these miti­ gations, and is more unfortunate in the judgment of every one.", "7199": "But why do I mourn and bewail in this manner?", "7200": "It is better for me to be silent, lest I too should be treated in some terrible manner;", "7201": "for ye are most merciless men in your dispositions, and implacable ;", "7202": "and the rage which was kindled in each of you is still furious and vehement.", "7203": "V.", "7204": "But when their father heard, not the truth indeed, that his son had been sold, but a falsehood that he was dead, and that he had been slain by wild beasts, he was smitten in his ears by the news that was reported to him, and in his eyes by what was shown to him (for they brought to him his son's coat rent and torn and defiled with quanti­ ties of blood);", "7205": "and being wholly bewildered by the exceed­ ing greatness of the calamity, he lay for a long time without speaking, not being able even to lift up his head, the cala­ mity overwhelming and completely prostrating him;", "7206": "then suddenly pouring forth as it were a stream of tears with bitter lamentations, he bedewed his cheeks, and his ehin, and his breast, and all the garments on his chest, saying at the same time sueh words as these, \" It is not thy death that grieves me, 0 my son, but such a tomb as has fallen to your lot;", "7207": "for if you had been buried in your own land I should have been comforted;", "7208": "I would have cherished you, I would have tended you in siekness if you had died before me, I would have given you my last embrace, I would have closed your eyes, I would have wept over your dead body lying before me, I would have buried you sumptuously, I would have omitted none of the customary observances.", "7209": "\"Again, even if you had died in a foreign land, I should have said, nature has claimed what was due to, and what belonged to her;", "7210": "and therefore, 0 my mind, be not east down ;", "7211": "for living men have indeed their separate countries, but the whole earth is the grave of the dead;", "7212": "and all men are destined to a speedy death;", "7213": "for even the longest lived man is but short lived if compared with eternity;", "7214": "but if it was necessary that he should die violently and by treachery, it would have been a lighter evil to me for him to have been slain by men, who would have laid out his corpse, and have pitied him so far as to scatter dust over him, and at least to have concealed his body;", "7215": "and even if they had been the most merciless of all people, what more could they have done than have thrown him out unburied, and so got rid of him ?", "7216": "And then perhaps, some one of the passers by on the road, standing by, and beholding him, and conceiving pity for our common nature, would have thought him worthy of some care, and of burial;", "7217": "but now, as the saying is, 0 my son, thou hast become a feast, and a banquet for savage and carnivorous wild beasts, who will eat and devour thy bowels ;", "7218": "I am compelled to endure distresses whieh I never had imagined, I am without any cause practised in enduring many miseries;", "7219": "I am a wanderer, a stranger, a slave, living under compulsion, having even my very life plotted against by those whom it least became to do so.", "7220": "And I have seen many things, and I have heard many things, and I have suffered many things, all of which have been incurable evils, which however I have learnt to bear with moderation, so as not to yield to them.\"", "7221": "But nothing has ever happened more intolerable than this misfortune which has now befallen me ;", "7222": "which has consumed and destroyed all the vigour of my soul;", "7223": "for what can be a greater or more pitiable calamity ?", "7224": "The garment of my child has been brought to me, who am his father;", "7225": "but of him himself there is no portion brought, not a limb, not a small fragment, but he has been wholly and entirely destroyed and devoured, not being able even to receive burial;", "7226": "and it seems to me that even his garment would never have been sent to me at all if it had not been by way of a reminder of my grief, and as a refreshment of my memory as to the sufferings which he endured, so as to afflict me with a never to be forgotten and never ending sorrow.", "7227": "He indeed bewailed his son in these terms ;", "7228": "but the merchants sold his son in Egypt to one of the king's eunuchs who was his chief cook.", "7229": "VI.", "7230": "It is worth while, however, after having thus explained the literal account given to us of these events, to proceed to explain also the figurative meaning concealed under that account;", "7231": "for we say that nearly all, or that at all events, the greater part of the history of the giving of the law is full of allegories;", "7232": "now the disposition which we have at present under consideration, is called by the Hebrews Joseph;", "7233": "but the name being interpreted in the Greek language means, \" the addition of the Lord,\" a name most felicitously given, and most appropriate to the account given of the person so called;", "7234": "for the democratic constitution in vogue among states is an addition of nature which has sovereign authority over everything;", "7235": "for this world is a sort of large state, and has one constitution, and one law, and the word of nature enjoins what one ought to do, and forbids what one ought not to do:", "7236": "but the cities themselves in their several situations are unlimited in number, and enjoy different constitutions, and laws which are not all the same;", "7237": "for there are different customs and established regulations found out and established in different nations;", "7238": "and the cause of this the want of union, and participation existing not merely between the Greeks and the barbarians, or between the barbarians and the Greeks, but also between the different tribes of each of these respective nations.", "7239": "Then they, as it would seem, blaming those things which do not deserve blame, such as unexpected occurrences or opportunities, deficiency of crops, badness of soil, their own situation either as being by the sea-side, or inland, or insular, or on the continent, or anything of that sort, are silent as to the real truth.", "7240": "The real truth is their covetousness, their want of good faith towards and confidence in one another, on which account they have not been satisfied with the laws of nature, but have called those regulations, which have ap­ peared to be for the common advantage of the agreeing and unanimous multitudes, laws, so that the individual constitu­ tions do naturally appear rather in the light of additions to the one great general constitution of nature;", "7241": "for the laws of individual cities are additions to the one right reason of nature;", "7242": "and so also the man who is occupied with political affairs is an addition to the man who lives in accordance with nature.", "7243": "VII.", "7244": "And it is not without a particular and correct mean­ in,, that Joseph is said to have had a coat of many colours.", "7245": "For a political constitution is a many-coloured and multi­ form thing, admitting of an infinite variety of changes in its general appearance, in its affairs, in its moving causes, in the peculiar laws respecting strangers, in numberless differ­ ences respecting times and places.", "7246": "For as the master of a ship collects together all the moans which may tend to ensure him a favourable voyage with reference to and in dependency on the changes of the wind, not always guiding his vessel in one and the same way;", "7247": "and as a physician does not apply one and the same means of cure to every sick person, nor even to one person if his disease varies in its character, but watches the periods of its abatement, and of its intensity, and of its becoming full or empty, and the alterations of the causes of the sickness, and so varies his remedies as much as possible to secure the safety of his patient, applying one remedy at one time and another at another;", "7248": "in the same manner I conceive that the man immersed in political affairs is of necessity a multiform man, assuming many different appearances, one in time of peace and another in time of war;", "7249": "and a different cha­ racter according as those who are opposed to him are numerous or few in number, withstanding a small number with vigorous resolution, but using persuasion and gentle means towards a large body.", "7250": "And in some cases where there is much danger, still for the sake of the common advantage he will take the place of every one, and manage the business in hand by himself;", "7251": "in other cases, where it is merely a question of labour he will let others minister to him as his assistants.", "7252": "It was appropriately said that the man was sold.", "7253": "For the haranguer of the people and the demagogue, mounting the tribunal, like slaves who are being sold and exposed to view, is a slave instead of a free man, by reason of the honours which he seems to be receiving, being led away by ten thousand masters ?", "7254": "The same person is also represented as having been torn by wild beasts;", "7255": "and vainglory, which lies in wait for a man, is an untameable wild beast, tearing and destroying all who give into it.", "7256": "And they who have been purchasers are likewise sellers ;", "7257": "for there is one master only to the citizens who live in any city;", "7258": "but there is a multitude of masters, one succeeding another in a certain succession and regular order.", "7259": "But those who have been sold three times change their masters like bad slaves, not remaining with their original ones, by reason of the speedily satisfied irregularity of their dispositions, always thirsting after novelty.", "7260": "VIII.", "7261": "This is enough to say on this part of the subject.", "7262": "Accordingly, the young man, having been conducted into Egypt, and there, as has already been stated, having become the slave of a eunuch, gave in a few days such proofs of virtue and excellence of disposition, that he had authority over his fellow servants given to him, and the management of the whole household committed to his charge ;", "7263": "for already his master had learnt by many circumstances to perceive that his servant in all his words and in all his actions was under the immediate direction of divine providence.", "7264": "Accordingly, in consequence of this opinion of his purchaser, he was appointed superintendent of his house, apparently indeed by his master, but, in fact and reality, by nature her­ self, which procured for him the government of a mighty city, and nation, and country.", "7265": "For it was necessary that one who was destined to be a statesman should be previously practised and trained in the management of a single house­ hold ;", "7266": "for a household is a city on a small and contracted scale, and the management of a household is a contracted kind of polity;", "7267": "so that a city may be called a large house, and the government of a city a widely spread economy.", "7268": "And from these considerations we may see that the manager of a household and the governor of a state are identical, though the multitude and magnitude of the things com­ mitted to their charge may be different, as is the case too with the arts of painting and statuary;", "7269": "for the good statuary or painter, whether he is making many and colossal figures, or only few and those of a small size, is still the same person, and the art which he is practising is the same art.", "7270": "IX.", "7271": "But while he is earning a very high reputation in the matters connected with the management of his master's house, he is plotted against by the wife of his master, because of the incontinent love which she had conceived for him;", "7272": "for she, being maddened by the beauty of the young man, and being unable to restrain the violence of her frenzy and passion, addressed a proposal of illicit intercourse to him;", "7273": "but he resisted it vigorously, and would not at all endure to approach her, by reason of the orderly and temperate dis­ position implanted in him by nature and habit.", "7274": "But when she, inflaming and exciting her lawless desire, kept con­ tinually tempting him, and continually throwing herself in his way, and continually failing in her object, she at last, in the violence of her passion, had recourse to force, and seizing hold of his cloak dragged him vigorously towards the bed, her passion endowing her strength with greater vigour, as it often does strengthen even the weak.", "7275": "But he, proving more powerful than even the alluring opportunity, uttered a cry becoming a free man, and worthy of his race, saying, What are you forcing me to ?", "7276": "We, the descendants of the Hebrews, are guided by special customs and laws of our own;", "7277": "in other nations the youths are permitted, after they are fourteen years of ago, to use concubines and prostitutes, and women who make gain by their persons, without restraint.", "7278": "But among us a harlot is not allowed even to live, but death is appointed as a punishment for any one who adopts such a way of life.", "7279": "Therefore, before our lawful marriage we know nothing of any connection with any other woman, but, with­ out ever having experienced any similar cohabitation, we approach our virgin brides as pure as themselves, proposing as the end of our marriage not pleasure but the offspring of legitimate children.", "7280": "I therefore, having kept myself pure to this day, will not begin now to transgress the law by adultery which is the greatest of all sins, when I ought rather, even if ,in past time I had lived in an irregular manner, and had been led away by the impulses of youth, and had imitated the licen­ tiousness of the natives, still not to seek to pollute the marriage of another man, an offence which who is there who would not avenge with blood ?", "7281": "For though different nations differ in other points, still all agree in this alone, that all men think him worthy of ten thousand deaths who does so, and give up the man who is detected in adultery without trial to the husband who has detected him.", "7282": "But you, pressing me thus to load myself with guilt, would add even a third pollution in my case, since you bid me not merely commit adultery, but also to violate my mistress and my master's wife, unless, indeed, this is to be looked upon as the reason for which I entered your house, that I might neglect the duties which a servant ought to perform, and get drunk, and become intoxicated with hopes fit for my master who has bought me, polluting his marriage, and his house and his family.", "7283": "Nevertheless I am induced to honour him not merely as my master, but also as one who has before now been my benefactor.", "7284": "He has committed to my care the whole management of his household;", "7285": "there is nothing whatever, be it great or small, which is withdrawn from my superin­ tendence, except you who are his wife.", "7286": "In return for these kindnesses is it fitting for me to requite him with such an action as you recommend to me ?", "7287": "I will rather, as becomes me, endeavour with honourable service to requite the kind­ ness of which he has set me the example, and which is due to him.", "7288": "He, being my master, has made me, who was a captive and a slave, a free man and a citizen by his great goodness, as far at least as depended on him;", "7289": "and shall I, who am a slave, compare myself to my master as if he were a stranger and a captive ?", "7290": "And with what disposition can I commit this unholy action ?", "7291": "and with what face can I be impudent enough to look upon him ?", "7292": "The consciousness of guilt which I shall have contracted will not suffer me to look him in the face, even if I should be able to be undis­ covered, but in fact I shall never escape detection, for there are innumerable witnesses of all the things which are done privily who may not be silent.", "7293": "I forbear to say that, even if no one else should know it, or being privy to it should not divulge it, still I never­ theless shall be a witness against myself by my complexion, by my look, by my voice, as I said a little while ago, being convicted by my own conscience ;", "7294": "and if no one else informs against me, shall I not fear nor respect, justice the assessor of God, and the overlooker of all human actions ?X.", "7295": "He put all these arguments together and philoso­ phised in this way till she ceased to importune him;", "7296": "for the desires are powerful, to cast in the shade even the most powerful of the outward senses, which he, being aware of, fled from them, leaving his garment in her hands, as she had seized hold of him.", "7297": "This circumstance gave her an opportunity to contrive a story, and to invent a plausible tale against the young man, by means of which she might revenge herself on him;", "7298": "for when her husband came from the public assembly, she, pretending to play the part of a modest and orderly woman, even among the intemperate habits by which she was surrounded, said to him, with excessive indignation, \" You brought a servant into us, a slave of the Hebrews, who has not only corrupted his soul, since you, in a simple manner without due inquiry, com­ mitted your household to him, but has even dared to assault my body.", "7299": "For he was not contented with seducing only his fellow servants, inasmuch as he has become a most lascivious and debauched man, but he has attempted to defile even me, his mistress, and to use force to me;", "7300": "and the proofs of his insane lust are visible and clear ;", "7301": "for when, having been very ill-treated by him, I cried out, calling to my aid assistants from within;", "7302": "he fled, from fear of being apprehended.", "7303": "\"And showing his garment, she appeared to give a proof of the truth of what she said;", "7304": "and his master thinking that it was true, ordered his officers to conduct the man to prison, erring in two most important points :", "7305": "first, that with­ out giving him any time to defend himself, he, without a trial, condemned one who had done no wrong, as if he had com­ mitted the greatest crimes;", "7306": "secondly, because the garment which the woman displayed as having been left behind bv the young man, was indeed a proof of violence, but not of that which he had committed, but rather of that which had been offered to him, and of the fortitude with which he endured it from the woman ;", "7307": "for if he had been offering violence, it was probable that he might have laid hold of the garment of his mistress ;", "7308": "but it was owing to his having had violence offered to him that he was deprived of his own.", "7309": "But perhaps he should be pardoned for his excessive igno­ rance, inasmuch as he lived chiefly in the cook's house, being filled with blood, and smoke, and ashes, his reasoning having no opportunity to become tranquillized and to enjoy leisure in itself, because it was confused still more, or, at all events, not less than the body.", "7310": "XI.", "7311": "I have already sketched out three characters of the man immersed in civil business ;", "7312": "that of him who is occupied as a shepherd, that of the regulator of a house, and that of the man possessed of fortitude :", "7313": "and we have now discussed the two first of these sufficiently.", "7314": "But the temperate man is no less connected with the regulation of political affairs than those two are;", "7315": "for tem­ perance is a beneficial and saving thing for all the affairs of life;", "7316": "and in affairs of state it is most especially so, as those who wish to understand the matter may learn from nume­ rous and easily obtained proofs.", "7317": "For who is there who does not know that great calamities have befallen nations, and districts, and whole countries all over the world, both by land and sea, in consequence of intemperance ;", "7318": "for the most numerous and most serious wars have been kindled on account of love, and adultery, and the wiles of women;", "7319": "by which the most numerous and most excellent portion both of the Grecian and barbarian race has been destroyed, and the youth of the cities has perished.", "7320": "And of the conse­ quences of intemperance, are domestic seditions, and wars, and evils upon evils in unutterable number.", "7321": "It is plain that the consequences of temperance, are stability, and peace, and the acquisition and enjoyment of perfect bless­ ings.", "7322": "XII.", "7323": "It is worth while, however, to proceed in regular order, and by this course to exhibit what is intended to be intimated by'this figurative history.", "7324": "The man who brought this servant of whom we are speaking is said to have been a eunuch;", "7325": "very naturally, for the multitude which pur­ chases the services of a man skilful in affairs of state is truly a eunuch, having in appearance, indeed, the organs of generation, but being deprived of all the power requisite for generating;", "7326": "just as those persons who have a confused sight though they have eyes, are nevertheless deprived of the active use of them, inasmuch as they are not able to see clearly.", "7327": "What, then, is the resemblance of eunuchs to the multitude ?", "7328": "That the multitude too is unable to generate wisdom, but that it studies virtue ;", "7329": "for when a multitude of men, brought promiscuously together from all quarters and of different races, meets in the same place, what is said in­ deed may be proper and becoming, but what is intended and what is done is quite the contrary;", "7330": "since the multi­ tude embraces what is spurious in preference to what is genuine, because it is carried away by false opinion, and has not studied what is truly honourable.", "7331": "On which account (though it seems a most unnatural thing), a wife is represented as cohabiting with this eunuch ;", "7332": "for the multitudes court desire, as a man courts a woman ;", "7333": "for the sake of which it says and does everything, making it its counsellor in everything which should and should not be spoken, trifling or important, being not at all accustomed to attend to considerations of calm wisdom;", "7334": "therefore the sacred historian very appropriately calls him the chief cook.", "7335": "For as a cook studies nothing beyond the insatiable and im­ moderate pleasures of the belly, in the same manner the multitude, which is occupied with public affairs, studies only those pleasures and allurements which are conveyed by means of the hearing, by which the energies of the mind are relaxed, as one may say the nerves of the soul are in a man­ ner loosened.", "7336": "And who is there who is not aware of the great quarrel which exists between physicians and cooks;", "7337": "since the first exert all their diligence and ingenuity in preparing things which are salutary, even if they are not pleasant;", "7338": "but the others, on the contrary, prepare only what is pleasant, dis­ regarding what is advantageous ?", "7339": "Therefore, the laws which exist among a people and those who govern in accordance with the laws resemble physicians, and so also do those counsellors and judges who have a regard to the common safety and security of the state, and who use no flattery to the people.", "7340": "But the chief body of the younger men resem­ bles cooks;", "7341": "for their object is not to supply what will be beneficial to the people, but only to contrive for the present moment to reap gratification.", "7342": "XIII.", "7343": "And the desire of the multitude, like an inconti­ nent woman, loves the man who is experienced in state affairs, and says to him:", "7344": "Go forth, my good man, unto the multitude among which you are dwelling, and forget all your own individual disposition, and the pursuits, and dis­ courses, and actions in which you have been brought up.", "7345": "And be guided by me, and attend to me, and do every thing which is agreeable to me;", "7346": "for I cannot endure any thing that is austere and obstinate, and foolishly fond of truth, and pertinaciously adhering to justice, which puts on an air of importance and dignity on all occasions, which yields in no point, and never proposes to itself any object but plain expediency, without any thought of gratifying the hearers.", "7347": "And you do not know the innumerable calumnies which some persons load you with, uttering them to my husband and your master, the multitude;", "7348": "for up to this time you appear to me to have been behaving like a free man, and you seem not at all to know that you are the slave of a very tyrannical master.", "7349": "But if you had understood that independence of action belongs to a free man, but obedience to the orders of others to a slave, you would then, laying aside your self-willed obstinacy, have learnt to look upon me who am his wife, being desire, and to do every thing with a reference

unproductive of every thing which is most necessary, such as modesty, temperance, continence, justice, and every kind of virtue.", "7622": "For there is no one thing so hostile to another as pleasure is to virtue, for the sake of which most people neglect all those matters which alone it is worth while to attend to, gratifying their unrestrained appetites, and sub­ mitting to all the commands

the chief baker and the chief butler, since eating and drink­ ing are of all the things which are useful to life those which have the greatest power to keep the being together, and those who have the management of those things, if they bestow great care upon them, do very justly obtain praise;", "7625": "while, if they neglect them, they are thought worthy of anger or punishment.", "7626": "But there is a difference in their punishments, because the need of the two things is different;", "7627": "that of food being the most indispensable, but that of wine not being very useful;", "7628":

who has erred in the least import­ ant particular.", "7630": "But the offences of the chief baker admit of no reconciliation and of no forgiveness, but incur an anger which leads to death, as he has been guilty of wrong in the most necessary matters;", "7631": "for want of food is followed by death.", "7632": "On which account he who has erred on these points very appropriately is put to death by hanging, suffer­ ing an evil similar to that which he has inflicted;", "7633": "for lie also has hanged, and suffocated, and stretched out the famishing man by means of hunger.", "7634": "XXVII.",

went forth in order to become acquainted with all the natives, and investigated all the laws that were established in the different cities, and caused a great affec­ tion for himself to arise in the breasts of those who saw him, not only because of the services which he conferred upon every one of them, but also by the unspeakable and unrivalled graces of his appearance and by the courtesy with which he associated with them.", "7637": "But when, in accord­ ance with the interpretation of the dreams, the first seven years of fertility arrived, he collected one-fifth of the pro­ duce every year by means of his subordinate officers and others who were employed under him in the public offices, and by this means he collected such a vast quantity of sheaves of corn as no one recollected as having ever existed at any previous time.", "7638": "And the most evident proof of this is that they could not possibly be counted, even although thousands and thousands of persons were occupied in the task, whose sole business it was to devote all their energies to count them.", "7639": "And when these seven years had passed, during which the plain of Egypt was fertile, the famine began, which, as it proceeded and increased, was not confined to Egypt;", "7640": "for as it became diffused, and from time to time extended, so as to be always comprehending fresh cities and countries in suc­ cession, it reached to the farthest borders of the land, both in the eastern and western direction, so as to reach at last over the whole world all around.", "7641": "Accordingly, it is said that no general pestilence ever extended so widely, not even that which the sons of the physicians call the creeping pestilence ;", "7642": "” for that also attacks all parts at once, and pro­ ceeding onwards rapidly like fire, utterly and completely devours the whole mass of the ulcerated body.", "7643": "Accordingly, they selected the men of the highest reputation in every district, and sent them into Egypt to procure corn ;", "7644": "for already the prudence of the young man was celebrated in all quarters, who had thus provided abundant food against a time of necessity.", "7645": "And he at first commanded all the treasure-houses to be opened, calculating that he should make the people more cheerful when they had beheld the store that was provided, and that in some degree he should be feeding their souls rather than their bodies on good hopes.", "7646": "After that, by means of those to whom the office of regulating the distribution of corn was committed, he sold it to all who wished to buy, keeping a constant eye on the future, and seeing what was impending even more clearly than the present.", "7647": "XXVIII.", "7648": "And at this crisis, his father also,* since his necessary food had by this time become scarce, not being aware of the good fortune of his son, sent ten of his sons to buy food, keeping the youngest at home, who was the uterine and own brother of the king's lieutenant.", "7649": "And they, when they had arrived in Egypt, met their brother as if he were a stranger, and being amazed at the dignity with which they beheld him surrounded, they addressed him with prostration according to the ancient fashion, their dreams now receiving confirmation and fulfilment.", "7650": "And he, when he beheld those who had sold him, immediately recognised them all, though he was not in the least recognised by any one of them himself, since God was not yet willing to reveal the truth on account of some necessary causes which at that time it was better should be buried in silence ;", "7651": "and therefore he either altered the countenance of their brother who governed the country, so as to give him a more dignified appearance, or else he perverted the accurate judgment of the mind of those who beheld him.", "7652": "But he acted not like a young man who, being the lieu­ tenant and magistrate invested with such extensive powers, and having attained to the authority next to that of the king himself, to whom the east and west looked up, and elated with the pride of manhood and the vastness of his authority, might, now that the opportunity of revenge had presented itself, have shown his remembrance of the ill-treat­ ment which he had received;", "7653": "but he bore what happened with self-restraint, and governed his own soul, and with great prudence feigned a perfect ignorance of and strangeness to them, and both by his looks, and by his voice, and by all the rest of his behaviour he pretended to be displeased at them.", "7654": "He said to them, \" My men, you say nothing peace­ ful ;", "7655": "but some one of the king's enemies has sent you forth as spies, and you, performing a base service for him, have expected to escape detection.", "7656": "But nothing that is done treacherously does escape detection, even if it be enveloped in profound darkness.", "7657": "\"And when they endeavoured to make excuses for them­ selves, they argued that he was accusing them of what had never taken place, for that they had not come from a hostile people, and that they were not themselves imbued with any unfriendly feelings towards the people of the country, and that they could never have been induced to undertake such an office as that of spies, for that they were by nature men of peace, and that they had learnt, almost from their child­ hood, from a most holy, and pious, and religious father, to honour stability and tranquillity;", "7658": "and that their father was a man who had had twelve sons, the youngest of whom, as he was not yet of an age to bear a long journey, was remain­ in,, at home, while we, whom you see here are ten more, and the remaining one is not.", "7659": "XXIX.", "7660": "When he heard this, and heard those who had sold him all speak of him as dead, what think you did Joseph feel in his soul?", "7661": "for even if he did not utter the feelings whieh then encompassed him, still they unquestion­ ably were burning within his breast, and exciting, and kind­ ling strange emotions within him;", "7662": "nevertheless, with deep wisdom and humanity does he address them, saying, \" If, in good truth, you have not come hither to spy the land, then, in order to prove your good faith to me, remain here some short period, and write a letter and send for your youngest brother, and let him come to you;", "7663": "or if, for your father's sake, you are anxious to depart, lest he perehance may be alarmed at your protracted absenee, in that case depart all the rest of you, but let one of you remain behind as a hostage, until you return again with your youngest brother;", "7664": "and if you do not obey, then the most terrible death shall be your punishment.", "7665": "\"He then threatened them in this manner, looking sternly at them, and giving every sign of violent anger, as far as appearances could go, and so he left them.", "7666": "But they, being full of eonseiousness and depression, afflicted themselves for their former treaehery towards their brother, saying, “* That wickedness which we committed is the eause of all our pre­ sent evils, since justice, whieh takes the regulation of all human affairs, is now eontriving some punishment for us;", "7667": "for having been quiet for a short time it is now awakened, displaying its nature, which is at all times relentless and implaeable towards those who are deserving of punishment, and how can we deny that we arc deserving of it?", "7668": "We in a merciless manner disregarded our brother when he besought us and supplicated us, though he had done no wrong, but had only, in the fulness of his natural affeetion, related to us, as to his nearest relations, the visions which had ap­ peared to him in sleep ;", "7669": "for which cause we, the most brutal and savage of men, became enraged, and committed (for we must not now deny the truth) most impious actions ;", "7670": "there­ fore let us now expect to suffer these things ahd even worse, we who, though we are almost the only men in the whole world who are called noble by birth, by reason of the ex­ ceeding virtues of our fathers, and grandfathers, and ancestors, have nevertheless disgraced our kindred, hastening to cover ourselves with notorious infamy.", "7671": "\"But the eldest of the brethren, who also at the very beginning had opposed them when they were originally concocting their treachery, said to them, \" Repentance is useless after the thing has been done;", "7672": "I exhorted you, I entreated you, pointing out to you how enormous the im­ piety you were meditating was, I begged you not to in­ dulge your passion;", "7673": "but though you ought to have assented to me, you yielded to your own inconsiderate folly;", "7674": "there­ fore, we now are reaping the fruit of your self-will and im­ piety, and now the treachery which we exercised towards him is required at our hands ;", "7675": "and he who requires it is not man, but either God, or reason, or the law of God.\"XXX.", "7676": "The brother whom they had sold heard them conversing in this manner without saying anything himself, as he had hitherto spoken to them by an interpreter.", "7677": "And being overcome by his feelings, he was unable to re­ strain his tears, and turned away that he might not be seen by them, and pouring forth hot and incessant tears, and so, having relieved himself for a short time, he wiped his eyes and returned to them, and commanded the second in age of the brothers to be bound in the sight of them all, since he, as it were, corresponded to himself, who was the youngest but one ;", "7678": "for in a large number the second corresponds to the last but one, as the first does to the last.", "7679": "Perhaps too, he bound him because the greatest share of the guilt belonged to him, as he was almost the original author of the plot against him, and as it was he who ex­ cited the others to the enmity which they displayed against him;", "7680": "for if he had arrayed himself on the side of the eldest when he gave his merciful and humane counsel, being younger than he, but older than all the rest, perhaps, and in­ deed most probably, the iniquity would have been checked, in consequence of those who had the highest rank and honour agreeing and co-operating together in the matter, which fact would have carried great weight with it;", "7681": "but now, he, departing from the merciful and more excellent side of the question, went over to the unmerciful and cruel one, and putting himself forward as the leader of it, he in this way encouraged those who were inclined to join him in his audacious action, so that they unshrinkingly carried out their nefarious purpose.", "7682": "This is the reason why he appears to me to have been selected from the whole body for the purpose of being bound.", "7683": "But the others now prepared for their return home, since the governor of the country had given charge to the officers to whom the sale of the wheat was en­ trusted to fill all the bags of his brothers, as though they had been strangers, and privily to replace in the mouths of their sacks the money which they had brought, without mentioning to any one that they had so restored it;", "7684": "and in the third place, to give them also abundant food which might be sufficient, and more than sufficient for them, on the way, in order that the corn which they had bought might be conveyed undiminished to their father.", "7685": "But while they were on their way, and expressing, as was natural, their compassion for their brother who was in prison, and being equally grieved also for their father's sake at this second calamity which he was to hear of, his flourishing family of children being thus diminished and curtailed at every journey, and saying that he would never believe that he was kept in prison, because those who had been once stricken with misfortune are always dreading a repetition of the same calamity, evening overtook them, and having relieved their beasts of their burdens, they light­ ened them, but received themselves heavier anxiety than ever in their minds ;", "7686": "for in times of rest to the body, the mind receives the impression made by unexpected events more readily, so as to be very severely weighed down and oppressed by them.", "7687": "XXXI.", "7688": "For one of them, having opened one of the sacks, saw in the mouth of it his purse full of money ;", "7689": "and when he had counted it, he found the whole price which he had paid down for the corn restored to him ;", "7690": "and being amazed, he brought it to his brothers ;", "7691": "and they, not imagining that it was meant as a favour to them, but rather, suspecting that it was a plot against them, were in great despondency and wishing to examine all their sacks, set off again for fear of being pursued, and made all imaginable speed, al­ most, as one may say, running without stopping to take breath, and so they completed a journey which should have taken many days, in a short time.", "7692": "Then, one after another embracing their father, with copious tears, they all clung to him, and kissed him ;", "7693": "and while he returned their em­ braces, although his soul speedily began to forebode some new calamity, for while they were thus approaching and saluting him he perceived the absence of the son who was left behind, and in his own mind blamed him for his slowness in being behind the others ;", "7694": "for he was looking at them as they came in, being anxious to behold the number of his children complete.", "7695": "But when no one from without came in besides, they, seeing that he was in a state of agitated suspense, said, “ 0 my father!", "7696": "doubt is worse than even the certain knowledge of unexpected calamities;", "7697": "for when one is cer­ tainly apprised of such, one may discover a road to

company, one of them being dead, and the other remain­ ing with you, who we said tarried behind at home on account of his age, inasmuch as he was still a child, making known and revealing to him all the circumstances of our family by reason of our absence of all suspicion, we availed nothing;", "7704": "but he said, that the only proof that could be given him of our truth and honesty would be the coming of our youngest brother to see him;", "7705": "for which reason he also detained the second of us, as a pledge and surety for his coming.", "7706": "Therefore his command is most grievous to us.", "7707": "But the occasion is also more imperious than even his command, which we must necessarily submit to from our want of necessaries, since Egypt is the only country which can supply us, who are thus oppressed by famine, with necessary food.", "7708": "\"XXXII.", "7709": "But he, groaning most bitterly, said, \" Whom shall I lament first ?", "7710": "the youngest but one, who was not the last, but the first to encounter the series of disasters which has befallen our family ?", "7711": "or the second, on whom the second evil has fallen, namely, captivity, which is only inferior in misery to death ?", "7712": "or the youngest, who is now to undertake that most detestable journey, since go he must, without being warned by the calamities which have be­ fallen his brethren ?",

and sound, the brother whom you entrust to my hand, and who, by his visit to Egypt, will effect two things of the greatest importance for us ;", "7715": "first, he will give a most evident proof that we are not spies and enemies;", "7716": "and, secondly, he will enable us to recover our brother, whom we have left in captivity.", "7717": "\"But as his father was much grieved and said that he did not know what to do, because while he had but two sons of one mother, one of them was now dead, and the other was left desolate and almost alone, so that he dreaded the journey, and though alive would

their spokes­ man him who was the boldest among them, and by his nature inclined to take the lead, and who was eloquent in speech, and he said what seemed good to them all;", "7719": "for they agreed, as their necessary food was falling short, for the corn which they had previously bought was now exhausted, and as the famine was again pressing upon and overwhelming them, to go for more in one united body, but not to go at all if the youngest still remained behind;", "7720": "because the governor of the country had forbidden them to appear before him without him.", "7721": "And their father, calculating like a wise man that it was better to expose one son to the uncertain and doubtful danger of the future, than to encounter the certain loss of so large a family, which the whole house must endure if they continued to be overwhelmed by the present scarcity, that most incurable of diseases, says to them, \" But if the neces­ sity which presses upon us is more powerful than my wishes, we must yield:", "7722": "for perhaps, perhaps I say, nature may be devising something better which she does not choose as yet to reveal to our minds.", "7723": "Depart, therefore, taking with you your youngest brother as you have determined;", "7724": "but do not go in the same manner as ye went in before.", "7725": "For formerly you had only need of money to buy corn, since no one knew you, and since you had not at that time suffered any in­ tolerable calamity.", "7726": "But now you require presents also;", "7727": "for three reasons.", "7728": "First of all, to propitiate the governor and dispenser of corn, to whom you say that you are known.", "7729": "Secondly, in order that so you may the more speedily recover him who is held in captivity, by thus paying down a large ransom for him.", "7730": "And thirdly, for the sake of as far as possible removing any idea of your being spies.", "7731": "Therefore, taking presents of all that our land supplies, offer them to the man as a kind of first fruits, and take double money, both that which you paid before, for perhaps it was restored to you through the oversight of some one, and also another sum sufficient to buy corn;", "7732": "and take with you also my prayer, which we offer to God our Saviour, that you who are strangers may go acceptably to the natives of the country, and that you may return in safety, giving back to your father those necessary pledges, his children, and bringing back the brother whom you have left in bondage, and also the youngest, as yet unacquainted with trouble, whom you are now taking with you.\"", "7733": "And so they took their departure and hastened towards Egypt.XXXIII.", "7734": "Then a few days afterwards they arrived in Egypt, and when the governor of the country saw them he was greatly pleased, and ordered the steward of his house to prepare a sumptuous dinner, and to bring the men in that they might partake of his salt and of his table.", "7735": "And when they were brought in to dinner they were in a state of great suspense, as not knowing what would be done with them, and were in confusion, suspecting that they might perhaps have a false accusation of theft brought against them on the ground of their having taken away the price of the corn that they had bought and which they had found in their sacks, as if they had done so wilfully.", "7736": "So then they came up to the steward of the house, and made a defence on a subject on which no one ventured to accuse them, purging their consciences, and, at the same time, displaying the money which they had brought back and offering to return it.", "7737": "But he cheered them with favourable and humane lan­ guage, saying, \" There is no one so impious as to found a false accusation on the graces of God, who is all-merciful.", "7738": "He it is who has rained treasures into your sacks, giving you not only food but also riches out of his abundant store.\"", "7739": "So they being comforted, then arranged in order the presents which they had brought from home to display them to the governor.", "7740": "And when the master of the house came in they offered them to him.", "7741": "And when he had inquired of them how they were, and whether their father, of whom they had previously spoken, was still alive, they answered nothing concerning themselves, but concerning their father they replied that he was alive and well.", "7742": "And when he had prayed for him, and addressed them in the most favourable and God-fearing manner, looking upon his brother by the same mother, when he saw him he could not restrain his tears, but being now overcome by his feelings, he turned himself about before he made himself known to them, and going out on a pretext as if some urgent cause compelled him (for it was not a favourable opportunity for him to tell them the truth), he wept in a secret chamber of his house and poured forth abundance of tears.", "7743": "XXXIV.", "7744": "Then when he had washed his hands he re­ strained his sorrow by the power of reason, and coming back again he feasted the strangers, returning to them the brother who had come with them before, and who had been kept as a hostage for the.", "7745": "appearance of the youngest.", "7746": "And with them there also feasted others of the nobles of the Egyptians.", "7747": "And the manner of their entertainment was to each party in accordance with their national customs, since Joseph thought it wrong to overturn ancient laws, and especially at a banquet where the pleasures should be more numerous than the annoyances.", "7748": "And as he commanded them all to sit down in order according to their age, as the men had not yet learnt the fashion of lying down on occasions of banquet­ ing, they marvelled to see whether the Egyptians would adopt the same habits as the Hebrews, having a regard to regular order, and knowing how to distinguish between the honours due to the eldest and the youngest.", "7749": "Perhaps, too, they thought this man who manages all the common business of the house, because the country has hitherto been less refined in matters relating to eating, has now not only in­ troduced regularity and good order into great matters, by which the affairs of peace and war are accustomed to be brought to a successful issue, but also into those things which are usually accounted of less importance, most of which, indeed, refer mainly to amusement.", "7750": "For the object of banquets is cheerfulness, and they do not at all allow the guests to be too solemn and austere-looking.", "7751": "While they were praising the arrangements of the feast in this quiet way, tables are brought indeed, of no great costliness or luxury, as, by reason of the famine, their host did not think it proper to revel too much amid the distresses of others;", "7752": "and they, like men of sense and understanding, praised this part of his conduct also, because he had thus avoid­ ed an unseemly magnificence, which is a thing calculated to provoke envy, saying that he was maintaining the character at the same time of one who sympathised with the needy, and also of a liberal entertainer, placing himself between the two, and avoiding all cause for blaming him in either particular.", "7753": "Therefore his preparations for the entertainment escaped all ill-will being suited to the time, and what was wanting was made up by continual cheerfulness, and by pledging one another in wine, and by good wishes, and by exhortations to eat what there was, which to persons of gentleman-like and accomplished minds was more pleasant than all the sump­ tuous dishes and liquors which men fond of eating and of epicurism provide for eating and drinking, which are in reality deserving of no serious care, but by which they do in truth display their little-mindedness with great pomp.", "7754": "XXXV.", "7755": "And on the next day he sent, the first thing in the morning, for the steward of his household, and com­ manded him to fill all the sacks of the men which they had brought with them with corn, and a second time to put back in the mouths of their sacks the price which they had brought with them, and to put in the sack of the youngest the most beautiful of his silver cups out of which lie himself was accustomed to drink;", "7756": "and he cheerfully did as he was commanded, taking care that no one was a witness of his actions.", "7757": "And they, not knowing any of the things which had been done thus secretly, departed, rejoicing in all the good fortune which had befallen them beyond all their ex­ pectations ;", "7758": "for what they had expected was this, to have a false accusation laid against them, as if they had stolen the money which had been restored to them, and never to recover their brother whom they had left as a hostage, and perhaps also, besides that, to lose their youngest brother who would be seized upon by force by the man who had been so determined that he should be brought.", "7759": "But what had happened to them was better than their most sanguine prayers, since, in addition to having no false accusations laid against them, they had also been ad­ mitted to the bread and salt of the governor, which among all men is a token of genuine friendship, and had also recovered their brother without his having received any injury, without having had recourse to the intercession and entreaty of any mediator, and were also taking back their youngest brother in safety to their father, having escaped all suspicion of being spies, and bearing with them an abundant quantity of food, and having good and well-founded hopes for the future, for they thought that even if necessary food was repeatedly to fail them, they should never again them­ selves be in exceeding want as before, but might return joy­ fully to the governor of the country as to a friend and not a stranger.", "7760": "XXXVI.", "7761": "But while they were feeling disposed in this way, and revolving such thoughts in their souls, a sudden and unexpected confusion came upon them, for the steward of the household, being commanded to do so, ran after them as if to attack them, bringing with him a vast multitude of servants, waving his hands, and making signs to them to stop, and then coming up to them out of breath he said, \"", "7762": "You have now set the seal to all the accusations that have been brought against you ;", "7763": "you have returned evil for good, and turned back upon the same road of iniquity as before;", "7764": "you have not only stolen and carried off the price of the corn, but you have committed even a greater offence than that, for wickedness which has obtained forgiveness gets more shameless;", "7765": "you, you very grateful and very peaceful men, have stolen the most beautiful and most valuable drinking cup belonging to my master, the very cup in which he pledged you;", "7766": "you who did not even know what was meant by the name of spy, and who brought back double money to restore that which you had previously paid and professed to have found in your sacks,-a trick, as it should seem, and a bait to enable you to catch and snare a more valuable prize ;", "7767": "but wickedness does not always prosper, but though always endeavouring to escape notice it is detected.", "7768": "\"While he was running on in this way against them they stood motionless and speechless, those most grievous of all evils, sorrow and fear, falling upon them thus suddenly, so that they were unable even to open their mouths, for the advent of unexpected evils makes even those who are elo­ quent actually speechless ;", "7769": "but at length they recovered themselves, and lest they should seem to be silent, because they were self-convicted by their own consciences, they spoke and said, \" How shall we reply and defend ourselves, and to whom ?", "7770": "for you who are our accuser are going to be our judge also;", "7771": "you, who even if others had accused us ought to have been our advocate from the experience that you have already had of us.", "7772": "The money which on the former occasion we found replaced in our sacks, we brought back again in order to restore it, though no one had con­ victed us of having received it again, and do you suppose that after that we became so completely changed as to requite our entertainer with injury and theft ?", "7773": "This was not so;", "7774": "and never let it enter your mind that we have done any such thing;", "7775": "but whichever of us brethren is found to have the cup let him die the death;", "7776": "for if any such wicked deed has been done there are many reasons why we should suffer death in atonement of it;", "7777": "in the first place, because covetousness and a desire for the property of others is a most wicked thing;", "7778": "secondly, because to attempt to injure those who have done one good is a most impious action;", "7779": "thirdly, because for men who are proud of the nobility of their birth to dare to destroy the reputation of their ances­ tors by scandalous actions of their own is a most shameful disgrace;", "7780": "and since if any one of us has stolen the cup of the governor he is liable to all these reproaches, let him die as one who has performed actions worthy of ten thousand deaths.", "7781": "\"XXXVII.", "7782": "And while speaking thus they unloose the burdens from off their beasts and take them down, and encourage the steward with all diligence to search them, and to look for the cup, and he, not being unaware that it was lying in the sack of the youngest, inasmuch as he himself had secretly placed it there, behaved cunningly, and began with the eldest, and so went on in regular order, taking them according to their ages, and searching, while each willingly brought forward his sack and displayed its contents, till he came to the last, in whose possession the sought-for cup was found, so that they all when they saw it lifted up their voices, and lamented, and rent their clothes, groaning heavily, and shedding tears, and before his exe­ cution bewailing their brother while he was still alive, and bewailing also their father no less than him, because he had foretold the calamities which would happen to his son, on which account he was unwilling to permit their brother to travel with them when they wished him to do so.", "7783": "And being downcast and confused they returned back by the same road to the city, being quite overwhelmed at what had happened, and looking at what had taken place as a plot, and not suspecting their brother of covetousness.", "7784": "Then when they were brought before the governor of the country they displayed their real affection and brotherly love with genuine feeling, for falling all together at his knees as if they were all liable to be punished for the theft, a wickedness too great to be mentioned, they all wept over him, and besought him, and gave themselves up to him, and offered to submit to voluntary slavery, and called him their master, speaking of themselves as foreign captives, as slaves, as bought with a price, and omitting no name whatever indicative of the most complete slavery ;", "7785": "but he, wishing to try them still more, addressed them in a most angry manner, and with the greatest possible severity, and said to them, \" May I never be guilty of such an action as to condemn such a number to captivity for the sin of one, for how can it be right to summon those persons to share in a punish­ ment who have had no share in the commission of the offence ?", "7786": "Let him alone be punished, since he alone has committed the crime.", "7787": "I know therefore that by your laws you condemn the man who has been found guilty of theft to be put to death in front of the city;", "7788": "but I, wishing to act in all respects in a gentle and most merciful manner, will mitigate the punishment, and adjudge him to slavery instead of to death.", "7789": "\"XXXVIII.", "7790": "And when they were grieved at his threat, and wholly overwhelmed at the false accusations brought against them, the fourth in age, and he was one of a daring character, combined with modesty, and full of true courage, inasmuch as he had studied freedom of speech without impudence, came forward and said, \"I entreat you, 0 master !", "7791": "not to give way to your passion ;", "7792": "nor, because you are placed in the rank next to the king, to be in a hurry to condemn us before you have heard our defence.", "7793": "When on our former journey hither, you inquired of us concerning our brother and our father, we answered you:", "7794": "Our father was an old man, aged, not more because of the power of time, than because of his uninterrupted misfortunes, by which he has been constantly exercised like a wrestler, and has passed his whole life amid labours and calamities hard to be borne.", "7795": "\"And our brother is very young, a mere child, loved beyond all measure by his father, since he is the son of his old age, and because also he had but him and one other child by the same mother, and this one alone is left, since the elder died a violent death.", "7796": "And when you commanded us to bring our brother hither, and threatened us that, if he did not come, you would not permit us to come into your sight, we departed in great depression of spirits;", "7797": "and with difficulty, when we had arrived at home, did we declare the commands which we had received from you to our father.", "7798": "And he at first wholly refused, being greatly alarmed for the child;", "7799": "but as necessary food was becoming scarce, and as not one of us dared to come hither to buy food without our youngest brother, by reason of your vehement commands;", "7800": "he was at last, with difficulty, persuaded to send him with us, blaming us bitterly for having confessed that we had another brother, and pitying himself very much for being about to be separated from him;", "7801": "for he is but a child and wholly ignorant of business, and not only of business in a foreign land, but even of such as is transacted in his own city.\"", "7802": "How, then, shall we approach our father who is under the influence of such feelings ?", "7803": "And with what eyes shall we be able to behold him without this his youngest son ?", "7804": "He will die most miserably if he only hears that his son has not returned ;", "7805": "and then all those who delight in hatred and in evil-speaking, and who rejoice in such misfortunes of their neighbours, will call us murderers and parricides, and the greater part of the accusation will fall upon me ;", "7806": "for I promised my father to give him up many things, confessing that I received my brother as a pledge, which I was to restore whenever he was re-claimed from me.", "7807": "And how shall I be able to restore him unless you are prevailed upon to show us mercy ?", "7808": "I entreat you, then, to have pity on the old man, and to give a thought to the evils by which he will be grieved, if he does not receive back again him whom he has unwisely entrusted to my hands.\"", "7809": "Nevertheless, do you exact punishment for the injuries which you imagine to have been done to you;", "7810":

will only be willing to let the child go free ;", "7813": "and not only shall you, if you will give him his liberty, receive thanks from him and me, but also from him who is not present, but who will then be relieved from his anxiety, the father of these men here, and of all the family ;", "7814": "for we are all your suppliants, having fled for succour to your right hand, and may we never fail to obtain it.\"", "7815": "Let, then, compassion for the age of the old man seize your heart, who during his whole life has constantly devoted himself to the labours of virtue.", "7816": "He has brought all the cities of Syria to receive him, and to submit to his authority, and to do him honour;", "7817": "even though he guides himself by foreign customs and laws very different from them, and although he is in all respects very unlike the natives of the land.", "7818": "But the excellence of his life, and the consistency and uniformity of his actions with his words, and of his words with his actions, have prevailed, so that he has been able to win over those who, out of regard for their national customs, were not at first well-disposed towards him.", "7819": "You will do him such a favour that it will not be possible for him to receive a greater.", "7820": "For what can be a more valuable gift to give to a father, than to allow him to receive back a son of whose safety he has despaired?", "7821": "\"XXXIX.", "7822": "But all this conduct was but an experiment, just as the former circumstances had been too, because the governor of the country was desirous to see what kind of good-will they had towards him who was his brother by the same mother.", "7823": "For he had been afraid that they felt some kind of natural dislike towards him, as children of a step­ mother often do to the family of a previous wife of their father, who may have been held in equal honours by him.", "7824": "It was with this view that he both reproached them as spies and inquired about their family, for the sake of knowing whether his brother was still alive, or whether he had been put out of the way by treachery.", "7825": "And he retained one while he allowed the rest to depart, after they had agreed to bring back their youngest brother with them, whom he desired to see above all things, and so to be relieved of his bitter and grievous sorrow on his account.", "7826": "And when he arrived, and when he beheld his brother, he was then in a slight degree relieved from his anxiety, and he invited them to an enter­ tainment, and while he was feasting them he regaled his own brother by the same mother with more costly viands and luxuries than the rest, looking carefully at every one ot them, and judging from their countenances whether there was any envy secretly cherished in their hearts.", "7827": "And when he saw them all cheerful, and all eager, and earnest for the honour of the youngest, conjecturing now by two strong proofs that there was no hatred smouldering beneath, he devised a third mode of trial likewise, bringing a charge against their youngest brother, that he appeared to have committed a theft;", "7828": "for this was likely to be the clearest possible proof of the disposition of each of them and of the affection which they bore to their brother, who was thus falsely accused.", "7829": "From all which circumstances he now clearly saw that his mother's offspring was not looked upon with hostile feelings and was not plotted against, and he also received a very probable impression respecting the events which had befallen himself, and learnt to think that he had suffered what he had, not so much because of the treachery of his brethren, as through the direction of the providence of God who sees things afar off, and who beholds the future no less than the present.", "7830": "XL.", "7831": "After this he had recourse to a reconciliation and agreement with his brethren, being influenced by his own affectionate disposition, and from his desire to cause no shame to his brethren, and to give no cause of reproach against them because of their conduct towards him, he did not choose that any of the Egyptians should be present on the occasion of his first making himself known to them.", "7832": "But he ordered all the servants to leave the apartment, and suddenly pouring forth a stream of tears, and signing to them with his right hand to approach nearer to him, that no one else might be able by chance even to hear any thing that passed, he said unto them, \"I, being about to reveal a matter which has long been kept in the shade, and which has appeared to be hidden by the long lapse of time, do now by myself disclose it to you by yourselves.", "7833": "I myself am that brother whom yousold to go into Egypt, I'whom

another began to pour forth praises of him without ceasing, and panegyrized him with unmodified encomium, each relating some different circum stance to his credit, one extolling his forgiving spirit, another his affection towards his family, and another his accuteness;", "7853": "and the whole company of them extolled his piety, and attributed to God the happy end to which everything had been brought, and being no longer melancholy or out of humour at the unexpected events which befell them, on their first arrival or at their original difficulties;", "7854": "they also praised his excessive patience and fortitude, combined with modesty, when he, who had experienced such vicissitudes of fortune, neither when he was a.slave, allowed himself to say a single word to the injury of his brothers, as having sold him, nor, when he was led away to brison, did he in his despondency say a single word that he should not have said, nor, though he remained there a long time, as prisoners usually do, did he, as is so much the custom, compare his misfortunes with those of his fellow prisoners so as to reveal anything, but kept silence as if he had no knowledge of the cause of the events that had happened to him.", "7855": "Nor again, when he was interpreting the dreams either to the eunuch or to the king, which was a favourable occasion for relating his own story, did he ever say a word about his own nobility of birth, nor yet when he was appointed lieu­ tenant of the king, and received the superintendence and government of the whole of Egypt, even with the view of not being thought an ignoble and obscure person, but one who was really descended of noble ancestors, not a slave by nature, but one who had been exposed to intolerable treachery, and calamities at the hands of persons from whom he was least entitled tv expect it.", "7856": "Moreover in addition to all this, great praise was be­ stowed on his affability and courtesy;", "7857": "for being acquainted with the insolence and rudeness of.", "7858": "other governors, they marvelled at the absence of -pretence and display which they saw in him, and they admired his kindness too, who, though the moment that he beheld them after their first journey he might have put them to death, or on the last occasion cither, merely by refusing to supply them with food when oppressed with hunger, was not content with not punishing them, but even gave them necessary food gratui­ tously as though they had been persons worthy of favour, ordering the price they had paid to be restored to them:", "7859": "and all the circumstances of their treachery towards him, and of their selling him, were so wholly concealed from, and unknown to any one, that the magistrates of the Egyptians sympathised with him in his joy, as if this was the first occasion of the brothers of the governor having arrived;", "7860": "moreover they invited them to hospitality, and made haste to relate their arrival to the king, and everything every­ where was full of joy, no less than would have been the case if the plain had suddenly become fertile, and the famine had changed into abundance.", "7861": "XLII.", "7862": "But the king, when he heard that Joseph had a father and a numerous family, advised him to press his father to remove into Egypt with all his house, promising to give them the most fertile district in Egypt on their arrival.", "7863": "Therefore Joseph gave his brothers chariots, and waggons, and a great multitude of beasts of burden, loaded with all necessary things, and a number of servants, that they might conduct his father into Egypt in safety.", "7864": "But when they arrived at home, and told their father their story about their brother, which was so apparently incredible and beyond all his hopes, he did not much believe them;", "7865": "for even though those who brought the account were trustworthy, still the greatness and extraor­ dinary character of the circumstances which they reported, did not allow him to believe them easily:", "7866": "but when the old man saw the vast preparation, and the supplies of all neces­ sary things, at such a time, in such abundance, correspond­ ing to the good fortune of his son which they were reporting to him, he praised God that he had made complete that part of his house which seemed to be deficient;", "7867": "but his joy immediately begat fear

which is blind, that he stored up all the silver and gold which he collected as the price of the corn in the king's treasury, not appropriating a single drachm of it to his own use, but being satisfied with nothing beyond the gifts which the king bestowed on him volun­ tarily, in acknowledgment of his services.", "7883": "And in this manner he governed Egypt, and other countries also with it, and other nations, while oppressed with the famine, in a manner too admirable for any description to do it justice, distributing food to all in a proper manner, and looking, not only at the present advantage, but also at what would be of future benefit:", "7884": "therefore, when the seventh year of the scarcity arrived, he sent for the farmers (for there was now a prospect of fertility and abundance), and gave them barley and wheat for seed, taking care that no one should appropriate what he gave for other purposes, but should sow what he received in the fields, to which end he selected men of honesty and virtues as overseers and super­ intendents, who were to take care that the sowing was properly performed.", "7885": "And when a long time after the famine his father died, his brothers were filled with secret misgivings, and feared lest now he should remember the evil that they had done to him, and should retaliate upon them and afflict them, and so they came to him and besought him earnestly, bringing with them their wives and their children.", "7886": "And he wept and said, \"", "7887": "The occasion indeed is a natural one, to fill with secret apprehension those who have done intolerable things, and who are convicted more by their own consciences than by anything else;", "7888": "for the death of our father has revived in you the ancient fear which you entertained before our re­ conciliation, that I had merely bestowed pardon on you for the sake of not grieving our father;", "7889": "but I do not change my disposition with the changes of time, nor, after I have agreed to a reconciliation and forgiveness, will I ever do anything inconsistent with such agreement;", "7890": "for I have not been postponing revenge and watching for opportunities to wreak it, but I once for all gave you immunity from all punishment, being influenced partly by feelings of respect for my father, for I must speak the plain truth, and partly by natural necessary affection for you.\"", "7891": "But if I did every thing that was merciful and humane for my father's sake while he was alive, I will also adhere to it now that he is dead.", "7892": "But in my real opinion no good man ever dies, but such will live for ever and ever, without growing old, in an immortal nature which is no longer bound up in the necessities of the body.", "7893": "And why should I remember only that father who was created and born ?", "7894": "We have also the uncreated, immortal, everlasting God for our father, who sees all things and hears all people, even when silent, and who always sees even those things which lie hidden in the recesses of the mind, and whom I look upon and invoke as a witness of my sincere reconciliation;", "7895": "for ' I am (and do not you be astonished at my words), I am in the place of God,'* who has changed your evil designs against me so as to bring forth from them an abundance of good things.", "7896": "Be ye therefore fearless, and know that for the future you shall enjoy still better fortune than hitherto you have while our father was still alive.", "7897": "\"", "7898": "XLIV.", "7899": "Having encouraged his brethren with these words he confirmed his promises still more by actions, leaving out nothing which could show his care for his brethren.", "7900": "And after the famine, when the inhabitants were now full of joy at the fertility and prosperity of the country he was honoured by all men, who thus recompensed him for the benefits which they had received from him in the season of their despair.", "7901": "And the report of him became noised abroad, and filled all the cities with his glory and reputation.", "7902": "And he lived a hundred and ten years, and then died at a good old age, having enjoyed the greatest perfection of beauty, and wisdom, and eloquence of speech.", "7903": "The beauty of his person is testified to by- the violent love with which he inflamed the wife of the eunuch;", "7904": "his wisdom by the even­ ness of his conduct in the indescribable variety of circum­ stances that attended the whole of his life, by which he wrought regularity among things that were irregular, and harmony among things that were discordant.", "7905": "His eloquence of speech is displayed in his interpretation of the dreams, in his affability in ordinary conversation, and by the persuasion which followed his words;", "7906": "in consequence of which his subjects all obeyed him cheerfully and voluntarily, rather than from any compulsion.", "7907": "Of these hundred and ten years he spent seventeen, till the expiration of his boyhood, in his father's house;", "7908": "and thirteen he passed amid unforeseen events, being plotted against, and sold, and becoming a slave, and having false accusations brought against him, and being thrown into prison;", "7909": "and the remaining eighty years he spent in autho­ rity and in all manner of prosperity, being the most excellent manager and administrator both of scarcity and plenty, and the most competent of all men to manage affairs under either complexion of circumstances.", "7910": "HADDON, BROTHERS, AND CO., PRINTERS, CASTLE

other as mendacious and full of trickery, made the beginning of his laws entirely beautiful, and in all respects admirable, neither at once declaring what ought to be done or the contrary, nor (since

beauty;", "19": "while the passive subject is something inanimate and incapable of motion by any intrinsic power of its own, but having been set in motion, and fashioned, and endowed with life by the intellect, became transformed into that most perfect work, this world.", "20": "And those who describe it as being uncreated, do, without being aware of it, cut off the most useful and necessary of

own in the breast of him who has not cre­ ated it.", "24": "It is then a pernicious doctrine, and one for which no one should contend, to establish a system in this world, such as anarchy is in a city, so that it should have no superintendant, or regulator, or judge, by whom everything must be managed and governed.", "25": "But the great Moses, thinking that a thing which has not been uncreated is as alien as possible from that which is visible before our eyes (for everything which is the subject of our ^ senses exists in birth and in changes, and is not always in the same condition), has attributed eternity to that which is in­ visible and discerned only by our intellect as a kinsman and a brother, while of that which is the object of our external senses he had predicated generation as an appropriate descrip­ tion.", "26": "Since, then, this world is visible and the object of our external senses, it follows of necessity that it must have been created ;", "27": "on which account it was not without a wise purpose that he recorded its creation, giving a very venerable account of God.", "28": "III.", "29": "And he says that the world was made in six days, not because the Creator stood in need of a length of time (for it is natural that God should do everything at once, not merely by uttering a command, but by even thinking of it);", "30": "but because the things created required arrangement;", "31": "and number is akin to arrangement;", "32": "and, of all numbers, six is, by the laws of nature, the most productive :", "33": "for of all the numbers, from the unit upwards, it is the first perfect one, being made equal to its parts, and being made complete by them ;", "34": "the number three being half of it, and the number two a third of it, and the unit a sixth of it, and, so to say, it is formed so as to be both male and female, and is made up of the power of both natures;", "35": "for in existing things the odd number is the male, and the even number is the female;", "36": "accordingly, of odd num­ bers the first is the number three, and of even numbers the first is two, and the two numbers multiplied together make six.", "37": "It was fitting therefore, that the world, being the most perfect of created things, should be made according to the perfect number, namely, six:", "38": "and, as it was to have in it the causes of both, which arise from combination, that it should be formed according to a mixed number, the first combination of odd and even numbers, since it was to embrace the character both of the male who sows the seed, and of the female who receives it.", "39": "And he allotted each of the six days to one of the portions of the whole, taking out the first day, which he does not even call the first day, that it may not be numbered with the others, but entitling it one, he names it rightly, perceiving in it, and ascribing to it the nature and appellation of the limit.", "40": "IV.", "41": "We must mention as much as we can of the matters contained in his account, since to enumerate them all is im­ possible ;", "42": "for he embraces that beautiful world which is percep­ tible only by the intellect, as the account of the first day will show:", "43": "for God, as apprehending beforehand, as a God mus' do, that there could not exist a good imitation without a good model, and that of the things perceptible to the external senses nothing could be faultless which was not fashioned with reference to some archetypal idea conceived by the intellect, when he had determined to create this visible world, previously formed that one which is perceptible only by the intellect, in order that so using an incorporeal model formed as far as pos­ sible on the image of God.", "44": "he might then make this corporeal world, a younger likeness of the elder creation, which should embrace as many different genera perceptible to the external senses, as the other world contains of those which are visible only to the intellect.", "45": "But that world which consists of ideas, it were impious in any degree to attempt to describe or even to imagine :", "46": "but how it was created, we shall know if we take for our guide a certain image of the things which exist among us.", "47": "When any city is founded through the exceeding ambition of some king or leader who lays claim to absolute authority, and is at the same time a man of brilliant imagination, eager to display his good fortune, then it happens at times that some man coming up who, from his education, is skilful in archi­ tecture, and he, seeing the advantageous character and beauty of the situation, first of all sketches out in his own mind nearly all the parts of the city which is about to be com­ pleted—the temples, the gymnasia, the prytanea, the markets, the harbour, the docks, the streets, the arrangement of the walls, the situations of the dwelling houses, and of the public and other buildings.", "48": "Then, having received in his own mind, as on a waxen tablet, the form of each building, he carries in his heart the image of a city, perceptible as yet only by the intellect, the images of which he stirs up in memory which is innate in him, and, still further, engraving them in his mind like a good workman, keeping his eyes fixed on his model, he begins to raise the city of stones and wood, making the corpo­ real substances to resemble each of the incorporeal ideas.", "49": "Now we must form a somewhat similar opinion of God, who, having determined to found a mighty state, first of all con­ ceived its form in his mind, according to which form he made a world perceptible only by the intellect, and then completed one visible to the external senses, using the first one as a model.", "50": "V.", "51": "As therefore the city, when previously shadowed out in the mind of the man of architectural skill had no external place, but was stamped solely in the mind of the workman, so in the same manner neither can the world which existed in ideas have had any other local position except the divine reason which made them ;", "52": "for what other place could there be for his powers which should be able to receive and contain, I do not say all, but even any single one of them whatever, in its simple form ?", "53": "And the power and faculty which could be capable of creating the world, has for its origin that good which is founded on truth ;", "54": "for if any one were desirous to investi­ gate the cause on account of which this universe was created, I think that he would come to no erroneous conclusion if he were to say as one of the ancients did say :", "55": "\"", "56": "That the Father and Creator was good ;", "57": "on which account he did not grudge the substance a share of his own excellentnature,since it had nothing good of itself, but was able to become everything.\"", "58": "For the substance was of itself destitute of arrangement, of quality, of animation, of distinctive character, and full of all disorder and confusion;", "59": "and it received a change and transformation to what is opposite to this condition, and most excellent, being invested with order, quality, animation, resemblance, identity, arrangement, harmony, and everything which belongs to the more excellent idea.", "60": "VI.", "61": "And God, not being urged on by any prompter (for who else could there have been to prompt him ?) but guided by his own sole will, decided that it was fitting to benefit with unlimited and abundant favours a nature which, without the divine gift, was unable of itself to partake of any good thing;", "62": "but he benefits it, not according to the greatness of his own graces, for they are illimitable and eternal, but according to the power of that which is benefited to receive his graces.", "63": "For the capacity of that which is created to receive benefits does not correspond to the natural power of God to confer them;", "64": "since his powers are infinitely greater, and the thing created being not sufficiently powerful to receive all their greatness would have sunk under it, if he had not measured his bounty, allotting to each, in due proportion, that which was poured upon it.", "65": "And if any one were to desire to use more undisguised terms, he would not call the world, which is per­ ceptible only to the intellect, any thing else but the reason of God, already occupied in the creation of the world;", "66": "for neither is a city, while only perceptible to the intellect, anything else but the reason of the architect, who is already designing to build one perceptible to the external senses, on the model of that which is so only to the intellect-this is the doctrine of Moses, not mine.", "67": "Accordingly he, when recording the cre­ ation of man, in words which follow, asserts expressly, that he was made in the image of God—and if the image be a part of the image, then manifestly so is the entire form, namely, the whole of this world perceptible by the external senses, which is a greater imitation of the divine image than the human form is.", "68": "It is manifest also, that the archetypal seal, which we call that world which is perceptible only to the in­ tellect, must itself be the archetypal model, the idea of ideas, the Reason of God.VII.", "69": "Moses says also;", "70": "“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth:", "71": "\" taking the beginning to be, not as some men think, that which is according to time;", "72": "for before the world time had no existence, but was created either simultaneously with it, or after it;", "73": "for since time is the inter­ val of the motion of the heavens, there could not have been any such thing as motion before there was anything which could be moved;", "74": "but it follows of necessity that it received existence subsequently or simultaneously.", "75": "It therefore follows also of necessity, that time was created either at the same moment with the world, or later than it-and to venture to assert that it is older than the world is absolutely inconsistent with philosophy.", "76": "But if the beginning spoken of by Moses is not to be looked upon as spoken of according to time, then it may be natural to suppose that it is the beginning accord­ ing to number that is indicated ;", "77": "so that, \" In the beginning he created,\" is equivalent to \" first of all he created the heaven ;", "78": "\" for it is natural in reality that that should have been the first object created, being both the best of all created things, and being also made of the purest substance, because it was destined to be the most holy abode of the visible Gods who are perceptible by the external senses;", "79": "for if the Creator had made everything at the same moment, still those things which were created in beauty would no less have had a regular arrangement, for there is no such thing as beauty in disorder.", "80": "But order is a due consequence and connection of things pre­ cedent and subsequent, if not in the completion of a work, at all events in the intention of the maker;", "81": "for it is owing to order that they become accurately defined and stationary, and free from confusion.", "82": "In the first place therefore, from the model of the world, perceptible only by intellect, the Creator made an incorporeal heaven, and an invisible earth, and the form of air and of empty space :", "83": "the former of which he called darkness, because the air is black by nature;", "84": "and the other he called the abyss, for empty space is very deep and yawning with immense width.", "85": "Then he created the incorporeal substance of water and of air, and above all he spread light, being the seventh thing made;", "86": "and this again was incorporeal, and a model of the sun, perceptible only to intellect, and of all the light- giving stars, which are destined to stand together in heaven.", "87": "VIII.", "88": "And air and light he considered worthy of the pre- eminence.", "89": "For the one he called the breath of God, because it is air, which is the most life-giving of things, and of life the causer is God;", "90": "and the other he called light, because it is sur­ passingly beautiful:", "91": "for that which is perceptible only by intellect is as far more brilliant and splendid than that which is seen, as I conceive, the sun is than darkness, or day than night, or the intellect than any other of the outward senses by which men judge (inasmuch as it is the guide of the entire soul), or the eyes than any other part of the body.", "92": "And the invisible divine reason, perceptible only by intellect, he calls the image of God.", "93": "And the image of this image is that light, perceptible only by the intellect, which is the image of the divine reason, which has explained its generation.", "94": "And it is a star above the heavens, the source of those stars which are perceptible by the external senses, and if any one were to call it universal light he would not be very wrong;", "95": "since it is from that the sun and the moon, and all the other planets and fixed stars derive their due light, in proportion as each has power given to it;", "96": "that unmingled and pure light being obscured when it begins to change, according to the change from that which is perceptible only by the intellect, to that which is perceptible by the external senses;", "97": "for none of those things which are perceptible to the external senses is pure.", "98": "IX.", "99": "Moses is right also when he says, that \" darkness was over the face of the abyss.\"", "100": "For the air is in a manner spread above the empty space, since having mounted up it entirely fills all that open, and desolate, and empty place, which reaches down to us from the regions below the moon.", "101": "And after the shining forth of that light, perceptible only to the intellect, which existed before the sun, then its adversary darkness yielded, as God put a wall between them and sepa­ rated them, well knowing their opposite characters, and the enmity existing between their natures.", "102": "In order, therefore, that they might not war against one another from being con­ tinually brought in contact, so that war would prevail instead of peace, God, turning want of order into order, did not only separate light and darkness, but did also place boundaries in the middle of the space between the two, by which he sepa­ rated the extremities of each.", "103": "For if they had approximated they must have produced confusion, preparing for the contest, for the supremacy, with great and unextinguishable rivalry, if boundaries established between them had not separated them and prevented them from clashing together, and these boun­ daries are evening and morning;", "104": "the one of which heralds in the good tidings that the sun is about to rise, gently dissi­ pating the darkness:", "105": "and evening comes on as the sun sets, receiving gently the collective approach of darkness.", "106": "And these, I mean morning and evening, must be placed in the class of incorporeal things, perceptible only by the intellect;", "107": "for there is absolutely nothing in them which is perceptible by the external senses, but they are entirely ideas, and measures, and forms, and seals, incorporeal as far as regards the genera­ tion of other bodies.", "108": "But when light came, and darkness retreated and yielded to it, and boundaries were set in the space between the two, namely, evening and morning, then of necessity the measure of time was immediately perfected, which also the Creator called \" day,\" and He called it not \" the first day,\" but \" one day;", "109": "\" and it is spoken of thus, on account of the single nature of the world perceptible only by the intellect, which has a single nature.", "110": "X.", "111": "The incorporeal world then was already completed, having its seat in the Divine Reason ;", "112": "and the world, percep­ tible by the external senses, was made on the model of it;", "113": "and the first portion of it, being also the most excellent of all made by the Creator, was the heaven, which he truly called the firmament, as being corporeal;", "114": "for the body is by nature firm, inasmuch as it is divisible into three parts ;", "115": "and what other idea of solidity and of body can there be, except that it is something which may be measured in every direction ?", "116": "therefore he, very naturally contrasting that which was per­ ceptible to the external senses, and corporeal with that which was perceptible only by the intellect and incorporeal, called this the firmament.", "117": "Immediately afterwards he, with great propriety and entire correctness, called it the heaven, either because it was already the boundary* of everything, or because it was the first of all visible things which was created;", "118": "and after its second rising he called the time day, referring the entire space and measure of a day to the heaven, on account of its dignity and honour among the things perceptible to the external senses.", "119": "XI.", "120": "And after this, as the whole body of water in existence was spread over all the earth, and had penetrated through all its parts, as if it were a sponge which had imbibed moisture, so that the earth was only swampy land and deep mud, both the elements of earth and water being mixed up and combined together, like one confused mass into one undistinguishable and shapeless nature, God ordained that all the water which was salt, and destined to be a cause of barrenness to seeds and trees should be gathered together, flowing forth out of all the holes of the entire earth;", "121": "and he commanded dry land to appear, that liquid which had any sweetness in it being left in it to secure its durability.", "122": "For this sweet liquid, in due pro­ portions, is as a sort of glue for the different substances, preventing the earth from being utterly dried up, and so becoming unproductive and barren, and causing it, like a mother, to furnish not only one kind of nourishment, namely meat, but both sorts at once, so as to supply its offspring with both meat and drink;", "123": "wherefore he filled it with veins, resembling breasts, which, being provided with openings, were destined to pour forth springs and rivers.", "124": "And in the same way he extended the invisible irrigations of dew per­ vading every portion of arable and deep-soiled land, to con­ tribute to the most liberal and plenteous supply of fruits.", "125": "Having arranged these things, he gave them names, calling the dry, \" land,\" and the water which was separated from it he called \" sea.\"XII.", "126": "After this he began to adorn the land, for he bade it bring forth grass, and bear corn, producing every kind of herb, and plains clothed with verdure, and everything which was calculated to be fodder for cattle, or food for men.", "127": "More­ over he commanded every kind of tree to spring up, omitting no kind, either of those which are wild or of those which are called cultivated.", "128": "And simultaneously with their first produc­ tion he loaded them all with fruit, in a manner different from that which exists at present;", "129": "for now the different fruits are produced in turn, at different seasons, and not all together at one time;", "130": "for who is there who does not know that first of all comes the sowing and the planting;", "131": "and, in the second place, the growth of what has been sown and planted, in some cases the plants extending their roots downwards like founda­ tions, and in others raising themselves upwards to a height and displaying long stalks ?", "132": "After that come the buds, and the putting forth of leaves, and then after everything else comes the production of fruit.", "133": "And again, the fruit when first produced is not perfect, but it contains in itself all kinds of change, with reference both to its quantity in regard of mag­ nitude, and to its qualities in its multiform appearance:", "134": "for the fruit is produced at first like indivisible grains, which are hardly visible from their diminutive size, and which one might correctly enough pronounce to be the first things per­ ceptible by the external senses;", "135": "and afterwards by little and little, from the nourishment conveyed in channels, which -waters the tree, and from the wholesome effect of the breezes, which blow air at the same time cold and gentle, the fruit is gradually vivified, and nursed up, and increased, advancing onward to its perfect size ;", "136": "and with its change of magnitude it changes also its qualities, as if it were diversified with varying colours by pictorial science.", "137": "XIII.", "138": "But in the first creation of the universe, as I have said already, God produced the whole race of trees out of the earth in full perfection, having their fruit not incomplete but in a state of entire ripeness, to be ready for the immediate and undelayed use and enjoyment of the animals which were about immediately to be born.", "139": "Accordingly he commanded the earth to produce these things.", "140": "And the earth, as though it had for a long time been pregnant and travailing, produced every sort of seed, and every sort of tree, and also of fruit, in unspeakable abundance;", "141": "and not only were these produced fruits to be food for living animals, but enough also to serve as a preparation for the continuous production of similar fruits hereafter;", "142": "covering substances consisting of seed, in which are the principles of all plants undistinguishable and invisible, but destined hereafter to become manifest and visible in the periodical maturity of the fruit.", "143": "For God thought fit to endue nature with a long duration, making the races that he was creating immortal, and giving them a participation in eternity.", "144": "On which account he led on and hastened the beginning towards the end, and caused the end to turn back­ wards to the beginning:", "145": "for from plants comes fruit, as the end might come from the beginning;", "146": "and from the fruit comes the seed, which again contains the plant within itself, so that a fresh beginning may come from the end.", "147": "XIV.", "148": "And on the fourth day, after he had embellished the earth, he diversified and adorned the heaven:", "149": "not giving the precedence to the inferior nature by arranging the heaven subsequently to the earth, or thinking that which was the more excellent and the more divine worthy only of the second place, but acting thus for the more manifest demonstration of the power of his dominion.", "150": "For he foreknew with respect to men who were not yet born, what sort of beings they would be as to their opinions, forming conjectures on what was likely and probable, of which the greater part would be reason­ able, though falling short of the character of unadulterated truth;", "151": "and trusting rather to visible phenomena than to God, and admiring sophistry rather than wisdom.", "152": "And again he knew that surveying the periods of the sun and moon, to which are owing the summers and winters, and the alternations of spring and autumn, they would conceive the revolutions of the stars in heaven to be the causes of all the things which every year should be produced and generated on the earth, accordingly that no one might venture either through shame­ less impudence or inordinate ignorance to attribute to any created thing the primary causes of things, he said:", "153": "\"Let them run over in their minds the first creation of the universe, when, before the sun or the moon existed, the earth brought forth all kinds of plants and all kinds of fruits:", "154": "and seeing

fruit and herbs before God proceeded to adorn the heaven.", "158": "And next the heaven was embellished in the perfect number four, and if any one were to pronounce this number the origin and source of the all-perfect decade he would not err.", "159": "For what the decade is in actuality, that the number four, as it seeems, is in potentiality, at all events if the numerals from the unit to four* are placed together in order, they will make ten, which is the limit of the number of immensity, around which the numbers wheel and turn as around a goal.", "160": "Moreover the number four also comprehends the principles of the harmonious concords in music, that in fours, and in fifths, and the diapason, and besides this the double diapason from which sounds the most perfect system of harmony is pro­ duced.", "161": "For the ratio of the sounds in fourths is as four to three ;", "162": "and in fifths as three to two ;", "163": "and in the diapason that ratio is doubled :", "164": "and in the double diapason it is increased fourfold, all which ratios the number four comprehends.", "165": "At all events the first, or the epistritus, is the ratio of four to three;", "166": "the second, or the hemiolius, is that of three to two :", "167": "the two­ fold ratio is that of two to one, or four to two :", "168": "and the four­ fold ratio is that of four to one.", "169": "XVI.", "170": "There is also another power of the number four which is a most wonderful one to speak of and to contemplate.", "171": "For it was this number that first displayed the nature of the solid cube, the numbers before four being assigned only to incorpo­ real things.", "172": "For it is according to the unit that that thing is reckoned which is spoken of in geometry as a point:", "173": "and a line is spoken of according to the number two, because it is arranged by nature from a point;", "174": "and a line is length without breadth.", "175": "But when breadth is added to it, it becomes a superficies, which is arranged according to the number three.", "176": "And a superficies, when compared with the nature of a solid cube, wants one thing, namely depth, and when this one thing is added to the three, it becomes four.", "177": "On which account it has happened that this number is a thing of great importance, inasmuch as from an incorporeal substance perceptible only by intellect, it has led us on to a comprehension of a body divisible in a threefold manner, and which by its own nature is first perceived by the external senses.", "178": "And he who does not comprehend what is here said may learn to understand it from a game which is very common.", "179": "Those who play with nuts are accustomed when they have placed three nuts on the floor, to place one more on the top of them producing a figure like a pyramid.", "180": "Accordingly the triangle stands on the floor, arranged up to the number three, and the nut which is placed upon it makes up four in number, and in figure it produces a pyramid, being now a solid body.", "181": "And in addition to this there is this point also of which we should not be ignorant, the number four is the first number which is a square, being equal on all sides, the measure of justice and equality.", "182": "And that it is the only number the nature of which is such that it is produced by the same numbers whether in combination, or in power.", "183": "In combination when two and two are added together ;", "184": "and again in power when we speak of twice two ;", "185": "* and in this it displays an exceedingly beautiful kind of harmony, which is not the lot of any other number.", "186": "If we examine the number six which is composed of two threes, if these two numbers are multiplied it is not the number six that is produced, but a different one, the number nine.", "187": "And the number four has many other powers also, which we must subsequently show more accurately in a separate essay appropriated to it.", "188": "At present it is sufficient to add this that it was the foundation of the creation of the whole heaven and the whole world.", "189": "For the four elements, out of which this universe was made, flowed from the number four as from a fountain.", "190": "And in addition to the four elements the seasons of the year are also four, which are the causes of the generation of animals and plants, the year being divided into the quadruple division of winter, and spring, and summer, and autumn.", "191": "XVII.", "192": "The aforesaid number therefore being accounted worthy of such pre eminence in nature, the Creator of necessity adorned the heaven by the number four, namely by that most beautiful and most godlike ornament the light-giving stars.", "193": "And knowing that of all existing things light is the most excellent, he made it the instrument of the best of all the senses, sight.", "194": "For what the mind is in the soul, that the eye is in the body.", "195": "For each of them sees, the one beholding those existing things which are perceptible only to the intellect, and the other those which are perceptible to the external senses.", "196": "But the mind is in need of knowledge in order to distinguish incorporeal things, and the eyes have need of light in order to be able to perceive bodies, and light is also the cause of many other good things to men, and particularly of the greatest, namely philosophy.", "197": "For the sight being sent upwards by light and beholding the nature of the stars and their harmonious movement, and the well-ordered-revolutions of the fixed stars, and of the planets, some always revolving in the same manner and coming to the same places, and others having double periods in an anomalous and somewhat contrary manner, be­ holding also, the harmonious dances of all these bodies arranged according to the laws of perfect music, causes an ineffable joy and delight to the soul.", "198": "And the soul, feasting on a continuous series of spectacles, for one succeeds another, has an insatiable love for beholding such.", "199": "Then, as is usually the ease, it examines with increased curiosity what is the substance of these things which are visible ;", "200": "and whether they have an existence without having been created, or whether they received their origin by creation, and what is the character of their movement, and what the causes are by which everything is regulated.", "201": "And it is from inquiries into these things that philosophy has arisen, than which no more perfect good has entered into human life.", "202": "XVIII.", "203": "But the Creator having a regard to that idea of light perceptible only by the intellect, which has been spoken of in the mention made of the incorporeal world, created those stars which are perceptible by the external senses, those divine and superlatively beautiful images, which on many accounts he placed in the purest temple of corporeal substance, namely in heaven.", "204": "One of the reasons for his so doing was that they might give light;", "205": "another was that they might be signs;", "206": "another had reference to their dividing the times of the sea­ sons of the year, and above all dividing days and nights, months and years, which are the measures of time ;", "207": "and which have given rise to the nature of number.", "208": "And how great is the use and how great the advantage derivable from each of the aforesaid things, is plain from their effect.", "209": "But with a view to a more accurate comprehension of them, it may perhaps not be out of place to trace out the truth in a regular discussion.", "210": "Now the whole of time being divided into two portions day and night, the sovereignty of the day the Father has assigned to the Sun, as a mighty monarch :", "211": "and that of the night he has given to the moon and to the multitude of the other stars.", "212": "And the greatness of the power and sovereignty of the sun has its most conspicuous proof in what has been already said :", "213": "for he, being one and single has been allotted for his own share and by himself one half portion of all time, namely day;", "214": "and all the other lights in conjunction with the moon have the other portion, which is called night.", "215": "And when the sun rises all the appearances of such numbers of stars are not only obscured but absolutely disappear from the effusion of his beams;", "216": "and when he sets then they all assembled together, begin to display their own peculiar brilliancy and their sepa­ rate qualities,XIX.", "217": "And they have been created, as Moses tells us, not only that they might send light upon the earth, but also that they might display signs of future events.", "218": "For either by their risings, or their settings, or their eclipses, or again by their appearances and occupations, or by the other variations observ­ able in their motions, men oftentimes conjecture what is about to happen, the productiveness or unproductiveness of the crops, the birth or loss of their cattle, fine weather or cloudy weather, calms and violent storms of wind, floods in the rivers or droughts, a tranquil state of the sea and heavy waves, unusual changes in the seasons of the year when either the summer is cold like winter, or the winter warm, or when the spring assumes the temperature of autumn or the autumn that of spring.", "219": "And before now some men have conjecturally predicted disturban­ ces and commotions of the earth from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and innumerable other events which have turned out most exactly true:", "220": "so that it is a most veracious saying that \" the stars were created to act as signs, and moreover to mark the seasons.\"", "221": "And by the word seasons the divisions of the year are here intended.", "222": "And why may not this be reasonably affirmed ?", "223": "For what other idea of opportunity can there be except that it is the time for success ?", "224": "And the seasons bring everything to perfection and set everything right;", "225": "giving perfection to the sowing and planting of fruits, and to the birth and growth of animals.", "226": "They were also created to serve as measures of time;", "227": "for it is by the appointed periodical revolutions of the sun and moon and other stars, that days and months and years are deter­ mined.", "228": "And moreover it is owing to them that the most useful of all things, the nature of number exists, time having displayed it;", "229": "for from one day comes the limit, and from two the number two, and from three, three, and from the notion of a month is derived the number thirty, and from a year that number which is equal to the days of the twelve months, and from infinite time comes the notion of infinite number.", "230": "To such great and indispensable advantages do the natures of the heavenly bodies and the motions of the stars tend.", "231": "And to how many other things might I also affirm that they contribute which are as yet unknown to us?", "232": "for all things are not known to the will of man ;", "233": "but of the things which con­ tribute towards the durability of the universe, those which are established by laws and ordinances which God has appointed to be unalterable for ever, are accomplished in every instance and in every country.", "234": "XX.", "235": "Then when earth and heaven had been adorned with their befitting ornaments, one with a triad, and the other, as has been already said, with a quaternion, God proceeded to create the races of mortal creatures, making the beginning with the aquatic animals on the fifth day, thinking that there was no one thing so akin to another as the number five was to ani­ mals ;", "236": "for animate things differ from inanimate in nothing more than in sensation, and sensation is divided according to a five-fold division, into sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.", "237": "Accordingly, the Creator allotted to each of the senses its appropriate matter, and also its peculiar faculty of judg­ ment, by which it should decide on what came before it.", "238": "So sight judges of colours, and hearing of sounds, and taste of juices, and smell of vapours, and touch of softness and hard­ ness, and of heat and cold, and of smoothness and roughness :", "239": "therefore", "240": "He commanded all the races of fish and sea-monsters to stand together in their places, animals differing both in their sizes and in their qualities;", "241": "for they vary in different seas, though in some cases they are the same, and every animal was not formed to live every where.", "242": "And was not this reasonable?", "243": "For some of them delight in marshy places, and in water which is very deep;", "244": "and some in sewers and harbours, being neither able to crawl up upon the land, nor to swim off far from the land.", "245": "Some, again, dwell in the middle and in the deep sea, and avoid all the projecting promontories and islands and rocks :", "246": "some also exult in fine weather and in calms, and some in storms and heavy surf.", "247": "For being exercised by continual buffetings, and being in the habit of withstanding the current by force, they are very vigorous and become stout.", "248": "After that he created the races of birds as akin to the races of aquatic animals (for they are each of them swimmers), leaving no species of creatures which traverse the air un­ finished.", "249": "XXI.", "250": "So now when the air and the water had received their appropriate races of animals as an allotment that was their due, God again summoned the earth for the creation of that share which still remained :", "251": "and after the production of plants, the terrestrial animals still remained.", "252": "And God said, \" Let the earth bring forth cattle and beasts, and creep­ ing things of each kind.\"", "253": "And the earth did as it was com­ manded, and immediately sent forth animals differing in their formation and in their strength, and in the injurious or beneficial powers that were implanted in them.", "254": "And after all", "255": "He made man.", "256": "But how he made him I will mention presently, after I have first explained that he adopted the most beautiful connection and train of consequences according to the system of the creation of animals which he had sketched out to himself;", "257": "for of souls the most sluggish and the most weakly formed has been allotted to the race of fishes;", "258": "and the most exquisitely endowed soul, that which is in all respects most excellent, has been given to the race of man­ kind, and one something between the two to the races of ter­ restrial animals and those which traverse the air;", "259": "for the soul of such creatures is endowed with more acute sensations than the soul of fishes, but is more dull than that of mankind.", "260": "And it was on this account that of all living creatures", "261": "God created fishes first, inasmuch as they partake of corporeal substance in a greater degree than they partake of soul, being in a manner animals and not animals, moving soulless things, having a sort of semblance of soul diffused through them for no object beyond that of keeping their bodies alive (just as they say that salt preserves meat), in order that they may not easily be destroyed.", "262": "And after the fishes, he created winged and terrestrial animals:", "263": "-for these are endowed with a higher degree of sensation, and from their formation show that the properties of their animating principle are of a higher order.", "264": "But after all the rest, then, as has been said before, he created man, to whom he gave that admirable endowment of mind-the soul, if I may so call it, of the soul, as being like the pupil to the eye ;", "265": "for those who most accurately inves­ tigate the natures of things affirm, that it is the pupil which is the eye of the eye.", "266": "XXII.", "267": "So at last all things were created and existing together.", "268": "But when they all were collected in one place, then some sort of order was necessarily laid down for them for the sake of the production of them from one another which was hereafter to take place.", "269": "Now in things which exist in part, the principle of order is this, to begin with that which is most inferior in its nature, and to end with that which is the most excellent of all;", "270": "and what that is we will explain.", "271": "It has been arranged that seed should be the principle of the generation of animals.", "272": "It is plainly seen that this is a thing of no import­ ance, being like foam;", "273": "but when it has descended into the womb and remained there, then immediately it receives motion and is changed into nature ;", "274": "and nature is more excel­ lent than seed, as also motion is better than quiet in created things;", "275": "and nature, like a workman, or, to speak more cor­ rectly, like a faultless art, endows the moist substance with life, and fashions it, distributing it among the limbs and parts of the body, allotting that portion which can produce breath, and nourishment, and sensation to the powers of the soul:", "276": "for as to the reasoning powers, we may pass over them for the present, on account of those who say, that the mind enters into the body from without, being something divine and eternal.", "277": "Nature therefore began from an insignificant seed, and ended in the most honourable of things, namely, in the for­ mation of animals and men.", "278": "And the very same thing took place in the creation of every thing:", "279": "for when the Creator determined to make animals the first created in his arrange­ ment were in some degree inferior, such as the fishes, and the last were the best, namely, man.", "280": "And the others the ter­ restrial and winged creatures were between these extremes, being better than the first created, and inferior to the last.", "281": "XXIII.", "282": "So then after all the other things, as has been­ said before, Moses says that man was made in the image and likeness of God.", "283": "And he says well;", "284": "for nothing that is born on the earth is more resembling God than man.", "285": "And let no one think that he is able to judge of this likeness from the charac­ ters of the body :", "286": "for neither is God a being with the form of a man, nor is the human body like the form of God;", "287": "but the resemblance is spoken of with reference to the most important part of the soul, namely, the mind:", "288": "for the mind which exists in each individual has been created after the likeness of that one mind which is in the universe as its primitive model, being in some sort the God of that body which carries it about and bears its image within it.", "289": "In the same rank that the great Governor occupies in the universal world, that same as it seems does the mind of man occupy in man;", "290": "for it is invisible, though it sees everything itself;", "291": "and it has an essence which is undiscernible, though it can discern the essences of all other things, and making for itself by art and science all sorts of roads leading in divers directions, and all plain;", "292": "it traverses land and sea, investigating every­ thing which is contained in either element.", "293": "And again, being raised up on wings, and so surveying and contemplating the air, and all the commotions to which it is subject, it is borne upwards to the higher firmament, and to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.", "294": "And also being itself involved in the revo­ lutions of the planets and fixed stars according to the perfect laws of music, and being led on by love, which is the guide or wisdom, it proceeds onwards till, having surmounted all essence intelligible by the external senses, it comes to aspire to such as is perceptible only by the intellect:", "295": "and perceiving in that, the original models and ideas of those things intelli­ ble by the external senses which it saw here full of surpassing beauty, it becomes seized with a sort of sober intoxication like the zealots engaged in the Corybantian festivals, and yields to enthusiasm, becoming filled with another desire, and a more excellent longing, by which it is conducted onwards to the very summit of such things as are perceptible only to the intellect, till it appears to be reaching the great King himself.", "296": "And while it is eagerly longing to behold him pure and unmingled, rays of divine light are poured forth upon it like a torrent, so as to bewilder the eyes of its intelligence by their splendour.", "297": "But as it is not every image that resembles its archetypal model, since many are unlike, Moses has shown this by adding to the words \" after his image,\" the expression, “in his likeness,\" to prove that it means an accurate impression, having a clear and evident resemblance in form.", "298": "XXIV.", "299": "And he would not err who should raise the ques­ tion why Moses attributed the creation of man alone not to one creator, as he did that of other animals, but to several.", "300": "For he introduces the Father of the universe using this language:", "301": "Let us make man after our image, and in our likeness.\"", "302": "Had he then, shall I say, need of any one whatever to help him, He to whom all things are subject?", "303": "Or, when he was making the heaven and the earth and the sea, was he in need of no one to co-operate with him ;", "304": "and yet was he unable himself by his own power to make man an animal so short-lived and so exposed to the assaults of fate without the assistance of others?", "305": "It is plain that the real cause of his so acting is known to God alone, but one which to a reasonable conjecture appears probable and credible, I think I should not conceal;", "306": "and it is this.", "307": "Of existing things, there are some which partake neither of virtue nor of vice;", "308": "as for instance, plants and irrational ani­ mals ;", "309": "the one, because they are destitute of soul, and are regulated by a nature void of sense;", "310": "and the other, because they are not endowed with mind or reason.", "311": "But mind and reason may be looked upon as the abode of virtue and vice ;", "312": "as it is in them that they seem to dwell.", "313": "Some things again partake of virtue alone, being without any participation in any kind of vice ;", "314": "as for instance, the stars, for they are said to be animals, and animals endowed with intelligence ;", "315": "or I might rather say, the mind of each of them is wholly and entirely virtuous, and unsusceptible of every kind of evil.", "316": "Some things again are of a mixed nature, like man, who is capable of opposite qualities, of wisdom and folly, of temperance and dissoluteness, of cou­ rage and cowardice, of justice and injustice, in short of good and evil, of what is honourable and what is disgraceful, of virtue and vice.", "317": "Now it was a very appropriate task for God the Father of all to create by himself alone, those things which were wholly good, on account of their kindred with himself.", "318": "And it was not inconsistent with his dignity to create those which were indifferent since they too are devoid of evil, which is hateful to him.", "319": "To create the beings of a mixed nature, was partly consistent and partly inconsistent with his dignity ;", "320": "consistent by reason of the more excellent idea which is mingled in them;", "321": "inconsistent because of the opposite and worse one.", "322": "It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, “Let us make man,\" which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants.", "323": "in order that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man, when he does right attributed to him;", "324": "and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.", "325": "For it was fitting that the Father should in the eyes of his children be free from all imputation of evil;", "326": "and vice and energy in accordance with vice arc evil.", "327": "And very beautifully after he had called the whole race “man,\" did he distinguish between the sexes, saying, that “ they were created male and female ;", "328": "\" although all the individuals of the race had not yet assumed their distinc­ tive form;", "329": "since the extreme species are contained in the genus, and are beheld, as in a mirror, by those who are able to discern acutely.", "330": "XXV.", "331": "And some one may inquire the cause why it was that man was the last work in the creation of the world.", "332": "For the Creator and Father created him after every thing else as the sacred scriptures inform us.", "333": "Accordingly, they who have gone most deeply into the laws, and who to the best of their power have investigated everything that is contained in them with all diligence, say that God, when he had given to man to partake of kindred with himself, grudged him neither reason, which is the most excellent of all gifts, nor anything else that is good;", "334": "but before his creation, provided for him every thing in the world, as for the animal most resembling himself, and dearest to him, being desirous that when he was born, he should be in want of nothing requisite for living, and for living well;", "335": "the first of which objects is provided for by the abun­ dance of supplies which are furnished to him for his enjoyment, and the other by his power of contemplation of the heavenly bodies, by which the mind is smitten so as to conceive a love and desire for knowledge on those subjects ;", "336": "owing to which desire, philosophy has sprung up, by which, man, though mortal, is made immortal.", "337": "As then, those who make a feast do not invite their guests to the entertainment before they have provided everything for festivity, and as those who celebrate gymnastic or dramatic contests, before they assemble the specta­ tors, provide themselves with an abundance of competitors and spectacles, and sweet sounds, with which to fill the theatres and the stadia;", "338": "so in the same manner did the Ruler of all, as a man proposing games, or giving a banquet and being about to invite others to feast and to behold the spectacle, first provide everything for every kind of entertainment, in order that when man came into the world he might at once find a feast ready for him, and a most holy theatre ;", "339": "the one abound­ ing with everything which the earth, or the rivers, or the sea, or air, brings forth for use and enjoyment, and the other being full of every description of light, which has either its essence or its qualities admirable, and its motions and revolutions worthy of notice, being arranged in perfect order, both as to the propor­ tions of its numbers, and the harmony of its periods.", "340": "And a man would not be far wrong who should say that in all these things there might be discovered that archetypal and real model music, the images of which the subsequent generations of mankind engraved in their own souls, and in this way handed down the art which is the most necessary and the most advantageous to human life.", "341": "XXVI.", "342": "This is the first reason on account of which it seems that man was created after all other animals.", "343": "And there is another not altogether unreasonable, which I must mention.", "344": "At the moment of his first birth, man found all the requisites for life ready prepared for him that he might teach them to those who should come afterwards.", "345": "Nature all but crying out with a distinct voice, that men, imitating the Author of their being, should pass their lives without labour and with­ out trouble, living in the most ungrudging abundance and plenty.", "346": "And this would be the case if there were neither irrational pleasures to obtain mastery over the soul raising up a wall of gluttony and lasciviousness, nor desires of glory, or power, or riches, to assume dominion over life, nor pains to contract and warp the intellect, nor that evil councillor-fear, to restrain the natural inclinations towards virtuous actions, nor folly and cowardice, and injustice, and the incalculable multitude of other evils to attack them.", "347": "But now that all the evils which I have now been mentioning are vigorous, and that men abandon themselves without restraint to their passions, and to those unbridled and guilty inclinations, which it is im­ pious even to mention, justice encounters them as a suitable chastiser of wicked habits ;", "348": "and therefore, as a punishment for wrong doers, the necessaries of life have been made difficult of acquisition.", "349": "For men ploughing up the plains with difficulty, and bringing streams from rivers, and fountains by channels, and sowing and planting, and submitting indefatigably day and night to the labour of cultivating the ground, provide them­ selves every year with what is necessary, even that at times being attended with pain ;", "350": "and not very sufficient in quantity, from being injured by many causes.", "351": "For either a fall of inces­ sant rain has carried away the crops, or the weight of hail which has fallen upon them has crushed them altogether, or snow has chilled them, or the violence of the winds has torn them up by the roots;", "352": "for water and air cause many alterations, tending to destroy the productiveness of the crops.", "353": "But if the immo­ derate violence of the passions were appeased by temperance, and the inclination to do wrong and depraved ambition were corrected by justice, and in short if the vices and unhallowed actions done in accordance with them, were corrected by the virtues, and the energies in accordance with them, the war of the soul being terminated, which is in good truth the most grievous and heavy of all wars, and peace being established, and founding amid all our faculties, a due regard for law, with all tranquillity and mild­ ness, then there would be hope that God, as being a friend to virtue, and a friend to honour, and above all a friend to man, would bestow upon the race of man, all kinds of spontaneous blessings from his ready store.", "354": "For it is evident that it is easier to supply most abundantly the requisite supplies without having recourse to agricultural means, from treasures which already exist, than to bring forth what as yet has no existence.", "355": "XXVII.", "356": "I have now mentioned the second reason.", "357": "There is also a third, which is as follows :", "358": "—God, intending to adapt the beginning and the end of all created things together, as being all necessary and dear to one another, made heaven the be­ ginning, and man the end :", "359": "the one being the most perfect of incorruptible things, among those things which are perceptible by the external senses;", "360": "and the other, the best of all earth­ born and perishable productions-a short-lived heaven if one were to speak the truth, bearing within himself many starlike natures, by means of certain arts and sciences, and illustrious speculations, according to every kind of virtue.", "361": "For since the corruptible and the incorruptible, are by nature opposite, he has allotted the best thing of each species to the beginning and to the end.", "362": "Heaven, as I before said, to the beginning, and man to the end.", "363": "XXVIII.", "364": "And besides all this, another is also mentioned among the necessary causes.", "365": "It was necessary that man should be the last of all created beings :", "366": "in order that being so, and appearing suddenly, he might strike terror into the other animals.", "367": "For it was fitting that they, as soon as they first saw him should admire and worship him, as their natural ruler and master ;", "368": "on which account, they all, as soon as they saw him, became tame before him;", "369": "even those, who by nature were most savage, becoming at once most manageable at the first sight of him;", "370": "displaying their unbridled ferocity to one another, and being tame to man alone.", "371": "For which reason the Father who made him to be a being dominant over them by na­ ture not merely in fact, but also by express verbal appointment, established him as the king of all the animals, beneath the moon, whether terrestrial or aquatic, or such as traverse the air.", "372": "For every mortal thing which lives in the three elements, land, water or air, did he put in subjection to him, excepting only the beings that are in heaven, as creatures who have a more divine portion.", "373": "And what is apparent to our eyes is the most evident proof of this.", "374": "For at times, innumerable herds of beasts are led about by one man, not armed, nor wearing iron, nor any defensive weapon, but clad only in a skin for a garment, and carrying a staff, for the purpose of making signs, and to lean upon also in his journeys if he become weary.", "375": "And so the shepherd, and the goatherd, and the cowherd, lead numerous flocks of sheep, and goats, and herds of oxen ;", "376": "men neither vigorous, nor active in their bodies, so as to strike those who behold them with admiration because of their fiue appearance;", "377": "and all the might and power of such numerous and well-armed beasts (for they have means of self-defence given them by nature), yet dread them as slaves do their master, and do all that is commanded them.", "378": "Bulls are yoked to the plough to till the ground, and cutting deep furrows all day, sometimes even for a long space of time together, while some farmer is managing them.", "379": "And rams being weighed down with heavy fleeces of wool, in the spring season, at the command of the shepherd, stand quietly, and lying down, without resistance, permit their wool to be shorn off, being accustomed naturally, like cities, to yield a yearly tribute to their sove­ reign.", "380": "And moreover, that most spirited of animals, the horse, is easily guided after he has been bridled;", "381": "in order that he may not become frisky, and shake off the rein ;", "382": "and he hollows his back in an admirable manner to receive his rider and to afford him a good seat, and then bearing him aloft, he gallops at a rapid pace, being eager to arrive at and carry him to the place to which he is urging him.", "383": "And the rider without any toil, but in the most perfect quiet, makes a rapid journey, by using the body and feet of another animal.", "384": "XXIX.", "385": "And any one who was inclined to dwell upon this subject might bring forward a great many other instances, to prove that there is no animal in the enjoyment of perfect liberty, and exempt from the dominion of man;", "386": "but what has been already said is sufficient by way of example.", "387": "We ought, how­ ever, not to be ignorant of this also, that it is no proof because man was the last created animal that he is the lowest in rank, and charioteers and pilots are witnesses of this ;", "388": "for the charioteers sit behind their beasts of burden, and are placed at, their backs, and yet when they have the reins in their hands, they guide them wherever they choose, and at one time they urge them on to a swift pace, and at another time they hold them back, if they are going on at a speed greater than is desirable.", "389": "And pilots again, sitting in the hindmost part of the ship, that is the stern are, as one may say, the most important of all the people in the ship, inasmuch as they have the safety of the ship and of all those who are in it, in their hands.", "390": "And so the Creator has made man to be as it were a charioteer and pilot over all other animals, in order that he may hold the reins and direct the course of every thing upon earth, having the superintendence of all animals and plants, as a sort of viceroy of the principal and mighty King.XXX.", "391": "But after the whole world had been completed ac­ cording to the perfect nature of the number six, the Father hallowed the day following, the seventh, praising it, and calling it holy.", "392": "For that day is the festival, not of one city or one country, but of all the earth ;", "393": "a day which alone it is right to call the day of festival for all people, and the birthday of the world.", "394": "And I know not if any one would be able to celebrate the nature of the number seven in adequate terms, since it is superior to every form of expression.", "395": "But it does not follow that because it is more admirable than anything that can be.", "396": "said of it, that on that account one ought to keep silence ;", "397": "but rather we ought to try, even if one cannot say everything which is proper, or even that which is most proper, at all events to utter such things as may be attainable by our capacities.", "398": "The number seven is spoken of in two ways;", "399": "the one within the number ten which is measured by repeating the unit alone seven times, and which consists of seven units;", "400": "the other is the number outside ten, the beginning of which is altogether the unit increasing according to a twofold or threefold, or any other proportion whatever;", "401": "as are the numbers sixty-four, and seven hundred and twenty-nine ;", "402": "the one number of which is increased by doubling on from the unit, and the other by trebling.", "403": "And it is not well to examine either species super­ ficially, but the second has a most manifest pre-eminence.", "404": "For in every case the number which is combined from the unit in double or treble ratio, or any other ratio, whatsoever, is the seventh number, a cube and a square, embracing both species, both that of the incorporeal and that of the corporeal essence.", "405": "That of the incorporeal essence according to the superficies which quadrangular figures present, and that of the corporeal essence according to the other figure which cubes make ;", "406": "and the clearest proof of this is afforded by the numbers already spoken of.", "407": "In the seventh number increasing immediately from the unit in a twofold ratio, namely, the number sixty-four, is a square formed by the multiplication of eight by eight, and it is also a cube, by the multiplication of four and four, four times.", "408": "And again, the seventh number from the unit being increased in a threefold ratio, that is to say, the number seven hundred and twenty-nine, is a square, the number seven and twenty being multiplied by itself;", "409": "and it is also a cube, by nine being multiplied by itself nine times.", "410": "And in every case a man making his beginning from the unit, and proceeding on to the seventh number, and increasing in the same ratio till he comes to the number seven, will at all times find the number, when increased, both a cube and a square.", "411": "At all events, he who begins with the number sixty-four, and combines them in a doubling ratio, will make the seventh number four thousand and ninety-six, which is both a square and a cube, having sixty- four as its square root, and sixteen as its cube root.", "412": "XXXI.", "413": "And we must also pass on to the other species of the number seven, which is contained in the number ten, and which displays an admirable nature, and one not inferior to the previously mentioned species.", "414": "The number seven consists of one, and two and four, numbers which have two most har­ monious ratios, the twofold and the fourfold ratio;", "415": "the former of which affects the diapason harmony, while the fourfold ratio causes that of the double diapason.", "416": "It also comprehends other divisions, existing in some kind of yoke-like combination.", "417": "For it is divided first of all into the number one, and the num­ ber six;", "418": "then into the two and the five;", "419": "and last of all, into the three and the four.", "420": "And the proportion of these numbers is a most musical one ;", "421": "for the number six bears to the num­ ber one a sixfold ratio, and the sixfold ratio causes the greatest possible.", "422": "difference between existing tones;", "423": "the distance namely, by which the sharpest tone is separated from the flattest, as we shall show when we pass on from numbers to the discussion of harmony.", "424": "Again, the ratio of four to two displays the greatest power in harmony, almost equal to that of the diapason, as is most evidently shown in the rules of that art.", "425": "And the ratio of four to three effects the first harmony, that in the thirds, which is the diatessaron,XXXII.", "426": "The number seven displays also another beauty which it possesses, and one which is most sacred to think of.", "427": "For as it consists of three and four, it displays in existing things a line which is free from all deviation and upright by nature.", "428": "And in what way it does so I must show.", "429": "The rectangular triangle, which is the beginning of all qualities, consists of the numbers three* and four, and fivé;", "430": "and the three and the four, which are the essence of the seven, contain the right angle ;", "431": "for the obtuse angle and the acute angle show irregularity, and disorder, and inequality;", "432": "for one may be more acute or more obtuse than another.", "433": "But a right angle does not admit of comparison, nor is one right angle more a right angle than another :", "434": "but one remains similar to another, never changing its peculiar nature.", "435": "But if the right-angled triangle is the beginning of all figures and of all qualities, and if the essence of the number seven, that is to say, the numbers three and four together, supply the most necessary part of this, namely, the right angle, then seven may be rightly thought to be the fountain of every figure and of every quality.", "436": "And besides what has been already advanced, this also may be as­ serted that three is

number seven, that it has a pre-eminent rank beyond all the other num­ bers in the first decade.", "442": "For of the other numbers, some pro­ duce without being produced, others are produced but have no productive power themselves ;", "443": "others again both produce and are produced.", "444": "But the number seven alone is contemplated in no part.", "445": "And this proposition we must confirm by demonstra­ tion.", "446": "Now the number one produces all the other numbers in order, being itself produced absolutely by no other;", "447": "and the number eight is produced by twice four, but itself produces no other number in the decade, Again, four has the rank of both, that is, of parents and of offspring;", "448": "for it produces eight when doubled, and it is produced by twice two.", "449": "But seven alone, as I said before, neither produces nor is produced, on which account other philosophers liken this number to Victory, who had no mother, and to the virgin goddess, whom the fable asserts to have sprung from the head of Jupiter :", "450": "and the Pythagoreans compare it to the Ruler of all things.", "451": "For that which neither produces, nor is produced, remains immov­ able.", "452": "For generation consists in motion, since that which is generated, cannot be so without motion, both to cause pro­ duction, and to be produced.", "453": "And the only thing which neither moves nor is moved, is the Elder, Ruler, and Lord of the universe, of whom the number seven may reasonably be called a likeness.", "454": "And Philolaus gives his testimony to this doctrine of mine in the following words :", "455": "—“For God,\" says he \" is the ruler and Lord of all things, being one, eternal, lasting, immovable, himself like to himself, and different from all other

things perceptible by the external senses, it displays a great and comprehensive power, contributing to the improvement of all terrestrial things, and affecting even the periodical changes of the moon.", "459": "And in what manner it does this, we must consider.", "460": "The number seven when compounded of numbers beginning with the unit, makes eight-and-twenty, a perfect number, and one equalised in its parts.", "461": "And the number so produced, is calculated to reproduce the revolutions of the moon, bringing her back to the point from which she first began to increase in a manner perceptible by the external senses, and to which she returns by waning.", "462": "For she increases from her first crescent-shaped figure, to that of a half circle in seven days ;", "463": "and in seven more, she becomes a full orb;", "464": "and then again she turns back, retracing the same path, like a runner of the diaulos,* receding from an orb full of light, to a half circle again in seven days, and lastly, in an equal number she diminishes from a half circle to the form of a crescent;", "465": "and thus the number before mentioned is completed.", "466": "And the number seven by those

dimensions, and the four boundaries, if it did not happen that the ideas of the first numbers, one, two, three and four, in in which the number ten is founded, comprised the nature of the number seven.", "472": "For the aforesaid numbers have four boundaries, the first, the second, the third, the fourth, and three intervals.", "473": "The first interval being that between one and two;",

admonitions when their offences seem involuntary, through want of foresight, in order to prevent their hereafter offending in a similar manner.", "632": "XLIV.", "633": "So Moses, summing up his account of the creation of the world, says in a brief style, \" This is the book of the creation of the heaven and of the earth, when it took place, in the day on which God made the heaven and the earth, and every green herb before it appeared upon the earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up.\"", "634": "Does he not here manifestly set before us incorporeal ideas perceptible only by the intellect, which have been appointed to be as seals of the perfected works, perceptible by the outward senses.", "635": "For before the earth was green, he says that this same thing, verdure, ex­ isted in the nature of things, and before the grass sprang up in the field, there was grass though it was not visible.", "636": "And we must understand in the case of every thing else which is de­ cided on by the external senses, there were elder forms and motions previously existing, according to which the things which were created were fashioned and measured out.", "637": "For although Moses did not describe everything collectively, but only a part of what existed, as he was desirous of brevity, beyond all men that ever wrote, still the few things which he has mentioned are examples of the nature of all, for nature perfects none of those which are perceptible to the outward senses without an incorporeal model.", "638": "XLV.", "639": "Then, preserving the natural order of things, and having a regard to the connection between what comes afterwards and what has gone before, he says next, \"And a fountain went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the earth.\"", "640": "For other philosophers affirm that all water is one of the four ele­ ments of which the world was composed.", "641": "But Moses, who was accustomed to contemplate and comprehend matters with a more acute and far-sighted vision, considers thus :", "642": "the vast sea is an element, being a fourth part of the entire universe, which the men after him denominated the ocean, while they look upon the smaller seas which we sail over in the light of harbours.", "643": "And he drew a distinction between the sweet and drinkable water and that of the sea, attributing the former to the earth, and considering it a portion of the earth, rather than of the ocean, on account of the reason which I have already mentioned, that is to say, that the earth may be held together by the sweet qualities of the water as by a chain;", "644": "the water acting in the manner of glue.", "645": "For if the earth were left entirely dry, so that no moisture arose and penetrated through its holes rising to the surface in various directions, it would split.", "646": "But now it is held together, and remains lasting, partly by the force of the wind which unites it, and partly because the moisture does not allow it to become dry, and so to be broken up into larger and smaller fragments.", "647": "This is one reason ;", "648": "and we must also mention another, which is aimed at the truth like an arrow at a mark.", "649": "It is not the nature of anything upon the earth to exist without a moist essence.", "650": "And this is indicated by the throwing of seed, which is either moist, as the seed of animals, or else does not shoot up without moisture, such as the seeds of plants ;", "651": "from which it is evident that it follows that the aforesaid moist essence must be a portion of the earth which produces everything, just as the flux of the catamenia is a part of women.", "652": "For by men who are learned in natural philosophy, this also is said to be the cor­ poreal essence of children.", "653": "Nor is what we are about to say inconsistent with what has been said ;", "654": "for nature has bestowed upon every mother, as a most indispensable part of her con­ formation, breasts gushing forth like fountains, having in this manner provided abundant food for the child that is to be born.", "655": "And the earth also, as it seems, is a mother, from which consideration it occurred to the early ages to call her Demetra, combining the names of mother and earth (γη̃ or δη).", "656": "For it is not the earth which imitates the woman, as Plato has said, but the woman who has imitated the earth which the race of poets has been accustomed with truth to call the mother of all things, and the fruit-bearer, and the .-giver of all things, since she is at the same time the cause of the generation and durability of all things, to the animals and plants.", "657": "Rightly, therefore, did nature bestow on the earth as the eldest and most fertile of mothers, streams of rivers, and fountains like breasts, in order that the plants might be watered, and that all living things might have abundant supplies of drink.", "658": "XLVI.", "659": "After this, Moses says that \"", "660": "God made man, having taken clay from the earth, and he breathed into his face the breath of life.\"", "661": "And by this expression lie shows most clearly that there is a vast difference between man as generated now, and the first man who was made according to the image of God.", "662": "For man as formed now is perceptible to the external senses, partaking of qualities, consisting of body and soul, man or woman, by nature mortal.", "663": "But man, made according to the image of God, was an idea, or a genus, or a seal, perceptible only by the intellect, incorporeal, neither male nor female, imperishable by nature.", "664": "But he asserts that the formation of the individual man, perceptible by the external senses is a composition of earthy substance, and divine spirit.", "665": "For that the body was created by the Creator taking a lump of clay, and fashioning the human form out of it;", "666": "but that the soul proceeds from no created thing at all, but from the Father and Ruler of all things.", "667": "For when he uses the expression, \" he breathed into,\" &c., he means nothing else than the divine spirit proceeding from that happy and blessed nature, sent to take up its habitation here on earth, for the advantage of our race, in order that, even if man is mortal according to that portion of him which is visible, he may at all events be immortal according to that portion which is invisible ;", "668": "and for this reason, one may properly say that man is on the boundaries of a better and an immortal nature, partaking of each as far as it is ne­ cessary for him ;", "669": "and that he was born at the same time, both mortal and the immortal.", "670": "Mortal as to his body, but immortal as to his intellect.", "671": "XLVII.", "672": "But the original man, he who was created out of the clay, the primeval founder of all our race, appears to me to have been most excellent in both particulars, in both soul and body, and to have been very far superior to all the men of subsequent ages from his pre-eminent excellence in both parts.", "673": "For he in truth was really good and perfect.", "674": "And one may form a conjecture of the perfection of his bodily beauty from three 'considerations, the first of which is this :", "675": "when the earth was now but lately formed by its separation from that abundant quantity of water which was called the sea, it hap­ pened that the materials out of which the things just created were formed were unmixed, uncorrupted, and pure ;", "676": "and the things made from this material were naturally free from all imperfection.", "677": "The second consideration is that it is not likely that God made this figure in the present form of a man, work­ ing with the most sublime care, after he had taken the clay from any chance portion of earth, but that he selected carefully the most excellent clay of all the earth, of the pure material choosing the finest and most carefully sifted portion, such as was especially fit for the formation of the work which he had in hand.", "678": "For it was an abode or sacred temple for a reason­ able soul which was being made, the image of which he was about to carry in his heart, being the most God-like looking of images.", "679": "The third consideration is one which admits of no comparison with those which have been already mentioned, namely, this:", "680": "the Creator was good both in other respects, and also in knowledge, so that every one of the parts of the body had separately the numbers which were suited to it, and was also accurately completed in the admirable adaptation to the share in the universe of which it was to partake.", "681": "And after he had endowed it with fair proportions, he clothed it with beauty of flesh, and embellished it with an exquisite corn­ plexion, wishing, as far as was possible, that man should appear the most beautiful of beings.", "682": "XLVIII.", "683": "And that he is superior to all these animals in regard of his soul, is plain.", "684": "For God does not seem to have availed himself of any other animal existing in creation as his model in the formation of man ;", "685": "but to have been guided, as I have said before, by his own reason alone.", "686": "On which account, Moses affirms that this man was an image and imitation of God, being breathed into in his face in which is the place of the sensations, by which the Creator endowed the body with a soul.", "687": "Then, having placed the mind in the dominant part as king, he gave him as a body of satellites, the different powers calculated to perceive colours and sounds, and flavours and odours, and other things of similar kinds, which man could never have distinguished by his own resources without the sen­ sations.", "688": "And it follows of necessity that an imitation of a perfectly beautiful model must itself be perfectly beautiful, for the word of God surpasses even that beauty which exists in the nature which is perceptible only by the external senses, not being embellished by any adventitious beauty, but being itself, if one must speak the truth, its most exquisite embellishment.", "689": "XLIX.", "690": "The first man, therefore, appears to me to have been such both in his body and in his soul, being very far supe­ rior to all those who live in the present day, and to all those who have gone before us.", "691": "For our generation has been from men :", "692": "but he was created by God.", "693": "And in the same proportion as the one Author of being is superior to the other, so too is the being that is produced.", "694": "For as that which is in its prime is superior to that the beauty of which is gone by, whether it be an animal, or a plant, or fruit, or anything else whatever of the productions of nature ;", "695": "so also the first man who was ever formed appears to have been the height of perfection of our entire race, and subsequent generations appear never to have reached an equal state of perfection, but to have at all times been inferior both in their appearance and in their power, and to have been constantly degenerating, which same thing I have also seen to be the case in the instance of the sculptors' and painters' art.", "696": "For the imitations always fall short of the ori­ ginal models.", "697": "And those works which are painted or fashioned from models must be much more inferior, as being still further removed from the original.", "698": "And the stone which is called the magnet is subject to a similar deterioration.", "699": "For any iron ring which touches it is held by it as firmly as possible, but another which only touches that ring is held less firmly.", "700": "And the third ring hangs from the second, and the fourth from the third, and the fifth from the fourth, and so on one from another in a long chain, being all held together by one attractive power, but still they are not all supported in the same degree.", "701": "For those which are suspended at a distance from the original attraction, are held more loosely, because the attractive power is weakened, and is no longer able to bind them in an equal'degree.", "702": "And the race of mankind appears to be subject to an in­ fluence of the same kind, since in men the faculties and dis­ tinctive qualities of both body and soul are less vivid an'd strongly marked in each succeeding generation.", "703": "And we shall be only saying what is the plain truth, if we call the original founder of our race not only the first man, but also the first citizen of the world.", "704": "For the world was his house and his city, while he had as yet no structure made by hands and wrought out of the materials of wood and stone.", "705": "And in this world lie lived as in his'own country, in all safety, removed from any fear, inasmuch as he had been thought worthy of the do­ minion over all earthly things;", "706": "and had everything that was mortal crouching before him, and taught to obey him as their master, or else constrained to do so by superior force, and living himself surrounded by all the joys which peace can be­ stow without a struggle and without reproach.", "707": "L.", "708": "But since every city in which laws are properly estab­ lished, has a regular constitution, it became necessary for this citizen of the world to adopt the same constitution as that which prevailed in the universal world.", "709": "And this constitution is the right reason of nature, which in more appropriate lan­ guage is denominated law, being a divine arrangement in ac­ cordance with which everything suitable and appropriate is assigned to every individual.", "710": "But of this city and constitution there must have been some citizens before man, who might be justly called citizens of a mighty city, having received the greatest imaginable circumference to dwell in ;", "711": "and having been enrolled in the largest and most perfect commonwealth.", "712": "And who could these have been but rational divine natures, some of them incorporeal and perceptible only by intellect, and others not destitute of bodily substance, such in fact as the stars ?", "713": "And he who associated with and lived among them was naturally living in a state of unmixed happiness.", "714": "And being akin and nearly related to the ruler of all, inasmuch as a great deal of the divine spirit had flowed into him, he was eager both to say and to do everything which might please his father and his king, following him step by step in the paths which the virtues prepare and make plain, as those in which those souls alone are permitted to proceed who consider the attaining a likeness to God who made them as the proper end of their existence.", "715": "LI.", "716": "We have now then set forth the beauty of the first created man in both respects, in body and soul, if in a way much inferior to the reality, still to the extent of our power, and the best of our ability.", "717": "And it cannot be but that his descendants, who all partake of his original character, must preserve some traces of their relationship to their father, though they may be but faint.", "718": "And what is this relationship ?", "719": "Every man in regard of his intellect is connected with divine reason, being an impression of, or a fragment or a ray of that blessed nature ;", "720": "but in regard of the structure of his body he is connected with the universal world.", "721": "For he is composed of the same materials as the world, that is of earth, and water, and air and fire, each of the elements having contributed its appropriate part towards the completion of most sufficient ma­ terials, which the Creator was to take in order to fashion this visible image.", "722": "And, moreover, mail dwells among all the things that have been just enumerated, as most appropriate places having the closest connection with himself, changing his abode, and going at different times to different places.", "723": "So that one may say with the most perfect propriety that mail is every kind of animal, terrestrial, aquatic, flying, and celestial.", "724": "For inasmuch as he dwells and walks upon the earth he is a terrestrial animal;", "725": "but inasmuch as he often dives and swims, and sails, he is an aquatic creature.", "726": "And merchants and cap­ tains of ships and purple dyers, and all those who let down their nets for oysters and fish, are a very clear proof of what is here said.", "727": "Again, inasmuch as his body is raised at times above the earth and uses high paths, lie may with justice be pronounced a creature who traverses the air;", "728": "and, moreover, he is a celestial animal, by reason of that most important of the senses, sight;", "729": "being by it brought near the sun and moon, and each of the stars, whether planets or fixed stars.", "730": "LII.", "731": "And with great beauty Moses has attributed the giving of names to the different animals to the first created man, for it is a work of wisdom and indicative of royal authority, and man was full of intuitive wisdom and self-taught, having been created by the grace of God, and, moreover, was a king.", "732": "And it is proper for a ruler to give names to each of his subjects.", "733": "And, as was very natural, the power of domination was exces­ sive in that first-created man, whom God formed with great care and thought worthy of the second rank in the creation, making him his own viceroy and the ruler of all other crea­ tures.", "734": "Since even those who have been born so many genera­ tions afterwards, when the race is becoming weakened by reason of the long intervals of time that have elapsed since the be­ ginning of the world, do still exert the same power over the irrational beasts, preserving as it were a spark of the dominion and power which has been handed down to them by succession from their first ancestor.", "735": "Accordingly, Moses says, that \"", "736": "God brought all the animals to man, wishing to see what names he would give to each.\"", "737": "Not because he was in doubt, for nothing is unknown to God, but because he knew that he had formed in mortal man a rational nature capable of moving of its own accord, in order that he might be free from all participation in vice.", "738": "But he was now trying him as a master might try his pupil, stirring up the disposition which he had implanted in him ;", "739": "and more­ over exciting him to a contemplation of his own works, that he might extemporise them names which should not be inappro­ priate nor unbecoming, but which should well and clearly dis­ play the peculiar qualities of the different subjects.", "740": "For as the rational nature was as yet uncorrupted in the soul, and as no weakness, or disease, or affliction had as yet come upon it, man having most pure and perfect perceptions of bodies and of things, devised names for them with great felicity and cor­ rectness of judgment, forming very admirable opinions as to the qualities which they displayed, so that their natures were at once perceived and correctly described by him.", "741": "And he was so excellent in all good things that he speedily arrived at the very perfection of human happiness.", "742": "LIII.", "743": "But since nothing in creation lasts for ever, but all mortal things are liable to inevitable changes and alterations, it was unavoidable that the first man should also undergo some disaster.", "744": "And the beginning of his life being liable to re­ proach, was his wife.", "745": "For, as long as he was single, he resembled, as to his creation, both the world and God ;", "746": "and he represented in his soul the characteristics of the nature of each, I do not mean all of them, but such as a mortal constitution was capable of admitting.", "747": "But when woman also was created, man perceiving a closely connected figure and a kindred for­ mation to his own, rejoiced at the sight, and approached her and embraced her.", "748": "And she, in like manner, beholding a creature greatly resembling herself, rejoiced also, and addressed him in reply with due modesty.", "749": "And love being engendered, and, as it were, uniting two separate portions of one animal into one body, adapted them to each other, implanting in each of them a desire of connection with the other with a view to the generation of a being similar to themselves.", "750": "And this desire caused likewise pleasure to their bodies, which is the beginning of iniquities and transgressions, and it is owing to this that men have exchanged their previously immortal and happy existence for one which is mortal and full of mis­ fortune.", "751": "LIV.", "752": "But while man was still living a solitary life, and before woman was created, the history relates that a paradise was planted by God in no respect resembling the parks which are seen among men now.", "753": "For parks of our day are only life­ less woods, -full of all kinds of trees, some evergreen with a view to the undisturbed delectation of the sight;", "754": "others bud­ ding and germinating in the spring season, and producing fruit, some eatable by men, and sufficient, not only for the ne­ cessary support of nature as food, but also for the superfluous enjoyment of luxurious life ;", "755": "and some not eatable by men, but of necessity bestowed upon the beasts.", "756": "But in the paradise, made by God, all the plants were endowed in the souls and reason, producing for their fruit the different virtues, and, moreover, imperishable wisdom and prudence, by which honour­ able and dishonourable things are distinguished from one another, and also a life free from disease, and exempt from corruption, and all other qualities corresponding to these al­ ready mentioned.", "757": "And these statements appear to me to be dictated by a philosophy which is symbolical rather than strictly accurate.", "758": "For no trees of life or of knowledge have ever at any previous time appeared upon the earth, nor is it likely that any will appear hereafter.", "759": "But I rather conceive that Moses was speaking in an allegorical spirit, intending by his paradise to intimate the dominant character of the soul, which is full of innumerable opinions as this figurative paradise was of trees.", "760": "And by the tree of life he was shadowing out the greatest of the virtues-namely, piety towards the gods, by means of which the soul is made immortal;", "761": "and by the tree which had the knowledge of good and evil, he was intimating that wisdom and moderation, by means of which things,' contrary in their nature to one another, are distinguished.", "762": "LV.", "763": "Therefore, having laid down these to be boundaries as it were in the soul, God then, like a judge, began to consider to which side men would be most inclined by nature.", "764": "And when he saw that the disposition of man had a tendency to wickedness, and was but little inclined to holiness or piety, by which qualities an immortal life is secured, he drove them forth as was very natural, and banished him from paradise;", "765": "giving no hope of any subsequent restoration to his soul which had sinned in such a desperate and irremediable manner.", "766": "Since even the opportunity of deceit was blameable in no slight degree, which I must not pass-over in this place.", "767": "It is said that the old poisonous and earthborn reptile, the serpent, uttered the voice of a man.", "768": "And he on one occasion coming to the wife of the first created man, reproached her' with her slowness and her excessive prudence, because she delayed and hesitated to gather the fruit which was com­ pletely beautiful to look at, and exceedingly sweet to enjoy, and was, moreover, most useful as being a means by which men might be able to distinguish between good and evil.", "769": "And she, without any inquiry, prompted by an unstable and rash mind, acquiesced in his advice, and ate of the fruit, and gave a portion of it to her husband.", "770": "And this conduct suddenly changed both of them from innocence and simplicity of cba­ racter to all kinds of wickedness ;", "771": "at which the Father of all was indignant.", "772": "For their actions deserved his anger, inasmuch as they, passing by the tree of eternal life, the tree which might have endowed them with perfection of virtue, and by means of which they might have enjoyed a long and happy life, preferred a brief and mortal (I will not call it life, but) time full of unhappiness ;", "773": "and, accordingly, he appointed them such punishment as was befitting.", "774": "LVI.", "775": "And these things are not mere fabulous inventions, in which the race of poets and sophists delights, but are rather types shadowing forth some allegorical truth, according to some mystical explanation.", "776": "And any one who follows a reasonable train of conjecture, will say with great propriety, that the aforesaid serpent is the symbol of pleasure, because in the first place lie is destitute of feet, and crawls on his belly with his face downwards.", "777": "In the second place, because he uses lumps of clay for food.", "778": "Thirdly, because he bears poison in his teetb, by which it is his nature to kill those who are bitten by him.", "779": "And the man devoted to pleasure is free from none of the aforementioned evils;", "780": "for it is with difficulty that he can raise his head, being weighed down and dragged down, since intemperance trips him up and keeps him down.", "781": "And he feeds, not on heavenly food, which wisdom offers to contem­ plative men by means of discourses and opinions ;", "782": "but on that which is put forth by the earth in the varying seasons of the year, from which arise drunkenness and voracity, and licen­ tiousness, breaking through and inflaming the appetites of the belly, and enslaving them in subjection to gluttony, by which they strengthen the impetuous passions, the seat of which is beneath the belly;", "783": "and make them break forth.", "784": "And they lick up the result of the labours of cooks and tavern-keepers ;", "785": "and at times some of them in ecstasy with the flavour of the delicious food, moves about his head and reaches forward, being desirous to participate in the sight.", "786": "And when he sees an ex­ pensively furnished table, he throws himself bodily upon the delicacies which are abundantly prepared, and devotes himself to them, wishing to be filled with them all together, and so to depart, having no other end in view than that he should allow nothing of such a sumptuous preparation to be wasted.", "787": "Owing to which conduct, he too, carries about poison in his teeth, no less than the serpent does ;", "788": "for his teeth are the ministers and servants of his insatiability, cutting up and smoothing everything which has a reference to eating, and committing them, in the first place to the tongue, which decides upon, and distinguishes between the various flavours, and, subsequently, to the larynx.", "789": "But immoderate indulgence in eating is natu­ rally a poisonous and deadly habit, inasmuch as what is so devoured is not capable of digestion, in consequence of the quantity of additional food which is heaped in on the top of it, and arrives before what was previously eaten is converted into juice.", "790": "And the serpent is said to have uttered a human voice, because pleasure employs innumerable champions and de­ fenders who take care to advocate its interests, and who dare to assert that the power over everything, both small and great, does of right belong to it without any exception whatever.", "791": "LVII.", "792": "Now, the first approaches of the male to the female have a pleasure in them which brings on other pleasures also, and it is through this pleasure that the formation and genera­ tion of children is carried on.", "793": "And what is generated by it appears to be attached to nothing rather than to it, since they rejoice in pleasure, and are impatient at pain, which is its con­ trary.", "794": "On which account even the infant when first brought forth cries, being as it seems in pain at the cold.", "795": "For coming forth on a sudden into the air from a very warm, and indeed, hot region-namely, the womb, in which it has been abiding a considerable time, the air being a cold place and one to which it is wholly unaccustomed, it is alarmed, and pours forth tears as the most evident proof of its grief and of its impatience at pain.", "796": "For every animal, it is said, hastens to pleasure as to the cud which is most indispensable and necessary to its very existence ;", "797": "and, above all other animals, this is the case with mail.", "798": "For other animals pursue pleasure only in taste and in the acts of generation;", "799": "but man aims at it by means of his other senses also, devoting himself to whatever sights or sounds can impart pleasure to his eyes or ears.", "800": "And many other things are said in the way of praise of this inclination, especially that it is one most peculiar and kindred to all animals.", "801": "LVIII.", "802": "But what has been already said is sufficient to show what the reasons were on account of which the serpent appears to have uttered a human voice", "803": "And it is on this account that Moses appears to me in the particular laws also which be issued in the respect to animals, deciding what were proper to be,eaten, and what were not, to have given especial praise to the animal called the serpent fighter.", "804": "This is a reptile with jointed legs above its feet, by which it is able to leap and to raise itself on high, in the same manner as the tribe of locusts.", "805": "For the serpent fighter appears to me to be no other than temperance expressed under a symbolical figure, waging an interminable and unrelenting warfare against intemperance and pleasure.", "806": "For temperance especially embraces economy and frugality, and pares down the necessities to a small number, preferring a life of austerity and dignity.", "807": "But intemperance is devoted to extravagance and superfluity, which are the causes of luxury and effeminacy to both soul and body, and to which it is owirg that in the opinion of wise men life is but a faulty thing, and more miserable than death.", "808": "LIX.", "809": "But its juggleries and deceits pleasure does not ven­ ture to bring directly to the man, but first offers them to the woman, and by her means to.", "810": "the man;", "811": "acting in a very natu­ ral and sagacious manner.", "812": "For in human beings the mind occupies the rank of the man, and the sensations that of the woman.", "813": "And pleasure joins itself to and associates itself with the sensations first of all, and then by their means cajoles also the mind, which is the dominant part.", "814": "For, after each of the senses have been subjected to the charms of pleasure, and has learnt to delight in what is offered to it, the sight being fasci-", "815": "Hated by varieties of colours and shapes, the hearing by liar­ monious sounds, the taste by the sweetness of flowers, and the smell by the delicious fragrance of the odours which are brought before it, these all having received these offerings, like handmaids, bring them to the mind as their master, leading with them persuasion as an advocate, to warn it against reject­ ing any of them whatever.", "816": "And the mind being immediately caught by the bait, becomes a subject instead of a ruler, and a slave instead of a master, and an exile instead of a citizen, and a mortal instead of an immortal.", "817": "For we must altogether not be ignorant that pleasure, being like a courtesan or mistress, is eager to meet with a lover, and seeks for panders in order by their means to catch a lover.", "818": "And the sensations are her panders, and conciliate love to her, and she employing them as baits, easily brings the mind into subjection to her.", "819": "And the sensations conveying within the mind the things which have been seen externally, explain and display the forms of each of them, setting their seal upon a similar affection.", "820": "For the mind is like wax, and receives the impressions of appearances through the sensations, by means of which it makes itself master of the body, which of itself it would not be able to do, as I have already said.", "821": "LX.", "822": "And those who have previously become the slaves of pleasure immediately receive the wages of this miserable and incurable passion.", "823": "For the woman having received vehement pains, partly in her travail, and partly such as are a rapid suc­ cession of agonies during the other portions of her life, and especially with reference to the bringing forth and bringing up of her children, to their diseases and their health, to their good or evil fortune, to an extent that utterly deprives her of her freedom and subjects her to the dominion of the man who is her companion, finds it unavoidable'to obey all his com­ mands.", "824": "And the man in his turn endures toils and labours, and continual sweats, in order to the providing of himself with necessaries, and he also bears the deprivation of all those spontaneous good things which the earth was originally taught to produce without requiring the skill of the farmer, and he is subjected to a state in which he lives in incessant labour, for the purpose of seeking for food and means of subsistence, in order to avoid perishing by hunger.", "825": "For I think that as the sun and the moon do continually give light, ever since they were originally commanded to do so at the time of the original creation of the universe, and as they constantly obey the divine injunction, for the sake of no other reason but because evil and disobedience are banished to a distance far from the boundaries of heaven :", "826": "so in the same way would the fertile and productive regions of the earth yield an immense abundance in the various seasons of the year, without any skill or co-operation on the part of the husbandman.", "827": "But at present the ever-flowing fountains of the graces of God have been checked, from the time when wicked­ ness began to increase faster than the virtues, in order that they might not be supplying men who were unworthy to be benefited by them.", "828": "Therefore, the race of mankind, if it had met with strict and befitting justice, must have been utterly destroyed, because of its ingratitude to God its benefactor and its Saviour.", "829": "But God, being merciful by nature, took pity upon them, and moderated their punishment.", "830": "And he per­ mitted the race to continue to exist, but he no longer gave them food as he had done before from ready prepared stores, lest if they were under the dominion of his evils, satiety and idleness, they should become unruly and insolent.", "831": "LXI.", "832": "Such is the life of those who originally were men of innocence and simplicity, and also of those who have come to prefer vice to virtue, from whom one ought to keep aloof.", "833": "And in his beforementioned account of the creation of the world, Moses teaches us also many other things, and especially five most beautiful lessons which are superior to all others.", "834": "In the first place, for the sake of convicting the atheists, he teaches us that the Deity has a real being and existence.", "835": "Now, of the atheists, some have only doubted of the existence of God, stating it to be an uncertain thing ;", "836": "but others, who are more audacious, have taken courage, and asserted positively that there is no such thing ;", "837": "but this is affirmed only by men who have darkened the truth with fabulous inventions.", "838": "In the second place he teaches us that God is one;", "839": "having reference here to the assertors of the polytheistic doctrine ;", "840": "men who do not blush to transfer that worst of evil constitu­ tions, ochlocracy, from earth to heaven.", "841": "Thirdly, he teaches, as has been already related, that the world was created;", "842": "by this lesson refuting those who think that it is uncreated and eternal, and who thus attribute no glory to God.", "843": "In the fourth place we learn that the world also which was thus created is one, since also the Creator is one, and he, making his creation to resemble himself in its singleness, em­ ployed all existing essence in the creation of the universe.", "844": "For it would not have been complete if it had not been made and composed of all parts which were likewise whole and com­ plete.", "845": "For there are some persons who believe that there are many worlds, and some who even fancy that they are boundless in extent, being themselves inexperienced and ignorant of the truth of those things of which it is desirable to have a correct knowledge.", "846": "The fifth lesson that Moses teaches us is, that God exerts his providence for the benefit of the world.", "847": "For it follows of necessity that the Creator must always care for that which he has created, just as parents do also care for their children.", "848": "And he who has learnt this not more by hearing it than by his own understanding, and has impressed on his own soul these marvellous facts which are the subject of so much contention- namely, that God has a being and existence, and that he who so exists is really one, and that he has created the world, and that he has created it one as has been stated, having made it like to himself in singleness ;", "849": "and that he exercises a con­ tinual care for that which he has created will live a happy and blessed life, stamped with the doctrines of piety and holiness.", "850": "I. \"", "851": "And the heaven and the earth and all their world was completed.”*", "852": "Having previously related the creation of the mind and of sense, Moses now proceeds to describe the perfection which was brought about by them both.", "853": "And he says that neither the indivisible mind nor the particular sen­ sations received perfection, but only ideas, one the idea of the mind, the other of sensation.", "854": "And, speaking symbolically, he calls the mind heaven, since the natures which can only be comprehended by the intellect are in heaven.", "855": "And sensation he calls earth, because it is sensation which has obtained a corporeal and somewhat earthy constitution.", "856": "The ornaments of the mind are all the incorporeal things, which are percep­ tible only by the intellect.", "857": "Those of sensation are the cor­ poreal things, and everything in short which is perceptible by the external senses.", "858": "II. \"", "859": "And on the sixth day God finished his work which he.", "860": "had made.\"", "861": "It would be a sign of great simplicity to think that the world was created in six days, or indeed at all in time;", "862": "because all time is only the space of days and nights, and these things the motion of the sun as he passes over the earth and under the earth does necessarily make.", "863": "But the sun is a portion of heaven, so that one must confess that time is a thing posterior to the world.", "864": "Therefore it would be cor­ rectly said that the world was not created in time, but that time had its existence in consequence of the world.", "865": "For it is the motion of the heaven that has displayed the nature of time.", "866": "When, therefore, Moses says, \" God completed his works on the sixth day,\" we must understand that he is speaking not of a number of days, but that he takes six as a perfect number.", "867": "Since it is the first number which is equalin its parts, -in the half, and the third and sixth parts, and since it is produced by the multiplication of two unequal factors, two and three.", "868": "And the numbers two and three exceed the incorporeality which exists in the unit;", "869": "because the number two is an image of matter being divided into two parts and dissected like matter.", "870": "And the number three is an image of a solid body, because a solid can be divided according to a threefold division.", "871": "Not but what it is also akin to the motions of organic animals.", "872": "For an organic body is naturally capable of motion in six directions, forward, backwards, upwards, downwards, to the right, and to the left.", "873": "And at all events he desires to show that the races of mortal, and also of all the immortal beings, exist according to their appropriate numbers ;", "874": "measuring mortal beings, as I have said, by the number six, and the blessed and immortal beings by the number seven.", "875": "First, therefore, having desisted from the creation of mortal creatures on the seventh day, he began the formation of other and more divine beings.", "876": "III.", "877": "For God never ceases from making something or other;", "878": "but, as it is the property of fire to burn, and of snow to chill, so also it is the property of God to be creating.", "879": "And much more so, in proportion as he himself is to all other beings the author of their working.", "880": "Therefore the expression, \" he caused to rest,\" is very appropriately employed here, not \" he rested.” , For he makes things to rest which appear to be producing others, but which in reality do not effect anything;", "881": "but he himself never ceases from creating.", "882": "On which account Moses says, \" He caused to rest the things which he had begun.\"", "883": "For all the things that are made by our arts when completed stand still and remain ;", "884": "but all those which are accomplished by the knowledge of God are moved at subsequent times.", "885": "For their ends are the beginnings of other things ;", "886": "as, for instance, the end of day is the beginning of night.", "887": "And in the same way we must look upon months and years when they come to an end as the beginning of those which are just about to follow them.", "888": "And so the generation of other things which are de­ stroyed, and the destruction of others which are generated is completed, so that that is true which is said that-", "889": "And nought that is created wholly dies;", "890": "But one thing parted and combined with others Produces a

happens to us when we are for a moment at a distance from its infection ;", "2558": "but at the exact moment of the enjoyment of pleasure we are com­ pletely deprived of all such perception as can arise from the operation of the outward senses, so that we seem to be mutilated.", "2559": "How then can it be anything but natural for the outward sense to denounce curses upon pleasure which thus

that the mind is wounded and destroyed.", "2562": "Why then does this one appear to be worse than all the other passions ?", "2563": "Because it is almost at the bottom of them all, as a sort of base or foundation for them, for desire originates in the love of pleasure, and pain consists in the removal of pleasure ;", "2564": "and fear again is caused by a desire to guard against its absence.", "2565": "So it is plain that all the passions are anchored on pleasure ;", "2566": "and perhaps one might say that they would absolutely have had no existence at all if pleasure had not been previously laid down as a foundation to support them.", "2567": "XXXVIII. \"", "2568": "Upon thy breast and upon thy belly shalt thou go.”*", "2569": "For passion works around these parts, the breast and the belly, like a serpent in his hole ;", "2570": "when pleasure has its efficient causes and its subject-matter, then it is in operation around the belly and the parts adjacent to the belly;", "2571": "and when it has not these efficient causes and this subject-matter, then it is occupied about the breast which is the seat of anger, for lovers of pleasure when deprived of their pleasures become embittered by their anger.", "2572": "But let us see what is shown by this sentence with greater accuracy.", "2573": "It so happens that our soul is divisible into three parts, and that one of its parts is the seat of reason, the second, the seat of courage, the third, the seat of the appetites.", "2574": "Some therefore of the philosophers have separated these parts from one another only in respect of their operations, and some have distinguished them also by their places.", "2575": "And then they have assigned the parts about the head to the residing part, saying where the king is, there also are his guards, and the guards of the mind are the external senses, which are seated about the head, so that the king may very naturally have his abode there too, as if he had been assigned the highest part of the city to dwell in.", "2576": "The chest is assigned to the courageous part, and they say, it is on this account, that nature has fortified that part with a dense and strong defence of closely conjoined bones, as though she had been arming a valiant soldier with a breastplate and shield to defend himself against his enemies.", "2577": "To the appetitive part they have assigned a situation about, the liver and the belly, for there it is that appetite dwells, being an irrational desire.", "2578": "XXXIX.", "2579": "If therefore you shall ever inquire, 0 my mind, what situation has been assigned to pleasure, do not take into your consideration the parts about the head, where the reasoning faculties of man have their abode, for you will not find it there;", "2580":

ever pleasure prevails, reason is put to flight.", "2583": "But seek first rather in the breast and in the belly, where courage and anger, and appetite abide, all which are parts of the irrational faculties.", "2584": "For it is there that our judgment is discovered, and also our passions.", "2585": "Therefore, the mind is not hindered by any external force from abandoning the legitimate objects of its attention, which can only be perceived by the intellect, and surrendering itself to those which are worse;", "2586": "but still this never happens except when there is a war in the soul, for then indeed it follows of necessity that reason must fall under the power of the inferior part of man, inasmuch as it is not of a warlike character, but is fond of peace.", "2587": "XL.", "2588": "At all events the holy scripture being well aware how great is the power of the impetuosity of each passion, anger and appetite, puts a bridle in the mouth of each, having appointed reason as their charioteer and pilot", "2589": "And first of all it speaks thus of anger, in the hope of pacifying and curing it;", "2590": "\"And you shall put manifestation and truth (the Urim and the Thummim), in the oracle of judgment, and it shall be on the breast of Aaron when he comes into the holy place before the Lord.\" *", "2591": "Now by the oracle is here meant the organs of speech which exist in us, which is in fact the power of language.", "2592": "Now language is either inconsiderate, and such as will not stand examination, or else it is judicious and well approved, and it brings us to form a notion of discreet speech.", "2593": "For Moses here speaks not of a random spurious oracle, but of the oracle of the judgment, which is equivalent to saying, a well-judged and carefully examined oracle;", "2594": "and of this well approved kind of language he says that there are two supreme virtues, namely, distinctness and truth, and he says well.", "2595": "For it is language which has in the first place enabled one man to make affairs plain and evident to his neighbour, when without it we should not be able to give any intimation of the impression produced on our soul by outward circumstances, nor to show of what kind they are.XLI", "2596": "On which account we have been compelled to have recourse to such signs as are given by the voices, that is nouns and verbs,

employing both its virtues, which in fact are nearly the only ones of which language is capable.", "2608": "'XLII.", "2609": "Moses, therefore, says that discreet discourse, having its own peculiar virtues, is placed on the breast of Aaron, that is to say, of anger, in order that it may in the first instance be guided by reason, and may not be injured by its own defi­ ciency in reason, and, in the second place, by distinctness, for there is no natural influence which makes anger a friend to distinctness.", "2610": "At all events, not only are the ideas of angry men, but all their expressions also, full of disorder and confu­ sion, and therefore it is very natural for the want of clearness on the part of anger to be rectified by clearness, and, in addition, by truth;", "2611": "for, among other things, anger has also this particular property of being inclined to misrepresent the truth.", "2612": "At all events, of all those who give way to this disposition scarcely any one speaks the strict truth, as if it were his soul and not his body that is under the influence of its intoxication.", "2613": "These, then, are the chief remedies suitable for that part of the soul which is influenced by anger, namely, reason, disinterestedness of language, and truth of language, for the three things are in power only one, namely, reason, curing anger, which is a per­ nicious disease of the soul, by means of the virtues truth and perspicuity.", "2614": "XLIII.", "2615": "To whom, or to what, then, does it belong to bear these things?", "2616": "Not to my mind, or to that of any chance person, but to the consecrated and purely sacrificial intellect, that, namely, of Aaron.", "2617": "And not even to this at all times, for it is frequently subject to change, but only when it is going on unchangeably, when it is entering into the holy place, when reason is entering in together with holy opinions, and is not abandoning them.", "2618": "But it often happens that the mind is at the same time entering into sacred and holy and purified opinions, but still such as are only human ;", "2619": "such, for instance, as opinions on what is expedient;", "2620": "opinions on successful actions ;", "2621": "opinions on what is in accordance with established law;", "2622": "opinions concerning virtue as it exists among men.", "2623": "Nor is the mind, when disposed in this way, competent to bear the oracle on its breast together with the virtues, but only that one which is going in before the Lord, that is to say, that one which doeth everything for the sake of God, and which estimates no­ thing as superior to the things of God;", "2624": "but attributes to them also their due rank, not indeed dwelling on them, but ascend­ ing upwards to the knowledge and understanding of an appre­ ciation of the honour due to the one God.", "2625": "For, in a mind which is thus disposed, anger will be directed by purified reason, which takes away its irrational part, and remedies what there is confused and disorderly in it by the application of dis­ tinctness, and eradicates its falsehood by truth.", "2626": "XLIV.", "2627": "Aaron, therefore, for he is a second Moses, restrain­ ing the breast, that is to say, the angry passions, does not allow them to be carried away by undistinguishing impulse, fearing lest, if they obtain complete liberty, they may become restiff, like a horse, and so trample down the whole soul.", "2628": "But he attends to and cures it, and bridles it in the first instance by reason, that so, being under the guidance of the best of charioteers, it may not become exceedingly unmanageable, and in the second place, by the virtues of language, distinct­ ness, and truth.", "2629": "For, if the angry passions were educated in such a way as to yield to reason and distinctness, and to culti­ vate the virtue of truthfulness, they would deliver themselves from great irritation and make the whole soul propitious.", "2630": "XLV.", "2631": "But he, as I have already said, having this passion, endeavours to cure it by the saving remedies already enumerated.", "2632": "But Moses thinks that it is necessary completely to extirpate and eradicate anger from the soul, being desirous to attain not to a state of moderation in the indulgence of the passions, but to a state in which they shall have absolutely no existence whatever, and the most Holy Scriptures bear witness to what I am here saying;", "2633": "for it says, \" Moses having taken the breast took it that it might be an offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration, and this was Moses's part.\"*", "2634": "Speaking very accurately, for it was the conduct of one who was both a lover of virtue and a lover of God, after having contemplated the whole soul, to take hold of the breast, which is the seat of the angry passions, and to take it away and eradicate it, that so when the warlike part had been wholly removed, the remainder might enjoy peace.", "2635": "And he removes this part not from any chance animal, but from the ram of consecration, although, indeed, a young heifer had been sacrificed;", "2636": "but, passing by the heifer, he came to the ram, because that is by nature an animal inclined to pushing and full of anger' and impetuosity, in reference to which fact the makers of military engines call many of their warlike machines rams.", "2637": "This ramlike and impetuous and undistinguishing character in us, therefore, is something fond of contention, and, contention is the mother of anger.", "2638": "In reference to which fact, they who are somewhat quarrelsome are very easily made angry in investigations and other discussions.", "2639": "Moses, therefore, does very properly endeavour to eradicate anger, that pernicious offspring of a contentious and quarrelsome soul, in order that the soul may become barren of such offspring and may cease from bringing forth mischievous things, and may become a portion consistent with the character of a lover of virtue, not being identical with either the breast or with anger, but with the absence of those qualities, for God has endowed the wise man with the best of all qualities, the power, namely, of eradicating his passions.", "2640": "You see, then, how the perfect man is always endeavouring to attain to a complete emancipation.", "2641": "from the power of the passions.", "2642": "But he who eradicates them being next to him, that is Aaron, labours to arrive at a state in which the passions have only a moderate power, as I have said before;", "2643": "for he is unable to eradicate the breast and the angry passions.", "2644": "But he bears the oracle, on which is distinctness and truth even beyond the guide himself, together with the appropriate and kindred virtues of language.", "2645": "XLVI.", "2646": "And he will, moreover, make the difference more evident to us by the following expression :", "2647": "-\"", "2648": "For the wave­ breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest, and unto his sons, for ever.\"\"'", "2649": "You see here that they are not able to take the breast alone, but they must take it with the shoulder;", "2650": "but Moses can take it without the shoulder.", "2651": "Why is this ?", "2652": "Because he, being per­ fect, has no inadequate or lowly ideas, nor is he willing to remain in a state in which the passions have even a moderate influence ;", "2653": "but he, by his exceeding power, does utterly extirpate the whole of the passions, root and branch.", "2654": "But the others, who go with faint endeavours and with but slight strength to war against the passions, are inclined to a reconciliation with them, and make terms with them, proposing terms of accommodotion, thinking that thus, like a charioteer, they may be able to bridle their extravagant impetuosity.", "2655": "And the shoulder is a symbol of labour and of the endurance of hardship ;", "2656": "and such a person is he who has the charge of and the care of administering the holy things, being occupied with constant exercise and labour.", "2657": "But he has no labour to whom God has given his perfect good things in great abundance, and he who attains to virtue by labour will be found to be less vigorous and less perfect than Moses, who received it as a gift from God without any labour or difficulty.", "2658": "For the mere fact of labouring is of itself inferior to and worse than the condition of being exempt from labour, so, also, what is imperfect is inferior to that which is perfect, and that which learns anything to that which has knowledge spontaneously and naturally.", "2659": "On this account it is that Aaron can only take the breast with the shoulder, but Moses can take it without the shoulder.", "2660": "And he calls it the heave-shoulder for this reason, because reason ought to be set over and to be predominant above the violence of anger, as a charioteer who is driving a hard-mouthed and restiff horse.", "2661": "And then the shoulder is no longer called the heave-shoulder, but the shoulder of removal, on this account, because it is fitting that the soul should not attribute to itself labour in the cause of virtue, but should remove it from itself and attribute it to God, confessing that it is not its own strength or its own power which has thus acquired what is good, but He who gave it a love for goodness.", "2662": "And so neither the breast nor the shoulder is taken, except from the virtue which bringeth salvation, as is natural, for then the soul is sacred when the angry passions are under the guidance of reason, and when labour does not bring conceit to the labourer, but when he owns his inferiority to God, his benefactor.", "2663": "XLVII.", "2664": "Now that pleasure dwells not only in the breast but also in the belly, we have already stated, showing that the belly is the most appropriate situation for pleasure;", "2665": "for we may almost call pleasure the vessel which contains all the pleasures ;", "2666": "for when the belly is filled, then the desires for all other pleasures are intense and vigorous, but when it is empty, then they are tranquil and steady.", "2667": "On which account Moses says, in another place, \" Every animal that goeth upon its belly, every animal which goeth on four legs at all times, and that has a multitude of feet, is unclean.\"*", "2668": "And such a creature is the lover of pleasure, inasmuch as he is always going upon his belly and pursuing the pleasures which relate to it.", "2669": "And God unites the animal which goes on four legs with him that crawls upon his belly, naturally ;", "2670": "for the passions of those who are absorbed in pleasure are four, as one most egregious account teaches.", "2671": "Therefore he who devotes himself as a slave to one of them, namely, to pleasure, is impure as much as he who lives in the indulgence of the whole four.", "2672": "This much having been premised, behold again the difference between the perfect man and him who is still advancing towards perfection.", "2673": "As, therefore, the perfect man was, just now, found to be competent to eradicate the whole of the angry feelings from the contentious soul and to make it submissive and man­ ageable, and peaceable and gentle to every one, both in word and deed ;", "2674": "and as he who is still advancing towards perfection is not able wholly to eradicate passion, for he bears the breast about with him, though he does educate it by the aid of judi­ cious language, which is invested with two virtues perspicuity and truth.", "2675": "XLVIII.", "2676": "So, also, now he who is perfectly wise, that is, Moses, will be found to have utterly shaken off and discarded the pleasures.", "2677": "But he who is only advancing towards perfec­ tion will be found to have escaped not from every pleasure, but to cling still to such as are desirable and simple, and to depre­ cate those which are superfluous and extravagant as unnecessary additions, for, in the case of Moses, God speaks thus :", "2678": "\"And he washed his belly and his feet, with the blood of the entire burnt offering.\"†", "2679": "Speaking very truly, for the wise man consecrates his entire soul as what is worthy to be offered to God, because it is free from all reproach, whether wilfully or unintentionally incorrect, and being thus disposed, he washes his whole belly and all the pleasures which it knows, and all which pursue it, and cleanses them and purifies them from all nncleanliness, not being content with any partial cleansing.", "2680": "But he is disposed to regard pleasure so contemptuously that he has no desire for even the necessary meat or drink, but nourishes himself wholly on the contemplation of divine things.", "2681": "On which account in another passage, he bears witness to himself, \" For forty-eight years he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water,\"* because he was in the holy mount listening to the oracular voice of God, who was giving him the law.", "2682": "But not only does he repudiate the whole belly, but he also at the same time washes off all the dirt from his feet, that is to say, to the supports in which pleasure proceeds.", "2683": "And the sup­ ports of pleasure are the efficient causes of it.", "2684": "For he who is advancing onwards to perfection is said \" to wash his bowels and his feet,\"t and not his whole belly.", "2685": "For he is not capable of rejecting the whole of pleasure, but he is content if he can purify his bowels, that is to say, his inmost parts from it, which the lovers of pleasure say are certain additions to preceding pleasures, and which originate in the superfluous ingenuity of cooks and makers of delicacies and laborious gourmands.", "2686": "XLIX.", "2687": "And he also displays, in a further degree, the mo­ deration of the passions of the man who is advancing towards perfection, by the fact that the perfect mail discards all the pleasures of the belly without being prompted by any command to do so, but that he who is only advancing onwards towards perfection only does so in consequence of being commanded.", "2688": "For, in the case of the wise man, we find the following expres­ sion used :", "2689": "—\"", "2690": "He washes his belly and his feet with water,\"‡ without any command, in accordance with his own unbidden inclination.", "2691": "But, in the case of the priests, he spoke thus:", "2692": "\" But their bowels and their feet,\" not they have washed, but \" they do wash ;", "2693": "\"§ speaking with very cautious exactness, for the perfect man must be moved in his own inclination towards the energies in accordance with virtue.", "2694": "But he who is only practising virtue must be instigated by reason, which points out to him what he ought to do, and it is an honourable thing to obey the injunctions of reason.", "2695": "But we ought not to be ignorant that Moses repudiates the whole of the belly, that is to say, the filling and indulging the belly, and almost renounces all the other passions likewise ;", "2696": "the lawgiver giving a lively representation of the whole from one part, starting from a universal example, and discussing, poten­ tially at least, the other points as to which he was silent.", "2697": "L.", "2698": "The filling of the belly is a most enduring and universal thing;", "2699": "and, as it were, a kind of foundation of the other passions.", "2700": "At all events, there is not one of them which can find any existence if it is not supported by the belly, on which nature has made everything to depend.", "2701": "On this account, when the goods of the soul had previously been born of Leah, and had ended in Judah,* that is to say, in confession, God being about to create also the improvements of the body, prepared Bilhah, the hand-maid of Rachel, to bear children on behalf of and before her mistress.", "2702": "And the name Bilhah, being inter­ preted, means deglutition.", "2703": "For he knew that not one of the corporeal faculties can exist without imbibing moisture and without the belly;", "2704": "but the belly is predominant over and the ruler of the whole body, and the preserver of this corporeal mass in a state of existence.", "2705": "And observe the subtle way in which all this is expressed;", "2706": "for you will not find a single word used superfluously.", "2707": "Moses indeed \" takes away the breast,\" but as for the belly he does not take that away, but he washes it.t", "2708": "Why so ?", "2709": "Because the perfectly wise man is able to repudiate and to

"2734": "How then am I to deal with them?", "2735": "\"It shall be a peg,\" says Moses, \" upon thy girdle, and thou shalt dig with it that is to say, reason shall be close to you in the case of the

day proceeding onwards from the east to the west.", "3343": "But their peculiar and voluntary motion is from west to east, according to which last motion we find that the periods of the seven planets

some of the others are unequal in point of time, but preserve a certain sort of relative proportion to one another and to the other three which have been mentioned.", "3346": "Accordingly, by one of the cherubim is understood the extreme outermost circumference of the entire heaven, in which the fixed stars celebrate their truly divine dance, which always proceeds on similar principles and is always the same, without ever leaving the order which the Father, who created them, appointed for them in the world.", "3347": "But the other of the cherubim is the inner sphere which is contained within that previously mentioned, which God origin­ ally divided in two parts, and created seven orbits, bearing a certain definite proportion to one another, and he adapted each of the planets to one of these ;", "3348": "and then, having placed each of these stars in its proper orbit, like a driver in a chariot, he did not entrust the reins to any one of them, fearing that some inharmonious sort of management might be the result, but he made them all to depend upon himself, thinking that, by that arrangement, the character of their motion would be rendered most harmonious.", "3349": "For

their motion and the everlasting agitation of the entire heaven.", "3354": "And may we not say, according to another way of understanding this alle­ gory, that the two cherubim are meant as symbols of each of the hemispheres ?", "3355": "For they say that they stand face to face.", "3356": "inclining towards the mercy-seat;", "3357": "since the two hemispheres are also exactly opposite to one another, and incline towards the earth which is the centre of the whole universe, by which, also, they are kept apart from one another.", "3358": "But the only one of all the parts of the world that

will never be able by themselves alone to conceive any thing.", "3420": "Who, then, is it who sows good seed in them, except the Father of the universe, the uncreated God, he who is the parent of all things ?", "3421": "This, therefore, is the being who sows, and presently he bestows his own offspring, which he himself did sow;", "3422": "for God creates nothing for himself, inasmuch as he is in need of nothing, but he creates every thing for him who is able to take it.", "3423": "And I will bring forward as a competent witness in proof of what I have said, the most holy Moses.*", "3424": "For he introduces Sarah as conceiving a son when God beheld her by himself;", "3425": "but he represents her as bringing forth her son, not to him who beheld her then, but to him who was eager to attain to wisdom, and his name is called Abraham.", "3426": "And he teaches the same lesson more plainly in the case of Leah, where he says that \" God opened her womb.\"t", "3427": "But to open the womb is the especial business of the husband.", "3428": "And she having conceived, brought forth, not to God, for he alone is sufficient and all-abundant for himself, but to him who underwent labour for the sake of that which is good, namely, for Jacob ;", "3429": "so that in this instance virtue received the divine seed from the great Cause of all things, but brought forth her offspring to one of her lovers, who deserved to be preferred to all her other suitors.", "3430": "‡Again, when the all-wise Isaac addressed his supplications to God, Rebecca, who is perseverance, became pregnant by the agency of him who received the supplication;", "3431": "but Moses, who received Zipporah,* that is to say, winged and sublime virtue, without any supplication or entreaty on his part, found that she conceived by no mortal man.XIV.", "3432": "Now I bid ye, initiated men, who are purified, as to your ears, to receive these things, as mysteries which are really sacred, in your inmost souls;", "3433": "and reveal them not to any one who is of the number of the uninitiated, but guard them as a sacred treasure, laying them up in your own hearts, not in a storehouse in which are gold and silver, perishable substances, but in that treasure-house in which the most excellent of all the possessions in the world does lie, the knowledge namely of the great first Cause, and of virtue, and in the third place, of the generation of them both.", "3434": "And if ever you meet with any one who has been properly initiated, cling to that man affec­ tionately and adhere to him, that if he has learnt any more recent mystery he may not conceal it from you before you have learnt to comprehend it thoroughly.", "3435": "For I myself, having been initiated in the great mysteries by Moses, the friend of God, nevertheless, when subsequently I beheld Jere­ miah the prophet, and learnt that he was not only initiated Into the sacred mysteries, but was also a competent hierophant or expounder of them, did not hesitate to become his pupil.", "3436": "And he, like a man very much under the influence of inspira­ tion, uttered an oracle in the character of God, speaking in this manner to most peaceful virtue:", "3437": "\" Hast thou not called me as thy house, and thy father, and the husband of thy virginity ?", "3438": "\"t showing by this expression most manifestly that God is both a house, the incorporeal abode of incorporeal ideas, and the Father of all things, inasmuch as it is he who has created them;", "3439": "and the husband of wisdom, sowing for the race of mankind the seed of happiness in good and virgin soil.", "3440": "For it is fitting for God to converse with an unpolluted and un­ touched and pure nature, in truth and reality virgin, in a different manner from that in which we converse with such.", "3441": "For the association of men, with a view to the procreation of children, makes virgins women.", "3442": "But when God begins to associate with the soul, he makes that which was previously woman now again virgin.", "3443": "Since banishing and destroying all the degenerate appetites unbecoming a human being, by which it had been made effeminate, he introduces in their stead genuine, and perfect, and unadulterated virtues;", "3444": "therefore, he will not converse with Sarah before all the habits, such as other women have, have left her,.", "3445": "and till she has returned into the class of pure virgins.", "3446": "XV.", "3447": "But it is, perhaps, possible that in some cases a virgin soul may be polluted by intemperate passions, and so become impure.", "3448": "On which account the sacred oracle has been cautious, calling God the husband, not of a virgin, for a virgin is subject to change and to mortality, but of virginity;", "3449": "of an idea, that is to say, which is always existing in the same principles and in the same manner.", "3450": "For as all things endowed with distinctive qualities are by nature liable to origination and to destruction, so those archetypal powers, which are the makers of those par­ ticular things, have received an imperishable inheritance in their turn.", "3451": "Therefore is it seemly that the uncreated and unchangeable", "3452": "God should ever sow the ideas of immortal and virgin virtues in a woman who is transformed into the appear­ ance of virginity ?", "3453": "Why, then, 0 soul, since it is right for you to dwell as a virgin in the house of God, and to cleave to wis­ dom, do you stand aloof from these things, and rather embrace the outward sense, which makes you effeminate and pollutes you ?", "3454": "Therefore, you shall bring forth an offspring altogether polluted and altogether destructive, the fratricidal and accursed Cain, a possession not to be sought after ;", "3455": "for the name Cain being interpreted means possession.", "3456": "XVI.", "3457": "And one may wonder at the kind of narration which the Jewish lawgiver frequently employs in many instances, where he departs from the usual style.", "3458": "For after giving the history of those parents of the human race who were created out of the earth, he begins to relate the story of the first-born of human parents, concerning whom he says absolutely nothing, as if he had already frequently mentioned his name, and were not now bringing it forward for the first time.", "3459": "Accordingly, he simply says that \" she brought forth Cain.\"", "3460": "What sort of being was he, 0 writer;", "3461": "and what have you ever said about him before of either great or small importance?", "3462": "And yet you are not ignorant of the importance of a proper application of names.", "3463": "For before this time, as you proceed in your history, you show this, when speaking in reference to the same person you say, \"And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth a son, and she called his name Seth.\"*", "3464": "Therefore it was much more necessary in the case of the first­ horn, who was the beginning of the generation of men from one another, to display the nature of him who was thus conceived and born, in the first place showing that he was a male child, and secondly mentioning his peculiar name, Cain.", "3465": "Since, therefore, it was not owing to inexperience or to ignorance of according to what persons he ought to give names, that he appears to have discarded his usual practice in the case of Cain, we must now consider on what account he thus named those who were born of our first parents, rather mentioning the name in an incidental way than actually giving it.", "3466": "And the cause, as it appears to me, according to the best conjecture that I can form, is this.", "3467": "XVII.", "3468": "All the rest of the human race gives names to things which are different from the things themselves, so that the thing which we see is one thing, but the name which we give it is another;", "3469": "but in the history of Moses the names which he affixes to things are the most conspicuous energies of the things themselves, so that the thing itself is at once of necessity its name, and is in no respect different from the name which is imposed on it.", "3470": "And you may learn this more clearly from the previous example which I have mentioned.", "3471": "When the mind which is in us, and let it be called Adam, meet­ in,, with the outward sense, according to which all living creatures appear to exist (and that is called Eve), having conceived a desire for connection, is associated with this out­ ward sense, that one conceives as in a net, and hunts after the external object of outward sense naturally.", "3472": "For by means of the eyes it arrives at a conception of colour, by the ears it conceives sound, by the nostrils it arrives at a conception of smells, of flavours by the organs of taste, and of all substance by those of touch;", "3473": "and having thus conceived it becomes preg­ nant, and immediately it is in labour, and brings forth the great­ est of all the evils of the soul, namely, vain opinion, for it con­ ceives an opinion that everything that it has seen, that it has heard, that it has tasted, that it has smelled, or that it has touched, belongs to itself, and it looks upon itself as the inventor and creator of them all.", "3474": "XVIII.", "3475": "And there is nothing unnatural in its receiving this impression, for there was a time once when the mind had no conversation with the outward sense, and had no outward sense, being very far removed from all things which were gregarious and in the habit of associating together, and itself resembling those solitary animals which feed by themselves.", "3476": "Accordingly as at that time it was classed by itself it did not touch any body, inasmuch as it had no organ in itself by which to take hold of external objects, but it was blind, and devoid of power, not being such a being as most people call a person when they see any one deprived of his eyes, for such a person is destitute of only one external sense, and has great and abundant vigour in the others.", "3477": "But this mind, being curtailed of all the facul­ ties which are derived from the outward senses, and being really powerless, being but the half of a perfect soul, destitute of the faculty by which it might naturally be able to conceive bodies, being but a fragment of itself, deprived of its kindred organs, and as such unfortunately is wholly deprived of these or­ gans of the external senses on which it might rely as on a staff, and by which it might have been able to support itself when tottering.", "3478": "From which cause a great darkness is spread over all bodies, so that nothing can be visible through it;", "3479": "for there was no outward sense by which things could be distinguished.", "3480": "God therefore, wishing to give it the faculty of comprehend­ in,, not only incorporeal but also solid bodies, filled up the entire soul, attaching a second portion to that which he had already created, which he called appellatively woman, and by an especial name Eve, intimating the outward sense by a metaphorical expression.", "3481": "XIX.", "3482": "And she, the first moment that she was born, pours forth abundant light in a flood into the mind through each of her subordinate parts, as through so many holes, and having dissipated the previously existing mist, enabled it like a master to discern the natures of bodies at a distance and with perfect clearness ;", "3483": "and the mind being now irradiated with light, as if the beams of the sun had suddenly shone upon it after night, or as if it had just arisen from a deep sleep, or as if it had been to see a blind man suddenly restored to sight, came at once upon all the things with which creation was concerned, heaven, and earth, and water, and air, and plants, and animals, and their habits, and distinctive qualities, and faculties, and dispositions, and movements, and energies, and actions, and changes, and ends;", "3484": "and some things he saw, and some things lie heard, and some he tasted, and some he smelled, and some he touched;", "3485": "and towards some be felt an inclination as they were productive of pleasure, and to some he felt aversion inas­ much as they caused pain.", "3486": "Having therefore looked around it on all sides, and having contemplated itself and its own faculties, it ventured to utter the same boast that Alexander the king of the Macedonians did, for they say that he, when he determined to lay claim to the supreme dominion over Europe and Asia, stood in a suit­ able place, and looking around him upon every thing, said. \"", "3487": "All things on this side and all things on that side are mine,\" displaying thus the emptiness of soul truly childish and infantine and foolish, and not at all royal.", "3488": "But the mind, hav­ ing first laid a claim to the faculties of the outward senses, and by means of them having conceived every idea of bodily substance, became filled with unreasonable pride and was puffed up, so as to think everything in the world its own property, and that nothing at all belonged to any one else.", "3489": "XX.", "3490": "This is that disposition in us which Moses characterised when he gave Cain his name, a name which being interpreted means possession, Cain himself being full of all folly or rather of all impiety;", "3491": "for instead of thinking that all possession belonged to God, he conceived that they all belonged to himself, though he was not only not able to possess even himself steadily, but he did not even know of what essence be consisted;", "3492": "but nevertheless he placed confidence in the outward senses, as being competent to attain the objects perceivable only by them.", "3493": "Let him tell us therefore how he will be able to avoid seeing wrongly, or being mistaken as to his hearing, or to escape even in any other of these outward senses.", "3494": "And in truth it is inevitable that these errors should continually befall every one of us, even if we should happen to be endowed with the most accurately constructed organs possible;", "3495": "for it is difficult, or I might rather say impossible, for any one completely to avoid the natural blemishes and involuntary errors which arise, since the efficient causes of erroneous opinions are innumerable, both within us and around us, and outside of us, and since they are to be found in every mortal creature, man, therefore, very improperly conceives every thing to belong to himself, however proud he may be, and however high he may carry his head.", "3496": "XXI And Laban, who relied greatly on his distinctive quali­ ties, appears to me to have afforded great amusement to Jacob, who was beyond all other men, a clear-sighted contemplator of the nature, which was free from any such qualities, when he ventured to say to him that, \"My daughter, and my sons, and my cattle, and all that you see, belong to me and to my daughters.\"*", "3497": "For adding the word \"my \" to each of these articles, he never ceases from speaking and boasting about himself.", "3498": "Your daughters now, tell me—and they are the arts and sciences of the soul-do you say that your daughters are your own property ?", "3499": "How so ?", "3500": "In the first place did you not receive them from the mind which taught them ?", "3501": "in the second place it is naturally possible for you to lose these also, as you might lose anything else, either forgetting them through the greatness of your other cares, or through severe and lasting sicknesses of body, or because of the incurable disease which is at all events destined for those who grow old, namely old age, or through ten thousand other accidents, the number of which it is impossible to calculate.", "3502": "And what will you say about the sons ?-and the sons are the reasonings which take place in portions of the soul,-if you pronounce that the sons belong to you, are you speaking reasonably, or are you downright mad for thinking so?", "3503": "For melancholic thoughts, and follies, and frenzies of the mind, and untrustworthy conjectures, and false ideas about things, and empty attractions of the mind, resembling dreams, and bringing with them convulsive agitation, and the disease which is innate in the soul, namely forgetfulness, and many other things beyond those that I have mentioned, take away the stability of your master-like authority, and show that these arc the possession of some one else and not of you.", "3504": "Again, what will you say about the cattle ?", "3505": "Now the cattle are the outward senses, for the outward sense is something un­ reasonable and brutish, like cattle, will you dare to call the cattle your property ?", "3506": "Tell me when you see erroneously, when you constantly hear erroneously, when you at one time think sweet flavours brackish, and at others look upon bitter flavours as sweet, when you in fact, in respect of every single one of these outward senses, are in the habit of being mistaken more frequently than you come to a correct decision, do you not blush?", "3507": "and if so, will you give yourself airs, and boast yourself as if you employed all the faculties and energies of the soul in such a way as never to err or to be mistaken.", "3508": "XXII.", "3509": "But if you were to become changed, and to become possessed of the senses which you ought to have, you would then affirm that everything was the property of God, not of yourself, all conceptions, all knowledge, all art, all speculation, all particular reasonings, all the outward senses, and all the energies of the soul, whether exerted by them or without them;", "3510": "and if you leave yourself throughout the whole of your life without any instructor, and without any teaching, you will be a slave for ever to harsh mistresses, such as vain opinions, appetites, pleasures, acts of injustice, follies, and erroneous conceptions;", "3511": "\" For if,\" says Moses, \" the servant shall answer and say, I am content with my master, and with my wife, and with my children, I will not depart and be free, then, being brought before the judgment-seat of God,\" and, having him for his judge, he shall securely have what he asked,\" \"having first had his ear bored through,\"* that he may not hear the words of God about freedom of soul.", "3512": "For it is a sign of a mind which is as it were rejected from the sacred contest and wholly discarded, and of reasoning faculties wholly childish and deficient, to make a boast of the mind being contented, and of thinking one's mind one's own lord and benefactor, and to boast of being very sufficiently pleased with the outward senses, and of thinking them one's own property, and the greatest of all good things, and their offspring with them;", "3513": "the offspring of the mind being to comprehend, to reason, to discriminate, to will, to conjecture;", "3514": "and the offspring of the outward sense being to see, to hear, to taste, to smell, to touch, in short to feel.", "3515": "XXIII.", "3516":

slavery for his soul instead of mastership, and being slain instead of slaying, and forcibly suffering himself all that he had designed to do to others.", "3527": "For such a man was truly the enemy of reason which establishes the truth, and of nature herself, setting up a claim to everything which was done as his own, and remembering not one of the things which happened to him while he was

property that he has acquired ;", "3805": "because he is the beginning of his chil­ dren, and the right of the first-born is his.\"", "3806": "tConsider, 0 my soul, and know who it is who is hated, and who is the son of her who is hated, and immediately you shall perceive that the chief rights and chief honours belong to no one else but to him alone;", "3807": "for there are two wives cohabiting with each individual of us, hostile and inimical to one another, filling the abode of the soul with the contentions which arise from jealousy.", "3808": "Of these we love one, which is gentle and tractable, and which we think very affectionate and akin to ourselves, and its name is pleasure ;", "3809": "but the other we hate, looking upon it as untameable, ungentle, fierce, and very hostile to us, and the name of this one is virtue.", "3810": "Now what mortal is ignorant of the great mysteries of that exceedingly beautiful and greatly contended for pleasure ?", "3811": "And who could worthily describe the multitude or the greatness of the good things which are treasured up by virtue ?", "3812": "They who have partaken of them already know it, and those whose nature is mild will hereafter know, when they have been invited to a participation in the banquet, not the banquet at which the pleasures of the satiated belly make the body fat, but that at which the mind is nourished and at which it revels among the virtues, and exults and revels in their company.", "3813": "VI.", "3814": "Now, on account of these things, and because of what was said before, namely, that the things which are really pious, holy, and good do naturally utter a voice from themselves, even while they keep silence, I will desist from saying any more about them;", "3815": "for neither does the sun nor the moon require an interpreter, because they, being on high, fill the whole world with light, the one shining by day and the other by night.", "3816": "But their own brilliancy is an evidence in their case which stands in no need of witnesses, but which is confirmed by the eyes, which are more undeniable judges than the ears.", "3817": "But I will speak with all freedom of that point in virtue which appears to have the greatest amount of difficulty and perplexity, for this, too, does appear to the imagination, at their first meeting, to be troublesome ;", "3818": "but, on consideration, it is found to be very pleasant and, as arising from reason, to be suitable.", "3819": "But labour is the enemy of laziness, as it is in reality the first and greatest of good things, and wages an irreconcileable war against pleasure;", "3820": "for, if we must declare the truth, God has made labour the foundation of all good and of all virtue to man, and without labour you will not find a single good thing in existence among the race of men.", "3821": "For, as it is impossible to see without light, since neither colours nor eyes are sufficient for the comprehension of things which we arrive at by means of sight (for nature has made light beforehand to serve as a link to connect the two, by which the eye is brought near and adapted to colour, for the powers of both eye and of colour are equally useless in darkness), so in the same manner is the eye of the soul unable to comprehend anything whatever of the actions in accordance with virtue, unless it takes to itself labour as a coadjutor, as the eye borrows the assistance of light;", "3822": "for this, being placed in the middle, between the intellect and the good object which the intellect desires, and understanding the whole nature of both the one and the other, does itself bring about friendship and harmony, two perfect goods between the two things on either hand of it.", "3823": "VII.", "3824": "For, choose whatever good thing you please, and you will find that it owes its existence and all its strength and solidity to labour.", "3825": "Now, piety and holiness are good things, but still we are not able to attain to them without the worship of the gods, and the worship of them is combined with persever­ alice in labours.", "3826": "Again, prudence and courage and justice are all beautiful things and perfect goods, but still they are not to be acquired by laziness, and we must be content if they can be attained to by continued diligence.", "3827": "Now, since the organs of every soul are not able to support a familiarity with God and with virtue, as being a very intense and mighty harmony, they very often get lax and become re­ miss so as to descend from the highest unto those of more moderate character ;", "3828": "but, nevertheless, even in these moderate ones there is great labour requisite.", "3829": "Look at all those who practise the encyclical branches of what is called elementary instruction ;", "3830": "look at those who cultivate the land, and at all who provide the means of subsistence by any regular business.", "3831": "These men are never free from care night or day, but always and continually, as it is said, they labour with hand and foot and with all their power, and never cease from suffering hard­ ship, so as often to encounter even death from it.", "3832": "VIlI.", "3833": "But as those who are thus anxious to render their souls propitious must of necessity cultivate the virtues of the soul, so also they who purpose to render their bodies favour­ able to their objects, must cultivate health and those powers which are akin to health, and these too they cultivate with un­ remitting and ceaseless labours, being overwhelmed with care, arising from the faculties in them of which they are com­ pounded.", "3834": "You see, therefore, that all good things spring up and shoot out from labour as from one general root, and this you must never allow yourself to neglect;", "3835": "for if you do, you will without being aware of it, be also letting slip the collected heap of goods which it brings with it;", "3836": "for the Ruler of the universe, of heaven, and of the world, both himself possesses and bestows on whomsoever he pleases, his good things, with all ease and abundance.", "3837": "Since formerly he created this world, vast as you see it is, without any labour, and how too he never ceases holding it together, so that it may last for ever.", "3838": "And absence from all labour and fatigue is the most appropriate attribute of God ;", "3839": "but nature has not given the acquisition 'of good things to any mortal without labour,* in order that in consequence of this arrangement, God alone of existing beings may be called happy and enjoy felicity.", "3840": "IX.", "3841": "For labour appears to me to have nearly the same pro­ perties as food.", "3842": "As therefore this latter makes life to depend upon itself, having combined all the actions and all the passions in living, so also has labour caused all good things to depend upon itself.", "3843": "For as those persons who are desirous to live must not neglect food, so too they who are anxious to attain to good things must pay due attention to labour, for what food is to life that labour is to virtue.", "3844": "Do not you then ever slight that, though it is but a single thing, that by its means you may enjoy the collective blessings of all good things.", "3845": "For thus, though you may be younger by birth you shall be called the elder, and you shall be thought worthy of the pre-eminence in honour.", "3846": "But if, having gone through a constant course of improvement you shall at last arrive at the end, then not only shall the Father give thee the pre-emi­ nence, but he shall also bestow on thee all the inheritance of the Father, as he did to Jacob, who overthrew all the founda­ tions and seats of passion, and who confessed what he suffered, saying that \"", "3847": "God has pitied me, and all things belong to me,”† uttering a doctrine full of instruction, for he makes everything to anchor in the mercy of God.X.", "3848": "And he learnt all these things from Abraham his grand­ father, who was the author of his own education, who gave to the all-wise Isaac all that he had,‡ leaving none of his sub­ stance to bastards, or to the spurious reasonings of concubines, but he gives them small gifts, as being inconsiderable persons.", "3849": "For the possessions of which he is possessed, namely, the per­ fect virtues, belong only to the perfect and legitimate son ;", "3850": "but those which are of an intermediate character, are suitable to and fall to the share of those who are not perfect, but who have advanced as far as the encyclical branches of elementary education, of which Agar and Cheturah partake, Agar mean­ ing \" a dwelling near,\" and Cheturah meaning “sacrificing.", "3851": "”", "3852": "For he who attends only to the encyclical instruction abides near wisdom but does not dwell with it, as sending a certain sweet fragrance from the elegance of contemplation to his own soul.", "3853": "But such a man requires food, and not sweet scents to bless him with good health.", "3854": "But nature is said to have made, with great skill and propriety, smell to serve as a handmaid to taste, as a sort of subject and taster to the other, or her queen;", "3855": "and we must always attend to the sovereign powers before those who are ruled over by them, and to the indi­ genous and native sciences before those which are strangers.", "3856": "The mind bearing this rejects pleasure, and attaches itself to virtue, perceiving its genuine, and unalloyed, and very divine beauty.", "3857": "Then it becomes the shepherd of sheep, being the charioteer and pilot of the irrational faculties which exist in the soul, \" not permitting them to be borne about at random and in an inconsistent manner, without any superintendant or guide ;", "3858": "* that they may not fall into a sort of orphan state, destitute of guardians and protectors, owing to their want of any allies, in which case they would perish without any saving hand to restrain them.", "3859": "XI.", "3860": "Accordingly, Jacob, the practiser of contemplation, con­ ceiving this to be an employment most closely akin to virtue, endured \" to be the shepherd of the flocks of Laban,\"t a mail wholly devoted to colours and to forms, and, in short, to life­ less substances ;", "3861": "and he tended not all of them.", "3862": "but the residue only.", "3863": "Now, what is the interpretation of this?", "3864": "The irrational animal is of a twofold character;", "3865": "one consist­ ing in a misuse of that reason which should direct the choice, and such we call people out of their mind :", "3866": "the other consisting in an absolute privation of reason, which we see to exist in these animals which we call brutes.", "3867": "Now, the irrational impulses of the mind, I mean those faculties which are deve­ loped in a misuse of that reason which should direct the choice, the sons of Laban, \" when they had departed three days' jour­ ney,”‡ paid great regard to;", "3868": "being thus under a symbol cut off from virtue for the whole period of their life ;", "3869": "for time is capable of being divided into three parts, consisting of the past, and the present, and the future.", "3870": "But these animals which are irrational in the second sense, and which are desti­ tute not only of right reason but of all reason whatever, under which class the brute beasts are reckoned, the practiser of con­ templation will think worthy of all his care, considering that their errors have proceeded, not so much from deliberate wick­ edness as from ignorance, which was devoid of a guide.", "3871": "Ignorance, therefore, being but a slight and also an invo­ luntary calamity, admits of a cure which is neither difficult nor troublesome, namely instruction.", "3872": "But, wickedness being a voluntary disease of the soul, admits of no remedy but such as is difficult, and almost impossible.", "3873": "Therefore his sons, as men who have been instructed by a father of exceeding wis­ dom, even if they do go down to Egypt, that is to say, to the body which is inclined to be a slave to the passions, and even if they meet with Pharaoh, that squanderer of all good things, who appears to be the sovereign of the composite animals, being not at all bewildered with the abundance of the prepara­ tions which they behold, confess that they are shepherds of sheep, and not only they but their fathers also.", "3874": "*XII.", "3875": "And yet no one would ever utter so great a boast in consequence of any power and sovereignty as these men do in respect of their being shepherds;", "3876": "to those indeed who are able to reason correctly, it is a more noble employment than that of a king, to be able to govern the body and the outward senses, and the belly, as one might govern a city or a country, and to restrain the pleasures which have their seat around the belly, and the other passions, and one's tongue, and, in short, all the different parts of one's composite nature, with vigour and exceeding power, and again to guide them in the right way with due gentleness;", "3877": "for it is necessary at one time to act like a charioteer who slackens the reins with which he holds the horses which are yoked to his chariot, and at other times one must draw them tight, and resist the haste of the steeds, that no precipitation and impetuous pursuit of outward objects may take place, and lead them into rebellion.", "3878": "And I admire that guardian of the laws, Moses, who, thinking it a great and noble task to be a shepherd, has attributed that employment to himself;", "3879": "for he manages and conducts the doctrines of Jethro, leading them from the tumultuous vexations of political affairs into the desert, for the purpose of avoiding all tempta­ tion to injustice.\"", "3880": "For he led the sheep into the wilderness.\"*", "3881": "The conse­ quence of which conduct of his was that \" Every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to the Egyptians.”†", "3882": "For every man who loves his passions hates right reason as the governor and guide to good things;", "3883": "just as foolish children hate their tutors and teachers, and every one who reproves them or corrects them, or would lead them to virtue.", "3884": "But Moses says that he “ will sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to God,”‡ namely the virtues which are faultless and most becoming vic­ tims, which every foolish man abominates.", "3885": "So that very appropriately, Abel, who brought the best offerings to God, is called a shepherd ;", "3886": "but he, who offered every thing to himself and to his own mind, is called a tiller of the earth, namely Cain.", "3887": "And what is meant by tilling the earth § we have shown in our previous treatises.", "3888": "XIII.", "3889": "And it came to pass after some days that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth as an offering to the Lord.", "3890": "Here are two accusations against the self-loving man;", "3891": "one that he showed his gratitude to God after some days, and not at once, the other that he made his offering from the fruits, and not from the first fruits, which have a name in one word, the first fruits.", "3892": "Let us now examine into each of these subjects of reproach, and first into that which is first in order, we must do good works, hastening with all speed, and labouring to outstrip others, casting away all slowness and delay.", "3893": "And the best of all good works is the

them if possible without any loss of time, and without any delay;", "3896": "and of those who do not act rightly in this particular, some through forgetfulness of the benefits which they have received, have failed in that great and beautiful virtue of thankfulness, and others from an excessive conceit, have looked upon themselves as the authors of the good things which have befallen them, and have not attributed them to him.", "3897": "who is really the cause of them.", "3898": "A third class are they who commit an offence slighter indeed than the fault of these latter, but more serious than that of the first mentioned, for though they confess that the supreme Ruler is the cause of the good that has befallen them, they still say that they deserved to receive it, for that they are prudent, and courageous.", "3899": "aud temperate, and just, so that they may well on these accounts be esteemed by God to be worthy of his favours.", "3900": "XIV.", "3901": "Xow the holy

nothingness in every particular, you will also be sure to remember the exceeding greatness of God in everything.", "3904": "And Moses reproves the man who looks upon himself as the cause of the good things that have befallen him in this manner, “Say not,”says he.", "3905": "\"my own might, or the strength of my right hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always the Lord thy God, who

"For Abraham also, having come with all haste and speech and eagerness, exhorts virtue, that is to say, Sarah, “ to hasten and knead three measures of fine meal, and to make cakes upon the hearth.\"*", "3917": "When God, being attended by two of the heavenly powers as guards, to wit, by authority and goodness, he himself, the one God being between them, presented an appearance of the figures to the visual soul;", "3918": "each of which figures was not measured in any respect;", "3919": "for God cannot be circumscribed, nor are his powers capable of being defined by lines, but he himself measures everything.", "3920": "His goodness therefore is the measure of all good things, and his authority is the measure of things in subjection, and the Governor of the universe himself, is the measure of all things to the corporeal and incorporeal.", "3921": "On which account, his powers also having been looked upon in the light of rules and models, have weighed and measured other things with refe­ rence to them.", "3922": "Now it is very good that these three measures should, as it were, be kneaded together in the soul, and mixed up together, in order that so the soul, being persuaded that the supreme being is God, who has raised his head above all his powers, and who is beheld independently of them, and who makes himself visible in them, may receive the characters of his power and beneficence, and becoming initiated into the perfect mysteries, may not be too ready to divulge the divine secrets to any one, but may treasure them up in herself, and keeping a check over her speech, may conceal them in silence;", "3923": "for the words of the scripture are, \" To make secret cakes;", "3924": "” because the sacred and mystic statements about the one uncreated Being,

systems which a long lapse of ages has handed down to the deceiving of mortals;", "3995": "but that, receiving new and fresh good things in all abundance from God, who never grows old, but who is

when God causes new shoots of self-taught wisdom to spring up in the soul, then it behoves us immediately to circumscribe and to contract the things which we have acquired from instruction, which of

to them because of their ministration to God.XXXVIII.", "4199": "But it is worth while to consider, in no passing manner, why he granted the cities of the Levites to fugitives, thinking it right that

been hallowed, for the sake of being purified;", "4202": "and, in the second place, we must consider that the Levites admit the fugitives because they themselves are poten­ tially fugitives;", "4203":

destruction of all its first-born, the first-born of Israel all became holy, but because both in former times, and now, and hereafter, and for ever, this naturally happens in the case of the soul, that when the most dominant parts of blind passion are destroyed, then the elder and most honourable offspring of God, who sees everything with a piercing sight, becomes holy ;", "4221": "for the departure of wickedness brings about the entrance of virtue, as, on the other hand, when what is good is driven away, then what was bad, having been lying in ambush, comes in to supply the void.",

which it seemed natural should be dedicated before the other parts, since, according to the language of the lawgiver, the dominant power is recognised as existing in one of them.", "4230": "But may it not be owing to an exceeding holiness and to very accurate consideration of the matter that he did not bear these things to the faithful altar of God?", "4231": "because that dominant part being subject to changes in either direction, either for bad or good, in an indivisible moment of time receives impressions which are continually changing, at one time impressions of what is pure and approved, and at others of an adulterated and base coinage.", "4232": "Therefore the lawgiver judging a place which was capable of receiving both these opposite qualities, namely, what is honourable, and what is disgraceful, and which was adapted to each, and distributed equal honour to both, to be quite as much impure as holy, removed it from the altar of God.", "4233": "For what is disgraceful is profane, and what is profane is by all means unholy;", "4234": "and this is why the dominant part is kept away from sacrifices, but if it is subjected to examination, then, when all its parts have been purified, it will be consecrated as a burnt offering, free from all -stain, and from all pollution.", "4235": "For this is the law respecting whole burnt offerings, that with the exception of the refuse of the food, and of the skin which are tokens of the weakness of the body and not of wickedness, nothing else should be left to the creature, but that all the other parts which exhibit the soul

glad to die.", "4368": "But those who take care of them­ selves are men of reputation, rich, leaders, men in the enjoy­ ment of praise and honour;", "4369": "moreover, they are healthy, stout, and

virtue, some treasured up what is good in their soul alone, becoming practisers of praiseworthy actions, and having no knowledge whatever of sophistries of words.", "4375": "But they who were armed in both ways, having their minds fur­ nished with wise counsel and with good deeds, and having also good store of reasons to bring forward according to the arts of the sophists, they had a good right to oppose the contentious behaviour of some others, having means at hand by which to repel their enemies.", "4376": "But the former sort had no safety what­ ever.", "4377": "For what men could fight naked against armed enemies on equal terms, when, even if they had been both equally armed, the contest would still have been unequal ?", "4378": "Abel therefore had not learnt any of the arts of

eloquent man,\"* which is equivalent to saying that he was not formed by nature for the conjectural rhetoric of plausible and specious reasons.", "4384": "And immediately afterwards he confirms the

out of the earth, and come into sight.", "4389": "And speech is an interpreter of the things which the mind has decided upon in its tribunal.", "4390": "Moreover, it is a prophet and a soothsayer of

explaining their symptons and causes, and the modes of cure, and are the most excellent interpreters possible of the principles of which their art is made up, but are utterly useless in the matter of attending the bodies of the sick, to the cure of which they are not able to contribute even the slightest assistance.", "4402": "In the same way, those who have devoted themselves to practical wisdom

consistent for Abel to practise prudence, a very saving virtue, and to have remained at home, disregarding the invitation to the arena of discus­ sion and contest, which was given to him, imitating Rebecca, that is perseverance, who, when Esau, the companion of wickedness, was pouring forth threats, advised the practiser of wisdom, Jacob, to retreat before him who was about to plot against him, until he should have relaxed in his fierce hostility to him, for Esau had been holding out an intolerable threat over Jacob, saying, \" The days of mourning for my Father are at hand, that then I may

occupying the most important place in the body, unless he had been making a reference to some very neces­ sary and comprehensive principle.", "4577": "What then are we to say ?", "4578": "The truth is, that every one of us according to the nearest estimation of numbers, is two persons, the animal and the man.", "4579": "And each of these two has a cognate power in the faculties, the seat of which is the soul assigned to it.", "4580": "To the one portion is assigned the vivifying faculty according to which we live;", "4581": "and to the other, the reasoning faculty in accordance with which we are capable of reasoning.", "4582": "Therefore, even the irrational animals partake of the vivifying power ;", "4583": "but of the rational faculty, God—I will not say partakes, but is the ruler, and that is the fountain of the most ancient Word.", "4584": "XXIII.", "4585": "Therefore, the faculty which is common to us with the irrational animals, has blood for its essence.", "4586": "And it, having flowed from the rational fountain, is spirit, not air in motion, but rather a certain representation and character of the divine faculty which Moses calls by its proper name an image, showing by his language that God is the archetypal pattern of rational nature, and that man is the imitation of him, and the image formed after his model;", "4587": "not meaning by man that animal of a double nature, but the most excellent species of the soul which is called mind and reason.", "4588": "On this account, Moses represents God as calling the blood the life of the flesh, though he is aware that the nature of the flesh has no participation in intellect, but that it does partake of life, as also does our whole body.", "4589": "And the soul of man he names the spirit, meaning by the term man, not the compound being, as I said before, but that Godlike creation by which we reason, the roots of which he stretched to heaven, and fastened it to the outermost rim of the circle of those bodies which we call the fixed stars.", "4590": "For God made man, the only heavenly plant of those which he placed upon the earth, fastening the heads of the others in the mainland, for all of them bend their heads downwards * but the face of man he has exalted and directed upwards, that it might have its food of a heavenly and incorruptible nature, and not earthly and perishable.", "4591": "With a view to which, he also rooted in the earth the foundations of our body, removing the most insensible part of it as far as possible from reason;", "4592": "and the outward senses, which are as it were the body-guards of the mind, and the mind itself, he established at a great distance from the earth, and from all things con­ nected with it, and bound it with the periodical revolutions of the air and of the heavens, which are imperishable.", "4593": "XXIV.", "4594": "Let us then no longer doubt, we who are the disciples of Moses, how man conceived an idea of God who is destitute of all figure, for he was taught the reason of this by the divine oracle, and afterwards he explained it to us.", "4595": "And he spoke as follows:", "4596": "—\" He said that the Creator made no soul in any body capable of seeing its Creator by its own intrinsic powers.", "4597": "But having considered that the knowledge of the Creator and the proper understanding of the work of Creation, would be of great advantage to the creature (for such knowledge is the boundary of happiness and blessedness), he breathed into him from above something of his own divine nature.", "4598": "And his divine nature stamped her own impression in an invisible manner on the invisible soul, in order that even the earth might not be destitute of the image of God.", "4599": "But the arche­ typal pattern was so devoid of all figure, that its very image was not visible, being indeed fabricated in accordance with the model, and accordingly it received not mortal but immortal conceptions.", "4600": "For how could a mortal nature at the same time remain where it was and also emigrate?", "4601": "or how could it see what was here and what was on the other side ?", "4602": "or how could it sail round the white sea, and at the same time traverse the whole earth to its furthest boundaries, and inspect the customs and laws of the nations on all the affairs and bodies which are in existence ?", "4603": "On separating them from the things of the earth, how could it arrive at a contemplation of the sublimer things of the air and its revolutions, and the peculiar character of its seasons, and all the things which at the periodical changes of the year are made anew.", "4604": "and, according to their usual habit, brought to perfection?", "4605": "Or again, how could it fly through the air from earth to heaven, and investigate the natures which exist in heaven, and see of what nature they are, how they are moved, what are the limits of their movements, of their be­ ginning and of their end ;", "4606": "how they are adapted to one another and to the universe according to the just principles of kindred ?", "4607": "Is it easy to have an accurate comprehension of the different arts and of the different branches of knowledge which bring ex­ ternal things into shape, and which are concerned with the affairs of the body and of the soul, with a view to the improve­ ment of the two, and to understand ten thousand other things.", "4608": "of which it is not easy to describe either the number or the nature in language ?", "4609": "For of all the faculties which exist in us, the mind alone, as being the most rapid in its motions of all, appears to be able to outrun and to pass by the time in which it originates, according to the invisible powers of the universe and of its parts existing without any reference to time, and touching the universe and its parts, and the causes of them.", "4610": "And now, having gone not only to the very boundaries of earth and sea, but also to those of air and heaven, it has not stopped even there, thinking that the world itself is but a brief limit for its continued and unremitting course.", "4611": "And it is eager to advance further;", "4612": "and, if it can possibly do so, to com­ prebend the incomprehensible nature of God, even if only as to its existence.", "4613": "How, then, is it natural that the human intellect, being as scanty as it is, and enclosed in no very ample space, in some membrane, or in the heart (truly very narrow bounds), should be able to embrace the vastness of the heaven and of the world, great as it is, if there were not in it some dortion of a divine and happy soul, which cannot be separated from it ?", "4614": "For nothing which belongs to the divinity can be cut off from it so as to be separated from it, but it is only extended.", "4615": "On which account the being which has had imparted to it a share of the perfection which is in the universe, when it arrives at a proper comprehension of the world, is extended in width simultaneously with the boundaries of the universe, and is incapable of being broken or divided ;", "4616": "for its power is ductile and capable of extension.", "4617": "XXV.", "4618": "Let this then be enough to say concisely about the essence of the soul.", "4619": "And now proceeding in regular order, we will explain the expression, that \" the voice of his blood cries out,\" in this manner,-of our soul, one part is dumb, and one part is endowed with utterance.", "4620": "All that part which is devoid of reason is likewise destitute of voice, but all that part which is rational is capable of speech, and that part alone has formed any conception of God;", "4621": "for, by the other parts of us, we are not able to comprehend God, or any other object of the intel­ lect.", "4622": "Of our vivifying power, therefore, of which the blood is, as it were, the essence, one portion has particular honour, namely, that of speech and reason ;", "4623": "I do not mean the stream which flows through the mouth and tongue, but I speak of the fountain itself, from which the channels of utterance are, in the course of nature, filled.", "4624": "And this fountain is the mind;", "4625": "by means of which, all our conversations with and cries to the living God take place, at one time being voluntary, and at another involuntary.", "4626": "But he, as a good and merciful God, does not reject his suppliants, and most especially he does not, when they, groaning at the Egyptian deeds and passions, cry to him in sincerity and truth.", "4627": "For at such a time Moses says that, \" their words go up to God,\"* and that he listens to them, and delivers them from the evils that surround them.", "4628": "But that all these things should happen when the king of Egypt dies, should be a most strange thing ;", "4629": "for it would be natural that when the tyrant died, all those who have been tyrannised over by him should rejoice and exult;", "4630": "but at that time they are said to groan. \"", "4631": "For after many days the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned.\"", "4632": "tNow here, if we look merely at the words, the expression does not appear to be reasonable ;", "4633": "but if we have regard to the faculties in the soul, then its consistency is discovered.", "4634": "For as long as he who scatters abroad and dissipates the opinions about good things, namely, Pharaoh, is vigorous in us, and appears in a sound and healthy state, if indeed we can say that any wicked man is in such a condition, we receive pleasure, driving temperance away from our borders.", "4635": "But when he loses his strength, and in a manner dies, he who has been the cause of men's living in a filthy and lascivious manner, then we, fixing our eyes on modesty of life, bewail and groan over our­ selves on account of our former way of living;", "4636": "because then, honouring pleasure before virtue, we joined a mortal life to an immortal one;", "4637": "and the law taking pity on our continued lamentation, gently receives our suppliant souls, and easily drives, away the Egyptian calamities which are brought upon them by the passions.", "4638": "XXVI.", "4639": "But on him who is incapable of receiving repent­ ance on account of the enormity of the pollution which lie has incurred by the murder of his brother, namely, on Cain, he lays well-deserved and fitting curses;", "4640": "for in the first place he says to him, \" And now, cursed art thou upon the earth:", "4641": "\"* show­ ing first of all that he is polluted and accursed, not now for the first time when he has committed the murder, but that he was so before, the moment that he conceived the idea of it, the intention being of equal importance with the perfected action;", "4642": "for as long as we only conceive wicked things in the bad imagination of our minds, still, during that time, we are guilty of thoughts only, for the mind is capable of being changed even against its will;", "4643": "but when performance is added to the intention that has been conceived, then our deliberate purpose becomes also guilty;", "4644":

with disease, it adds the miseries which are derived from itself, and so fills the mind with grief and despondency;", "4648": "or, on the other hand, if it has grown fat immoderately through enjoyment of pleasures, it makes all the faculties of the mind duller for the comprehension of nobler objects.", "4649": "For, indeed, each of the outward senses is capable of re­ ceiving injury;", "4650": "for

outward senses to be opened and widened, as even when they are not open the flood of the objects appreciable only by them rushes in like an overflowing river, nothing being capable of resisting their evident impetuosity;", "4660": "for then the mind is found to be overwhelmed, being wholly absorbed by so vast a wave, and being utterly unable to swim against it, or even to raise its head above it;", "4661": "but it is neces­ sary to employ all these things not so much for whatever objects can possibly be effected, but for those that are best;", "4662": "for the sight can perceive all

apportioning its nourish­ ment amongst numerous offspring, inasmuch as they are able to support themselves, that which was previously weak from being drained by this cause becomes so fully satiated as to grow fat and young again.", "4695": "And I have seen another man who cut away the less de­ sirable shoots of trees which admitted of cultivation, as soon as they appeared above the ground, and left only a small piece adhering to the root itself.", "4696": "And then taking a branch in good condition from another tree of a good sort, he scraped away the one shoot down till he came to the pith, and the shoot which was attached to the root he cut at no great depth, but opening it just sufficiently to make the union perfect, and then putting into the cleft the shoot which he had pared away he fitted it in ;", "4697": "and from these two shoots one single tree of one united nature sprang up, each portion giving to the other that which was useful to it;", "4698": "for the roots support the shoot which has been fitted into them, and prevent it from drying up and withering, and the shoot which has been inserted as a reward for its nourishment supplies the root with good fruit in requital.", "4699": "There are also an innumerable host of other operations in farming which proceed on rules of art, which it would be superfluous to enumerate on the present occasion, for we have only dwelt on this point at such length for the purpose of showing the difference between the man who is only a cul­ tivator of the earth, and one who is a farmer.", "4700": "XXIX.", "4701":

different sys­ tems of life, exceedingly difficult to distinguish from one another, both worthy of attention, at the very beginning instilling the sweetness of these contemplations which exist in the sciences, and again emitting the most brilliant light to those who take hold of the things which are the objects of their desire, not fastidiously, but firmly, and scarcely by means of unremitting and

interminable talkers, who, in the long passages of their con­ versations, do not properly keep to their conceptions, but merely connect long and empty and, to say the truth, lifeless sentences.", "4777": "Therefore the conversation of such men as these is inde­ corous, and is justly condemned to groan;", "4778": "as, on the other hand, it is inevitable that that conversation which proceeds from a proper consideration of the objects of its consideration must rejoice, since it comes in an adequate manner to the in­ terpretation of the things which it saw and comprehended vigorously;", "4779": "and this is a matter within the knowledge of almost every one from his daily experience.", "4780": "For, when we thoroughly understand what we are saying, then our speech rejoices and exults, and is rich in most emphatic and appropriate expres­ sions, with which, using great copiousness and fluency of un­ hesitating diction, it sets before the hearer what it desires to exhibit to him in a most evident and efficient manner.", "4781": "But when the comprehension of the conceptions is doubtful, then the speech stumbles and exhibits a great deficiency of suitable and felicitous expressions, and speaks very inappropriately;", "4782": "on which account it is tedious and wearisome and wanders about, and instead of persuading its hearers it pains their ears.", "4783": "XXXVI.",

Aaron who should come forward to meet the conceptions of the most perfect Moses.", "4787": "Since else why, when God had said, \" Behold, is not Aaron thy brother ?\" did he add, \" the Levite,\" if it were not for the sake of teaching that it belongs to the Levite and priest, and to virtuous speech alone, to give inform­ ation respecting the conceptions of the mind, which are shoots of the perfect soul.", "4788": "For never may the speech of a wicked man be interpreter of divine doctrines, for such an one would deform their beauty by his own pollutions;", "4789": "and, on the other hand, may what is intemperate and disgraceful never be related by the utterance of a virtuous man, but may sacred and holy conversations always deliver the relation of holy things.", "4790": "In some of the best governed cities of the world they say that such a custom as this prevails.", "4791": "When any man who has not lived well attempts to deliver his opinion, either in the council or in the assembly of the people, he is not permitted to do so by his own mouth, but is compelled by the magistrates to deliver his opinion to some virtuous and honourable man to explain in his behalf;", "4792": "and then he, when he has heard what he wishes said, rises up and unfolds the meaning of the sewn up mouth of his instructor, becoming his extempore pupil;", "4793": "and he displays the imaginations of another, scarcely consider­ ing the original concern of them even in the rank of a hearer or spectator.", "4794": "So some people do not choose to receive even benefits from unworthy

most holy Moses appears to teach;", "4798": "for such is the object of the statement that Aaron the Levite is coming forward to meet his brother Moses, and that when he sees him he rejoices in himself;", "4799": "and the statement that he rejoices in himself shows also, besides the doctrine which has already been mentioned, another more connected with politics, since the lawgiver is here exhibiting that genuine joy which is most especially akin to the human race;", "4800": "for to speak strictly, the feeling of joy does not belong to abundance of money, or of possessions, or to brilliancy of renown, nor, in short, to any one of those external circumstances which are lifeless and unstable, and which contain the seeds of their decay in themselves:", "4801": "nor yet does it belong to personal strength and vigour, and to the other advantages of the body, which are common to even the most worthless men, and which have often brought inevitable destruction on those who pos­ sessed them.", "4802": "Since then it is only in the virtues of the soul that genuine and unadulterated joy is found, and since every wise man rejoices, he rejoices in himself, and not in his surrounding circumstances ;", "4803": "for the things that are in himself are the virtues of the mind on which it is worthy for a man to provide him­ self :", "4804": "but the circumstances which surround him are either a good condition of body or an abundance of external wealth, which are not proper objects for a man to pride himself on.", "4805": "XXXVIII.", "4806": "Having shown, therefore, as far as we could by the most unmistakeable testimony of Moses that, to rejoice is the peculiar property of the wise man, we will now also show that to hope also belongs to him alone;", "4807": "and

men, as those who do not hope in God have no share in rational nature.", "4813": "On which account Moses, after he had previously mentioned with respect to Enos that \" he hoped to call upon the name

countless number of internal and external faculties.", "4994": "And the fact of God's having passions like unto those of man follows of necessity from the fact of his having a form like that of man

suitable to and consistent with their natural necessities and offices.", "4996": "But the living God has need of nothing;", "4997": "so that as he does not at all require the assistance to be derived

heaven binds round and contains within itself everything which has ever been created ;", "5004": "and of those things which have already perished, the component parts are resolved into their original

the sight of a mortal king, how can it be anything but extremely difficult to depart and quit the appearance of God, and to determine no longer to come into his sight.", "5011": "This indeed is to be left without any idea of him, and to be mutilated as to the eyes of the soul, and all those who of necessity have endured this fate, being weighed down by the might of irresistible and implacable power, are objects rather for pity than for hatred;", "5012": "but all those who voluntarily and of deliberated purposes have rejected the living God, exceeding even the bounds of wickedness itself,

invisible.", "5035": "And it appears to me that the great bierophant bad attained to the comprehension of the most important point in this investiga­ tion before he commenced it, when he entreated God

some other road, he now stops and hesitates;", "5045": "for the eyes of his mind being opened, he sees more clearly that he had entered upon a chase after a thing which was difficult to over­ take,

things that move ;", "5051": "but, though it seems incredible, God, while standing still, outstrips everything.", "5052": "And it is said that he, at the same moment, is close to us and at a great distance, touch­ ing us with his creative or his punishing powers, which are close to each individual, and yet at the same time driving away the creature to an excessive distance from his nature as

of the side of the man, until the woman who is here mentioned;", "5120": "and if any one says that Cain took his sister to wife, putting the impiety of such a connection out of the question, he will speak falsely;", "5121": "for Moses represents the daughters of Adam as born late.", "5122": "What then are we to say ?", "5123": "As I imagine, Moses here calls his wife opinion of impious reason which it forms about things, as crowds of those who have studied philosophy do :", "5124": "some of them introducing the same opinions into human life, and others introducing such as are wholly at variance with one another.", "5125": "What then is the position of the impious man ?", "5126": "Why, that the human mind is the measure of all things;", "5127": "which also they say that one of the ancient philosophers, Protagoras, used to employ, being a descendant of the folly of Cain.", "5128": "And from thence I conjecture that his wife, being known to him, brought forth Enoch ;", "5129": "and the name Enoch being interpreted means, thy grace.", "5130": "For if man is the measure of all things, then, also, all things are a grace and a free gift of the mind;", "5131": "so that we refer to the eye the grace of sight, to the ears that of hearing, and to each of the other external senses their appropriate object, and also to the speech and utterance do we attribute the power of speaking.", "5132": "And if we judge in this manner of these things, so also do we with respect to intelligence, in which ten thousand things are comprised, such as thoughts, perceptions, designs, medita­ tions, conceptions, sciences, arts, dispositions, and a number of other faculties almost incalculable.", "5133": "What is it then that the gravest philosophers, who have talked in the most grandiloquent manner about divine law and the honour due to God, have determined both to say and to allow to be said, If ye have in ye a mind which is equal to God, which regulating by its own power all the good and bad things which exist among men, occasionally mingles both in certain persons, and sometimes distributes both good and bad to some in an unalloyed state;", "5134": "and if any one accuses you of impiety, make your defence with a good courage, saying that you have been brought up very admirably by your guide and teacher, Cain, who recommended you to honour the powers that are nearest in preference to that cause which was afar off, to whom you ought to attend for many other reasons, and most especially because he showed the power of his doctrine by very evident works, having conquered Abel the expounder of the opposite doctrine, and having removed and destroyed his doctrine as well as himself.", "5135": "But in my opinion and in that of my friends, death in the company of the pious would be preferable to life with the impious;", "5136": "for those who die in the company of the pious everlasting life will receive, but everlasting death will be the portion -of those who live in the other way.", "5137": "XII.", "5138": "But as after Cain had begotten Enoch, one of the pos­ terity of Seth is also subsequently called Enoch, it may be well to consider, whether the two namesakes were men of different or of similar dispositions and characters.", "5139": "And at the same time that we examine this question let us also investigate the differ­ ences between other persons bearing the same name.", "5140": "For as Enoch was, so also Methusaleh and Lamech were both descen­ dants of Cain, and they were no less the descendants of Seth also.", "5141": "We must therefore be aware that each of the aforesaid names, being interpreted, has a double signification;", "5142": "for Enoch, being interpreted, means, as I have already said, \" thy grace,\" and Methusaleh means, the sending forth of death.", "5143": "Lamech, again means, humiliation.", "5144": "Now the expression, \"", "5145": "Thy grace , is by some persons referred to the mind that is in us ;", "5146": "and by more learned and sounder interpreters it is referred to the mind of other persons.", "5147": "They therefore who say that all thinking, and feeling, and speaking, are the free gifts of their own soul, utter an impious and ungodly opinion, and deserve to be classed among the race of Cain, who, though he was not able to master himself, yet dared to assert that he had absolute possession of all other things ;", "5148": "but as for those persons who do not claim all the things in creation as their own, but who ascribe them to the divine grace, being men really noble and sprung out of those who were rich long ago, but of those who love virtue and piety, they may be classed under Seth as the author of their race.", "5149": "The race of these men is difficult to trace, since they show a life of plotting, and cunning, and wickedness, and disso­ luteness, full of passion and wickednesses, as such a life must be.", "5150": "For all those whom God, since they pleased him well, has caused to quit their original abode, and has transformed from the race of perishable beings to that of immortals, are no longer found among the common multitude.", "5151": "XIII.", "5152": "Having, therefore, thus distinguished the indications intended to be afforded by the name of Enoch, let us now proceed in regular order to the name of Methuselah;", "5153": "and this name is interpreted, a sending forth of death.", "5154": "Now there are two meanings contained in this word;", "5155": "one, that according to which death is sent to anyone, and the other, that according to which it is sent away from any one.", "5156": "He, therefore, to whom it is sent, immediately dies, but he, from whom it is sent, lives and survives.", "5157": "Accordingly, he who receives death is akin to Cain, who is dying as to the life in accordance with virtue;", "5158": "but he from whom death is sent away and kept at a distance, is most nearly related to Seth, for the good man enjoys real life.", "5159": "And again, the name Lamech, which means humili­ ation, is a name of ambiguous meaning ;", "5160": "for we are humiliated either when the vigour of our soul is relaxed, according to the diseases and infirmities which arise from the irrational pas­ sions, or in respect of our love for virtue, when we seek to restrain ourselves from swelling self-opinions.", "5161": "Now the former kind of humiliation arises out of weakness, being a species of that multiform disease of many changes.", "5162": "leprosy. \"", "5163": "For when his appearance seems more humble,\"* being broken as to its level and fresh face, than the lawgiver says that that humble disease leprosy exists.", "5164": "But the second kind of humiliation arises from the strength of perseverance, which is followed by propitiation, according to the perfect number of the decade;", "5165": "for the people are enjoined to humble their souls on the tenth day of the month, and this means to put away all high boasting, the putting away of which works the rejection of all offences, both voluntary and involuntary.", "5166": "Accordingly, the Lamech who is humbled in this sense, is the descendant of Seth, and the father of the just Noah;", "5167": "but he who is humbled in the former manner is the descendant of Cain.XIV.", "5168": "And it may become us next to consider on what account this same man is represented as founding and building a city, for it is only a multitude of men who have need of a city to dwell in ;", "5169": "but the three who were the only human beings in existence at that time might have thought the foot of a mountain, or a small cave, a most sufficient abode.", "5170": "And I said, indeed, the three ;", "5171": "but in all probability I might have spoken of him by himself;", "5172": "for the parents of Abel, who had been so treacherously slain, would never have endured to inhabit the same city with his murderer-a man who had committed fratricide, which is a greater pollution than even homicide.", "5173": "For it is plain that it is not only extraordinary, but utterly contrary to all reason, that one man should build a city.", "5174": "In what manner could he do it ?", "5175": "He could not build even the most trifling portion of a house, unless he employed other men as his assistants.", "5176": "Would the same man be able at the same time to cut stones, to cut wood, to work in iron and in brass, and to throw the vast circumference of walls round the city ?", "5177": "to build up propylaea, and inter-walls, and temples, and sacred precincts, and porticoes, and docks, and houses, and all the other public and private buildings which one is accustomed to find in a city ?", "5178": "And moreover, besides all these things, would he be able to carry burdens, to move away masses of earth, to widen narrow passages, to make fountains and water-courses, and all the other things with which a city ought to be provided?", "5179": "Perhaps, therefore, since all these ideas are inconsistent with truth, it would be better to look upon the statement as an alle­ gory, and to say that Cain determined to build up his own doctrine like a city.", "5180": "XV.", "5181": "Since, therefore, every city consists of houses and inhabitants, and laws, the houses, in Cain's case, are the reasons which he alleges to prove his point;", "5182":

were ill-treated by the superintendents, they built three cities for the prince of the country, Peithom, Rameses, ‡ and On, which is Heliopolis.", "5196": "And these cities, if taken symbolically,

time subject to him ;", "6006": "for their life is not time, but the beautiful model of time, eternity ;", "6007": "and in eternity nothing is past and nothing is future, but everything is present only.", "6008": "VII.", "6009": "Having therefore now sufficiently discussed the ques­ tion of the living", "6010": "God never knowing repentance, it comes next in order for us to explain what is the meaning of the expression, \" God considered that he had made man upon the earth, and he thought within himself.\"", "6011": "Then the creator of the world, having attached to himself the two most lasting powers of cogitation and deliberation-the one being a conception conceived within his own breast, and the other the discussion of such conception-and since he continually employs them for the contemplation of his own works, those things which do not leave their appointed station he praises for their obedience, but those which change their place he pursues with the punishment appointed for deserters ;", "6012": "for some bodies he has endowed with habit, others with nature, others with soul, and some with rational soul;", "6013": "for instance, he has bound stones and beams, which are torn from their kindred materials, with the most powerful bond of habit;", "6014": "and this habit is the inclination of the spirit to return to itself;", "6015": "for it begins at the middle and proceeds onwards towards the extremities, and then when it has touched the extreme boundary, it turns back again, until it has again arrived at the same place from which it originally started.", "6016": "This is the continued unalterable course, up and down, of habit, which runners, imitating in their triennial festivals, in those great common spectacles of all men, display as a brilliant achievement, and a worthy subject of rivalry and contention.", "6017": "VIII.", "6018": "And he has given to plants a nature which he has combined of as many powers as possible, that is of the nutritive, and the changeable, and the forming power;", "6019": "for they are nourished when they have need of nourishment;", "6020": "and a proof of this is that those plants which are not irrigated waste away and are dried up, as on the other hand those which have water supplied to them do visibly grow, for those which for a time were mere creepers on the ground, by reason of their shortness, suddenly spring up and become very long branches.", "6021": "And why need I speak of the changes which they undergo ?", "6022": "for at the time of the winter solstice then:", "6023": "leaves wither and fall to the ground;", "6024": "and the eyes, as they are called by the agricultural labourers, which appear on the young shoots, close up like the eyes of animals, and all the mouths which are calculated to send forth young buds, are bound up;", "6025": "their internal nature being at that time confined and quiet, in order that, when it has taken breath, like a wrestler who has gone through a little preliminary exercise, and having again collected its appropriate strength, it may return again to its customary operations.", "6026": "And this happens at' the seasons of both spring and sum­ mer, for then their nature, waking as it were out of a deep sleep, opens its eyes, and expands and widens its previously closed mouth;", "6027": "and then it brings forth all those things of which it was pregnant, leaves, and young shoots, and tendrils, and feelers, and fruit on all its branches ;", "6028": "and then when these things have come to perfection it affords nourishment and food to them, as a mother does to her child by some invisible passages which are similar in principle to the breasts in women, and it never ceases to nourish them until the fruit be come to complete ripeness;", "6029": "and that which is thoroughly ripe is then perfected, when, even if no one gathers it, it of its own accord hastens to separate itself from its kindred branch, inasmuch as it no longer stands in need of nourish­ ment from its parent, being able, if it should meet with a fitting soil, itself to sow and beget offspring resembling its own parents.", "6030": "IX.", "6031": "And the Creator has made the soul to differ from nature in these things-in the outward sense, and imagination, and impetuosity ;", "6032": "for plants are destitute of impetuosity and devoid of imagination, and without any participation in the outward sense.", "6033": "But every animal partakes of all these qualities above- mentioned, all together.", "6034": "Now the outward sense, as indeed its name shows, in some degree is a kind of insertion, placing the things that are made apparent to it in the mind;", "6035": "for in the mind, since that is the greatest store-house and receptacle for all things, is everything placed and treasured up which comes under the operation of the sense of seeing or hearing, or the other organs of the outward senses.", "6036": "And imagination is an impression of figures in the soul;", "6037": "for the things which each of the outward senses has brought in, like a ring or a seal, on them it imprints its own character.", "6038": "And the mind, being like wax, having received the impression, keeps it carefully in itself until forgetfulness, the enemy of memory, has smoothed off the edges of the impression, or else has rendered it dim, or perhaps has completely effaced it.", "6039": "And that which has been visible and has been impressed upon the soul at times affects the soul in a way consistent with itself, and at other times in a different way;", "6040": "and this passion to which it is subject is called appetite, which philosophers who define such things say is the first motion of the soul.", "6041": "In such important points are animals superior to plants.", "6042": "Let us now see in what man is superior to the rest of the animal creation.", "6043": "X.", "6044": "Man, then, has received this one extraordinary gift, in­ tellect, which is accustomed to comprehend the nature of all bodies and of all things at the same time ;", "6045": "for, as in the body, the sight is the most important faculty, and since in the universe the nature of light is the most pre-eminent thing, in the same manner that part of us which is entitled to the highest rank is the mind.", "6046": "For the mind is the sight of the soul, shining transcendently with its own rays, by which the great and dense darkness which ignorance of things sheds around is dissipated.", "6047": "This species of soul is not composed of the same elements as those of which the other kinds were made, but it has received a purer and more excellent essence of which the divine natures were formed;", "6048": "on which account the intellect naturally appears to be the only thing in us which is imperishable, for that is the only quality in us which the Father, who created us, thought deserving of freedom;", "6049": "and, unloosing the bonds of necessity, he let it go unrestrained, bestowing on it that most admirable gift and most connected with himself, the power, namely, of spontaneous will, as far as he was able to receive it;", "6050": "for the irrational animals, in whose soul there is not that especial gift tending to freedom, namely, mind, are put under the yoke and have bridles put in their mouths, and so are given unto men to be their slaves, as servants are given to their masters.", "6051": "But man, who has had bestowed on him a voluntary and self-impel­ ling intellect, and who for the most part puts forth his energies in accordance with deliberate purpose, very properly receives blame for the offences which he designedly commits, and praise for the good actions which he intentionally performs.", "6052": "For, in the case of other plants and other animals, we cannot call either the good that is caused by them deserving of praise, nor the evil that they do deserving of blame ;", "6053": "for all their motions in either direction, and all their changes, have no design about them, but are involuntary.", "6054": "But the soul of man, being the only one which has received from God the power of voluntary motion, and which in this respect has been made-to resemble God, and being as far as possible emancipated from the autho­ rity of that grievous and severe mistress, necessity, may rightly be visited with reproach if she does not pay due honour to the being who has emancipated her.", "6055": "And therefore, in such a case, she will most deservedly suffer the implacable punishment denounced against slavish and ungrateful minds.", "6056": "So that God \" considered\" and thought within himself, not now for the first time, but long ago, and with great steadiness and resolution, \" that he had made man;", "6057": "\" that is to say, he considered within himself what kind of being he had made him.", "6058": "For he had made him free from all bondage or restraint, able to exert his energies in accordance with his own will and deliberate purpose, on this account:", "6059": "that so knowing what things were good and what, on the contrary, were evil, and having arrived at a proper comprehension of what is honour­ able and what is disgraceful, and apprehending what things are just and what unjust, and, in short, what things flow from virtue and what from wickedness, he might exercise a choice of the better objects and an avoidance of their opposites ;", "6060": "and this is the meaning of the oracle recorded in Deuteronomy, \" Behold, I have put before thy face life and death;", "6061": "good and evil.", "6062": "Do thou choose life.\"✽", "6063": "Therefore he teaches us by this sentence both that men have a knowledge of good and of the contrary, evil, and that it is their duty to choose the better in preference to the worse, preserving reason within themselves as an incorruptible judge, to be guided by the arguments which sound sense suggests, and to reject those which are brought forward by the contrary power.", "6064": "XI.", "6065": "Having now therefore explained these matters suffi­ ciently, let us pass on to what comes next.", "6066": "And this is what follows :", "6067": "\"I will destroy,\" says God, \" the man whom I have made from off the face of the earth, from man to beast, from creeping things to the fowls of the air, be­ cause I have considered and repent that I have made them.\" †", "6068": "Now, some persons, when they hear the expressions which I have just cited, imagine that the living God is here giving away to anger and passion ;", "6069": "but God is utterly inaccessible to any passion whatever.", "6070": "For it is the peculiar property of human weakness to be disquieted by any such feelings, but God has neither the irrational passions of the soul, nor are the parts and limits of the body in the least belonging to him.", "6071": "But, nevertheless, such things are spoken of with reference to God by the great lawgiver in an introductory sort of way, for the sake of admonishing those persons who could not be corrected otherwise.", "6072": "For of all the laws which are couched in the form of injunction or prohibition, and such alone are properly speak­ ing laws;", "6073": "there are two principal positions laid down with respect to the great cause of all things:", "6074": "one, that God is not as a man;", "6075": "the other, that God is as a man. ‡", "6076": "But the first of these assertions is confirmed by the most certain truth, while the latter is introduced for the instruction of the many.", "6077": "In reference to which, it is said concerning them, \" as a man would instruct his son.\"", "6078": "§", "6079": "And this is said for the sake of instruction and admonition, and not because he is really such by nature.", "6080": "For of men some are attached to the service of the soul, and others to that of the body;", "6081": "now the companions of the soul, being able to associate with incorporeal natures, ap­ preciable only by the intellect, do not compare the living God to any species of created beings ;", "6082": "but, dissociating it with any idea of distinctive qualities (for this is what most especially con­ tributes to his happiness and to his consummate felicity, to comprehend his naked existence without any connection with figure or character), they, I say, are content with the bare con­ ception of his existence, and do not attempt to invest him with any form.", "6083": "But those who enter into agreements and alliances with the body, being unable to throw off the robes of the flesh, and to behold that nature, which alone of all natures has no need of anything, but is sufficient for itself, and simple, and unalloyed, and incapable of being

many faculties, he has need of many parts in order to supply the necessities of each of those facul­ ties.", "6085": "XII.", "6086": "But God, inasmuch as he is uncreated, and the Being who has brought all other things to creation, stood in need of none of those things which are usually added to creatures.", "6087": "For what are we to say ?", "6088": "Shall we say, if he is possessed of the different organic parts, that he has feet for the sake of walking ?", "6089": "But where is he to walk who fills all places at once with his presence ?", "6090": "And to whom is he to go, when there is no one of equal honour with himself?", "6091": "And why is he to walk?", "6092": "It cannot be out of any regard for his health as we do.", "6093": "Again, are we to say that he has hands for the purpose of giving and taking?", "6094": "he never receives anything from any one.", "6095": "For in addition to the fact of his wanting nothing he actually has everything;", "6096": "and when he gives, he employs reason as the minister of his gifts, by whose agency also he created the world.", "6097": "Once more, he had no need of eyes, the organs without which there can be no comprehension of the light perceptible by the outward senses;", "6098": "but the light perceptible by the out­ ward senses is a created light;", "6099": "and even before the creation God saw, using himself as light.", "6100": "And why need we mention the organs of luxury ?", "6101": "For if he has these organs, then he is fed, and when he has satisfied himself he leaves off eating, and after he has left eating he wants food again;", "6102": "and I need not enumerate other particulars which are the necessary conse­ quences of this;", "6103": "for these are the fabulous inventions of im­ pious men, who

straight, take truth with them as the com­ panion of their journey;", "6113": "by which they are initiated in the true mysteries relating to the living God, and therefore they never attribute any of the properties of created beings to him.", "6114": "Now to these disciples, that principal assertion in the sacred oracles is especially well adapted, that \"", "6115": "God is not as man,\" but neither is he as heaven, nor as the world;", "6116": "for these species are endued with distinctive qualities, and they come under the perception of the outward senses.", "6117": "But he is not even

ease which presses upon them more easily, and the illness will be more likely to be allayed.", "6126": "For what man in his senses would say to a patient under his care, \" My good man, you shall have the knife applied to you, and cautery, and your limbs shall be amputated,\" even if such things were absolutely necessary to be endured ?", "6127": "No man on earth would say so.", "6128": "For if he did, his patient would sink in his heart before the operations could be performed, and so receiving another dis­ ease in his soul, more grievous than that already existing in his body, he would resolutely renounce the cure;", "6129": "but if, on the other hand, through the deceit of the physician he is led to form a contrary expectation, he will submit to everything with a patient spirit,

attribute either the parts or the passions of men to the living God, but who, as becomes the majesty of God, honour him in himself, and by himself alone, to love him is most natural ;", "6137": "but

found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\"", "6143": "But anger, which is a passion peculiar to man, is here spoken of with especial felicity, but still more metaphorically than the real truth, in order to the explanation of a matter which is ex­ tremely necessary, namely, to show that everything that we do through anger, or fear, or pain, or grief, or any other passion, is confessedly faulty and open to reproach;", "6144": "but all that we do in accordance with right reason and knowledge is praiseworthy.", "6145": "You see now what great caution he uses in speaking here, when he says, \" I was indignant that I had made them,\" not reversing the order of the words so as to say, \" Because I had made them I was indignant;", "6146": "\" for the latter expression would have become a person who repented of what he had done, an idea which is inconsistent with the nature of God, which fore­ sees everything.", "6147": "But the other doctrine is a general one, being the expression of a man who means to explain by it that anger is the fountain of all sins, and reason the source of all good actions.", "6148": "But God, remembering his own perfect good­ ness in every particular, even if the whole or the greater part of mankind fall off from him by reason of the abundance and extravagance of their sins, stretching forth his right hand, his hand of salvation, supports man and raises him up, not per mitting the whole race to be utterly destroyed and to perish everlastingly.", "6149": "XVI.", "6150": "On which account God now says, that Noah found grace in his sight, when all the rest of mankind appearing ungrateful were about to receive punishment, in order that he might mingle saving mercy with judgment against sinners.", "6151": "As the psalmist has said somewhere, \" My song shall be of mercy and judgment.\"*", "6152": "For if God were to choose to judge the race of mankind without mercy, he would pass on them a sentence of condemnation;", "6153": "since there has never been a single man who, by his own unassisted power, has run the whole course of his life, from the beginning to the end, with­ out stumbling;", "6154": "but since some men have fallen into voluntary.", "6155": "and some into involuntary sins, that therefore the human race might still subsist, even though many of the subordinate mem­ bers of it go to destruction.", "6156": "God mingles mercy with his justice, which he exercises towards the good actions of even the unworthy;", "6157": "and he not only pities them while judging, but judges them while pitying them, for mercy is older than jus­ tice in his sight, inasmuch as he knew the man who deserved punishment, not after he had passed sentence on him, but also before sentence.", "6158": "XVII.", "6159": "On which account he

upon those uncreated powers which exist around him, and emit the most dazzling light, without any veil or modification.", "6167": "As, therefore, the sun extends his rays from heaven to the boundaries of the earth, tempering and dissolving the exceed­ ing violence of the heat that is in them by cool air, for he mixes his rays with that, in order that that portion of them which gives light being separated from that portion which gives heat, he may remit somewhat of his power of burning, but retain the power by which he gives light, and so be re­ ceived with welcome, when meeting that kindred and friendly light which is situated in the eyes of man ;", "6168": "for the meeting of these two lights in the same place, coming from an opposite direction, and the reception of the one by the other, is what causes that comprehension which we arrive at by our faculty of sight:", "6169": "but what mortal could possibly receive in this man­ ner the knowledge, and wisdom, and prudence, and justice, and all the other virtues of God, in an unalloyed state ?", "6170": "The whole heaven, the whole world, could not do so.", "6171": "Therefore the Creator, knowing the way in which he exceeded in all things that were most excellent, and the inherent natural weakness of created beings, even though they boast loudly, does not think either to benefit them or to chastise them to the extremity

sketches out the generic and spe­ cific virtues;", "6216": "for genus resembles a city, because it is marked out in larger circumferences, and because it is common to many individuals;", "6217": "and species resembles a house, because it is more contracted and avoids community;", "6218": "and cisterns prepared before-hand intimate the rewards which fall to the lot of some for their labour, while they are given spontaneously to others, being channels of heavenly and wholesome waters and well prepared treasures for the preservation of the virtues before­ mentioned, by means of which joy is shed over the perfect heart, irradiating it all over with the light of truth.", "6219": "Again, when Moses speaks of the vineyards, he means them as an emblem of cheerfulness, and the olive gardens as a symbol of light.", "6220": "Happy, therefore, are they who, suffering something like those persons who awoke up out of deep sleep, on a sudden, without any labour or exertion on their part, behold the world before them;", "6221": "and miserable are they to whom it happens to be eagerly contentious for objects to which they are not fitted by nature, being full of a contentious spirit, which is the most grievous of diseases.", "6222": "For, in addition to failing in the object which they are desirous of attaining, they do further incur great disgrace with no slight injury, like ships which are attempting to make their way by sea against opposing winds;", "6223": "for they, in addition to being unable to proceed in their course towards the point to which they are hastening, are very often upset with their crews and their cargoes, and so cause pain to their friends and pleasure to their enemies.", "6224": "XXII.", "6225": "Therefore the law says that some persons, having made a violent effort, went up to the mountain, \" And the Amorites came forth who dwell on that mountain, and wounded them, as bees might have done, and pursued them from Seir even to Hormah.\"t", "6226": "For it follows of necessity that those persons who, being by nature unfitted for the comprehension of arts, if by making violent efforts they do something in them, not only fail of attaining their end, but also incur disgrace;", "6227": "and those who voluntarily, but still without any deliberate con­ sent of their mind, do something that they ought to do, putting a sort of constraint on their own voluntary principle, do not succeed, but are wounded and harassed by their own con­ sciences.", "6228": "So also those who restore deposits of small value in the hope of having larger deposits entrusted to them, which they may be able to appropriate, you would call men of good faith ;", "6229": "and yet even when they are restoring the deposits, they put a great constraint on their natural faithlessness, by which it is to be hoped, they will be unceasingly tormented.", "6230": "And do not all those who offer but a spurious kind of worship to the only wise God, putting on a profession of a rigid life like a dress on a magnificent stage, merely with the object of making a display before the assembled spectators, having im­ posture rather than piety in their souls, do not they, I say, stretch themselves on the rack as it were, and torment them­ selves, compelling even the truth itself to assume a false ap­ pearance.", "6231": "Therefore, they being for a brief period over­ shadowed

disguise, display their naked hypocrisy.", "6233": "And then like men, convicted of being aliens, they are looked upon as enemies, having entered themselves as citizens of that noblest of cities-virtue, while they have really no connection with it.", "6234": "For whatever is violent (βίαιον) is also of short duration, as its very name imports, since it closely resembles short (βαιὸν).", "6235": "And the ancients used the two words (βαιὸν) and (ὀλιγοχϱόνιον) of short duration as synonymous.", "6236": "XXIII.", "6237": "We must now consider the question which is meant by \" Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord God.\" ✽", "6238": "Is the meaning of what is here expressed this, that he received grace, or that he was accounted worthy of grace ?", "6239": "The former idea it is not natural for us to entertain ;", "6240": "for what was given to him beyond what was given to all, as one may say, not only to all concrete natures only, but to all elementary and simple natures which have been accounted worthy of divine grace?", "6241": "But the second interpretation has a reason in it which is not altogether inconsistent, that the cause of all things, judges those persons worthy of his gifts, who do not corrupt the divine impression which has been stamped upon them, namely, the most sacred mind, with disgraceful practices;", "6242": "still perhaps even this is not the true meaning of the words.", "6243": "For what kind of person must he be who would be accounted before God to be worthy of his grace ?", "6244": "I indeed think that the whole world put together could scarcely attain to such a pitch, and yet the world is the first, and greatest, and most perfect of all the works of God.", "6245": "May it not then perhaps be better to understand this expression as meaning that the virtuous man being fond of investigating things, and eager for learning, amid all the dif­ ferent things that he has investigated, has found this one most certain fact, that all things that exist, the earth, the water, the air, the fire, the sun, the stars, the heaven, all animals and plants whatever, are the grace of God.", "6246": "But God has given nothing to himself, for he has no need of anything ;", "6247": "but he has given the world to the world, and its parts he has bestowed on themselves and on one another, and also on the universe, and without having judged anything to be worthy of grace, (for he gives all his good things without grudging to the universe and to its parts), he merely has regard to his own everlasting goodness, thinking the doing good to be a line of conduct suitable to his own happy and blessed nature ;", "6248": "so that if any one were to ask me, what was the cause of the creation of the world, having learnt from Moses, I should answer, that the goodness of the living God, being the most im­ portant of his graces, is in itself the cause.", "6249": "XXIV.", "6250": "But here we must observe that Moses says, that \" Noah pleased \" the powers of the living God, \" the Lord and God,\" but that he tells us that Moses himself pleased the Being who is attended by those powers as his body guard, and who, without them, is conceived only according to his essence.", "6251": "For it is said here, speaking in the person of God, \" Because thou hast found grace in my sight,\" * pointing out himself instead of any one else whatever.", "6252": "Thus, therefore, he who exists himself by himself alone, thinks the exceeding wisdom which is found in Moses worthy of grace, and that other wis­ dom which was formed on the model of his, he considers of an inferior class, and more a wisdom of species, as consisting of subordinate powers, according to which he is both Lord and God, and ruler and benefactor.", "6253": "But another mind attached to the body and the slave of the passions, having been sold as slave to the chief cook,* that is to say to the pleasure of our compound being, and being castrated and mutilated of all the masculine and generative parts of the soul, being afflicted with a want of all good practices, and being incapable of receiving the divine voice, being also separated and cut off from the sacred assembly, in which conferences and discussions about virtue are continually being brought up, is conducted into the prison of the passions, and finds grace, (a grace more inglorious than clishonour), with the keeper of the prison.", "6254": "†For these men are properly called prisoners, not those who after they have been condemned at the judgment seat by the legitimate magistrates, or by judges formally appointed, are led away by the officers into the place appointed for malefactors;", "6255": "but those in whom nature has condemned the disposition of their souls, men who are full of intemperance, and cowardice, and injustice, and impiety, and innumerable other evils;", "6256": "but the steward, and keeper, and guardian of these men, is the keeper of the prison, a composition and combination of all kinds of various wickednesses, united together into one mass, to please whom is the greatest of punishments.", "6257": "But some people who do not perceive this, being deceived with respect to what is injurious to such a degree, as to look upon it as advantageous, come to him with great joy, and offer themselves as his body-guards, that being accounted faithful by him, they may become his lieutenants and successors in the guardianship of involuntary and voluntary offences;", "6258": "but do thou, 0 my soul, thinking such an office and magistracy as that, more grievous than the most laborious slavery, adopt, as far as you can, an unrestrained, and unconfined, and free system of life, and if you are caught by the baits of passion, endure rather to be a prisoner yourself, than the keeper of a prison ;", "6259": "for then if you suffer distress, and groan aloud, you will obtain pity;", "6260": "but if you give yourself up to ambition of great posts, and to a covetousness of honour, you will receive that pleasant and greatest evil of being keeper of the prison, by which you will be influenced the whole of your life.", "6261": "XXV.", "6262": "Reject therefore with all your might all idea of pleasing the keepers of the prison ;", "6263": "but on the contrary, with all your ability and all your earnestness, labour to please him who is the cause of all things ;", "6264": "and if you are unable to do so, (for the greatness of his dignity is exceeding high), at all events advance, without ever turning back, towards his powers, and present yourself to them as their suppliant, until they admit­ ting the continual assiduity and sincerity of your service, place you in the ranks of those who have pleased them, as they did Noah, of whose descendants Moses has made a most admirable and novel catalogue ;", "6265": "for he says, \" These are the generations of Noah:", "6266": "Noah was a just man, being perfect in his gene­ ration, and Noah pleased God\";", "6267": "for the descendants of the compound being were naturally compound beings also them­ selves ;", "6268": "for horses do of necessity beget horses, and lions beget lions, bulls become the parents of bulls, and so too men beget men;", "6269": "but such things are not the appropriate offspring of a good mind;", "6270": "the progeny of that are the virtues before mentioned, namely the being a man, the being just, the being perfect, the pleasing God, which last particular, inasmuch as it is the crowning one, and as it were the boundary of perfect happiness, is enumerated last of all.", "6271": "But there is one kind of creation, which is a sort of con­ ducting and travelling from that which does not exist to existence.", "6272": "This is the one which plants, and animals do of necessity use;", "6273": "and there is another kind, which is a transition and change from a better genus to a worse species, which Moses mentions when he says, \"These are the generations of Jacob ;", "6274": "Joseph when he was seventeen years of age, was keeping the sheep with his brethren, being a youth with the sons of Billah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. \"t", "6275": "For when this reason inclined to meditation and devoted to learning, was driven down from its more divine speculations, human and mortal opinions, then Joseph, the companion of the body, and of all the things which pertain to the body was born, being still but a youth, even though in the lapse of time he may become greyheaded, as being one who never listened to any older discourse or opinions, which the com­ panions of Moses acquired as the most useful possessions for themselves and their disciples.", "6276": "On this account it seems to me that Moses wishing to describe his figure and to give a more accurate idea of his appearance, so as to make it known, introduced him as tending his father's sheep, not in the com­ pany of any one of his father's legitimate sons, but with his illegitimate brethren, who, being the sons of concubines, derive their name from the inferior sex, that of the women, and not from the superior sex, that, namely of the man ;", "6277": "for they here are called the sons of Jacob's wives, Billah and Zilpah, and not the sons of their father Israel.", "6278": "XXVI.", "6279": "And one may here very fitly raise the question for what reason it was that after mentioning the perfection of Noah in virtue, he then immediately adds that \" the earth was become corrupt in the sight of God, and was filled with wickedness.\"*", "6280": "But perhaps it is not difficult to arrive at a solution of this doubt, for any one who is not exceedingly ignorant of all in­ struction.", "6281": "We must say therefore, that when an incorruptible species arises in the soul, the mortal part is immediately de­ stroyed ;", "6282": "for the birth of virtuous studies is the death of dis­ graceful ones, since also when light shines forth darkness dis­ appears.", "6283": "On this account, in the law of leprosy, it is most expressly enjoined that \"", "6284": "If the living skin arise in the leper, he shall be polluted ;", "6285": "\"t and further ratifying this same injunction, and as it were setting a seal to it, he adds, \" and the flesh which is sound shall pollute him,\" delivering this injunction in opposition to what is natural or usual:", "6286": "for all men think the things that are sick the pollution of those that are in health, and those that are dead the pollution of the living, and not, on the contrary, that the healthy and the living are the pollution of the sick and of the dead, but rather, they account them their salvation.", "6287": "But the lawgiver being full of the most modern wisdom in everything, has this peculiarity in his expositions, that he teaches that the healthy and the living are the causes of our not being pure from pollution;", "6288": "for the healthy and living complexion in the soul is truly conviction which rises up against it:", "6289": "when this conviction rises up, it makes a catalogue of all the offences of the soul, and reproaching it with them, and looking sternly at it, it is scarcely able to be stopped in its attacks upon it;", "6290": "and the soul being convicted recognises all its actions by which it has offended against right reason, and per­ ceives that it is foolish, and intemperate, and unjust, and fall of pollutions.", "6291": "XXVII.", "6292": "On which account Moses also establishes a most extraordinary law, in which he enjoins that \" the man who is in part leprous shall be accounted impure, but that he who is wholly, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head over­ whelmed with leprosy, shall be considered pure ;", "6293": "\"* for any one else, I apprehend, reasoning from probability, would say the exact contrary, and would think that the leprosy which was contracted, and which extended over only a small portion of the body, was less impure, but that the leprosy which was dif.", "6294": "fused, so as to spread over the whole body was more impure :", "6295": "but Moses here, as it appears to me, uses this symbolical ex­ pression to intimate this most undeniable truth, that uninten­ tional misdeeds, even if they be of the greatest enormity, are not deserving of blame, and are pure, inasmuch as they have not conscience, that terrible accuser, to testify against them:", "6296": "but that intentional offences, even if they do not extend over a wide surface, being convicted by the judge who passes sentence against the soul, are rightly accounted unholy, and polluted, and impure.", "6297": "This leprosy, therefore, being of a twofold character, and putting forth two complexions, signifies voluntary depravity;", "6298": "for the soul, though it has healthy, and vivifying, and right reason in itself, does not use it for the preservation of its good things, but surrendering itself to persons unskilled in naviga­ tion, it overturns the whole bark of life, which might have been saved in calm fine weather;", "6299": "but when it changes so as to assume one uniform white appearance, it displays an involun­ tary change;", "6300": "since the mind, entirely deprived of the power of reasoning, not having left in it one single seed to beget understanding, like a man in a mist or in deep darkness, sees nothing that ought to be done;", "6301": "but, like a blind man, fall­ ing without seeing his way before him into all kinds of error, endures continual falls and disasters one after another, in spite of all its efforts.", "6302": "XXVIII.", "6303": "And like this is the injunction given respecting the house in which it happens that leprosy often arises;", "6304": "for Moses says that, \" If there be a taint of leprosy in the house, the owner shall come, and shall tell it to the priest, saying there is something like a taint of leprosy has been seen by me in my bouse,\"* and presently he adds, \"And the priest shall command him to dismantle his house, before the priest enters into the house to see it, and all the things that are in the house shall not be impure ;", "6305": "and after that the priest shall enter the house to examine it.\"", "6306": "Therefore, before the priest enters in, the things in the house are pure ;", "6307": "but after he has entered inn from that time forth they are all impure.", "6308": "And yet the contrary would have been natural, that when a man thoroughly purified and perfect, who is in the habit of offering up prayers and purifications, and sacrifices for all the people come into a house, all that is therein would be improved by his presence, and would become pure from having been impure ;", "6309": "but now they do not even remain in the same condition as before, but they are brought into a worse state by the arrival of the priest.", "6310": "But whether this is consistent with the literal and obvious order of the words, those men may inquire who are in the habit of, and fond of pursuing such Investigations ;", "6311": "but we must affirm distinctly, that no one thing can be more consistent with another than the fact, that when the priest enters in, all the things in the house should be polluted ;", "6312": "for as long as the divine word has not come to our souls as to a hearth of hospitality, all its actions are blameless ;", "6313": "for the overseer, or the father, or the teacher, or whatever else it may be fit to entitle the priest, by whom alone it is possible for it to be admonished and chastened, is at a distance:", "6314": "and those persons are to be pardoned who do wrong from inexperience, out of ignorance what they ought to do:", "6315": "for they do not look upon their deeds in the light of sins, but even sometimes they believe that they are doing right in cases in which they are erring greatly;", "6316": "but when the real priest, conviction, enters our hearts, like a most pure ray of light, then we think that the designs which we have cherished within our souls are not pure, and we see that our actions are liable to blame, and deserving of reproach, though we did them through ignorance of what was right.", "6317": "All these things, there­ fore, the priest, that is to say, conviction, pollutes, and orders that they should be taken away and stripped off, in order that he may see the abode of the soul pure,!", "6318": "and, if there are an' diseases in it, that he may heal them.", "6319": "B BXXIX.", "6320": "And the woman who met the

right road, be compelled to yield to one of two rival faults, let us desire and pray to be able to proceed straight along the middle of the road.", "6417": "Now, the middle between temerity and cowardice, is courage ;", "6418": "the mean between profuse extravagance and illiberal stinginess, is temperance;", "6419": "that between crafty unscrupulousness and folly, is prudence;", "6420": "and

young shoots.", "6487": "Moreover, those trees which are of good sorts, and which make many shoots, he propagates by extend­ ing them under the earth in ditches of no very great depth, and those which

which shoot forth and grow up to a height, bringing forth pernicious fruits, are rooted up, and cut down, and cleared away, so that not even the smallest frag­ ment of them is left, from which any new shoots of evil actions can subsequently spring up.", "6500": "And if, besides, there are any trees which produce no fruit at all, neither good nor bad, the husbandman will cut them down too, but still he will not suffer them to be completely destroyed, but he will apply them to some appropriate use, making them into stakes and fixing them as pales all round his homestead, or using them as a fence for a city to serve instead of a wall.", "6501": "III.", "6502": "For Moses says, “ Every tree which bringeth not forth fruit good to eat thou shalt cut down ;", "6503": "and thou shalt make it into stakes against the city which shall make war upon thee.”*", "6504": "And these trees are likened to those powers developed in words alone, which have nothing in them but mere speculation, among which

about the discovery of the truth, but solely about the means of deceiving the hearers by plausible persuasion ;", "6505": "and in the same class we must place all those parts of dialectics and geometry which have no connection with a proper regulation of the character or morals, but which only sharpen the mind, not suffering it to exercise a dull apprehension towards each question which is raised and submitted to it, but always to dissect the question and divide it, so as to distinguish the peculiar character of each thing from the common qualities of the whole genus.", "6506": "At all events, men say, that the ancients compared the principles of philosophy, as being threefold, to a field ;", "6507": "likening natural philosophy to trees and plants, and moral philosophy to fruits, for the sake of which the plants are planted ;", "6508": "and logical philosophy to the hedge or fence :", "6509": "for as the wall, which is erected around, is the guardian of the plants and of the fruit which are in the field, keeping off all those who wish to do them injury and to destroy them, in the same manner, the logical part of philosophy is the strongest possible sort of protection to the other two parts, the moral and the natural philosophy ;", "6510": "for when it simplifies twofold and ambiguous expressions, and when it solves specious plausibilities entangled in sophisms, and utterly destroys seductive deceits, the greatest allurement and ruin to the soul, by means of its own expressive and clear language, and its unambiguous demon­ stations, it makes the whole mind smooth like wax, and ready to receive all the innocent and very praiseworthy impressions of sound natural and moral philosophy.", "6511": "IV.", "6512": "These then are the professions and promises made by the husbandry of the soul, \" I will cut down all the trees of folly, and intemperance, and injustice, and cowardice;", "6513": "and I will eradicate all the plants of pleasure, and appetite, and

founda­ tions of the earth, so that no portion, nay, no trace, or shadow whatever, of such things shall be left;", "6515": "and I will destroy these things, and I will implant in those souls which are of a child­ like age, young shoots, whose fruit shall nourish them.", "6516": "And those shoots are as follows:", "6517": "the practice of writing and reading with facility;", "6518": "an accurate study and investigation of the works of wise poets;", "6519": "geometry, and a careful study of rhetorical speeches, and the whole course of encyclical edu­ cation.", "6520": "And in those souls which have arrived at the age of puberty or.", "6521": "of manhood, I will implant things which are even better and more perfect, namely, the tree of prudence, the tree of courage, the tree of temperance, the tree of justice, the tree of every respective virtue.", "6522": "And if there be any tree belonging to what is called the wild class, which does not bear eatable fruit, but which is able to be a fence to and a protector of that which is eatable, that also I will manage, not for its own sake, but because it is calculated by nature to be of use to what is necessary and very useful.", "6523": "V.", "6524": "Therefore, the allwise Moses attributes to the just man a knowledge of the husbandry of the soul, as an act consistent with his character, and thoroughly suited to him, saying, \" Noah began to be a husbandman.\"", "6525": "But to the unjust man he attributes the task of tilling the ground, which is an em­ ployment bearing the heaviest burdens without any knowledge.", "6526": "For

indeed suppose that what is here said, is said of a man who is able to work by his hands or by his feet, or by any other of the powers of his body, or of any mountain land, or of any champaign country, but that is applicable to the powers existing in every one of us;", "6530": "for it happens that the soul of the wicked man is not concerned about any thing else except about his earthly body, and about all the pleasures of that body.", "6531": "Moreover, the general crowd of men, travelling over the different climates of the earth and penetrating to its furthest boundaries, and traversing the seas, and investigating the things that lie hid in the recesses of the ocean, and leaving no single part of the whole universe unexplored, is continually providing from every quarter the means by which it can in­ crease pleasure.", "6532": "For as fishermen let down their nets at times to the most extraordinary depths, comprehending a vast surface of the sea in their circle, in order to catch the greatest possible number of fish enclosed within their nets, like people shut up within the walls of a besieged city ;", "6533": "so in the same manner the greatest part of men having extended their universal nets to take everything, as the poets somewhere say, not only over the parts of the sea, but also over the whole nature of earth, and air, and water, seek to catch everything from every quarter for the enjoyment and attainment of pleasure.", "6534": "For they dig mines in the earth, and they sail across the seas, and they achieve every other work both of peace and war, providing un­ bounded materials for pleasure, as for their queen, being utterly uninitiated in that husbandry of the soul which sows and plants the virtues and reaps their fruit, which is a happy life.", "6535": "But they labouring to procure, and reducing to a system those things which are pleasant to the flesh, cultivate with all imaginable care that composite mass, that carefully fashioned statue, the narrow house of the soul, which, from its birth to its death it can never lay aside, but which it is compelled to bear till the day of its death, burdensome as it is.", "6536": "VI.", "6537": "We have now therefore explained, in what respect, the occupation of tilling the ground differs from husbandry, and a tiller of the ground from a husbandman.", "6538": "And we must now consider whether there are not some other species akin to these already mentioned, but which, through the common names borne by them and others, conceal the real difference which exists between them.", "6539": "At least there are two which we have discovered by investigation, concerning which we will say what is fitting, if it is in our power.", "6540": "Therefore, as we found a tiller of the earth and a husband­ man, though there did not appear to be any difference between them (till we came to investigate the allegorical meaning con­ cealed under each name), nevertheless very far removed from one another in fact, such also shall we find to be the case with a shepherd and a keeper of sheep.", "6541": "For the lawgiver some­ times speaks of the occupation of a shepherd, and sometimes of that of a keeper of sheep.", "6542": "And those who do not examine expressions with any excessive accuracy, will perhaps fancy that these two appellations are synonimous terms for the same employment.", "6543": "They are, however, in reality the names of things which are widely different in the meaning affixed to their concealed ideas.", "6544": "For if it is customary to give both the names of shepherd and keeper of sheep to those who have the management of flocks, still they do not give these names to that reason which is the superintendant of the flock of the soul;", "6545": "for a man who is but an indifferent manager of a flock is called a keeper of sheep, but a good and faithful one is called a shepherd, and in what way we will proceed to show immediately.", "6546": "VII.", "6547": "Nature has made cattle akin to every individual among us, the soul putting forth two young branches as from one root;", "6548": "one of which being entire and undivided, and being left in its integrity is called the mind;", "6549": "but the other part is sepa­ rated by six divisions into seven natures, five outward senses, and two other organs, the organs of speech, and that of gene­ ration.", "6550": "But all this multitude of external senses and organs being destitute of reason is compared to a sheep, but since it is composed of many parts, it of necessity stands in need of a governor by the unvarying law of nature.", "6551": "Whenever there­ fore a man who is ignorant how to govern, and at the same time wealthy, rises up and appoints himself governor, he be­ comes the cause of innumerable evils to the flocks, for he supplies all necessary things in superabundance, and the flock beingimmoderately glutted with them becomes insolent through the superfluity of food ;", "6552": "for insolence is the genuine offspring of satiety.", "6553": "Accordingly, they become insolent and exult, and shake off all restraint, and being scattered in small divisions they break the appointed order of the Lord.", "6554": "But he who, for a while, was then governor, being deserted by the flock under his orders, appears stripped of his authority, and runs about earnestly endeavouring, if possible, to collect the scattered flock together and to unite it again;", "6555": "but when he finds that he is unable to do this he groans and weeps, blaming his own remissness, and reproaching himself as the cause of all that has happened.", "6556": "In this manner, also, the offspring of the outward senses, when the mind is supine and indolent, being satiated in the most unbounded degree with a superfluity of the pleasures of the outward senses, toss their heads, and frisk about, and rove about, at random, wherever they please ;", "6557": "the eyes being opened wide to embrace every object of sight, and hastening even to feast themselves on objects which ought not to be looked at;", "6558": "and the ears eagerly receiving every kind of voice, and never being satisfied, but always thirsting for superfluity and the in­ dulgence of vain curiosity, and sometimes even for such delights as are but little suited to a free man.", "6559": "VIII.", "6560": "Since on what other account can we imagine, that in every quarter of the habitable globe, the theatres are every day filled with incalculable myriads of spectators ?", "6561": "For they, being wholly under the dominion of sounds and sights, and allowing their ears and their eyes to be carried away without any re­ straint, go in pursuit of harp-players and singers to the harp, and every description of effeminate and unmanly music ;", "6562": "and, moreover, eagerly receiving dancers and every other kind of actors, because they place themselves and move in all kinds of effeminate positions and motions, they are continually by their applause exciting the factions of the theatre, never thinking either of the propriety of their own conduct or of that of the general body of the citizens ;", "6563": "but, miserable as they are, up­ setting all their own plan of life for the sake of their eyes and ears.", "6564": "And there are others who are still more unfortunate and miserable than these men, who have released their sense of taste out of prison as it were ;", "6565": "and that sense, immediately rushing, in an unrestrained manner, to every kind of meat and drink, selects from the things that are already prepared, and also cherishes an indiscriminate and insatiable hunger for what is not present.", "6566": "So that, even if the channels of the belly are filled, its ever unsatisfied appetites, raging and ravening around, continue to look and stalk about in every direction, lest there should any where be any fragment which has been over­ looked, that it may swallow that up also like a devouring fire.", "6567": "And this gluttony is followed by its usual natural attendant, an eagerness for the connections of the sexes, which brings in its train a strange frenzy, an unrestrainable madness and a most grievous fury;", "6568": "for, when men are oppressed by the indulgence of gluttony and delicate food, and by much unmixed wine and drunkenness, they are no longer able to restrain themselves, but hastening to amorous gratifications they revel and disturb the doors, until they are at last able to rest when they have drawn off the great violence of their passion.", "6569": "On which account nature, as it would seem, has placed the organs of such connec­ tion beneath the belly, being previously aware that they do not delight in hunger, but that they follow upon satiety and then rise up to fulfil their peculiar operations.", "6570": "IX.", "6571": "Those, then, who permit the flock committed to their charge to satiate themselves all at once with all the things that they desire, we must call keepers of sheep;", "6572": "but those, on the contrary, we should entitle shepherds, who supply their flocks with only so much as is necessary and proper for them;", "6573": "cutting off and utterly rejecting all superfluous and useless ex­ travagance and abundance, which is not less injurious than want and deficiency, and who guard with great prudence against the possibility of the flock becoming diseased through their want of care and indolence, praying that those diseases, which at times are liable to attack flocks from external causes, may not visit theirs.", "6574": "And they take equal care that it may not straggle about at random and get scattered, holding out to them as an object of fear one who will chastise those who never obey reason, and inflicting continual punishment, moderate when applied to those who err only in such a degree as admits of a remedy, but very severe when laid upon those whose wicked­ ness is uncurable;",

represented as the shepherd of the mind which em­ braces pride in preference to truth, and which receives appear­ ance rather than reality;", "6586": "for the interpretation of the name Jethro is \" superfluous,\" and superfluity is pride adopted for the purpose of introducing error into correct life ;", "6587": "which is the cause why different things are looked upon as right in different cities, and not those principles which ought to be looked upon as just everywhere, inasmuch as it never sees, not even in a dream, the common and immovable principles of the justice of nature.", "6588": "For, it is said, that \" Moses was the shepherd of the sheep of Jethro, the priest of Midian.”", "6589": "And this man himself prays that the flock may not be left without a shepherd, mean­ ing by the flock the whole multitude of the parts of the soul;", "6590": "but that they may meet with a good shepherd, who will lead them away from the nets of folly, and injustice, and all wicked­ ness, and conduct them to the doctrines of learning and all other virtue;", "6591": "for, says Moses, \" Let the Lord the God of spirits and of all flesh look down upon man and upon this assembly.\"t", "6592": "And then, a little further on, he adds, \"", "6593": "And the assembly of the Lord shall not be like sheep who have no shepherd.\"XI.", "6594": "But is it not well worth praying for, that the flock which is akin to each individual of us, and of so much value, may not be left without any superintendent or governor, so that we may not, through being filled with a love of the worst of all constitutions, an ochlocracy, which is a base copy of the best form, democracy, pass our lives for ever amid tumults, and disorders, and intestine seditions ?", "6595": "Certainly it is not anarchy alone that is an evil, through being the parent of ochlocracy, but also the insurrection of any lawless and violent force against authority;", "6596": "for the tyrant who, by his own nature is hostile, is, in the case of cities, a man, but in the case of the body and the soul, and all transactions having reference to either, he is a mind resembling the brute beasts, besieging the citadel of each in­ dividual ;", "6597": "but not only are these dominations unprofitable, but so also are the governments and authority of other persons, who are very gentle, for gentleness is a line of conduct very likely to be despised, and injurious to both parties, both to the rulers and the subjects.", "6598": "To the one from the disregard with which their subjects treat them, so that they are unable to manage any matter, whether of public or of their own private business successfully, are sometimes even compelled to abdi­ cate their authority;", "6599": "and to the others, because of their con­ tinual disrespect to their governors, disregarding all persuasion, so that they contract a habit of self-willed insolence, a pos­ session of great evil.", "6600": "We must then think that one of these classes of governors differs in no respect from keepers of sheep, while the others resemble the sheep themselves, for the go­ vernors persuade the governed to be luxurious, through the extravagance of the supplies with which they provide them;", "6601": "and the governed being unable to bear their satiety become insolent;", "6602": "but what is really desirable is, that our mind should govern all our conduct, like a goatherd, or a cowherd, or a shepherd, or, in short, like any herdsman of any kind;", "6603": "choosing in preference to what is pleasant that which is for the advantage both of himself and of his flock.", "6604": "XII.", "6605": "But the providence of God is the principal and almost the only cause that the divisions of the soul are not left entirely without any governor, and that they have met with a blameless and in all respects good shepherd.", "6606": "In consequence of whose appointment it is impossible that the company of the mind should become scattered ;", "6607": "for it will of necessity appear in one and the same order, looking to the authority of its one governor, since the heaviest burden of all is to be compelled to obey a variety of rulers.", "6608": "Thus, indeed, being a shepherd is a good thing, so that it is justly attributed, not only to kings, and to wise men, and to souls who are perfectly purified, but also to God, the ruler of all things ;", "6609": "and he who confirms this is not any ordinary person, but a prophet, whom it is good to believe, he namely who wrote the psalms;", "6610": "for he speaks thus, \"The Lord is my shepherd, and he shall cause me to lack nothing and let every one in his turn say the same thing, for it is very becoming to every man who loves God to study such a song as this, but above all this world should sing it.", "6611": "For God, like a shepherd and a king, governs (as if they were a flock of sheep) the earth, and the water, and the air, and the fire, and all the plants, and living creatures that are in them, whether mortal or divine;", "6612": "and lie regulates the nature of the heaven, and the periodical revolutions of the sun and moon, and the variations and harmonious movements of the other stars, ruling them according to law and justice ;", "6613": "ap­ pointing, as their immediate superintendent, his own right reason, his first-born son, who is to receive the charge of this sacred.", "6614": "company, as the lieutenant of the great king;", "6615": "for it is said somewhere, \"Behold, I am he!", "6616": "I will send my mes­ senger before thy face, who shall keep thee in the road.”*", "6617": "Let therefore all the world, the greatest and most perfect flock of the living God, say, \" The Lord is my shepherd, and he shall cause me to lack nothing,\" and let every separate individual say the same thing;", "6618": "not with the voice which proceeds from his tongue and his mouth, extending only through a scanty portion of the air, but with the wide spreading voice of the mind, which reaches to the very extremities of this universe;", "6619": "for it is impossible that there should be a deficiency of anything that is necessary, where God presides, who is in the habit of bestowing good things in all fulness and completeness in all living beings.", "6620": "XIII.", "6621": "But there is a very beautiful encouragement to equality contained in the song before mentioned;", "6622": "for in real truth, the man who appears to have everything else, and yet who is impatient under the authority of one master, is in­ complete in his happiness, and is poor ;", "6623": "but if a soul is governed by God, having that one and only thing on which all other things depend, it is very naturally in no need of other things, regarding not blind riches, but only such as are endowed with real and acute sight, f All true disciples have come to conceive an earnest and unalterable love for that;", "6624": "and therefore laughing at the mere keeping of sheep, they have directed their attention to the attainment of a shepherd's knowledge;", "6625": "and a proof of this is to be found in the case of Joseph, who was always studying that knowledge which is conversant about the body and vain opinions, not being able to rule and govern irrational nature (for it is customary for old men to be appointed to offices of irresponsible authority;", "6626": "but this man is always young, even if after a lapse of time he may come to support old age, which has at last reached him);", "6627": "and being accustomed to nourish this and to lead it on to growth, he expects to be able to persuade the lovers of virtue to change and come over to him, in order, that in so changing to irrational and inanimate objects, they may have no leisure for applying themselves to the studies of a rational soul.", "6628": "For Moses represents Joseph as saying, \" If the king,\" that is to say, the mind, the king of the body, “ shall ask you, What is your occupation ?", "6629": "answer,", "6630": "We are men, the keepers of cattle.”*", "6631": "When they hear this they are naturally impatient, not liking the idea, while they are rulers, of confessing that they hold the rank of subordinates;", "6632": "for those who supply food to the outward senses, through the abundance of the objects perceptible only by them, become the slaves of those who are nourished, like servants who pay to their mistresses a com­ pulsory reverence every day;", "6633": "but those who preside over them are rulers, and they bridle the vehement impetuosity with which they are hurried on to luxury.", "6634": "At first therefore, although they do not hear what is said with any pleasure, they will still keep silence, thinking it unseemly to discuss the difference between the employment of a keeper of cattle and a shepherd, before those who do not understand it;", "6635": "but subsequently, when a contest about these things arises, they will contend with all their power, and will never desist till they have carried their point by main force, having exhibited the liberality, and nobleness, and royal character of their nature to the living God.", "6636": "Accordingly when the king asks, \" What is your occupation ?\" they will answer \"", "6637": "We are shepherds, we and our fathers.", "6638": "XIV.", "6639": "Would they not then appear to boast as much of their occupation as shepherds, as the king himself, who is conversing with them, does of his mighty power and domin­ ion?", "6640": "At least they are testifying their high opinion of the profession of life which they have adopted, not in honour of themselves alone, but of their father also, as being worthy of all possible care and diligence;", "6641": "and yet, if the discussion had been merely about the care of goats or sheep, perhaps they would have been ashamed to make such an admission through desire to avoid dishonour;", "6642": "for such occupations are accounted inglorious and mean among those who are loaded with great prosperity, without being at the same time endowed with prudence, and especially among kings.", "6643": "And the Egyptian character is by nature most especially haughty and boastful whenever so slight a breeze of prosperity does merely blow upon it, so that men of that nation look upon the pursuits of life and objects of ambition of ordinary men, as subjects for laughter and downright ridicule.", "6644": "But since the matter before us, at present, is to consider the rational and irrational powers in the soul, those persons will naturally boast, who are persuaded that they are able to master the irrational faculties, by taking the rational ones for their allies.", "6645": "If therefore any envious or captious person should blame us, and say, \" How then have ye, who are devoted to the employment of shepherds, and who profess to be occupied in the care and management of the flocks which belong to you, ever thought of approaching the country of the body and the passions, namely Egypt ?", "6646": "and why have ye not turned your voyage in another direction?", "6647": "You must say to him in reply, with all freedom of speech, We have come hither as sojourn­ ers, not as inhabitants.\"", "6648": "For in reality every soul of a wise man has heaven for its country, and looks upon earth as a strange land, and considers the house of wisdom his own home;", "6649": "but the house of the body, a lodging-house, on which it pro­ poses to sojourn for a while.", "6650": "Therefore since the mind, the ruler of the flock, having taken the flock of the soul, using the law of nature as its teacher, governs it consistently and vigorously, rendering it worthy of approbation and great praise;", "6651": "but when it manages it sluggishly and indulgently, with a disregard of law, then it renders it blameable.", "6652": "Very naturally, therefore, the one will assume the name of a lung, being addressed as a shepherd, but the other will only have the title of a confectioner, or of a baker, being called a keeper of sheep, supplying the means of feasting and gluttonous eating to cattle accustomed to gorge themselves to satiety.", "6653": "XV.", "6654": "I have now therefore explained, in no superficial manner, in what way a husbandman differs from a tiller of the ground, and a shepherd from a keeper of sheep.", "6655": "There is also a third point, having some connection with what has already been said, which we will now proceed to speak of.", "6656": "For I consider that a horseman and a rider differ;", "6657": "meaning by this state­ ment, not merely that one man who is carried on a neighing animal differs from another mail who is carried on a similar beast, but the motion of the one is different from the motion of the other;", "6658": "therefore the man who gets on a horse without any skill in horsemanship, is correctly called a rider, and he has given himself up to an irrational and restive animal, to such a degree that it is absolutely inevitable that he must be carried wherever the animal chooses to go, and if he fails to see beforehand a chasm in the earth, or a deep pit, it has hap­ pened before now that such a man, in consequence of the impetuosity of his course, has been thrown headlong down a precipice and dashed to pieces.", "6659": "But a horseman, on the other hand, when he is about to mount, takes the bridle in his hand, and then taking hold of the mane on the horse's neck, he leaps on ;", "6660": "and though he appears to be carried by the horse, yet, if one must tell the truth, he in reality guides the animal that carries him, as a pilot guides a ship.", "6661": "For the pilot too, ap­ pearing to be carried by the ship which he is managing, does in real truth guide it, and conducts it to whatever harbour he is himself desirous to hasten.", "6662": "While, therefore, the horse goes on in obedience to the rein, the horseman pats the horse, as if praising it;", "6663": "but when it goes on with too great impetuosity, and is carried away beyond moderation, then he pulls it back with force and vigour, so as to restrain its speed.", "6664": "But if the horse continue to be disobedient, then he takes the whole bridle, and pulls him back, and drags back his neck, so that he is compelled to stop.", "6665": "And for all his restiveness and his continued disregard of the rein, there are whips and spurs pre­ pared, and all other instruments of punishment which have been invented by horse-breakers.", "6666": "And it is not wonderful :", "6667": "for when the horseman mounts, the art of horsemanship mounts too ;", "6668": "so that there then being two parties borne by the horse, and skilful in horsemanship, they will very naturally get the better of one animal who is subjected to them, and who is incapable of acquiring skill.", "6669": "XVI.", "6670": "Therefore now, leaving the consideration of these neighing animals, and of the parties carried by them, investi­ gate, if you will, the condition of your own soul.", "6671": "For in its several parts you will find both horses and a rider in the fashion of a charioteer, just as you do in external things.", "6672": "Now, the horses are appetite and passion,' the one being male and the other female.", "6673": "On this account, the one giving itself airs, wishes to be unrestrained and free, and holds its head erect, as a male animal naturally does;", "6674": "and the other, not being free, but of a slavish disposition, and rejoicing in all kinds of crafty wickedness, devours the house, and destroys the house, for she is female.", "6675": "And the rider and charioteer is one, namely the mind.", "6676": "When, indeed, he mounts with prudence, he is a charioteer ;", "6677": "but when he does so with folly, then he is but a rider.", "6678": "For a fool, through ignorance, is unable to keep hold of the reins ;", "6679": "but they, falling from his bands, drop on the ground.", "6680": "And the animals, immediately that they have got the better of the reins, run on in an ill-regulated and unrestrained course.", "6681": "But the man who has mounted behind them, not being able to take hold of anything by which he may steady himself, falls, and lacerating his knees and his hands and his face, like a miserable man as he is, he bitterly weeps over his disaster;", "6682": "and after hanging by his feet to the chariot after he has been overturned, he is suspended, with his face upwards, lying on his back;", "6683": "and as the chariot proceeds, he is dragged along, and injured in his head, and neck, and both his shoulders ;", "6684": "and then, being hurried on in this direction and in that, and being dashed against everything which lies in the way, he en­ dures a most pitiable death.", "6685": "He then meets with an end, such as I have been describing ;", "6686": "and the chariot, being lightened by his fall and bounding along violently, when, at last, it is dashed to the ground in the rebound, is easily broken to pieces, so that it can never again be joined or fastened together.", "6687": "And the animals, being now released from everything which could restrain them, proceed at random, and are frantic, and do not cease galloping on, till they are tripped up and fall, or till they are hurried over some high precipice, and so are dashed to pieces and destroyed.", "6688": "XVII.", "6689": "In this manner, then, it seems that the whole chariot of the soul is destroyed, with its passengers ;", "6690": "and all through the carelessness or unskilfulness of the driver.", "6691": "But it is desirable for them that such horses, and such drivers, and riders, so wholly without skill, should be destroyed, in order that the faculties of virtue may be roused ;", "6692": "for when folly has fallen, it follows of necessity that wisdom must rise up.", "6693": "On this account Moses, in his passages of exhortation, says, “ If thou gocst forth to battle against thy enemies, and if thou seest numbers of horses, and riders, and people, be not afraid, because the Lord thy God is with thee.\"*", "6694": "For we must neglect anger and desire, and, in short, all the passions, and indeed the whole company of reasonings, which are mounted upon each of the passions as upon horses, even if they believe that they can exert irresistible strength ;", "6695": "at least, all those must do so who have the power of the great King holding a shield over them, and in every place, and at every time, fight­ ing in their defence.", "6696": "But the divine army is the body of virtues, the champions of the souls that love God, whom it becomes, when they see the adversary defeated, to sing a most beautiful and becoming hymn to the God who giveth the vic­ tory and the glorious triumph;", "6697": "and two choruses, the one proceeding from the conclave of the men, and the other from the company of the women, will stand up and sing in alternate songs a melody responsive to one another's voices.", "6698": "And the chorus of men will have Moses for their leader;", "6699": "and that of the women will be under the guidance of Miriam, \" the purified outward sense.\" t", "6700": "For it is just that hymns and praises should be uttered in honour of God without any delay, both in accordance with the suggestions of the intellect and the perceptions of the outward senses, and that each in­ strument should be struck in harmony, I mean those both of the mind and of the outward sense, in gratitude and honour to the holy Saviour.", "6701": "Accordingly, all the men sing the song on the sea-shore, not indeed with a blind mind, but seeing sharply, Moses being the leader of the song ;", "6702": "and women sing, who are in good truth the most excellent of their sex, having been enrolled in the lists of the republic of virtue, Miriam being their leader.", "6703": "XVIII.", "6704": "And the same hymn is sung by both the choruses, having a most admirable burden of the song which is beautiful to be sung.", "6705": "And it is as follows:", "6706": "“ Let us sing unto the Lord, for he has been glorified gloriously;", "6707": "the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.”‡", "6708": "For no one, if he searches ever so eagerly, can ever discover a more excellent victory than that by which the most mighty army, four-footed, restive, and proud as it was, of the passions and vices was overthrown.", "6709": "For the vices are four in genus, and the passions likewise are equal in number.", "6710": "Moreover, the mind, which is the character of them all, the one which hates virtue and loves the passions, has fallen and perished-the mind, which delighted in pleasures and appetites, and deeds of injustice and wickedness, and likewise in acts of rapine and of covetousness.", "6711": "Very beautifully, therefore, does the lawgiver in his recom­ mendations, teach us not to elect as a chief, a man who is a breeder of horses, thinking that such a one is altogether unsuited to exercise authority, inasmuch as he is in a frenzy about pleasures and appetites, and intolerable loves, and rages about like an unbridled and unmanageable horse.", "6712": "For he speaks thus, \"", "6713": "Thou shalt not be able to set over thyself a mail that is a stranger, because he is not thy brother ;", "6714": "because he will not multiply for himself his horses, and will not turn his people towards Egypt.\" * Therefore, according to the most holy Moses, no man that was a breeder of horses was ever born fit for dominion;", "6715": "and yet some one perhaps may say that power in cavalry is a great strength to the king, not inferior either to infantry or to a naval force, but in many places far more advantageous than either, and especially in those cases in which one has need of swiftness of motion with­ out delay, but prompt and energetic, when the times do not admit of delay, but are at the very crisis of action, so that those who arrive too late are very naturally not considered to have been sluggish so much as to have been wholly useless, the opportunity for action having passed by like a cloud.", "6716": "XIX.", "6717": "And we would say to these people:", "6718": "My good men, the lawgiver is removing no protection whatever from the ruler, nor is he in any respect mutilating the army of his power which he has collected, by cutting off the force of cavalry which is the most efficient part of his army;", "6719": "but he is endeavouring to the best of his power to increase and strengthen it, in order that his allies, contributing to its strength and number, may most easily destroy their enemies.", "6720": "For who else is equally skilful in marshalling and arraying armies, and in distributing them in squadrons, and in appoint­ ing captains of regiments and leaders of squadrons, and other commanders of large and small bodies, and in displaying a knowledge of all the other suggestions of tactics and strategy, and in explaining the principles of the military art to those who will avail themselves of them skilfully, through the great superabundance of his knowledge of such matters ?", "6721": "But the question is not now about his force of cavalry, which it is necessary to collect around the rulers for the destruction of their enemies and the protection of their friends;", "6722": "but con­ cerning the irrational, and immoderate, and unmanageable im­ petuosity of the soul, which it is desirable to check, lest it should turn all its people towards Egypt, the country of the body, and labour with all its might to render it devoted to pleasure and to the passions, rather than to the service of virtue and of God;", "6723": "since it follows inevitably that he who has acquired a body of cavalry for himself, must, as he said him­ self, proceed on the road which leads to Egypt.", "6724": "For when the wave rises high and dashes over each side of the soul (looking upon it as a ship), that is to say, over the mind and the outward sense, being lifted up by evident pas­ sions and iniquities which blow fiercely upon it, so that the soul leans on one side and is nearly over-balanced;", "6725": "then, as is natural, the mind becoming water-logged, goes down, and the deep in which it is sunk and overwhelmed is the body, which is compared to Egypt.", "6726": "XX.", "6727": "Beware, therefore, never to occupy yourself in this kind of horse-breeding, for they who pursue the other kind are themselves also blameable, for how can they not be ?", "6728": "inasmuch as by them irrational animals are exceedingly humoured, and from their houses troops of well-fed horses continually go forth;", "6729": "while to the men who conduct them, not a person is found who ever gives the slightest contribution to relieve their wants, nor any present to increase their superfluities.", "6730": "But, never­ theless, they err in a lighter degree;", "6731": "for these men who breed horses to contend for the prize, assert that by so doing they are adorning the sacred games and the assemblies, which are held in honour everywhere, and they affirm that they are the causes not only of pleasure to the spectators, and of that kind of delight which arises from beholding the spectacle, but that they also give them an inducement to study and practise praiseworthy pursuits.", "6732": "For they who attribute to animals a desire for victory, using, out of their love of honour and rivalry in excellence, a certain unceasing exhortation, and encourage­ ment, and eagerness, enduring pleasant labours, will never desist from what is suitable and becoming to them, till they attain the end that they desire.", "6733": "But these men seek pretexts to excuse themselves, while doing wrong, but those who do wrong without excuse are they, who would make the mind a rider, and mount him upon his horse, though ignorant of the science of horsemanship, his horse being that four-footed vice and passion ;", "6734": "but if after having been taught the art of managing a chariot, you devote greater pains and study to it, and think yourself at last com­ petent and able to manage horses, mount, and take hold of the reins.", "6735": "For thus, even if they are restive, you will not, by being thrown out of the chariot, receive wounds difficult to be cured, and also afford a subject of ridicule to all the spectators who delight in mischief;", "6736": "nor, on the other hand, will you be over­ whelmed by your enemies coming against you or running over you from behind, since by your own speed you will outstrip and leave behind those who are coming after you, and you will be able to afford to disregard those who are coming towards you, because of your skill in getting safely out of the way.", "6737": "XXI.", "6738": "It is not unnaturally, therefore, that Moses, singing his song of triumph on the destruction of the riders, neverthe­ less prays for complete safety for the horsemen;", "6739": "for these are able, putting their bridles into the mouths of the irrational powers, to check the impetuosity of their superabundant vio­ lence.", "6740": "What then his prayer is must be told:", "6741": "he says, \" Let Dan be a serpent in the way, sitting in the path, biting the heel of the horse;", "6742": "and the horseman shall fall backwards, awaiting the salvation of the Lord.\"*", "6743": "But we must explain what is the enigmatical meaning which he conceals under this prayer, the name of Dan, being interpreted, means \"judg­ ment therefore he here likens that power of the soul which investigates, and accurately examines, and distinguishes be­ tween, and, in some degree, decides on each part of the soul, to a dragon (and the dragon is an animal various in its move­ ments, and exceedingly cunning, and ready to display its courage, and very powerful to repel those who begin acts of violence), but not to that friendly serpent, the counsellor of life, which is wont to he called Eve in his national language, but to the one made by Moses, of the material of brass, which, when those who had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, and who were at the point of death beheld, they are said to have lived and not to have died.", "6744": "XXII.", "6745": "And these things thus expressed resemble visions and prodigies;", "6746": "I mean the account of one dragon uttering the voice of a man and pouring his sophistries into most innocent dispositions, and deceiving the woman with plausible arguments of persuasion;", "6747": "and of another becoming a cause of complete safety to those who looked upon it.", "6748": "But, in the allegorical explanations of these statements, all that bears a fabulous ap­ pearance is got rid of in a moment, and the truth is discovered in a most evident manner.", "6749": "The serpent, then, which appeared to the woman, that is to life depending on the outward senses and on the flesh, we pro­ nounce to have been pleasure, crawling forward with an indirect motion, full of innumerable wiles, unable to raise itself up, ever cast down on the ground, creeping only upon the good things of the earth, seeking lurking places in the body, burying itself in each of the outward senses as in pits or caverns, a plotter against man, designing destruction to a being better than itself, eager to kill with its poisonous but painless bite.", "6750": "But the brazen serpent, made by Moses, we explain as being the disposition opposite to pleasure, namely, patient endurance, on which account it is that he is represented as having made it of brass, which is a very strong material.", "6751": "He, then, who with sound judgment contemplates the appearance of patient en­ durance, even if he has been previously bitten by the allure­ ments of pleasure, must inevitably live ;", "6752": "for the one holds over his soul a death to be averted by no prayers, but self-restraint proffers him health and preservation of life ;", "6753": "and temperance, which repels evils, is a remedy and perfect antidote for intem­ perance.", "6754": "And every wise man looks upon what is good as dear to him, which is also altogether calculated to ensure his pre­ servation.", "6755": "So that when Moses prays that it may happen to Dan, either himself, to be that serpent (for the words may be understood in either sense), he means a serpent closely resembling the one which has been made by himself, but not like the one which appeared to Eve, for then the prayer is an entreaty for good things;", "6756": "therefore the character of patient endurance is good, and capable of receiving immortality, which is the perfect good.", "6757": "But the character of pleasure is evil, bringing in its train the greatest of all punishments, death.", "6758": "On which account Moses says, \"Let Dan become a serpent,\" and that not in any other place rather than in the road.", "6759": "For the indulgences of intemperance and gluttony, and whatever other vices the im­ moderate and insatiable pleasures, when completely filled with an abundance of all external things, produce and bring forth, do not allow the soul to proceed onwards by the plain and straight road, but compel it to fall into ravines and gulfs, until they utterly destroy it;", "6760": "but those practices which adhere to patience, and endurance, and moderation, and all other virtues, keep the soul in the straight road, leaving no stumbling block in the way, against which it can stumble and fall.", "6761": "Very na­ turally, therefore, has Moses declared that temperance clings to the right way, because it is plain that the contrary habit, in­ temperance, is always straying from the road.:", "6762": "XXIII.", "6763": "And the expression, “ Sitting in the path,\" sug­ gests some such meaning as this, as I persuade myself:", "6764": "a path is a road calculated

and walk along it, and with great indolence and easiness of temper spend all their lives in it, and not men only, but every species of animal whatever;", "6766": "for there is no single thing which is not attracted by the allurements of pleasure, and which is not, at times, entangled in its multifarious nets, from which it is very difficult to escape.", "6767": "But the paths of prudence, and temperance, and the other virtues, even though they may not be utterly untra­ velled, are, at all events, not beaten much;", "6768": "for the number of those who proceed by those roads, and who philosophise in a genuine spirit, and who form associations with virtue alone, disregarding, once for all, all other allurements, is very small.", "6769": "Therefore he sits constantly in the road, and not once only, who has an eagerness for, and a care for, patient endurances, in order to watch from his ambush and attack pleasure, to which men in general are accustomed, that fountain of ever­ lasting evils, and so to keep it off, and to eradicate it from the whole district of the soul.", "6770": "Then, as Moses says, proceeding to the natural consequence of his position, he will of necessity bite the heel of the horse;", "6771": "for it is the especial attribute of patient endurance and temperance to shake and overturn the foundations of vice, which lifts its head on high, and of exerted, and quickly-moved, and unmanageable passion.", "6772": "XXIV.", "6773": "Moses, therefore, represents the serpent that ap­ peared to Eve as planning the death of man, for he records, that God says in his curses, \" He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"", "6774": "But he represents the serpent of Dan, which is the one which we are now discussing, as biting the heel of the horse and not of the man, for the serpent of Eve, being the symbol of pleasure, as has been already shown, attacks man, that is to say, the reasoning power which is in every one of us;", "6775": "for the enjoyment and free use of excessive pleasure is the destruction of the mind;", "6776": "and the serpent of Dan being a sort of image of vigorous virtue and of patient endurance, will bite the horse, who is the emblem of passion and wickedness, because temperance is occupied about the overthrow and destruction of these things.", "6777": "Accordingly, when they are bitten and when they have fallen, \" the horseman also,\" says Moses, \" will fall;", "6778": "\" and the meaning which he con­ ceals under this enigmatical expression is such as this, that we must think it an excellent thing and an object worthy of all labour, that our mind shall not be mounted upon any one of the passions or vices, but that whenever an attempt is made by force to put it upon one of them, we must endeavour to leap off and fall, for such falls produce the most glorious victories.", "6779": "On which account one of the ancients, when challenged to a contest of abuse, said, \" I will never engage in such a contest as that in which lie who wins is more dishonoured than he who is defeated.\"XXV.", "6780": "Do you, therefore, my friend, never enter into a con­ test of evil, and never contend for the pre-eminence in such practices, but rather exert yourself with all your might to escape from them.", "6781": "And if ever, being under the compulsion of some power which is mightier than yourself, you are com­ pelled to engage in such a strife, take care to be without delay defeated ;", "6782": "for then you, being defeated, will be a glorious con­ queror, and those who have

of breath.", "6798": "Of all these contests, then, there is not one which is truly sacred;", "6799": "no, not though all the men in the world should combine to bear witness in their favour, but they must be convicted bear by witness of hearing false witness if they do so:", "6800": "for they who admire these things have established laws against men who behave with insolent violence, and have affixed punishments to assaults, and have appointed judges to decide on every action of that kind.", "6801": "How, then, is it natural for the same persons to be indignant at those who insult and assault others privately, and to establish in their cases punishments which cannot be avoided, but yet, in the case of those who commit these assaults publicly, and in assemblies of the people, and in theatres, to establish by law that they shall receive crowns, and that proclamations shall be made in their honour, and all sorts of other glorious circumstances?", "6802": "For when two opposite

their bodies, but very vigorous in their souls;", "6811": "and then, having stripped off their clothes, and smeared themselves in the dust, they do all those actions which belong to skill and to power, omitting nothing which may conduce to their gaining the victory.", "6812": "These men, therefore, get the better of their adversaries:", "6813": "and then, again, they have a competition with

advantageous to be behind-hand in vice and passion ;", "6821": "for it is always good to be beforehand in doing what is good, but to be slack in doing what is disgraceful :", "6822": "and, on the

the skill or power of his adversaries, will undoubtedly meet with disaster before he can do anything, and will endure the death of knowledge, which is a more grievous death than that which separates the soul from the body.", "6966": "And this ought to happen to those who allow them­ selves to be deceived by the sophists;", "6967": "for when they are not able to find a solution for their sophisms, believing their fallacies as if they were true statements, they die as to the life of knowledge, suffering the same thing that they do who are cajoled by flatterers;", "6968": "for in the case of those men too, their soul, while in a healthy and genuine state, is driven off and overthrown by a friendship which is diseased in its very nature.", "6969": "XXXVIII.", "6970": "We must therefore advise those who are beginning to learn not to go forth into such contests, for they have not sufficient knowledge;", "6971": "and we must counsel those who are making some progress to abstain from them, because they are not perfect;", "6972": "and those who have now for the first time just attained to perfection, we must urge to forbear, because in some degree their perfection has escaped their own notice.", "6973": "But of those who disregard our warnings, Moses says, \" One man will inhabit his house, and another will obtain his vineyard, and another will marry a wife.\"", "6974": "And the meaning of this is something of this kind:", "6975": "the powers which have been enumerated, of careful beginning, and improvement, and perfection, will never fail altogether, but will at different times approach and unite themselves with different persons, and will not be always forming the same souls, but will change about, resembling seals;", "6976": "for seals, when they have stamped an impression on one piece of wax, without suffering any alteration themselves, though they impress on it a form which is derived from themselves, remain in the same condition as before;", "6977": "and if the piece of wax which has been stamped, be melted, and the impres­ sion effaced, then another piece may be substituted in its place.", "6978": "So that, my good friends, do not think, that when you yourselves perish, your powers perish with you;", "6979": "for they, being immortal, have, on account of their own glory, embraced ten thousand other persons before they came to you, who, they perceived, did not behave like you, out of an aversion to danger, shunning their society, but who rather came forward to meet them, and showed an eagerness to consult their safety.", "6980": "And if any one is a friend of virtue, let him pray that all good things may be implanted in him, and may appear in his soul, like some symmetrical propor­ tion conducing to beauty in a statue or a picture, con­ sidering that there are innumerable persons watching at hand, to whom nature will give all these things instead of giving them to him, namely, facility of learning, improvement, and perfection;", "6981": "but it is better that he should shine out rather than they, guarding safely the graces which have been bestowed on him by God;", "6982": "and that he himself should not, by carrying forward destruction, afford an easy prey to his unsparing enemies.", "6983": "XXXIX.", "6984": "Are we then to say that there is but little use in a beginning to which a fortunate end does not set its seal ?", "6985": "It has often indeed happened that even some who have attained to perfection have still been thought im­ perfect, from appearing to have improved through their own earnestness alone, and not according to the will of God.", "6986": "And on this account, being exceedingly elated by their vain opinion, and elevated to a great height, they have fallen from a high position to the lowest depths, and so been destroyed.", "6987": "\"For if,\" says Moses, \"you have built a new house, you shall also erect a battlement on the house, and then shall commit no murder in your house if any one falls from it.\"*", "6988": "For the most grievous of all falls is for a man to stumble and fall from the honour due to God;", "6989": "crowning himself rather than God, and committing domestic murder.", "6990": "For he who docs not duly honour the living", "6991": "God kills his own soul:", "6992": "so that the building of education which he has erected is of no advantage to him.", "6993": "But instruction has a nature which never grows old;", "6994": "on which account Moses calls its house a new house, for all other things are gradually destroyed by time.", "6995": "But instruction, in proportion as it advances towards perfection, is fresh and vigorous, looking blooming with an ever-flourishing appearance, and putting itself in motion with continual studies.", "6996": "And in his hortatory admonitions Moses recommends that those who have received the most abundant possession of good things should not look upon themselves as the causes of their acquisition, but should \"remember God who gave them strength to acquire the power.\"*", "6997": "This then is the utmost limit of good fortune, and the other things are its beginnings, so that those who forget the end cannot possibly derive any advantage from the acquisitions which they have made.", "6998": "And so the falls which these men endure are self­ incurred, through their own self-sufficiency, because they could not endure to call the loving and all-accomplishing God the cause of their good things.", "6999": "XL.", "7000": "There are also some people who, letting loose every cable of piety, hasten to make a speedy voyage, in the hope of anchoring in its harbours.", "7001": "And afterwards, when they are at no great distance off, but are just on the point of reaching the haven, on a sudden there comes a violent wind, blowing in their teeth and coming upon them closely, which drives back the vessel which was proceeding onwards in its straight course, in such a manner as to destroy a great many of the things which were of use to contribute to a fair voyage ;", "7002": "no one then could blame those people for being still tossed about by the sea, for the slowness, which they have displayed in completing their voyage, has been uninten­ tional on their part.", "7003": "Who then can be likened to them rather than he who prayed what is called the great prayer ? \"", "7004": "For if,\" says Moses, \" any one dies in his presence suddenly, then immediately the head of his vow shall be polluted and he shall be shaved;", "7005": "”† and then after saying a few more sentences he thus proceeds, \"And the former days shall not be taken into the computation, because the head of his vow was polluted.\"", "7006": "Now by the two expressions suddenly and immediately, the involuntary character of the deviation of the soul is manifested.", "7007": "For with reference to intentional sins there is need of time to consider where, and when, and how a thing is to be done.", "7008": "But unintentional sins are committed suddenly, without any consideration, and, if it be possible to say such a thing they strike upon the man without any time at all.", "7009": "For it is very difficult, as in the case of runners, for men, when they first begin to travel by the road which leads to piety, to keep their course straight onward without stumbling and without being out of breath ;", "7010": "since there are innumerable hindrances to every human being, but above all things, that which is the one and only thing in the way of doing good, namely the abstaining from any inten­ tional misdeeds, is of service also to keep off the incalculable number of voluntary sins;", "7011": "and, in the second place, even of those which are involuntary, they are but few which are committed, and they do not cling to a person for any very long time.", "7012": "Very beautifully, therefore, has Moses said that the days of unintentional error do not come into the computation (ἄλογος);", "7013": "not only because the error was one without calculation, but also because it is not possible to give an account (λόγος) of involuntary offences.", "7014": "Therefore, it often happens, when we are asked the reason of such and such a thing, that we say that we do not know, and that we cannot tell, in that we were not present when they were done, and also that we were ignorant of their being done.", "7015": "It is, there­ fore, a very rare thing when God gives to any one to keep his life in a steady course from the beginning to the end, without either stumbling or falling;", "7016": "but escaping both kinds of offences, unintentional as well as intentional, with great speed and owing to the celerity and impetuosity of one's motions.", "7017": "These things then are here said about beginning and end, because of the instance of the just Noah, who, after he had acquired the first and elementary principles of the knowledge of husbandry, was unable to reach its furthest limits.", "7018": "For it is said that \" he began to be a husbandman, \" not that he arrived at the extreme end of complete knowledge:", "7019": "but what is said about his planting we will discuss subsequently.", "7020": "I.", "7021": "IN the former part of this treatise we have spoken of the art of husbandry as to its genus, dwelling on it at as great a length as the time admitted of;", "7022": "but in this book we will discuss the question of his cultivation of his vineyard with regard to the species as far as it is in our power.", "7023": "For Moses represents the just Noah not only as a husbandman, but also especially as occupied with the cultivation of vines, saying, \" Noah began to be a husbandman of the earth ;", "7024": "and he planted a vineyard.\" *", "7025": "And it is fitting that a man who was about to discuss the whole question of separate plants and manners of cultivation, should first of all acquire an accurate comprehension of the most perfect plants in the universe, and of the great planter and superintendent of them.", "7026": "He then who is the greatest of all planters and the most perfect in art, is the Ruler of the universe;", "7027": "and his plant is not one which comprises within itself only individual plants, but rather infinite numbers of them springing up like suckers from one root, namely, this world.", "7028": "For after the Creator of the world, reducing that substance, which was in its own nature destitute of order and regularity, into a state of order, and bringing it from a condition of confusion into a distinct system, began to fashion and shape it, he placed the earth and the water in the middle, and the plants of air and fire he drew up from their previously central position to a lofty eminence ;", "7029": "and the æther he arranged all round, placing it as a boundary to and preservation of the things within, from which also it seems that the heaven t derives its name, causing the earth to be borne upon the water in such a way that it continues dry, which, however, there was reason to fear might be dissolved by water;", "7030": "and this great worker of marvels, moreover, united the air, which was exceedingly cold by its own nature, to fire which is very hot;", "7031": "a most surprising miracle.", "7032": "For how can it be looked upon as any­ thing but a prodigy, for that which would dissolve another thing, to be held together by that which it would dissolve :", "7033": "that is to say, for water to be held together by earth;", "7034": "and again, for that which is the hottest of all things to be placed upon that which is the coldest without its nature being de­ stroyed, that is to say, for fire to be placed upon air ?", "7035": "And these are the elements of this most perfect plant;", "7036": "but the very great and all productive plant is this world, of which the aforesaid branches are the main shoots.", "7037": "II.", "7038": "AVe must now therefore consider where God placed its foundations, and in fact, what foundation it has on which it is supported, as a statue is on a pedestal;", "7039": "certainly we cannot imagine that any body is left outside and wandering about, since God has worked up and arranged every imagi­ nable material throughout the whole universe.", "7040": "For it was fitting that the most perfect and greatest of all works should be made by the greatest of all makers;", "7041": "and it would not have been the most perfect of works if it had not been filled up by perfect parts, so that this world consists of all earth, and all water, and all air, and all fire, not a single particle, no not the smallest imaginable atom, being omitted.", "7042": "It follows therefore of necessity, that what is outside must either be a vacuum or nothing at all.", "7043": "If now it is a vacuum, than how can that which is full and solid, and the heaviest of all things, avoid being pressed down by its own weight, since there is no solid thing to hold it up ?", "7044": "from which consideration it would appear to be something like a vision, since the mind is always seeking for some corpo­ real foundation, such as everything which is moved, must of necessity have;", "7045": "and especially the world, inasmuch as it is the greatest of all bodies, and embraces a multitude of other bodies as its own appropriate parts.", "7046": "If therefore any one wishes to escape from the difficulties of this question which present themselves in the different doubts thus raised, let him speak freely and say that there is nothing in any material of such power as to be able to sup­ port this weight of the world.", "7047": "But it is the eternal law of the everlasting God which is the most supporting an firm foundation of the universe.", "7048": "This it is which, being extended from the centre to the borders, and again from the extremities to the centre, runs through the whole un­ subdued course of nature, collecting all the parts and bind­ ing them firmly together;", "7049": "for the father who created them has made it the indissoluble bond of the universe.", "7050": "Very naturally and appropriately therefore, all earth will not be dissolved by all water, which the bosom of the earth con­ tains, nor will fire be extinguished by air, nor.", "7051": "again will air be burnt up by fire, since the divine law establishes itself as a boundary to all these elements, like a vowel among consonants, so that the universe may, as it were, be harmo­ nious in concert with the music expressed by letters ;", "7052": "per­ suasion, by its own authority, putting an end to the threaten­ in,, conflicts of contrary natures.", "7053": "III.", "7054": "Thus then the plant which bears all things was rooted, and when it was rooted was made strong.", "7055": "But of the particular plants, and those of smaller growth, some were moveable, so as to have their places changed;", "7056": "and some were made so as, without any such change, to stand steadily in the same place.", "7057": "Those then that are affected by motion, inducing change of place, which we call animals, are attached to the most important portions of the universe;", "7058": "the terres­ trial animals to the earth, the animals which swim to the water, the winged animals to the air and those which can live in the flame to the fire (which last are said to be most evidently produced in Macedonia), and the stars are attached to the heaven.", "7059": "For those who have studied philosophy pro­ nounce the stars also to be animals, being endowed with intellect and pervading the whole universe;", "7060": "some being planets, and moving by their own intrinsic nature ;", "7061": "and others, that is the fixed stars, being borne along with the revolutions of the universe ;", "7062": "so that they likewise appear to change their places.", "7063": "But those which are regulated accord­ ing to a nature devoid of all sensation, which are peculiarly called plants, have no participation in that motion which in­ volves a change of place.", "7064": "IV.", "7065": "But the Creator made two different races on the earth and in the air.", "7066": "In the air, he made the winged animals capable of being perceived by the external senses, and other powers which can by no means be comprehended in any place by the external senses ;", "7067": "and this is the company of incorpo­ real souls arranged in order, but not in the same classifications.", "7068": "For it is said that some are assigned to mortal bodies, and are again subjected to a'change of place according to certain defined periodical revolutions;", "7069": "but that others which have received a more divinely prepared habitation, look down upon the region of the earth, and that in the highest place, near the other itself, the purest souls are placed, which those who have studied philosophy among the Greeks call heroes, but which Moses, by a felicitous appellation, entitles angels ;", "7070": "souls which go as ambassadors and messengers of good from the ruler of all things to his subjects, and messen­ gers also to the king respecting those things of which his subjects have heard.", "7071": "To the earth again he assigned two classes, terrestrial animals and plants, wishing that she should be at the same time their mother and their nurse.", "7072": "For, as in the case of woman and every animal of the female sex, foun­ tains of milk spring up in them when they are about to bring forth, in order that they may supply the offspring that is born of them with necessary and suitable food;", "7073": "so in a similar manner God has assigned to the earth, which is the mother of all terrestrial animals, all the different species of plants, in order that the animals produced by the earth may have such food as is akin to them, and not alien from their natures.", "7074": "And, indeed, God has caused plants to grow with their heads downwards, having fixed their heads in the deepest parts of the earth;", "7075": "and having drawn up the heads of the irrational animals from the earth, he has set them up high on long necks, putting their fore feet under their necks as a kind of foundation.", "7076": "But man has received a pre-eminently superior formation.", "7077": "For of all other animals", "7078": "God has bent the eyes downwards, so that they look upon the ground ;", "7079": "but on the other hand, he has raised the eyes of man so that he may behold the heaven, being not a terrestrial but a celestial plant as the old proverb is.*V.", "7080": "But the others who say that our mind is a portion of the ethereal nature, have by this assertion attributed to man a kindred with the air;", "7081": "but the great Moses has not named the species of the rational soul by a title resembling that of any created being, but has pronounced it an image of the divine and invisible being, making it a coin as it were of sterling metal, stamped and impressed with the seal of God, the impression of which is the eternal word.", "7082": "For, says Moses, \" God breathed into man's face the breath of life,\" * so that it follows of necessity, that he that received the breath must be fashioned after the model of him who sent it forth.", "7083": "On which account it is said too, that “Man was made after the image of God,\" t and not after the image of any created being.", "7084": "It follows, therefore, since the soul of man has been fashioned in accordance with the archetypal word of the great cause of all things, that his body also, having been raised up to the purest portion of the universe-the heaven, must extend its vision, in order that, by a comparison with what is visible, it may attain to an accurate compre­ hension of what is invisible.", "7085": "Since, therefore, it was impossible for any one to perceive the attraction of the mind to the living God, except for those persons alone who were drawn towards him (for that which each person suffers, he alone particularly knows), God has given us the eyes of the body (as an evident and visible image of the invisible eye), which are able to look up to the heaven ;", "7086": "for when the eyes, composed of perishable material, have raised themselves to such a height, as to be able from the region of the earth to mount up to heaven which is removed at so great a distance from the earth, and to reach its utmost heights, how great a course in every direction must we suppose to be within the power of the eyes of the soul ?", "7087": "which, being endowed with wings from their excessive desire to see the living", "7088": "God clearly, reach up not only to the highest regions of the air, but even pass over the boundaries of the whole world, and hasten towards the Uncreate.", "7089": "VI.", "7090": "On this account, those persons who are insatiable in their desire for wisdom and knowledge are said in the sacred oracles to be \" called up.\" *", "7091": "For it is legitimate that those persons should be called up to the Deity who have been inspired by him.", "7092": "For it would be a terrible thing if whirl­ winds and hurricanes have power to tear trees up by their roots, and to toss them in the air, and to carry off vessels of many tons' burden, though loaded with cargoes, as if they were the lightest things imaginable, out of the middle of the sea;", "7093": "and if even lakes and rivers are raised on high, when their streams actually leave the bosom of the earth, having been drawn up by the ardent and diversified eddies of the winds:", "7094": "and yet, if the mind, which is intrinsically light, cannot be raised up by the nature of the Divine Spirit, which is able to do everything and to subdue all things below, and cannot be elevated to an exceeding height;", "7095": "and especially the mind of the man who studies philosophy in a genuine manner.", "7096": "For he does not incline downwards to the things dear to the body and to the earth, from which he separates himself, and studies to alienate himself as far as possible;", "7097": "but he is borne upwards, being insatiably devoted to sublime, holy, magnificent, and happy natures.", "7098": "Therefore, also, Moses will be summoned upwards, the steward and guardian of the sacred mysteries of the living God.", "7099": "For we read in the book of Leviticus, \" He called Moses up to him.\"",

sacred works.", "7102": "But he receives only the second honour of this summons, and the all-wise Moses shall have the first place assigned to him.", "7103": "For the former fashions shadows only, like painters do, in which it is not right to form any living thing.", "7104": "For the very name Bezeleel is interpreted to mean, \"working in shadows.\"", "7105": "But Moses does not make shadows, but the task is assigned to him of forming the archetypal natures of things themselves.", "7106": "And in other places, also, the great Cause of all things is accus­ tomed to reveal his secrets to some in a more conspicuous and visible manner, as if in the pure light of the sun, and to others more sparely, as though in the shade.", "7107": "VII.", "7108": "Having therefore gone through all the larger plants in the universe, let us see in what manner the all-wise God made the trees which exist in the smaller world, that is to say, in man.", "7109": "In the first place, then, taking our body as if it were a field of deep soil, he created the external senses to be in it as so many channels.", "7110": "And after that, he arranged the place of each separate one of them, as if it had been a fruit-bearing and most useful tree, assigning the sense of hearing to the ear, that of sight to the eyes, that of smell to the nostrils, and each of the other senses and faculties to their kindred and appropriate organs.", "7111": "And the divine man bears his testimony to this account of mine, speaking thus in his Psalms, \" He that planted the ear, doth he not hear ?", "7112": "and he that made the eyes, shall he not see ? \" *", "7113": "Moreover, all the different powers which run down as far as the legs and hands, and all the other parts of the body, whether internal or external, are all those of an unimportant kind.", "7114": "But those which are better and more perfect he has rooted in the more central portion;", "7115": "that which is pre-eminently able to bring forth fruit, the dominant portion of the man.", "7116": "These faculties are perception, comprehension, felicity of conjecture, study, memory, habit, disposition, the various species of art, the firmness of knowledge of different things, the apprehension of the speculations of universal virtue in such a way as is never forgotten.", "7117": "Now, no mortal is com­ petent to plant any one of these things himself.", "7118": "But of all of them together there is one architect, the uncreated God, who has not only made them originally, but who also makes them for and implants them in every individual man that is born.", "7119": "VIII.", "7120": "Now the account of the planting of Paradise is con­ sistent with what has been already said.", "7121": "For it is stated, \" God planted a Paradise in Eden, towards the east;", "7122": "and there he placed the man whom he has made.\"", "7123": "t Now, to think that it is here meant that God planted vines, or olive trees, or apple trees, or pomegranates, or any trees of such kinds, is mere incurable folly.", "7124": "For why should he have done so ?", "7125": "any one may ask.", "7126": "Was it that he might have a pleasant abode to spend his time in ?", "7127": "Even the whole world could not be considered a dwelling sufficient for God, the governor of the universe.", "7128": "Would it not appear to be deficient in innumerable other things, so that it could never be looked upon as a place worthily suited to the reception of the great King ?", "7129": "True, indeed, it is impiety to think that the Cause of all things can be contained in that which he has caused, especially as even those trees do not invariably bear their annual fruit.", "7130": "For whose enjoyment and use, then, is it that the Paradise is to produce fruit ?", "7131": "For that of no man.", "7132": "For there is absolutely no one at all who is represented as inhabiting the Paradise, since Moses says that God removed the first man who was created out of the earth, by name Adam, from his original place, and placed him here.", "7133": "And, moreover, God has no need of food any more than he has of anything else ;", "7134": "for it follows necessarily that he who uses food must first of all stand in need of it.", "7135": "And in the second place, that he must have organs adapted for the reception of it, by means of which he can receive it when it enters him ;", "7136": "and then dismiss it from him when he has digested it.", "7137": "But all these things, which are parts of the happiness and blessedness which surround the Great Cause of all things, are inconsistent with the doctrine of those men who represent him as clothed with human form, and influenced by human passions to the utter destruction of all piety and religious feeling-both great virtues ;", "7138": "such notions being contrary to all law and right.", "7139": "IX.", "7140": "We must therefore have recourse to allegory, which is a favourite with men capable of seeing through it;", "7141": "for the sacred oracles most evidently conduct us towards and instigate us to the pursuit of it.", "7142": "For they say that in the Paradise there were plants in no respect similar to those which exist among us;", "7143": "but they speak of trees of life, trees of immortality, trees of knowledge, of comprehension, of understanding;", "7144": "trees of the knowledge of good and evil.", "7145": "Now these cannot have been trees of the land, but must indisputably have been plants of a rational soil, which was a road to travel along, leading to virtue, and having for its end

bounteous", "7148": "God plants in the soul, as it were, a paradise of virtues and of the actions in accordance with them, which lead it to perfect happiness.", "7149": "On this account, also, he has assigned a most appropriate place to the Paradise, called Eden (and the name Eden, being interpreted, means \".delight\"), an emblem of the soul, which sees right things, and revels amid the virtues,

his joy in God alone.", "7154": "X.", "7155": "And the statement that the Paradise was in the east,\" is a proof of what has been here said.", "7156": "For folly is a thing of darkness and setting,

whole circle of the heaven with its light, so in the same manner, when the beams of virtue shine forth, they make the whole place occupied by the mind full of pure light.", "7159": "Therefore the possessions of man have guards and keepers, very fierce beasts, for the repulse of invading and attacking enemies.", "7160": "But the posses­ sions of God have rational natures for their guards.", "7161": "For \"there,\" says Moses, \"God placed the man whom he had made;", "7162": "\" that is to say, he placed him among the rational virtues alone ;", "7163": "therefore the practices and uses of the virtues have received from God this especial honour beyond the souls of other animals.", "7164": "And therefore, also, it is most expressly and plainly declared that God placed that man which is really man in us, namely, the mind, among the most sacred shoots and plants of excellence and virtue.", "7165": "But among those animals which have no share in mind, no one has ever cultivated any plant worth speaking of, since there is not one of them capable by nature of receiving comprehension.", "7166": "XI.", "7167": "We cannot therefore raise any question as to why it was ordained that all the different species of animals should be collected in the ark which was made at the time of the great deluge, while more were brought into the Paradise.", "7168": "For the ark was an emblem of the body, which of necessity there­ fore contained all the most tameable and ferocious evils of the passions and vices;", "7169": "but the Paradise contained only the virtues :", "7170": "and the virtues do not receive anything savage or in short anything destitute of reason.", "7171": "And Moses also speaks very carefully, not representing the man who was made after God's own image, but the man who was formed of clay, as the one who was placed in the paradise.", "7172": "For the one who was made after the image of God, and stamped with the truth of God, does, as it appears to me, in no

man.", "7174": "For it is said that \" the tree of life is in the midst of the Paradise.", "7175": "\"But the other man, he of the composite and more earthly body, who has no justification in uncreated and simple nature, the cultivator of which is the only person who knows how to dwell in the house and in the courts of the Lord.", "7176": "For Jacob is represented \" as a plain man dwelling in a house,\" * having a disposition full of ingenuity, and com­ pounded and made up of all kinds of materials.", "7177": "It was natural therefore to place and firmly root the mind in the middle of the paradise, that is, of theuniversal world, having in itself faculties which draw it in contrary directions, so that it should be kept in a state of doubt when called upon to discriminate as to what it should choose and what it should avoid, since if it chose the better part it would reap immor­ tality and glory;", "7178": "and if it chose the worse it would meet with reproach and death.", "7179": "XII.", "7180": "Such then are the trees which the only wise God has planted in rational souls.", "7181": "But Moses, pitying those who were exiled and compelled to quit the paradise of the virtues, addresses a prayer to the absolute authority of God and to his merciful and propitious powers, entreating that in the place from which the earthly mind, Adam, was banished, there a people capable of seeing the truth might be planted.", "7182": "For he says, \" Bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance which thou dost give them;", "7183": "thou hast made them to sit in thy seat, 0 Lord;", "7184": "in the sanctuary, 0 Lord, which thy hands have made.", "7185": "The Lord shall shall be king of ages, for ever and ever.\"", "7186": "*Therefore he had learnt, as plainly as any man that ever lived, that God, having fixed the roots and seeds of every­ thing down in the earth, is the cause also of the greatest of all plants, namelythis world, shooting up;", "7187": "which world he here seems to speak of enigmatically in the song which I have just quoted, where he calls it the mountain of his inheritance ;", "7188": "since that which is made is the most appropriate possession and inheritance, of him who has made it.", "7189": "Therefore he prays that we may be planted in it, not in order that we may become irrational and unmanageable in our natures ;", "7190": "but that, in due obedience to the arrangement of the all-perfect governor, imitating his perpetual and undeviating consistency, we may live a temperate and innocent life.", "7191": "For to be able to live in a strict uniformity with nature, is what the men of old have defined as the end of happiness.", "7192": "And accordingly what is said afterwards is in strict agree­

not uncreated, as some persons have thought.", "7194": "And lie uses the word \"sanctuary,\" as meaning a splendour emitted from holy objects, an imitation of the archetypal model;", "7195": "since those things which are beautiful to the external senses are to the intellectual senses models of what is beautiful.", "7196": "The expression that \"it was prepared by the hands of God,\" means that it was made by his world-creating powers.", "7197": "But in order that no one may suppose that the Creator had need of any one of the things which he created, he adds the most necessary assertion, \" Being King of ages for ever and ever.\"", "7198": "But a king is in need of nothing, but everything which is subject to him is inevitably in need of the king.", "7199": "And some persons have said that God is and is properly called the inheritance of God, the use and enjoyment of which Moses has now prayed may be afforded to us.", "7200": "For, says he, representing us as children just beginning to learn by means of the doctrines and speculations of wisdom, and not leaving us destitute of the elements of knowledge, plant them in sublime and heavenly reason.", "7201": "For this is

it is not reasonable to think that he receives inheritances, since everything in the world belongs to him.", "7210": "But perhaps this is said of those who are subject to him as their master, according to some special computation of connection ;", "7211": "just as kings govern indeed all their subjects, but rule their own servants in a different and peculiar manner, whom they are accustomed to employ as ministers for the care of their bodies and the rest of their manner of life.", "7212": "And again, though they are lords of all the possessions in their whole country, even of those which appear to belong to pri­ vate individuals, they nevertheless are accounted owners only of those portions which they can entrust to superintendents and overseers, from whom they receive yearly revenues, which properties they often visit for the sake of relaxation and amusement, when they lay aside for a while the heaviest portion of the burden of the cares which arise to them in the administration of public affairs and in the govern­ merit of their kingdoms;", "7213": "and these possessions are called especially the royal properties.", "7214": "Moreover all the silver and gold,

the com­ pany of wise souls is pronounced to be the especial inheritance of the all-powerful God who has authority and dominion over everything, since he sees most acutely of all beings, exercising the irreproachable and unadulterated eye of the mind, which is never shut, but is always wide open and looking intensely into every thing.", "7217": "XIV.", "7218": "And on this account, indeed, it is said in the greater prayer, \" Inquire of thy father, and he will tell thee ;", "7219": "of thy elders, and they will reply to thee, when the Most High divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he fixed the boundaries of the nations, according to the number of the angels of God, and the portion of the Lord himself was his people Israel.\"*", "7220": "For, behold, here again, he uses the expression, \" the portion and inheritance of God,\" mean­ ing that disposition which is capable of seeing him, and which sincerely worships him ;", "7221": "and he says that the children of the earth, whom he calls the sons of Adam, were scattered and dispersed, and brought together again, and that a company was formed of them, since they were unable to use right reason as their guide.",

honour to himself;", "7227": "but he who attributes honour to creation will be banished, being driven from the most sacred places, and compelled to fall into inaccessible and wicked gulfs.", "7228": "XV.", "7229": "Moses, therefore, has such intimate connection with God, that, relying upon this in a very great degree, he is in the habit of using more fervent and energetic expressions and doctrines than are calculated for the ears of us inferior persons;", "7230": "for he not only thinks it fit to speak of God as an inheritor, but even, which is a more startling thing to the comprehension, he calls him the inheritance of others ;", "7231": "for to the entire tribe which came to him as a fugitive and a sup­ pliant, he did not think fit to allot only a portion of land, as he did to the other eleven tribes, but he chose that they should receive an especial honour, namely, the priesthood, a posses­ sion not of earth, but of heaven.", "7232": "\"For thou shalt not be,\"

things of creation, knows and recognizes one only God, the Uncreate, whom it approaches, and by whom it is re­ ceived.", "7236": "For to whom is it permitted to say, \" He alone is my God,\" except to the man who is attached to none of the objects which are inferior to him ?", "7237": "And this is the custom of the Levites ;", "7238": "for the name of Levi, being interpreted, means, \" he is to me,\" because different things are honoured by different people, but by him only that which is highest and most excellent, the Cause of all things.", "7239": "XVI.", "7240": "They tell an old story, that some man in ancient times, who had fallen madly in love with the beauty of wis­ dom, as if it had been the beauty of a most lovely woman, once, when he saw a most sumptuous preparation of un­ bounded and costly magnificence, looked towards some of his friends, and said, \" Behold, 0 companions, how many things there are of which I have no need!\"", "7241": "And yet he had nothing whatever of even necessary things beyond his mere clothes, so that he was not puffed up with the magni­ tude of his riches, which has been the case with numbers of people;", "7242": "so that, on this account, he spoke arrogantly against pomp and show.", "7243": "The lawgiver teaches us that we should account those people wise who are not eager to be rich in created things, but who despise all created things in comparison of the friendship of the uncreated God, whom they look upon as the only true wealth, and the boundary of most perfect happiness.", "7244": "Never, then, let those men boast, who have acquired power and sovereignty, as some do, because they have subdued one city, or country, or nation;", "7245": "and others, because they have acquired the dominion over all the coun­ tries of the earth, to its furthest borders, and over all Gre­ cian and barbarous nations, and over all the rivers and seas, infinite both in number and magnitude.", "7246": "For if, besides these things, they had made themselves masters (which it is impious even to mention) of that sublime nature which was the only thing that the Creator made free from the bond of slavery and servitude, they would still be looked upon but as private individuals in comparison with the great kings who have received God for their inheritance;", "7247": "for in pro­ portion as that nature which has acquired a possession is better than the possession itself, and the Creator than the thing created, by so much also are they more royal.", "7248": "XVII.", "7249": "Therefore, some people considered, that they who said that everything was the property of the one good Being, were speaking in an unreasonable manner, looking at the deficiencies and abundance which existed externally, and thinking no one rich who was in want of either money or possessions.", "7250": "But Moses thinks wisdom a thing of such pre-eminent value, and deserving to be so eagerly sought after, that not only the whole world deserves to be his inheritance, but that he even looks upon the Governor of the universe in that light;", "7251": "and these are the doctrines, not of men who are halting between two opinions, but of those who are occupied in a firm and sure faith;", "7252": "since, even now, there are some persons among those who make a show and pretence of piety, who calumniate the literal meaning of this saying, saying that it is neither pious nor safe to speak of God as the inheritance of a man.", "7253": "You say this—I should say to them-because ye have come not from genuine passion, but from a supposititious and illegitimate one, to the investigation of things.", "7254": "For you thought it a matter of equal consequence for God to be called the inheritance of possessions, of vineyards, and oliveyards, and such matters, and of wise men;", "7255": "and ye did not perceive that paintings are said to be the inheritance of painters, and, in short, that any art is said to be the inheritance of the artist,

perfect:", "7268": "so that the limit is the beginning of numbers, and the end, in those calcu­ lations, according to the first combination, is the number ten thousand;", "7269": "in reference to which fact, some persons have not erred greatly, who have compared the limit to the starting- place, and the number ten thousand to the goal, and all the numbers between these two to those who contend in a race;", "7270": "for they, beginning to start from the unit, as from the start­ ing place, come to the number ten thousand as to the goal.", "7271": "Therefore, some persons, departing from these numbers, as from signals, have said that God is the beginning and end of everything, which is a doctrine admirably calculated to engender piety.", "7272": "This doctrine, being implanted in the soul,

exist, and who conduct their examinations of each individual matter in no negligent manner, behave very like those men who dig wells ;", "7280": "for they also are seeking springs in an obscure place.", "7281": "And all men have one common desire, to find something to drink.", "7282": "But some men's nature is to be nourished by the food of the soul, and that of others by the food of the body.", "7283": "As, therefore, some of those who have dug wells have often done so without finding water;", "7284": "so likewise those who advance far in knowledge, and who have made great progress in it, are still often unable to attain to the end which they desire.", "7285": "At all events, they say that men of extensive learning often find fault with their terrible ignorance, for they only just know how far they are removed from the truth.", "7286": "And there is a story that some man of old time, when he was admired for his wisdom, said, that it was a fine thing that he should be

thought of in regard of his skill in it, and then consider if the professions held out by the art are equal to the performances of the artist;", "7288": "for if you duly examine the matter, you will find that the performance falls short of the profession, not by a small, but by a vast dis­ tance, it being almost impossible for a man to be perfect in any art whatever, which is in continual motion like a fount­ ain, and is constantly pouring forth various species of all kinds of speculations.", "7289": "On this account, it is most appro­ priately denominated an oath,9 being the most certain sign of faith, comprehending also the testimony of God:", "7290": "for as he who swears, calls God to be a witness to a matter concerning which a question is raised, so it is not possible to swear so truly about any matter, as to the fact that the perfection of no art whatever can be found in the artist who professes it.", "7291": "And the same assertion holds good also with respect to all the other powers which exist in us, or very nearly so;", "7292": "for, as they say, that no water was found in the well which had been mentioned, so also neither was there the faculty of seeing in the eyes, or that of hearing in the ears, or that of smelling in the nostrils, or, in short, any one of the senses in its corresponding organ;", "7293": "and similarly in the mind, there was not the faculty of comprehension.", "7294": "For how could it have happened that any one should have made a mistake in what he saw, or in what he heard, or in what he understood, if the comprehensions of each

creation of the world, according to the most holy Moses, the name of God is always assumed by him:", "7304": "for it was fitting that the power according to which the Creator, when he was bringing his

enjoined \" to remove the uncleanness of the tree which has been planted, bearing eatable fruit.”", "7388": "†XXVI.", "7389": "But we, even after we have been instructed, make no progress in learning;", "7390": "but some persons, having a self-taught natural instinct, purify what is good from the evils which surround it, as Jacob did, he who was surnamed the practicer of virtue ;", "7391": "for he “peeled the rods, leaving on the white bark, having stripped off all the green ;", "7392": "”‡ in order that the dark and dusky vanity in the middle being taken away in every case, a white appearance might be dis­ played, which should be produced so as to be akin to it, not by diversified art but by nature ;", "7393": "in reference to which it is also commanded in the low which was established in cases of leprosy, that the man who was not infected with any variation of colour, but who was white all over from the head to the extremity of his feet, should be pure.”§", "7394": "In order that, according to the similitude of the body, those who have discarded the crafty, and unscrupulous, and ambiguous, and uncertain disposition of mind, may embrace the simple, uncoloured, unambiguous, plain complexion of truth;", "7395": "there­ fore, to say that the tree is purified, contains a principle, the assertion of which is founded surely in truth, but to make the same statement with respect to the fruit is saying what is not equally clear or credible;", "7396": "for no cultivator of figs or grapes, or, in sort, of any fruit whatever, purifies them.", "7397": "XXVII.", "7398": "And again Moses says, \" Its fruit shall be impure for three days, it shall not be eaten;", "7399": "\"* as if in fact it were customary for it to be purified for ever.", "7400": "We must, therefore, say that this is one of those expressions which have a concealed meaning, since the words themselves are not quite consistent with it;", "7401": "for the expression is an ambiguous one;", "7402": "for it bears one sense of this kind, the fruit shall remain for three years ;", "7403": "and then there is a distinct injunction, \"it shall not be eaten before it is purified.\"", "7404": "But there is also another meaning, \" the fruit of the tree shall for three years be unpurified, and while in that state it shall not be eaten.\"", "7405": "According, then, to the former statement one may understand it in this manner:", "7406": "the three years being taken for time which is divided into three portions;", "7407": "for it is the nature of time to be divided into the past, the present, and the future ;", "7408": "therefore the fruit of education will exist, and will endure, and will last unimpaired through all the divisions of time, a statement equivalent to-it will never receive any corruption, for the nature of good is imperishable.", "7409": "But the fruit which is not purified shall not be eaten;", "7410": "inasmuch as virtuous reasons, duly purified and rendered sound, nourish the soul, and give vigour to the mind;", "7411": "but the opposite kinds are not nutritious, but bring disease and destruction on the soul.", "7412": "According to the other meaning, as in the disputes of dialecticians, the word “undemonstrated” is used in a double sense, either of a proposition which it is hard to demonstrate by reason of its difficulty, or of one which is intrinsically so plain as to require no demonstration, and the truth of which is established not by the testimony of any one else, but by its own internal evidence.", "7413": "So also fruit may be understood as not being purified, either when it is so impure as to be difficult to purify, or when it requires no purification, but is bright, and clear, and pure of itself.", "7414": "Such now is the fruit of education;", "7415": "being for three years, that is to say for all time, divided as it is into three portions, most completely pure and brilliant, being overshadowed by no injurious thing, and having no need whatever of any washings or purifications, or any thing else whatever which tends to cleansing.", "7416": "XXVIII. \"", "7417": "But in the fourth year,\" says the scripture, \" all the fruit of the tree shall be sacred, being praised by the Lord.\"*", "7418": "The prophetic books appear often to dignity the number four in many places of the exposition of the law, and most especially in the account of the creation of the universe;", "7419": "for the light which is perceptible by the outward senses, and held in honour, being that which throws the most brilliant light both upon itself and upon other things, and upon its own parents the sun and the moon, and upon the most sacred company of the stars, which by their rising and setting fix the boundaries of night and day, and, more­ over, of months and years, and which have shown the nature of number, to which, also, the greatest good of the soul is attributed, Moses says was created on the fourth day.", "7420": "And now he honours this day in a remarkable degree, assigning the fruit of the trees to God, in accordance with no other time than with the fourth year after they are planted;", "7421": "for this has a principle in it very consistent with nature and with good morals.", "7422": "At all events it so happens that the roots of the universe, the elements of which the world is composed, are four— earth, water, air, and fire.", "7423": "Also, that the seasons of the year are equal in number, namely, winter and summer, and those others which are between these two, spring and autumn.", "7424": "And as this is the most ancient of all square numbers, it is found to exist in right angles, as the figure of a square in geometry shows.", "7425": "And right angles are manifest examples of correctness of reason.", "7426": "And right reason is an everlasting fountain of virtues.", "7427": "It follows, therefore, of necessity that the sides of a square must be all equal to one another.", "7428": "And equality is the parent of justice, which is the mistress and ruler of all the virtues, so that it is now proved that this number four is the symbol of equality, and justice, and of all virtue, beyond any other number.", "7429": "And the number four is likewise called “all,” because it comprehends in its power the numbers up to ten, and the number ten itself.", "7430": "XXIX.", "7431": "That it comprehends all the numbers up to itself is manifest to every one ;", "7432": "but that it also comprehends the numbers which come after it, is very easily seen by a calculation of numbers, when we have put them together, one, two, three, four, we shall find what we were doubting about;", "7433": "for of one and four, the number five will be found to be composed, and of two and four six are made up;", "7434": "the number seven, again, consists of three and four;", "7435": "again, according to a triple combination of one, and three, and four, the number eight is composed;", "7436": "also of two, and three, and four, the number nine ;", "7437": "and the number ten is made of all the numbers together, for one, and two, and three, and four make ten.", "7438": "On this account also, Moses said that in the fourth year all the fruit of the tree shall be holy;", "7439": "for this number has an even, and an entire, and a full, and (as one may almost say) every possible reason in it, because the number ten, of which four is the parent, is the first starting place of all the numbers when put together after the unit;", "7440": "and the number four and the number ten are both also called all,\" but the number ten is so called by reason of its operation, this number four with reference to its potentiality.", "7441": "XXX.", "7442": "And Moses very appropriately says that the fruit of education is not only holy but also praised;", "7443": "for every one of the virtues is a holy thing, but most especially is gratitude holy;", "7444": "but it is impossible to show gratitude to God in a genuine manner, by those means which people in general think the only ones, namely offerings and sacrifices ;", "7445": "for the whole world could not be a temple worthy to be raised to his honour, except by means of praises and hymns, and those too must be such as are sung, not by loud voices, but by the invisible and pure mind, which shall raise the shout and song to him.", "7446": "At all events there is an old saying often quoted, originally invented by wise men, but, as is often the case, handed down in succession to future ages, and one which has not escaped our ears, which are always greedy of instruction, and it is to this effect, \" When,\" say they, \" the Creator had finished the whole world, he asked of one of his ministers, whether he felt that any thing that was wanting which had not been created of all the things that are in the earth, or in the water, or of all that have received the sublime nature of the air, or the loftiest nature of all the universe, namely, that of the heaven ;", "7447": "and he replied, that every thing every where was perfect and complete ;", "7448": "but that he wished for one thing only, namely for reason, which should be able duly to praise it all, and which should not so much praise as give an accurate account of the exceeding excellence existing throughout, even in these things which appeared the most unimportant and the most obscure ;", "7449": "for lie said that an exact account of the works of God was their most complete and adequate panegyric, since they required no addition of external things to set them forth, but were of such a character that the bare plain truth was their most perfect encomium.\"", "7450": "And when the Father had heard what be said he praised it all, and at no distant time produced a race, which should be capable of receiving all learning, and of composing hymns of praise, producing them from one of the faculties existing around him, the virgin memory, whose name men in general distort and call her Mnemosyne.", "7451": "XXXI.", "7452": "This is then the purport of that legend of the ancients, and we in accordance with that story say, that it is the most appropriate work of God to confer benefits, and of created beings to show gratitude, since they are unable to give any requital of those benefits beyond gratitude ;", "7453": "for whatever he might be inclined to give as a requital for the other things which he has received, will be found to be the private property of him who is the Creator of all things, and not of the nature which offers it.", "7454": "Having learnt there­ fore that there is only one employment possible for us of all the things that seem to contribute to the honour of God, namely the display of gratitude, let us at all times and in all places study this, with our voice, and with useful writings, and let its never desist composing encomiastic orations and poems, in order that both the Creator and the world may be honoured by every description of utterance which can be exhibited in either speaking or singing;", "7455": "the one being, as some has said, the best of all causes, and the other the most perfect of all created things.", "7456": "XXXII.", "7457": "Since therefore all the fruit of the soul is con­ secrated in the fourth year and the fourth number;", "7458": "in the fifth year we ourselves shall be allowed the use and enjoy­ ment of it for ourselves ;", "7459": "for the scripture says, \" In the fifth year ye shall eat the fruit thereof;", "7460": "\" since it has been established by a perpetual law of nature, that account shall be taken of the creation after the Creator in every thing;", "7461": "so that even if we are thought worthy of the second place, it must be considered a marvellous thing;", "7462": "and on this account it assigns to us the fruit of the fifth year, because the number five is the number appropriate to the outward sense;", "7463": "and if one must tell the truth, that which nourishes our minds is the outward sense, which by means of our eyes sets before us the distinctive qualities of colours and forms, and by means of our ears presents us with all the various peculiarities of sounds, and with smells by means of the nose, and with tastes through the medium of the mouth, and which enables us to judge of the yielding softness and resisting hardness, or of softness and roughness, or again of heat and cold, by means of the faculty which is dispersed over the whole body, which we usually denominate touch.", "7464": "XXXIII.", "7465": "But the most correct example of what has been said, is afforded by the sons of Leah, that is of virtue, not all her sons, but the fourth and fifth ;", "7466": "for with respect to the fourth, Moses says that, then she ceased to bring fortli,* and his name was called Judah, which, being in­ terpreted, is \" confession to the Lord,\" and the fifth she 4 called Issachar, and the name being interpreted, means “reward;", "7467": "” and after she had brought forth in this manner, the soul immediately spoke and related what it had suffered ;", "7468": "for says Moses, \" She called his name Issachar, which means reward.”†", "7469": "Therefore Judas, the mind which blesses God, and which is without ceasing, devoted to pouring forth hymns of praise and gratitude to him, is himself in truth \" the holy and praiseworthy fruit,”‡ being produced not by the trees of the earth but by a rational and virtuous nature.", "7470": "In reference to which, the nature which brought him forth is said to have desisted from bringing forth, since she knew not which way to turn, when she had come to the limit of perfection;", "7471": "for of all successful actions which are brought forth, the best and most perfect production is a hymn to the Father of the universe;", "7472": "and the fifth son is in no respect different from the enjoyment of the trees planted in the fifth year;", "7473": "for the tiller of the earth after a fashion takes his reward from the trees in the fifth year, and he takes the offspring of the soul, Issachar, who was called the “reward,” and very naturally, being brought forth after the grateful Judah ;", "7474": "for to a grateful person gratitude is a most sufficient reward.", "7475": "Therefore, the fruits of the trees are called the produce of the owners of the trees ;", "7476": "but the fruit of in­ struction and wisdom is no longer the produce of man, but as Moses says, \" of the universal Governor alone for after he has spoken of his produce, he adds, \" I am the Lord your God,\" asserting most distinctly that there is one God, whose fruit is the produce of the soul.", "7477": "And with this assertion, this oracle delivered by one of the prophets is consistent, \" Fruit from me has been found by you.", "7478": "What wise man will understand this ?", "7479": "Will any in­ telligent person comprehend it ?\"*", "7480": "For it does not belong to every one, but only to the wise man, to understand whose the fruit of the mind is.", "7481": "XXXIV.", "7482": "Therefore, concerning that most ancient and sacred husbandry, which the Cause of all things uses with reference to the world, that most productive of trees, and concerning that other kind in imitation of it which the vir­ tuous mail studies, and concerning the ordinary quaternion of prizes, and the laws and precepts which all tend to the same point, we have now spoken to the best of our power.", "7483": "Let us now consider the vine-planting of the just Noah which is a species of husbandry.", "7484": "For it is said that \" Noah began to be a husbandman of the earth, and he planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine, and got drunk.”†", "7485": "Therefore, the wise man here cultivates with skill and science the tree of drunkenness, though fools enter upon its management in an unartistic and negligent manner, so that it is necessary for us now to speak in a fitting manner about drunkenness ;", "7486": "for we shall presently know the power also of that tree which gives rise to it.", "7487": "Afterwards, we will examine with accuracy what has been said by the lawgiver concerning drunkenness, but at present we will ex­ amine what determination others have come to on this subject.", "7488": "XXXV.", "7489": "Now, among many philosophers, this question has been investigated with no slight degree of pains, and the question is proposed in this manner, whether the wise man will get drunk?", "7490": "Therefore, to get drunk is a matter of a twofold nature, one part of it being equivalent to being overcome with wine ;", "7491": "the other, to behaving foolishly in one's cups.", "7492": "But of those who have dealt with this proposition, some have said that the wise man never takes too much un­ mixed wine, and never behaves foolishly;", "7493": "for that the one is an error, and that the other is an efficient cause of error, and that both the one and the other is inconsistent with good conduct.", "7494": "Others again have asserted, that to be overcome with wine is appropriate even to a virtuous man, but that to behave foolishly is inconsistent with his character.", "7495": "For that the wisdom which is in him is sufficient to resist those things which attempt to do him injury, and to destroy the innova­ tions which they seek to produce in the soul, and that in-is­ dom is endued with a power capable of extinguishing the passions, whether they be fanned by the impetuous gale of furious love, or kindled by abundant and heating wine, and that owing to this power it will always be superior to them.", "7496": "Since also of those who dive beneath a deep river or under the sea, some are destroyed from being ignorant of the art of swimming, but others who are possessed of this knowledge are very speedily saved;", "7497": "and, indeed, a great quantity of wine, inundating the soul like a torrent, sometimes weighs it down and precipitates it to the lowest depth of ignorance, but at other times is unable to part it, because it is supported and borne aloft by saving instruction.", "7498": "Those again who have not sufficiently observed the great­ ness of this excess with respect to passion in the wise man, have pressed him down, when he was applying himself to the study of sublime things, from heaven to earth, as those men do who are seeking to catch birds, in order to involve him in disasters similar to their own ;", "7499": "but others, seeing the great height of his virtue, have said that a wise man, if he indulges in wine beyond the bounds of moderation, will by all means cease to be master of himself, and will go astray, and will not only let his hands droop out of weakness, like those ath­ letes do who are defeated, but will also droop his neck and his head, and stumble, and fall down, coming to the ground with his whole body.", "7500": "XXXVI.", "7501": "Having then learnt this beforehand, the wise man will never of his own accord think fit to enter upon a contest of hard drinking, unless there were great things at stake, such as the safety of his country, or the honour of his parents, or the preservation of his children, or of his nearest relations, or in short, the success and prosperity of some im­ portant public or private interest.", "7502": "For he would not take a deadly poison unless the occasion compelled him very strongly to depart from life, as it might urge him to depart from his country.", "7503": "And at all events it is plain, that un­ mixed wine is a poison, which is the cause, if not of death, at least of madness, and why may we not pronounce mad­ ness to be death, since by it the most important thing in us dies, namely, the mind ?", "7504": "But it appears to me that a man would without the slightest hesitation choose (if a choice was permitted him), that death which separates and disunites the soul and the body as a lesser evil in preference to that greater one-the alienation of the mind.", "7505": "On this account, forsooth, men of old time called skill in the art of making wine madness (μαινομένη), and called the Bacchæ who were carried away under the influence of wine, mad women (Μαινάδες), since wine is the cause of madness and folly to those who indulge in it insatiably.", "7506": "XXXVII.", "7507": "Such then are, as it were, the prefaces of this discussion or investigation.", "7508": "Let us now go on to the other parts of this question which is divided into two heads as is natural;", "7509": "the one view affirming that the wise man will occa­ sionally be drunk, and the other, on the contrary, insisting that he will not get drunk.", "7510": "Now it is well to ruminate the arguments which are adduced in support of the former view, having first of all taken our beginning from this point, that of things some are homonymous, and others are only synony­ mous.", "7511": "And it is admitted that the being homonymous and the being synonymous are two opposite things, because homonymy is predicated of many subjects which have one common name ;", "7512": "and synonymy is the application of many different names to one subject.", "7513": "For instance, the name of do, is beyond all question a. homonymy, inasmuch as it com­ prehends many dissimilar things which are signified by that appellation.", "7514": "For there is a terrestrial barking animal called a do,;", "7515": "there is also a marine monster with the same name ;", "7516": "there is also the star in heaven, which the poets call the autumnal star, because it rises at the beginning of autumn, for the sake of ripening the fruits and bringing them to per­ fection.", "7517": "Moreover, there were the philosophers who came from the cynic school, Aristippus and Diogenes ;", "7518": "and others too who chose to practise the same mode of life, an incal­ culable number of men.", "7519": "Again there are other appellations which differ from one another, but still signify but one thing, as a shaft, a bolt, an arrow ;", "7520": "for all these terms are applied to the weapon which is sent from the string of the bow against the mark;", "7521": "and again there are the words, oar, scull, and blade, to express the instrument used for propelling a vessel, of equal power with sails ;", "7522": "for whenever a ship, by reason of a calm or of un­ favourable winds cannot use its sails, then those, whose busi­ ness it is, sitting down as rowers, and stretching out their oars on each side like wings, compel it to proceed onwards as if borne on wings ;", "7523": "and so the vessel being borne on the top of the waves, and rather running over them than cutting through them, hastens along with a speedy voyage, and speedily anchors in a safe harbour.", "7524": "And again, a staff, and a stick, and a cane, are all different appellations of one sub­ ject with which we can strike, or support one's self steadily, and on which one can lean, and do many other things besides.", "7525": "And we have enumerated these instances not for the purpose of making a long story, but in order that the matter under in­ vestigation may be more clearly understood.", "7526": "XXXVIII.", "7527": "The ancients called unmixed wine οἶνος, and also μέθυ.", "7528": "At all events, this latter name is used in very many passages of poetry, so that if those names are accounted synonymous which are applied to one subject, then οἶνος and μέθυσμα, and other words derived from them will differ in nothing but sound, and the being overcome with wine (οἰνου̃σθαι), and the being drunk (μεθύειν), are one and the same thing.", "7529": "And both these words intimate a taking of too much wine, which nevertheless there may be many reasons for a good man not turning away from ;", "7530": "and if he be overcome with wine he will also be drunk, being nevertheless not made in any respect the worse by his drunkenness, but remaining the same as if he had simply been well filled with wine.", "7531": "We have now detailed one of the opinions concerning a wise man getting drunk:", "7532": "and the second is as follows :", "7533": "—", "7534": "The men of the present clay, with the exception of a small portion of them, do not choose in any way to resemble the men of old times;", "7535": "but both in mind and action they show that they are in no respect agreed with them, but that they differ from them widely.", "7536": "For they have made such a revolution as to bring reasons which were sound and healthy into incurable decay and destruction.", "7537": "And in the place of a vigorous and athletic habit, they have brought almost every thing into a state of disease;", "7538": "and in the place of a full, and strong, and sinewy body, they have rendered it weak, inducing an unnatural, and swollen, and sickly habit, filling it up with empty wind alone, which soon bursts by reason of the want of any power to keep it to­ gether, when it is extended in the greatest degree.", "7539": "And the actions of created beings, which are most worthy of atten­ tion, and which were, as one may say, masculine actions, those also they have made disgraceful feminine instead, and discreditable instead of honourable, so that there are very few persons found, either in deed or in words, inclined to an imitation of the ancient manners.", "7540": "Therefore, the poets and historians who lived in their time, and all ether men who devoted themselves to literary studies, did not confine themselves to soothing and tick­ ling the ears with rhythmical sounds, but, if there was any­ thing broken, so to say, and relaxed in the mind, they roused it up, and whatever there was in it suited to their purpose they improved by initiation into natural philosophy and virtue.", "7541": "But the cooks and confectioners of our time, and those persons who are only artists of superfluous luxury, in the arts of dyeing and making perfumes, are always building up the outward senses with some new colour, or shape, or scent, or flavour, so as utterly to destroy the most important part of us, the mind.", "7542": "XXXIX.", "7543": "And why do 1 mention these things ?", "7544": "In order to show that the men of the present day do not use wine now as the ancients did.", "7545": "For now they drink eagerly without once taking breath, till the body and soul are both wholly relaxed, and they keep on bidding their cup-bearers to bring more wine, and are angry with them if they delay while they are cooling what is called by them the hot drink;", "7546": "and in a vile imitation of the gymnastic contests, they insti­ tute a contest among their fellow revellers as to who can drink most wine, in which they do many glorious things to one another, biting one another's ears and noses, and the tips of the fingers of their hands, and any other parts of the body they can get at.", "7547": "Now, these are the contests of revelry while in youth and vigour, and, as one may say, in its prime;", "7548": "but the others are the deeds of that ancient and more old-fashioned sort.", "7549": "For the men of old time began every good action with perfect sacrifices, thinking that in that way the result would be most favourable to them;", "7550": "and even if the occasion required especial promptitude in action, still they did not begin till they had offered prayers and sacrifices.", "7551": "But in all cases waited, thinking that haste was not in every case better than slowness.", "7552": "For speed, which is not accompanied with forethought, is injurious, but slowness, when founded on good hope, is advantageous.", "7553": "Knowing, therefore, that the use and enjoyment of wine require much care, they did not drink unmixed wine either in great quantities or at all times, but only in moderation and on fitting occasions.", "7554": "For first, of all, they offered up prayers and instituted sacrifices, and then, having propitiated the deity, and having purified their bodies and souls, the former with baths, and the latter with the waters of laws and of right instruction, they then turned their cheerful and rejoicing countenances to more luxurious food, very often not returning home but, walking about in the temples in which they sacrificed, in order that, by keeping in mind their sacrifices, and having a due respect for the place, they might enjoy what should be really a most sacred feast, doing no wrong either in word or deed.", "7555": "And this, indeed, is what they say the word [μεθύειν, to be drunk, derives its name from;", "7556": "because, μετὰΤΟ θύειν (after sacrificing) it was the custom of the men of old to drink great quantities of wine.", "7557": "And to whom could the manner of using unmixed wine described above be more appropriate than to wise men to whom the work to be done before drinking, namely, sacrificing, is so appropriate ?", "7558": "For one may almost say that no bad man can really perform sacrifices, not even if he were to bring the altar ten thousand oxen every day without intermission;", "7559": "for his most important and indispensable offering, namely his mind, is polluted.", "7560": "And it is impious for polluted things to come near to the altar.", "7561": "This, now, is the second point of view in which this question may be regarded, bywhieh we have shown that it is not inconsistent with the character of the wise man to get drunk.", "7562": "XL.", "7563": "There is a third way of looking at this subject, which depends ehiefly on the exceeding plausibility of an argument derived from etymology.", "7564": "For some persons think that drunkenness derives its name not merely from the fact of its being admitted after saerifice, but also because it is the cause of relaxation (μέθεσις) to the soul.", "7565": "But the reason of foolish men is relaxed so as to get strength for many sins;", "7566": "while that of those inclined to be sensible is relaxed, so as to enjoy freedom from care, and eheerfulness, and lightness of heart.", "7567": "For the wise man, when he is intoxicated, becomes more good-humoured than when he is sober;", "7568": "so that in this respect we should not be at all wrong in saying that he may get drunk.", "7569": "And besides all this, we must likewise add, that we are not speaking of a stern- looking and sordid kind of wisdom, contracted by profound thought and ill-humour;", "7570": "but, on the other hand, of that wisdom whieh wears a tranquil and cheerful appearance, being full of joy and happiness, by which men have often been led on to sport and divert themselves in no inelegant manner, indulging in amusements suitable to their dignified and earnest character, just as in a well-tuned lyre one may have a combination uniting, by means of opposite sounds, in one melodious harmony.", "7571": "At all events, according to the most holy Moses, the end of all wisdom is amusement and mirth, not such mirth as is pursued by foolish people, uneombined with any prudence, but such as is admitted even by those who are already grey, not only through old age alone, but also through deep think­ ing.", "7572": "Do you not see that he speaks of the man who has drunk deeply of that wisdom which is to be derived from a man's own hearing, and learning, and study;", "7573": "not as one who partakes of mirth, but who is actually mirth in itself?", "7574": "This is Isaae, for the name Isaae being interpreted means \"laugh­ ter,\" with whose character it is very consistent that he should have been sporting with \" perseverance,\" which the Hebrews call Rebekkah.", "7575": "XLI.", "7576": "But it is not lawful for a private individual to behold the divine instruction of the soul, but the king may behold it, as one with whom wisdom has dwelt for a very long time, if we may not rather say that it dwells with him all his life.", "7577": "His name is Abimelech, who, looking out through the window with the well-opened and radiant eye of the mind, saw Isaac sporting with Rebekkah his wife.", "7578": "For what employ­ ment is more suitable for a wise man than to be sporting, and rejoicing, and diverting himself with perseverance in good things ?", "7579": "From which it is plain that he will become intoxicated, since intoxication contributes to good morals, and also produces relaxation and advantage;", "7580": "for unmixed wine seems to increase and render more intense all the natural qualities, whether they be good or the contrary, as many other things do too.", "7581": "For money is to a good man a cause of good things, and to a bad man, as some one has said, it is a cause of bad things.", "7582": "And again, high rank makes the wickedness of a fool more conspicuous, but it renders the virtue of the just man more glorious.", "7583": "So also unmixed wine, being poured forth in abundance, makes the man who is the slave of his passions, still more subservient to them, but it renders him who has them under control more manageable and amiable.", "7584": "Who, indeed, is there who does not know that of two opposite things, when one kind is suitable to most people, the other kind must of necessity be suited to some ?", "7585": "As, for instance, white and black are two opposite colours:", "7586": "if white is suitable both to good and to bad things, then black must also be necessarily equally suitable to both, and not to one of the two alone.", "7587": "And, again, to be sober and to be drunk are two opposite things;", "7588": "accordingly, both bad men and good, as the ancient proverb says, partake of sobriety;", "7589": "therefore, also, drunken­ ness is suitable to both classes.", "7590": "Therefore the virtuous man will get drunk without losing any of his virtue by it.", "7591": "XLII.", "7592": "But if, like persons before a court of justice, one must bring forward not only such proofs as are in accordance with the rules of art, but those too which have no connection with art, one of which is proof by testimony, we will then pro­ duce many sons of physicians and philosophers of high repute to give evidenec, not by words alone, but also by writings.", "7593": "For they have left behind ten thousand commentaries entitled treatises on drunkenness ;", "7594": "in which they consider nothing beyond the bare use of wine, without pursuing any investigation with respect to those who are accustomed to behave foolishly in their cups, and in fact omitting every thing which has reference to conduct under the influence of wine ;", "7595": "so that it is very plainly confessed in their writings that drunkenness is the same as drinking wine freely.", "7596": "And to drink a superabundant quantity of wine on proper occa­ sions is not unsuitable to a wise man ;", "7597": "therefore we shall not be wrong if we say that a wise man may get drunk.", "7598": "But since no one is ever inscribed on the rolls as a con­ queror if he has contended by himself alone, for if he does this he appears only to be fighting with a shadow, and very naturally too;", "7599": "it follows that we must also produce the arguments of those who contend for the opposite side of the question, that by this means a most just judgment may be formed, and that the other side of the question may not be decided against through default.", "7600": "And the first and the most powerful argument is this:", "7601": "if no one in his senses would entrust a secret which lie wished to be kept to a drunken man, then a good and wise man will not get drunk.", "7602": "But before we collect all the other arguments in their order, it may be better to reply to each objection separately, in order that we may not appear to be too prolix, and consequently to be troublesome.", "7603": "Some one then will say in opposition that, according to the argument that has been advanced, the wise man must never have a bilious attack, and never go to sleep, and above all must never die.", "7604": "But he to whom some of these things happens is either an inanimate being or a divine one;", "7605": "but beyond all question he is not a man at all.", "7606": "Imitating this perversion of the arguments, one may apply it equally to a bilious man, or to a sleeping man, or to a dying man;", "7607": "for no one in his senses would tell a secret to a man in any of these conditions, but it would be reasonable for him to tell it to a wise man, for the wise man is never bilious, never goes to sleep, and never dies.", "7608": "I. WHAT has been said by other philosophers about drunk­ enness we have to the best of our ability recorded in the treatise before this present one.", "7609": "But now let us consider what is the opinion of the lawgiver, who was in all respects great and wise, on this subject;", "7610": "for in many places of his history of the giving of the law he mentions wine, and the plant which produces wine, namely the vine;", "7611": "and he commands somepersonsto drink it, but some he does not permit to do so;", "7612": "and at times he gives contrary directions to the same people, ordering them sometimes to drink and some times to abstain.", "7613": "These therefore are the persons who have taken the great vow, to whom it is expressly forbidden to drink unmixed wine, being the priests who are engaged in offering sacrifices.", "7614": "But those who drink wine are numerous beyond all calculation, and among them are all those who are especially praised by the lawgiver for their virtue.", "7615": "But before we begin to talk of these subjects we will examine with accuracy some points that concern this argument, and, as I at least imagine they are these.", "7616": "II.", "7617": "Moses looks upon an unmixed wine as a symbol not of one thing only but of many, namely of trifling, and playing the fool, and of all kinds of insensibility and of insatiable greediness, and of a covetousness which is hard to be pleased, and of a cheerfulness which comprehends many other objects, and of a nakedness which is apparent in all the things now mentioned, such as that which he says Noah, when drunk, displayed himself in.", "7618": "Wine, then, is said to produce all these effects.", "7619": "But great numbers of person who, because they never touch unmixed wine, look upon themselves as sober, are them involved in the same accusation.", "7620": "Andonemayseesomeof acting in a foolish and senseless manner, and others possessed by complete insensibility;", "7621": "and others again who are never satisfied, but are always thirsting for what cannot be obtained, because of their want of knowledge ;", "7622": "others, on the other hand rejoicing and exulting;", "7623": "and others in good truth naked.", "7624": "The cause now of behaving foolishlyisamischievous ignorance;", "7625": "I mean by this expression, not an ignorance of such things as are matters of instruction but an alienation from, and dislike of knowledge.", "7626": "The cause again of insensibility is a treacherous and mutilated ignorance.", "7627": "The cause of insatiability is a most grievous appetite for the indulgence of the passions of the soul.", "7628": "The cause of cheerfulness is at once the acquisition and the employment of virtue.", "7629": "Of nakedness there are many causes-an ignorance of such things as are opposite to one another;", "7630": "complete innocence and simplicity of manners;", "7631": "truth, which strips ont' all the coverings of such things as are concealed, on the one side revealing virtue to our eyes, and on the other side, in its turn, uncovering vice ;", "7632": "for no one can possibly put off both these things at one time, nor can he either strip them both off together But when any one discards the one, he must of necessity take up and clothe himself with the other.", "7633": "For as the old story tells us, God, when he had combined pleasure and pain, two things naturally at variance, under one head, gave to us an outward sense capable of appreciating them both, not at the same moment, but at different times, fixing the period of the return of one to be simultaneous with the moment of the flight of the other.", "7634": "Thus from one root of the domi­ nant principle, the two shoots of virtue and vice sprang up, neither blossoming nor bearing fruit at the same time;", "7635": "for when the one loses its leaves and fades away, then the other begins to shoot, and blossom, and look green, so that one might fancy that the one withered through dissatisfaction at the blooming appearance of the other.", "7636": "It is with reference to this that Moses represents in a most natural manner the departure of Jacob to be contem­ poraneous with the arrival of Esau ;", "7637": "\"", "7638": "For it came to pass,\" says he, \" that as Jacob went out his brother Esau came in.\"*", "7639": "As long, indeed, as prudence dwells in and makes his abode in the soul, so long every companion of folly is discarded and banished to a distance ;", "7640": "but when prudence departs then folly rejoices and enters, since its enemy and adversary, for whose sake it was driven away and banished, is no longer inhabiting the same place as before.", "7641": "III.", "7642": "We have now then said enough by way of preface to this treatise.", "7643": "We will proceed to adduce the proofs of all that we have said, beginning first of all to establish the first point.", "7644": "We said, then, that ignorance was the cause of man's behaving foolishly and misconducting himself, just as a great quantity of unmixed wine is to great numbers of foolish persons;", "7645": "for ignorance is the primary evil of all the errors of the soul, if we must tell the truth, from which, as from a spring, all the actions of life do flow, never producing to any one, one single stream of wholesome or drinkable water, but only brackish water, the cause of disease and destruction to all who use it.", "7646": "Thus, at all events, the law­ giver is very indignant with all uninstrncted and unmanage­ able persons, more than he is with any other description of people whatever.", "7647": "And a proof of this is this :", "7648": "who are they who are united in alliance not so much by study as by nature, whether among men or among the other kinds of animals ?", "7649": "No one;", "7650": "not even a madman would say that any beings were so closely united as parents and children;", "7651": "for even by the mere untaught instinct of nature the parent always cares for his offspring, and in every case endeavours to provide for its safety and durability.", "7652": "IV.", "7653": "Those, then, who are the natural protectors of others, Moses represents as having crossed over to the ranks of enemies, making those accusers who would naturally have been advocates, I mean the father and mother, in order that the children may be destroyed by those by whom above all others it was natural they should be saved;", "7654": "\" For if,\" says he, \"any man's son be disobedient, or contentions, not obeying the voice of his father and of his mother, and if they reprove him and he does not listen to them, then his father and his mother shall take him, and shall bring him before the elders of the city, and shall bring him to the gate of that place, and shall say to the men of their city, This our son is disobedient and contentious, and does not obey our voice, but spends his time in revelling and drunkenness.", "7655": "And the men of that city shall stone him, and you shall destroy that wicked one from among you.\"*", "7656": "Therefore, here the accusations are four in number-disobedience, and contentiousness, and love of revelling, and drunkenness;", "7657": "and the last of these is the greatest, deriving its growth from the first, namely, from disobedience;", "7658": "for when the soul begins to be restive it advances onward through contention and quarrelsomeness, and arrives at last at the furthest boundary, drunkenness, the cause of alienation of mind and folly.", "7659": "But it is requisite to see the force of each of all these accusations, beginning with the first in order.", "7660": "V.", "7661": "It is then confessed by all most undeniably, that it is both honourable and advantageous to yield and to become obedient to virtue, so that on the other hand to be disobe­ dient to it must be disgraceful and in no moderate degree disadvantageous.", "7662": "And to be contentious and obstinate is a quality which comprehends every extravagance of evil;", "7663": "for­ the man who is disobedient is less wicked than he who is contentious, since the one only disregards what he is com­ manded to do, but the other also exerts himself to do the contrary.", "7664": "Come, now, let us investigate the true nature of these things.", "7665": "Since the law commands, for instance, that men should honour their parents, he who does not honour them is dis­ obedient ;", "7666": "but he who dishonours them is contentious.", "7667": "And again, since it is a righteous action to preserve one's coun­ try, we must call the man who admits of hesitation in the pursuit of the object disobedient, but the man who is pre­ pared moreover to betray it we must pronounce perverse and contentious.", "7668": "Again, he who, when requested to requite a favour, contradicts the man who says that he ought to consider himself a debtor, is disobedient;", "7669": "but he who, in addition to making no return, is so carried away by conten­ tiousness that he endeavours to do the person what harm he can, commits unredeemable wickedness.", "7670": "And further, he who never approaches, nor practises sacrifices, or any of the other observances required by piety, disobeys the command­ ments which the law usually ordains in such matters;", "7671": "but he who resists and turns aside to the opposite disposition, impiety, is a wicked man and a minister of impiety.", "7672": "VI.", "7673": "Such a mail as this was he who said, \" Who is there whom I am to obey?\" and again, \"I do not know the Lord.\"*", "7674": "For by his first expression lie states that there is no such thing as a Deity;", "7675": "and by the second question he means, that even if there is such a being, still he will not recognize him, which arises from a deficiency in his provi­ dence ;", "7676": "for if he were possessed of providence he would be recognized.", "7677": "Now to bring contributions and supplies in aid of an entertainment with a view to a participation in that best of all possessions, prudence, is praiseworthy and advantageous.", "7678": "But to do so with a view to the worst of all objects, folly, is disadvantageous and blameable ;", "7679": "therefore, the contributions for the most excellent object are the desire of virtue, the imitation of good men, continued care, laborious practice, incessant and unwearied labours ;", "7680": "the contributions for the opposite object are relaxation, indifference, luxury, effemi­ nacy, and a complete desertion of what is right.", "7681": "And we may see those who every day descend into the arena to con­ tend in drinking much wine, and practising this quality every day, and striving to gain the victory in greediness and voracity, bringing their contributions as though they had some desirable object in view, and injuring themselves in every thing, in their property, and their bodies, and their souls ;", "7682": "for by contributing their property they diminish their substance ;", "7683": "and they break down and enervate the powers of their bodies by their luxurious way of life, and as for their souls, inundating them with immoderate food like a swollen torrent, they compel that to sink down to the lowest depth.", "7684": "For the same manner all those, who bring contributions for the destruction of learning, injure the most important thing in them, namely, their mind, cutting off every thing that might save it—prudence, and temperance, and courage, and justice;", "7685": "on which account he seems to me himself to use a compound word, συμβολοϰοπω̃ν, for the more manifest manifestation of his meaning, because they who bring for­ ward attempts at virtue as their offering and contribution, wound and lacerate, and cut to pieces, obedient and learn­ ing-loving souls to the extent of their utter destruction.", "7686": "VII.", "7687": "Therefore the wise Abraham is said to have returned again from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who were with him.*", "7688": "And on the other hand, Amalek is said to have cut to pieces the rear of the company of the meditator of virtue,!", "7689": "in strict accordance with the truth of nature;", "7690": "for what is contrary to one is also hostile to the other, and such things are always meditating the destruction of one another.", "7691": "But one may especially blame a man who contributes offerings on this account, because such an one has not only determined to do wrong, but also to co-operate with others in doing wrong, thinking fit in some things to be the leader himself, and in others to follow the leadership of others ;", "7692": "so that, erring both by nature and through what he has learnt, he leaves himself no good hope of safety, and this, too, though the law has expressly said that one must \" not follow a multitude to do evil for, in truth, evil is a very manifold and very fertile thing in the souls of men, but good is but a contracted and rare thing.", "7693": "Again it is a most useful recommendation, not to join with many persons to do evil, but to unite with a few whose chief practice is to do justly.", "7694": "VIII.", "7695": "The fourth and greatest of the accusations, is that of drunkenness, not slight but excessive drunkenness.", "7696": "For devotion to crime is equivalent to devotion to swelling up, and kindling, and inflaming the poison which is the great cause of folly, namely ignorance, a thing which can never be extinguished, but which is at all times and in every case raising a conflagration and fury in the soul.", "7697": "Very naturally, therefore, justice will follow which purifies every evil disposition of the mind, for it is said, \" Thou shalt utterly get rid of the wicked man,\" not out of the city, or out of the country, or out of the nation, but out of yourselves.\" †", "7698": "For there are many faulty and blameable thoughts lurk­ ing in us, and taking up their abode in the recesses of our hearts, which, since they are incurable, it is necessary to eradicate and destroy.", "7699": "Therefore it is just that this disobedient and contentious man, who is always advancing plausible reasons as a sort of offering and contribution on his part towards the destruction of what is good, and who is inflamed with strong wine, and raging in a drunken manner against virtue, and being absurdly excited to his own injury by wine, should have his allies for his accusers, his own father and mother, since he ought to receive every possible reproof and chastisement from those who can be saved;", "7700": "but of the father and mother the appellations are common, but their powers are different.", "7701": "At all events we shall speak with justice, if we say that the Creator of the universe is also the father of his creation ;", "7702": "and that the mother was the knowledge of the Creator with whom God uniting, not as a man unites, became the father of creation.", "7703": "And this knowledge having received the seed of God, when the day of her travail arrived, brought forth her only and well-beloved son, perceptible by the external senses, namely this world.", "7704": "Accordingly wisdom is re­ presented by some one of the beings of the divine company as speaking of herself in this manner:", "7705": "\" God created me as the first of his works, and before the beginning of time did he establish me.\"", "7706": "For it was necessary that all the things which came under the head of the creation must be younger than the mother and nurse of the whole universe.", "7707": "IX.", "7708": "Who then is able to encounter the accusation of these parents ?", "7709": "No one can withstand even their moderate threats, or their very slightest reproach ;", "7710": "for neither is any one able to contain the immeasurable multitude of their gifts, perhaps even the whole world is not;", "7711": "but like a shallow channel, when the great fountain of the bounties of God flows into it, it will be very speedily filled so as to overtop its bounds and overflow;", "7712": "but if we are unable to receive his benefits, how shall we endure his chastising powers when they come upon us ?", "7713": "But these parents of the universe must be taken out of the present discussion;", "7714": "and for the present let us consider their pupils and acquaintances who have had assigned to them the care and superintendence of such souls as are not unwilling to learn and illiterate.", "7715": "Therefore we say that the father is masculine and perfect right reason, and that the mother is that middle and encyclical course of study, and instruction, and learning, which it is honourable and advantageous to obey as a child obeys his parents.", "7716": "The recommendation then of the father, that is of right reason, is to follow and obey reason, pursuing naked and undisguised truth;", "7717": "and the injunction of learning, the mother that is, is to obey the just customs, which ancient men who embraced opinion, as if it were truth, have established in cities, and nations, and countries.", "7718": "Now these parents have four classes of children.", "7719": "First of all comes that class which is obedient to them both, the second is that which attends to neither, being the opposite of the former one.", "7720": "Of the others, each is half perfect.", "7721": "For the one is exceedingly attached to its father, and attends to him, but disregards its mother and her injunctions.", "7722": "The other again appears to be attached to its mother, and obeys her in everything, but pays but little attention to its father.", "7723": "The first class, therefore, will carry off the prize of victory as superior to all the others;", "7724": "the second, which is the contrary of it, will meet with defeat and destruction\" at the same time ;", "7725": "and as to each of the others they will claim, one the second prize, and the other the third.", "7726": "The one which is obedient to its father being the second in honour, and the one which obeys its mother being the third.", "7727": "X.", "7728": "Now of the soul attached to its mother, yielding to the opinions of the many, and constantly changing its appear­ ance in accordance with the various forms arising from the manifold and different ways of life, after the manner of the Egyptian Proteus, who was able to assume the likeness of anything in the whole world, and to conceal his real form so as to render it entirely invisible, the most visible image is Jothor, a compound of pride, who evidently represents a city and constitution of men from all quarters, and of all nations, carried away by vain opinions.", "7729": "For after the wise Moses had invited the whole people of the soul to observe piety and to pay the honour due to God, and had taught them the commandments and the most sacred laws, (for he says, \" When there is a controversy among them and they come to me, I will decide between them all, and I will bring together to them the commandments of God and his law.”)* then Jothor, wise in his own conceit, uninitiated in the divine blessings, but having principally lived among human and corruptible things, harangues the people, and proposes laws contrary to those of nature, having regard only to opinion, while those other laws are all referrible to the standard of reality and truth.", "7730": "And indeed the prophet, pitying this man and com­ miserating his exceeding error, thinks it fitting to endeavour to teach him better things, and to persuade him to change his ways, and to forsake vain opinions and steadily to follow the truth.", "7731": "For says he, \" We after having cut up and eradicated the vain pride of the mind, will leave our abodes and depart to the place of knowledge, which we shall gain possession of by the divine oracles and their agreement of the result with them.", "7732": "Come now with us, and we will do thee good.\"*", "7733": "For so doing you will get rid of that most pernicious thing, false opinion, and you will acquire that most advantageous thing, truth.", "7734": "But he, being as it were subdued by enchantment in this way, will neglect what is said, and will by no means follow any kind of knowledge whatever, but will retire and will run off to his own individual and empty pride.",

false opinions, since he had not learnt that true faith which is dear to men.", "7737": "XI.", "7738": "For, when desiring to make a display of his piety, he says, \" Now I know that God is a great Lord in comparison of all gods,\" t he accuses himself of impiety in the eyes of all men who are competent to form a judgment;", "7739": "for they will say to him, \" Dost thou now know, 0 impious man, the power of the Ruler of the universe ?", "7740": "but before this thou didst not know it.", "7741": "For was there anything which thou hast ever fallen in with of more antiquity or power than

pouring forth his own light al­ together over our sight, so also when the beams of the light- giving God, unmingled as they are, and entirely pure, and visible at the greatest distance, shone upon the eye of the soul, being comprehensible only by the intellect, then the eye of the soul can see nothing else;", "7748": "for the knowledge of the living God having beamed upon it, out-dazzles everything else, so that even those things which are most brilliant by their own intrinsic light appear to be dark in comparison.", "7749": "Therefore he would never have ventured to compare the true and faithful God to those falsely named gods, if he had really known him ;", "7750": "but ignorance of the one God has caused him to entertain a belief of many as gods, who have in reality no existence at all.", "7751": "XII.", "7752": "Now this same opinion is entertained by every one who, having thoroughly comprehended the affairs of the soul, looks with astonishment on the affairs of the body and on

lawgiver calls labour, who, not perceiving the true laws of nature, falsely assents to those which are in force among men, saying, \" it is not the custom in our country to give the younger daughter in marriage before the elder.\"*", "7754": "For he thinks that it behoves him to adhere to the classifica­ tion arising from the consideration of time, according to which, that which is oldest is entitled to priority, and after that, that which is the younger is admitted to a participation in their joint rights.", "7755": "But the practicer of wisdom, knowing that natures are not subject to time, desires what is younger first, and what is older afterwards.", "7756": "And moral reason agrees with him in this matter, for it is necessary for those who practise anything, first of all to come to the more recent learning, in order that after that, they may be able to derive advantage from that which is more perfect.", "7757": "And, on this account, the lovers of virtue and excellence do not approach the doors of the older philosophy before they have become familiar with these younger parts of it, grammar, and geometry, and the whole range of encyclical learning ;", "7758": "for these subordinate branches do always attend upon those, who with sincerity and purity of purpose court wisdom.", "7759": "But he acts cunningly in opposition to these principles, wishing us to take to ourselves the elder sister first, not in order that we may have her in a lasting manner, but that being attracted by the allurements of the younger, we may hereafter relax in our desire for the elder one.", "7760": "XIII.", "7761": "And we may almost say that this has happened to many of those who have used out of the way roads to learn­ ing ;", "7762": "for still, as one may say, men coming from their very swaddling clothes to the most perfect study and way of life, philosophy, not thinking it fit to be utterly ignorant of ency­ clical learning, have still determined to apply themselves to them late and unwillingly.", "7763": "And then, descending from the older and more important kinds of learning to the contem­ plation of the inferior and younger branches, they have grown old among them so as no longer to be able to return to those pursuits with which they began.", "7764": "It is on this account, I imagine, that he says, \" Accomplish her seven years,\" which is equivalent to:",

impediments hindering and drawing him in the opposite direction.", "7769": "And the scripture here appears to me to show very plainly, that customs are regarded by men more than by women, as is clear by the words of Rachel, who admires only those things which are perceptible by the outward senses;", "7770": "for she says to her father, \" Be not angry, my lord, that I am unable to rise up before thee in thy presence, because the custom ot women is upon me.\" *", "7771": "Therefore it is especially the conduct of women to pay regard to customs ;", "7772": "for, indeed, that is the habit of the

war who are under our charge, and there is not one of them who has refused, but each man has brought his gift to the Lord of that which he has found.\" t", "7951": "For these men are likely again to prelude with a song of triumph, being eager to attain to perfect and dominant powers.", "7952": "For they say that the man who has taken the sum of the whole, has also taken the greatest number of the reasons of courage, which are by nature inclined to war, being arrayed in opposition to two squadrons, one of which is led by cowardice, which is difficult to overtake, and the other by frantic temerity and rashness ;", "7953": "and neither of them has any share in sound wisdom.", "7954": "And it is very admirably said that no one refused, by way of intimating a participation in perfect and complete courage ;", "7955": "just as the lyre and any other musical instrument is out of tune, if there is one single discordant note in it ;", "7956": "but is in tune when the strings are all harmonious and pour forth the same symphony at one touch.", "7957": "In the same manner also, the instrument of the soul is out of tune when it is either strained by rashness and urged on to a degree of exceeding sharpness, or relaxed by cowardice in an immoderate degree, so as to be let down and become very flat.", "7958": "But it is in tune when all the tones of courage and of every virtue are well united and combined together, and so produce one well-arranged melody.", "7959": "And it is a great proof of good tune and of skilful management to bring his due gift to God;", "7960": "and this is to honour the living God in a becoming manner, by means of confessing most distinctly that this whole universe is his gift to us;", "7961": "for he says in, strictest accordance with natural truth, \" the man has brought the gift which he found.\"", "7962": "But everyone of us, the moment that he is born, finds the great gift of God, namely the universal world, which he has given to him, and to the most excellent parts of him.", "7963": "*XXXI.", "7964": "There are also particular gifts which it is suitable both to God to give, and to men to receive.", "7965": "And these must be the virtues and the energies in accordance with them, at the discovery of which, being almost without any connexion with time, by reason of the surpassing rapidity of the giver which he is accustomed to exhibit in his gifts, every one is full of admiration, even those to whom nothing else in the world appears great.", "7966": "On which account also, the question is put, \" How didst thou find it so quickly, 0 my son ?", "7967": "”† the questioner marvelling at the promptness of the virtuous disposition;", "7968": "and he who has received the benefit answers felicitously, \" Because the Lord God gave it to me.\"", "7969": "For the gifts and explanations of men are slow, but those of God are most rapid, outstripping the motion of even the most speedy time.", "7970": "Therefore those who by their strength and courage have become chiefs and leaders of the chorus which raises the song of triumph and of gratitude, are those who have been already mentioned ;", "7971": "but those who, by reason of having been put to flight, and of their weakness, are companions of the song of lamentation which is raised on occasion of defeat, are men whom one ought to look upon as cowards, rather than to pity ;", "7972": "like those who have a body labouring under some natural defect, to whom any ordinary occasion of sickness is a great hindrance to their cure.", "7973": "But some persons have succumbed contrary to their inclinations, not because the energies of their souls are more effeminate, but because they have been overwhelmed by the more vigorous strength of their adversaries ;", "7974": "and imitating those who are willing slaves, they have voluntarily cast themselves down before either masters, though they were freemen by birth ;", "7975": "on which account being unable to be sold they have, which is the most incredible of all things, bought masters for themselves and so become slaves, doing the very same thing with those who are insatiably eager for drunkenness with wine;", "7976": "for they also of their own free will and without any compulsion, drink unmixed wine, so that of their own accord they eradicate sobriety from their souls, and choose folly;", "7977": "for, says the scripture, \" I hear the voice of those who are beginning revelry and drunkenness;", "7978": "\" that is to say, of men who are exhibiting a madness which is not involun­ tary, but who injure themselves with a voluntary and deliberate frenzy.", "7979": "XXXII.", "7980": "And every one who comes near the camp sees the calf and the dances, and he himself also is soon infected.", "7981": "For we fall in with Typhus and the revellers of Typhus, when­ ever we deliberately purpose to come near to the camp of the body;", "7982": "since those who are fond of contemplation and are eager to see incorporeal objects, as being persons who practise obstinacy from pride, are accustomed to dwell at a distance from the body.", "7983": "Do then therefore pray to God never to begin revelry or drunkenness, that is to say, never intentionally to set forth in the road which leads to ignorance and folly;", "7984": "for unin­ tentional errors are as light again as deliberate sins, inasmuch as

you will acquire the most important of all offices, namely, the priesthood.", "7986": "For it is almost the only occupation of the priests and ministers of God to offer abstemious sacrifices, abstaining in the firmness of their minds from wine and from every other cause of folly.", "7987": "For, says the scripture, \" The Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying, Wine and strong drink shalt thou not drink, neither thou nor thy sons after thee, when ye come into the tabernacle of the testimony, or when ye ap­ proach the altar of sacrifice, so that ye may not die.", "7988": "This shall be an everlasting law for all your generations to dis­ tinguish between what is sacred and what is profane, and between what is pure and what is impure.\"", "7989": "But Aaron is the priest, and the interpretation of his name is \"mountain­ oils ;", "7990": "\" reasoning occupying itself with sublime and lofty objects, not on account of the superabundant excess of the arrogance of empty pride,

manner will ever voluntarily touch unmixed wine or any other medicine of folly, for it is inevitable that he must either make one in the solemn procession and enter the tabernacle, being about to perform* the rites which may not be seen, or else, that ap­ proaching the altar he must offer sacrifices of gratitude for all the public and private blessings which have been showered upon him;", "7992": "and these things require sobriety and great presence of mind.", "7993": "XXXIII.", "7994": "Therefore, any one may here rightly admire the expressions in which the command is conveyed.", "7995": "For how can it be anything but admirable for people, while sober and masters of themselves, to apply themselves to prayers and to the offering of sacrifices ?", "7996": "just as on the other hand it is ridiculous for men to do so when relaxed both in body and soul by wine;", "7997": "unless indeed as often as servants, and sons, and subjects, are about to approach masters, and parents, and sovereigns, they take care to be sober in order not to offend in either word or deed, lest if they in any respect act as if contemptuous of their rank, they should be punished, or to speak in the most moderate manner, should at least suffer ridicule;", "7998": "and yet any one when about to become the minister of the Ruler and father of the universe, is not then to show himself superior to meat, and drink, and sleep, and all the vulgar necessities of nature, but is to turn aside to luxury and effeminacy, and imitate the life of the intem­ perate, and having his eyes weighed down with wine, and his head shaking, and bending his neck on one side, and belching from intemperance, and being weak and tottering in his whole body, is in that condition to approach the sacred puri­ fications, and altars, and sacrifices.", "7999": "No:", "8000": "such a man may not without impiety even behold the sacred flame at a distance.", "8001": "But, if indeed one is to understand these things as said not of the tabernacle or altar of sacrifice which are visible, and which are made of inanimate and perishable materials, but of those objects of speculation which are invisible and per­ ceptible only by the intellect, of which these other things are only the images perceptible by the outward senses ;", "8002": "he will all the more marvel at the explanation.", "8003": "For since the Creator has in every instance made one thing a model and another a copy of that model, he has made the archetypal pattern of virtue for the seal, and then he has on this stamped an impression from it very closely resembling the stamp.", "8004": "Therefore, the archetypal seal is the incorporeal idea being a thing as to its intrinsic nature an object of the outward senses, but yet not actually coming within the sphere of their operations.", "8005": "Just as if there is a piece of wood floating in the deepest part of the Atlantic sea, a person may say that the nature of wood is to be burned, but that that particular piece never will be burnt because of the way in which it is saturated with salt water.", "8006": "XXXIV.", "8007": "Let us then look upon the tabernacle and the altar as ideas, the one being the idea of incorporeal virtue, and the other as the emblem of an image of it, which is per­ ceptible by the outward senses.", "8008": "Now it is easy to see the altar and the things which are on it, for they have all their preparations out of doors, and are consumed by unquenchable fire, so as to shine not by day alone, but also by night;", "8009": "but the tabernacle and all things that are therein are invisible, not only because these are placed in the innermost recesses and in the most holy shrines, but also because God has affixed according to the injunctions of the law, the inevitable punish­ ment of death, not only to any one who touches them, but to any one who through the superfluous curiosity of his eyes beholds them.", "8010": "The only exception is, if any one is perfect and faultless, unpolluted by any error whether it be great or small, having a nature entirely even and full, and in all respects most perfect;", "8011": "for to such a man it is permitted once in each year to enter in and behold what is invisible to others, since in him alone of all men the winged and heavenly love of incorruptible and incorporeal good things abides.", "8012": "When, therefore, any one being smitten by the idea is in­ fluenced by the seal which gives an impression of the par­ ticular virtues, perceiving, and comprehending, and admiring the most God-like beauty of that idea which he is approaching, as having received the impression of that seal, then a forget­ fulness of ignorance and folly is at once engendered in him, accompanied by a simultaneous recollection of instruction and learning.", "8013": "On which account the scripture says, \" Wine and strong drink thou shalt not drink, neither thou nor thy sons after thee,\" when ye enter into the tabernacle of the testimony or approach the altar of sacrifice;", "8014": "and he goes through all these details not more by way of prohibition than of explaining his intention.", "8015": "In truth, for one who was issuing prohibitions, it was ap­ propriate to say, Drink not wine when you are performing sacrifice;", "8016": "but for one who is declaring his opinion, it is more suitable to say, Ye shall not drink.", "8017": "For it is impossible for a man to admit ignorance, which is the cause of intoxication and of ignorance of the soul, if he be one who studies the generic and specific virtues and devotes himself to the pursuit of them.", "8018": "And he very often speaks of the tabernacle of testimony, in truth, inasmuch as God is the witness of virtue, to whom it is honourable and expedient to attend, or inas­ much as it is virtue which implants steadiness in our souls, eradicating ambiguous, and doubtful, and hesitating, and vacillating reasonings out of them by force, and revealing truth in life as in a court of justice.", "8019": "XXXV.", "8020": "And the scripture says that, \" he shall not die who offers abstemious sacrifices ;", "8021": "” since ignorance brings death, and education and instruction- bring immortality.", "8022": "For as in our own bodies disease is the cause of dissolution, and health of preservation ;", "8023": "so in the same manner in our souls also, that which saves is prudence, for this is a kind of good health of the mind ;", "8024": "and that which destroys is folly, which inflicts an incurable disease.", "8025": "And he expressly declares his opinion, and pronounces this last to be an ever­ lasting evil.*", "8026": "For he considers that there is an undying law set up and established in the nature of the universe embracing these principles, that instruction is a salutary and saving thing, but that ignorance is the cause of disease and destruction.", "8027": "He also besides delivers this further statement, that the laws which are established in accordance with truth are at once everlasting;", "8028": "since right reason, which is law, is not perishable.", "8029": "For also, on the other hand, the contrary thing, namely lawlessness, is a thing of brief existence, and by its own intrinsic nature easily destructible, as it is confessed to be by all persons of sound sense.", "8030": "And it is an especial property of law and of instruction to distinguish what is profane from what is holy, and what is unclean from what is clean;", "8031": "as, on the other hand, it is the effect of lawlessness and ignorance to combine things that are at variance with one another by force, and to throw everything into disorder and confusion.", "8032": "XXXVI.", "8033": "On this account the greatest of the kings and prophets, Samuel, as the sacred scriptures tell us, drank no wine or intoxicating liquors to the day of his death ;", "8034": "* for he is enrolled among the ranks of the divine army which he will never leave in consequence of the prudence of the wise cap­ tain.", "8035": "But Samuel was perhaps in reality a man, but he is looked upon not as a compound animal, but as mind rejoic­ ing only in the service and ministrations of God.", "8036": "For the name Samuel, being interpreted, means \" appointed to God;", "8037": "\" because he looked upon all such actions as are done in accordance with vain and empty opinions to be shameful irregularity.", "8038": "He was born of a human mother, whose name when interpreted means \" grace.\"", "8039": "For without divine grace it is impossible either to abandon the ranks of mortal things, or to remain steadily and constantly with those which are imperishable.", "8040": "But whatever soul is filled with grace is at once in a state of exultation, and delight, and dancing;", "8041": "for it becomes full of triumph, so that it would appear to many of the uninitiated to be intoxicated, and agitated, and to be beside itself.", "8042": "On which account it was said to it by a young boy, and that not by one only but by every one who was old enough for juvenile sauciness and for a readiness to mock at what is good, \"", "8043": "How long will you be drunk ?", "8044": "Put an end to your wine-bibbing.\"", "8045": "*For in the case of those who are under the influence of divine inspiration, not only is the soul accustomed to be.", "8046": "excited, and as it were to become frenzied, but also the body is accustomed to become reddish and of a fiery complexion, the joy which is internally diffused and which is exulting, secretly spreading its affections even to the exterior parts, by which many foolish people are deceived, and have fancied that sober persons were intoxicated.", "8047": "And yet indeed those sober people are in a manner intoxicated, having drunk deep of all good things, and having received pledges from perfect virtue.", "8048": "But those are intoxicated with that drunkenness which proceeds from wine, who pass their whole lives without ever having tasted wisdom, though they have a continued hunger and desire for it.", "8049": "Very naturally therefore is answer made to the man who acts with the impetuosity of youth, and tninks to produce laughter at the venerable and austere mode of life of prudence, \" My good man I am a hard woman, a severe day, and I drink no wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.", "8050": "\"Very great is the freedom of speech of that soul which is filled with the graces of God.", "8051": "In the first place it calls itself a severe day, having regard to the boy who is mock­ ing it;", "8052": "for by him and by every fool the road which leads to virtue is looked upon as rough and difficult to travel and most painful, as one of the old poets testifies, saying:", "8053": "-", "8054": "Vice one may take in troops with ease, But in fair virtue's front Immortal God has stationed toil, And care, and sweat, to bar the road.", "8055": "Long is the road and steep,", "8056": "And rough at first, which leads the steps", "8057": "Of mortal man thereto ;", "8058": "But when you reach the height, the path", "8059": "Is easy which before was hard, And swift the onward course.", "8060": "XXXVII.", "8061": "After this the soul goes on to deny that it drinks wine or strong drink, boasting in its being continu­ ally sober throughout the whole of its life.", "8062": "For to have the reasoning powers really free, and unfettered, and pure, and intoxicated by no passion, was really a very important and admirable thing.", "8063": "And from this it results that the mind which is filled with unmixed sobriety is of itself a com­ plete and entire libation, and is offered as such to and conse­ crated to God.", "8064": "For what is the meaning of the expression, \"I will pour out my soul before the Lord,\" but \"I will consecrate it entirely to him?\"", "8065": "Having broken all the chains by which it was formerly bound, which all the empty anxieties of mortal life fastened around it, and having led it forth and emancipated it from them, he has stretched, and extended, and diffused it to such a degree that it reaches even the extreme boundaries of the universe, and is borne onwards to the beautiful and glorious sight of the uncreate God.", "8066": "Therefore this company is one of sober persons who have made instruction their guide;", "8067": "but the former one is a company of drunkards, whose leader is ignorance.", "8068": "XXXVIII.", "8069": "But since intoxication does not only display folly, which is the child of ignorance, but also utter in­ sensibility ;", "8070": "and since, again, wine is the cause of that insensibility which affects the body, while the cause of the insensibility of the soul is the ignorance of those things with which it is proper and natural to be acquainted;", "8071": "we must now say a few words about ignorance, reminding the reader of only the most important particulars relating to it.", "8072": "To which, then, of the passions which affect the body shall we compare that passion in the soul which is called igno­ rance ?", "8073": "To the deprivation of the organs of the external senses ?", "8074": "Therefore all those, who have been injured in their eyes or ears, are no longer able to see or hear at all, but have no acquaintance with day or light, which are the only objects for the sake of which, if we are to tell the plain truth, life is really desirable, but dwell in lasting darkness and everlast­ ing night, being made insensible to everything whether of small or great importance ;", "8075": "men whom ordinary conversation naturally is accustomed to call infirm.", "8076": "For even if all the other faculties of the rest of the body, should attain to the very extreme limit of strength and vigour, still, if they are tripped up, as it were, and deprived of their foundation by the deprivation of the eyes and ears, they will meet with a great fall, so as never again to be able to rise;", "8077": "for the things which support man and keep him erect are in name, indeed, the feet, but in reality the powers of hearing and seeing;", "8078": "and the man who possesses them in their complete integrity is awake and stands upright, but he who is deprived of them falls and will be utterly destroyed.", "8079": "And ignorance does produce completely similar effects on the soul, depriving it of its faculties of seeing and of hearing, and allowing neither light nor reason to enter into it, lest the one should instruct it and the other should exhibit the truth to it.", "8080": "But shedding upon it dense darkness and abundant folly, it renders the most beautiful soul a deaf, and dumb, and lifeless stone.", "8081": "XXXIX.", "8082": "For knowledge, which is the opposite of igno­ rance, may be called, in a manner, the eyes and ears of the soul;", "8083": "for it applies the mind to what is said, and fixes its eyes upon things as they exist, and cannot endure to form a false judgment of anything which it either sees or hears.", "8084": "But it examines and carefully surveys every object which is worthy of being seen or heard, and even if it be necessary to sail or to travel over sea and land, it will traverse them to its furthest boundaries that it may see anything more im­ portant, or hear anything more modern;", "8085": "for the love of knowledge admits of no hesitation or delay, it is an enemy to sleep and a friend to waking.", "8086": "Therefore, continually rousing up, and awakening, and sharpening the intellect, it compels it to roam about in every direction, where instruction is to be obtained, inspiring it with an avidity for hearing, and infusing into it an insatiable thirst for learning.", "8087": "There­ fore knowledge causes hearing and seeing, by means of which faculties success and rectitude of conduct are arrived at;", "8088": "for he who sees and hears, knowing what is expedient, chooses that, and rejecting the contrary is benefited by his knowledge.", "8089": "But ignorance causes to the soul a mutilation more grievous than the mutilation of the body, and is the cause of many errors, since it is unable to derive any assist­ ance from without, either by foreseeing anything, or by any acuteness of hearing.", "8090": "Therefore, owing to its exceeding desolateness of condition, it is left utterly undefended and unprotected, and is exposed to the plots of all kinds of men and to dangers from all kinds of events.", "8091": "Let us, then, never drink unmixed wine in such quantities as to cause insensi­ bility to our outward senses, nor let us alienate ourselves to such a degree from knowledge as to diffuse ignorance, that vast and dense darkness, over our souls.", "8092": "XL.", "8093": "But there are two kinds of ignorance, one simple, being complete insensibility;", "8094": "and the other of a twofold nature, when a man is not only enveloped in ignorance, but also thinks that he knows what he never has known, being elated with an ungrounded opinion of his knowledge.", "8095": "The former evil is the lighter one, for it is the cause of lighter offences, and of what we may perhaps call involuntary errors ;", "8096": "but the second is of more importance, for it is the parent of great evils, and not only of unintentional but also of deli­ berate offences.", "8097": "These are the offences of which Lot, the the father of daughters, appears to me to be especially guilty, not being able to nourish a masculine and perfect plant in his soul;", "8098": "for he had two daughters by his wife, who was after­ wards turned to stone, whom, using an appropriate appella­ tion, one may call habit, a nature at variance with truth, and always, whenever any one tries to lead it on, lagging behind and looking round upon its ancient and customary ways, and remaining in the midst of them like a lifeless pillar.", "8099": "Of these daughters of his the elder may be called Counsel, and the younger may be named Assent, for assent follows upon taking counsel;", "8100": "but no one after he has assented still takes counsel.", "8101": "Accordingly the mind, when it has taken its seat in its council chamber, begins to put its daughters in motion;", "8102": "and with the elder one, namely, Counsel, it begins to consider and investigate everything;", "8103": "and with the younger one, Assent, it begins easily to assent to the cir­ cumstances that arise, and to embrace what is hostile as though it were friendly, if they only present ever so slight an attraction of pleasure from this source.", "8104": "But sober reasoning does not admit these things, but only that reason­ ing does so which is overcome with wine, and, as it were, drunk.", "8105": "XLI.", "8106": "On which account it is said, \" They made their father drink wine.\"*", "8107": "That is to say, they brought com­ plete insensibility on the mind, so that it fancied itself com­ petent by its own abilities to judge what was expedient, and to assent to all sorts of apparent facts, as if they really had solid truth in them;", "8108": "human nature being by no means and under no circumstances competent either to ascertain the truth by consideration, or to choose real truth and advantage, or to reject what is false and the cause of injury;", "8109": "for the great darkness which is spread over all existing bodies and things does not permit one to see the real nature of each thing, but even if any one, under the influence of immoderate curiosity or of a real love of learning, wishes to emerge from ignorance and to obtain a closer view, he, like people wholly deprived of sight, stumbling over what is before his feet, will fall, and so get behind hand before he can lay hold of anything;", "8110": "or else, snatching at something with his hands, he will make uncertain guesses, having only conjecture in the place of truth.", "8111": "For even if education, holding a torch to the mind, con­ ducts it on his way, kindling its own peculiar light, it would still, with reference to the perception of existing things, do harm rather than good;", "8112": "for a slight light is naturally liable to be extinguished by dense darkness, and when the light is extinguished all power of seeing is useless.", "8113": "Accordingly we must, on these accounts, remind the man who gives himself airs by reason of his power of deliberating, or of wisely choosing one kind of objects and avoiding others, that if the same unalterable perceptions of the same things always occurred to us, it might perhaps be requisite to admire the two faculties of judging which are implanted in us by nature, namely, the outward senses and the intellect, as unerring and incorruptible, and never to doubt or hesitate about any­ thing, but trusting in every first appearance to choose one kind of thing and to reject the contrary kind.", "8114": "But since we are found to be influenced in different manners by the same things at different times, we should have nothing positive to assert about anything, inasmuch as what appears has no settled or stationary existence, but is subject to various, and multiform, and ever-recurring changes.", "8115": "XLII.", "8116": "For it follows of necessity, since the imagination is unstable, that the judgment formed by it must be unstable likewise ;", "8117": "and there are many reasons for this.", "8118": "In the first place, the differences which exist'in animals are not in one particular only, but are unspeakable in point of number, extending through every part, having reference both to their creation and to the way in which they are furnished with their different faculties, and to their way of being supported and their habits, and to the manner in which they choose and avoid different things, and to the energies and motions of the outward senses, and to the peculiar properties of the endless passions affecting both the soul and body.", "8119": "For without mentioning those animals which have the faculty of judgment, consider also some of those which are the objects of judgment, such as the chameleon and the polypus;", "8120": "for they say that the former of these animals changes his com­ plexion so as to resemble the soils over which he is accustomed to creep, and that the other is like the rocks of the sea-shore to which it clings, nature herself, perhaps, being their saviour, and endowing them with a quality to protect them from being caught, namely, with that of changing to all kinds of complexions, as a defence against evil.", "8121": "Again, have you never perceived the neck of the dove changing colour so as to assume a countless variety of hues in the rays of the sun ?", "8122": "is it not by turns red, and purple and fiery coloured, and cinereous, and again pale, and ruddy, and every other variety of colour, the very names of which it is not easy to enumerate ?", "8123": "They say indeed that among the Scythians, among that tribe which is called the Geloni, most marvellous things happen, rarely indeed, but never­ theless it does happen;", "8124": "namely that there is a beast seen which is called the tarandus, not much less than an ox in size, and exceedingly like a stag in the character of his face.", "8125": "The story goes that this animal continually changes his coat according to the place in which he is, or the trees which he is near, and that in short he always resembles whatever he is near, so that through the similarity of his colour he escapes the notice of those who fall in with him, and that it is owing to this, rather than to any vigour of body, that he is hard to catch.", "8126": "Now these facts and others which resemble them are visible proofs of our inability to comprehend every­ thing.", "8127": "XLIII.", "8128": "In the next place, not only are there all these variations with respect to animals, but there are also innumerable changes and varieties in men, and great differences between one man and another.", "8129": "For not only do they form different opinions respecting the same things at different times, but different men also judge in different manners, some looking on things as pleasures, which others on the contrary regard as annoyances.", "8130": "For the things with which some persons are sometimes vexed, others delight in, and on the contrary the things, which some persons are eager to acquire and look upon as pleasant and suitable, those very same things others reject and drive to a distance as unsuitable and ill-omened.", "8131": "At all events I have before now often seen in the theatre, when I have been there, some persons influenced by a melody of those who were exhibiting on the stage, whether dramatists or musicians, as to be excited and to join in the music, uttering encomiums with­ out intending it;", "8132": "and I have seen others at the same time so unmoved that you would think there was not the least difference between them and the inanimate seats on which they were sitting;", "8133": "and others again so disgusted that they have even gone away and quitted the spectacle, stopping their ears with their hands, lest some atom of a sound being left behind and still sounding in them should inflict annoyance on their morose and unpleasable souls.", "8134": "And yet why do I say this ?", "8135": "Every single individual among us (which is the most surprising thing of all) is subject to infinite changes and variations both in body and soul, and sometimes chooses and sometimes rejects things which are subject to no changes themselves, but which by their intrinsic nature do always remain in the same condition.", "8136": "For the same fancies do not

still often conceives different ideas from those which he entertains when he is in motion;", "8138": "and also when he is courageous, or when he is alarmed ;", "8139": "again when he is grieved, or when he is delighted, and when he is in love, he feels differently from what he does when he is full of hatred.", "8140": "And why need I be prolix and keep dwelling on these points ?", "8141": "For in short every motion of both body and soul, whether in accordance with nature or in opposition to nature, is the cause of a great variation and change respecting the appearances which present themselves to us;", "8142": "from which all sorts of incon­ sistent and opposite dreams arise to occupy our minds.", "8143": "XLIV.", "8144": "And that is not the least influential cause of the instability of one's perceptions which arises from the position of the objects, from their distance, and from the places by which they are each of them surrounded.", "8145": "Do we not see that the fishes in the sea, when they stretch out their fins and swim about, do always appear larger than their real natural size?", "8146": "And oars too, even though they are very straight, look as if they were broken when they are under water;", "8147": "and things at a great distance display false appear­ ances to our eyes, and in this way do frequently deceive the mind.", "8148": "For at times inanimate objects have been imagined to be alive, and on the contrary living animals have been considered to be lifeless ;", "8149": "sometimes again stationary things appear to be in motion, and things in motion appear to be standing still:", "8150": "even things which are approaching towards us do sometimes appear to be retreating from us, and things which are going away do on the other hand appear to be approaching.", "8151": "At times very short things seem to be ex­ ceedingly long, and things which have many angles appear to be circular.", "8152": "There is also an infinite number of other things of which a false impression is given though they are open to the sight, which however no man in his senses would subscribe to as certain.", "8153": "XLV.", "8154": "What again are we to say of the quantities occurring in things compounded?", "8155": "For it is through the admixture of a greater or a lesser quantity that great injury or good is often done, as in many other instances, so most especially in the case of medicines compounded by medical science.", "8156": "For quantity in such compounds is measured by fixed limits and rules, and it is not safe either to stop short before one has reached them, nor to advance beyond them.", "8157": "For if too little be applied, it relaxes, and if too much, it strains the natural powers;", "8158": "and each extremity is mischievous, the one from its impotence being capable of producing any effect at all, and the other by reason of its exceeding strength being necessarily hurtful.", "8159": "Again it is very plain with reference to smoothness, and roughness, and thickness, and close compression, or on the other hand leanness and slackness, how very much influence all these differences have in respect of doing good or harm.", "8160": "Nor indeed is any one ignorant that scarcely anything what­ ever of existing things, if you consider it in itself and by itself, is accurately understood;", "8161": "but by comparing it with its opposite, then we arrive at a knowledge of its true nature.", "8162": "As for instance, we comprehend what is meant by little by placing it in juxta-position with what is great;", "8163": "we understand what dry is by comparing it with wet, cold by comparing it with heat, light by comparing it with heavy, black by contrasting it with white, weak by contrasting it with strong, and few by comparing it with many.", "8164": "In the same way also, in whatever is referred to virtue or to vice, what is advantageous is recognised by a comparison with what is injurious, what is beautiful by a comparison with what is unseemly, what is just and generally good, by placing it in juxta-position with what is unjust and bad.", "8165": "And, indeed, if any one considers everything that there is in the world, he will be able to arrive at a proper estimate of its character, by taking it in the same manner;", "8166": "for each separate thing is by itself incomprehensible, but by a com­ parison with another thing, it easy to understand it.", "8167": "Now, that which is unable to bear witness to itself, but which stands in need of the advocacy of something else, is not to be trusted or thought steady.", "8168": "So that in this way those men are convicted who say that they have no difficulty in assenting to or denying propositions about anything.", "8169": "And why need we wonder ?", "8170": "For any one who advances far into matters, and who contemplates them in an unmixed state will know this, that nothing is ever presented to our view according to its real plain nature, but that everything has the most various possible mixtures and combinations.", "8171": "XLVI.", "8172": "Some one will say, We at once comprehend colours.", "8173": "How so ?", "8174": "Do we not do so by means of the external things, air and light, and also by the moisture which exists in our eyes themselves ?", "8175": "And in what way are sweet and bitter comprehended ?", "8176": "Is it apart from the moisture in our mouths ?", "8177": "And as to all the flavours which are in accordance with, or at variance with nature, are not they in the same case ?", "8178": "What, again, are we to say of the smells arising from perfumes which are burnt ?", "8179": "Do they ex­ hibit plain unmixed simple natures, or rather qualities com­ pounded of themselves and of the air, and sometimes also of the fire which consumes their bodies, and also of the faculty existing in our own nostrils ?", "8180": "From all this we collect the inference that we have neither any proper comprehension of colours, not only of the combination which consists of the objects submitted to our view and of light;", "8181": "nor of smells, but only of the mixture which consists of that which flows from substances and the all-receiving air;", "8182": "nor of tastes, but only of the union which arises from the tasteable object presented to us, and the moist substance in our mouths.", "8183": "XLVII.", "8184": "Since, then, this is the state of affairs with respect to these matters, it is worth while to appreciate cor­ rectly the simplicity, or rashness, or impudence of those who pretend to be able with ease to form an opinion, so as to assent to or deny what is stated with respect to anything whatever.", "8185": "For if the simple faculties are wanting, but the mingled powers and those which are formed by contri­ butions from many sources are within sight, and if it is impossible for those which are invisible to be seen, and if we are unable to comprehend separately the character of all the component parts which are united to make up each faculty, then what remains except that we must think it necessary to suspend our judgment ?", "8186": "And then, too, do not those facts which are diffused over nearly the whole world, and which have caused both to Greeks and barbarians such erroneous judgments, exhort us not to be too ready in giving our credence to what is not seen ?", "8187": "And what are these facts ?", "8188": "Surely they are the instructions which we have received from our childhood, and our national customs and ancient laws, of which it is admitted that there is not a single one which is of equal force among all people ;", "8189": "but it is notorious that they vary according to the different coun­ tries, and nations, and cities, aye, and even still more, in every village and private house, and even with respect to men, and women, and infant children, in almost every point.", "8190": "At all events, what are accounted disgraceful actions among us, are by others looked upon as honourable;", "8191": "what we think becoming, others call unseemly;", "8192": "what we pronounce just, others renounce as iniquitous ;", "8193": "others think our holy actions impious, our lawful deeds lawless:", "8194": "and further, what we think praiseworthy, they find fault with;", "8195": "what we think worthy of all honour, is, in the eyes of others, deserving of punishment;", "8196": "and, in fact, they think most things to be of a contrary character to what we think.", "8197": "And why need I be prolix and dwell further on this sub­ ject, when I am called off by other more important points ?", "8198": "If then, any one, leaving out of the question all other more remarkable subjects of speculation, were to choose to devote his time to an investigation of the subject here proposed, namely, to examine the education, and customs, and laws of every different nation, and country, and place, and city;", "8199": "of all subjects and rulers;", "8200": "of all men, whether renowned or inglorious, whether free or slaves, whether ignorant or en­ dowed with knowledge, he would spend not one day or two, nor a month, nor even a year, but his whole life, even though he were to reach a great age, in the investigation ;", "8201": "and he would nevertheless still leave a vast number of subjects unexamined, uninvestigated, and unmentioned, without perceiving it.", "8202": "Therefore, since there are some persons and things removed from other persons and things, not by a short distance only, but since they are utterly dif­ ferent, it then follows of necessity that the perceptions which occur to men of different things must also differ, and that their opinions must be at variance with one another.", "8203": "XLVIII.", "8204": "And since this is the case, who is so foolish and ridiculous as to affirm positively that such and such a thing is just, or wise, or honourable, or expedient ?", "8205": "For whatever this mail defines as such, some one else, who from his child­ hood, has learnt a contrary lesson, will be sure to deny.", "8206": "But I am not surprised if a confused and mixed multitude, being the inglorious slave of customs and laws, however introduced and established, accustomed from its very cradle to obey them as if they were masters and tyrants, having their souls beaten and buffeted, as it were, and utterly unable to conceive any lofty or magnanimous thoughts, believes at once every tradition which is presented to it, and leaving its mind without any proper training, assents to and denies propositions without examination and without delibe­ ration.", "8207": "But even if the multitude of those who are called philosophers, pretending that they are really seeking for certainty and accuracy in things, being divided into ranks and companies, come to discordant, and often even to diame­ trically opposite decisions, and that too, not about some one accidental matter, but about almost everything, whether great or small, with respect to which any discussion can arise.", "8208": "For when some persons affirm that the world is infinite, while others pronounce it to be confined within limits;", "8209": "or while some look upon the world as uncreated, and others assert that it is created ;", "8210": "or when some persons look upon it as destitute of any ruler and superintendent, attributing to it a motion, deprived of reason, and proceeding on some independent internal impulse, while others think that there is a care of and providence, which looks over the whole and its parts of marvellous power and wisdom, God ruling and governing the whole, in a manner free from all stumbling, and full of protection.", "8211": "How is it possible for any one to affirm that the com­ prehension of such objects as are brought before them, is the same in all men ?", "8212": "And again, the imaginations which are occupied with the consideration of what is good, are not they compelled to suspend their judgment rather than to agree ?", "8213": "While some think that it is only what is good that is beautiful, and treasure that up in the soul, and others divide it into numbers of minute particles, and extend it as far as the body and external circumstances.", "8214": "These men affirm that such pieces of prosperity as are granted by fortune, are the body-guards of the body, namely strength and good health, and that the integrity and sound condition of the organs of the external senses, and all things of that kind, are the guards of that princess, the soul;", "8215": "for since the nature of good is divided according to three divisions, the third and outermost is the champion and defender of the second and yielding one, and the second in its turn is a great bulwark and protection to the first;", "8216": "and about these very things, and about the different ways of life, and about the ends to which all actions ought to be referred, and about ten thousand other things which logical, and moral, and natural philo­ sophy comprehends, there have been an unspeakable number of discussions, as to which, up to the present time, there is no agreement whatever among all these philosophers who have examined into such subject.", "8217": "XLIX.", "8218": "Is it not then strictly in accordance with nature that while its two daughters, Counsel and Assent, were agreed together, and sleeping together, the mind is introduced as embarrassed by an ignorance of all knowledge ?", "8219": "for we read in the scripture, \" They knew not when they lay down, or when they rose up.\"*", "8220": "For it was not likely that in his state he could clearly and distinctly comprehend either sleep or waking, or a stationary position or motion;", "8221": "but when he appears to have come to an opinion in the best manner, then above all other times is he found to be most foolish, since his affairs then come to an end, by no means resembling that which was expected;", "8222": "and whenever he has decided on assenting to some things as true, then he incurs a reproach and condemnation for his facility in adopting opinions, those things which he previously believed as most certain now appearing untrustworthy and uncertain ;", "8223": "so that, as matters are in the habit of turning out contrary to what was expected, the safest course appears to be to suspend one's judgment.", "8224": "L.", "8225": "Having now discussed these matters sufficiently, let us turn to what follows the points already examined.", "8226": "We said, then,

filled in all the channels of thejr bodies, still unsatisfied and empty as to their desires.", "8227": "These men, if, being distended by the abundance of the things which they have devoured, they

appearing to the minister of drunkenness, his cup- bearer, to be angry with him;", "8229": "again at no great distance of time is represented in the sacred scriptures as reconciled to him remembering that passion which breaks down the appetites in the day of his perishable creation, not in the imperishable light of the uncreated luminary;", "8230": "for it is said that it was Pharaoh's birth-day,* when he sent for the chief butler out of his prison, that he might appear at his banquet;", "8231": "for it is a peculiar characteristic of the man who is devoted to the passions, to think created and perishable things beautiful, because he is enveloped in night and dense darkness, as to the knowledge of imperishable things.", "8232": "On which account he embraces drunkenness as the beginning of all pleasures, and its minister the cup-bearer.", "8233": "LI.", "8234": "Now there are three companions of and servants of the intemperate and incontinent soul, the chief baker, the chief cook, and

chief cook;", "8235": "\" and the chief cook is eunuch;", "8236": "for he says in another place, \" And Joseph was brought down to Egypt, and a eunuch became his master, Pharaoh's chief cook,\"* and

because men are by nature calculated to sow seed, and woman to receive it, and that the meeting of the two to­ gether is the cause of the generation, and also of the duration of all animals ?", "8239": "But it belongs to an unproductive and barren soil, or one may rather say to one which has been made a eunuch, to delight in costly meats and drinks, and in superfluous extravagant preparations of delicacies, since it is unable in reality either to scatter the masculine seeds of virtue, or to receive and nourish them after they have been shed upon it;", "8240": "but, like a rough and stony field, only to destroy those things which ought to have lived for ever.", "8241": "And it is laid down as a doctrine of the most general applicability and usefulness, that every author of pleasure is unproductive of wisdom, being neither male nor female, because it is incompetent either to give or to receive the seeds which have a tendency to incorruptibility, but is able only to study the most disgraceful habits of life, to destroy what ought to be indestructible, and to extinguish the torches of wisdom, which ought to be enduring and in­ extinguishable.", "8242": "None of such persons does Moses permit to come into the assembly of God ;", "8243": "for he says that, \" A man who is bruised or castrated shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord.”", "8244": "‡LII.",

doctrines most advantageous to all human life ?", "8246": "Now, there are three persons who contribute to the conviviality of the human race,-the chief baker, the cup-bearer, and the maker of delicacies:", "8247": "very naturally, since we desire the use and enjoyment of three things­ meat, confections, and drink.", "8248": "But some men only desire that indispensable food which we use of necessity for the sake of our health, and in order to avoid living in an illiberal manner.", "8249": "Others again desire immoderate and exceedingly extravagant luxuries, which, breaking through the appetites, and weighing down, and overwhelming the chan­ nels of the body by their number, usually become the parents of all sorts of terrible diseases.", "8250": "Those, therefore, who are inexperienced in pleasure and the indulgence of the appetites and diseases, like the com­ mon people in cities, living a life free alike from hatred and from annoyances, as frugal people, have no need of all kinds of various ministers of refined skill, being contented with ordinary cooks, and cup-bearers, and confectioners.", "8251": "But they who think that the most important and royal object of life is to live pleasantly, and who refer everything, whether of great or small importance, to this object, desire to avail themselves of the services of chief cooks and chief cupbearers, and chief confectioners, that is to say, of men possessed of the highest degree of skill in the arts which they profess.", "8252": "For those who are skilful in the making of con­ fections and luxuries invent the most various possible kinds of cheese-cakes, and honey cakes, and of innumerable other sweetmeats, varying from one another, not merely in the difference of their material, but also in the manner in which they are made, and in their shape, in such a way as not only to please the taste, but also to beguile the eye.", "8253": "And again, the contrivances displayed in the examination of different kinds of wine to produce some, the effect of which shall speedily go off, and which shall not produce headache, but, on the contrary, shall be devoid of any tendency to heat the blood, and shall be very fragrant, admitting either a copious or a scanty admixture with water, according as the object is to have a strong and powerful draught, or a gentle and imperceptible one.", "8254": "And all the other devices and inven­ tions of cup-bearers all come to the same end of art.", "8255": "And to cook up and prepare fish, and birds, and similar viands, in every variety of manner, and to make all

agreement, was the cup-bearer ;", "8260": "for by its own nature, the human race is very fond of wine, and this is the sole thing of which it is im­ measurably insatiable, since there is no one who is impossible to be satisfied with sleep, and eating, and carnal enjoyments, and things like these;", "8261": "but nearly every one is insatiably fond of wine, and especially those who are occupied with serious business;", "8262": "for after they have drunk they are still thirsty, and they begin drinking at first out of small cups, then, as they proceed, they tell their servants to bring them wine in larger goblets, and when they are pretty full and getting riotous, being no longer able to restrain themselves, they take bowls and goblets of all the largest sizes that they can get, and drink the wine unmixed in huge draughts, until they are either overcome by deep sleep, being no longer able to govern themselves, or till what they have poured into themselves is vomited out again through repletion.", "8263": "But even then, nevertheless, the insatiable desire which exists within them continues to rage as though it were still under the influence of hunger. \"", "8264": "For their wine

instead of them he may implant in our souls the valuable trees of right instruction, and may bestow upon us noble and masculine reason as its fruit, such as is able to bear within it good actions by way of seed, and is able to increase the virtues, and is calculated to maintain and preserve for ever the entire connection and system of happiness.", "8279": "I. HAVING examined in the preceding treatise what has been said by the lawgiver about wine and the nakedness which attends upon it, we will now begin to connect the the following essay with the statements advanced in that work.", "8280": "Now in the sacred scriptures we come to the following words immediately after the account we have just been examining, \" And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew all that his younger son had done to him. \"* Sobriety is con­ fessed to be a most advantageous thing, not only for souls but also for bodies, for it drives away the diseases which arise from immoderate repletion, and it sharpens the outward senses to an exceeding degree of acuteness, and it altogether prevents bodies from being weighed down so as to fall, but keeps them light, and raises them up, and incites them to the exercise of their appropriate energies, implanting in every part a prompt­ ness and vigour;", "8281": "and in short, sobriety is the cause of exactly as many good things, as drunkenness, on the contrary, is of evils.", "8282": "Since then sobriety is most advantageous to those bodies to which the drinking of wine is naturally suitable, is it not much more so to souls, with which all perishable food is incon­ sistent ;", "8283": "for what thing in human nature can be more noble than a sober mind ?", "8284": "what glory can be more glorious ?", "8285": "what

us.", "8293": "Accordingly, many who have lost their sight, have voluntarily also thrown away life, thinking as far as they were concerned, that death itself was a lighter evil than such deprivation.", "8294": "In proportion then as the soul is superior to the body, in the same proportion also is the mind better than the eyes ;", "8295": "and the mind while it is free from injury and imperfection, not being oppressed by any of the iniquities or passions which are produced by insane drunkenness, renounces sleep as a thing which causes forgetfulness and hesitation in what is to be done;", "8296": "but it embraces wakefulness, and uses acuteness of vision, with respect to every object worthy of being beheld, being kept awake by exceedingly perfect memory, and committing actions

honours the things whieh appear good, in preference to joining his legitimate brothers and to those things which really are good.", "8329": "But he is spoken of as \"youngest,\" even although he keeps on increasing and im­ proving for the better, in comparison with the perfect man, who thinks nothing honourable but what is good.", "8330": "On which aeeount he says in an encouraging manner, by way of exhort­ ation, \" Return to me,\" a phrase equivalent to, \" Desire the elder opinion.\"", "8331": "Do not be in everything aiming at inno­ vation, do now love virtue for herself alone;", "8332": "do not, like a foolish child dazzled by the splendour of the events of for­ tune, allow yourself to be filled entirely by deceit and erro­ neous opinions.", "8333": "IV.", "8334": "It has therefore been proved, that in many passages Moses is in the habit of calling a person young, having regard not to the age of the body, but to the desire of the soul for innovation:", "8335": "and also we will now proceed to show that he calls some persons elders, not because they are op­ pressed by old age, but as being worthy of honour and respeet.", "8336": "Who then of those persons, who are acquainted with the saered seriptures, is ignorant that the wise Abraham is represented as less long lived than almost any one of his ancestors ?", "8337": "And yet of all those who lived to the most ex­ treme old age there is not one, as I think, who is called an elder, but he alone has this title given to him.", "8338": "Therefore, the saered seriptures say, that \" Abraham was now old and advanced in years,\" and, \" The Lord blessed Abraham in all things.\" *", "8339": "This appears to me to be added as a sort of ex­ planatory cause for what has been said before, namely, why the wise man is called the elder.", "8340": "For when the rational part of the soul is made of a good disposition by the kind provi­ dence of God, and when it reasons not only about one speeies, but about everything whieh is presented to it, using older opinion, it then becomes blessed, and is itself the older part of the people.", "8341": "Thus also he is accustomed to eall the members of the assembly of the God-loving people which consists of the number of ten sevens, elders.", "8342": "For we read in the scripture the direction given to Moses, \" Assemble for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you yourself know that they are elders.\" * Therefore, it is not only those persons who are looked upon by ordinary people as old men, inasmuch as they are hierophants, but those whom the wise man alone knows, whom he thinks worthy of the appellation of elders.", "8343": "For those whom he rejects, like a skilful money-changer, from the coinage of virtue, being alloyed, are all in their souls in­ clined to innovation;", "8344": "but those whom he wishes to make friends to himself, are of necessity well tested and approved, and elders as to their minds.", "8345": "V.", "8346": "Therefore, the scripture is seen to prove each particular of what I have said more plainly to those who have taught themselves to obey one injunction of the law.", "8347": "“For if,\" says the scripture, \" a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and if she who is beloved bears him a child, and also she who is hated, and if the child of the wife who is hated be the first born, then, on the day on which he bestows on his sons the inheritance of his substance, he shall not be able to give the share of the first born to the son of her who is beloved, overlooking his real first born son, the child of her who is hated;", "8348": "but he must recognize the son of her who is hated as his first born, to give him a double share of all the possessions that belong to him, because he is the beginning of his children, and the rights of the first born belong to him.\" t", "8349": "You observe here now that he never calls the son of the wife that is beloved the first born or the elder, but he often gives this title to the son of her who is hated ;", "8350": "and yet he has already pointed out that the son of her who is beloved was in point of time the first, and the son of her who is hated the last, at the very beginning of this injunction ;", "8351": "for he says, \" If the beloved wife and she who is hated both bear children.\"", "8352": "But nevertheless the offspring of the first mentioned, even though it may be con­ siderably earlier in point of time is looked upon as younger by right reason when it comes to decide between them.", "8353": "But the offspring of her who is spoken of in the second place, even though it may come after as to the time of its birth, is thought worthy of the more important and elder share.", "8354": "Why so ?", "8355": "because we say that she who is beloved is the symbol of pleasure, and she who is hated is the emblem of prudence.", "8356": "For the chief multiude of men love the company of the one to excess, inasmuch as she, from her own treasures, proffers them most seductive charms and allurements, from the very first moment of their birth to the extremity of old age;", "8357": "but of the other they detest excessively the austere and very dignified look, just as silly children dislike the profitable but unpleasant reproofs of their parents and guardians.", "8358": "And both the wives become mothers:", "8359": "the one bringing forth that disposition in the soul which loves pleasure, and the other that which loves virtue;", "8360": "but the lover of pleasure is imper­ fect, and in reality is always a child, even if he reaches a vast age of many years.", "8361": "But, on the other hand, the lover of virtue, though he is in old age as to his wisdom, while still in his swaddling clothes, as the proverb has it, will never grow old.", "8362": "In reference to which Moses says very emphatically with respect to the son of virtue, which is hated by the generality of men, that \" he is the beginning of his children,\" being, forsooth, the first both in order and precedency.", "8363": "And to him belong the rights of the first-born by the law of nature, and not by the lawless principle exist­ ing among men.", "8364": "VI.", "8365": "The prophet, then, in accordance with this law, and as it were shooting his arrows with happy aim at the appointed mark, in strict agreement with what has gone before, represents Jacob as younger in point of age than Esau (because from our very earliest birth folly is bred up with us, and the desire of what is honourable is engendered subsequently), but as older in point of power.", "8366": "In conse­ quence of which Esau is deprived of his birthright as the elder son, but Jacob is very naturally invested with it;", "8367": "and the arrangements made with respect to the sons of Joseph are consistent, if we examine them carefully and with much consideration;", "8368": "when the wise man, under the influence of immediate inspiration, having them both standing before him, does not put his hands on their heads, directing them as the youths are straight before him and immediately, but crossing his hands, so as to touch with his left the head of the one who appears to be the elder, and with his right that of him who seems the younger;", "8369": "and the elder one in point of age is called Manasseh, and the younger is called Ephraim.*", "8370": "And these names, if they are translated into the Greek language will be found to be symbols of memory and recollection;", "8371": "for the name Manasseh, being interpreted, means from forgetfulness,\" and which by another name is called \"recollection;", "8372": "\" for he who comes to a recollection of what he has forgotten is advancing out of forgetfulness.", "8373": "But Ephraim being interpreted means \"fruit-bearing,\" a most appropriate appellation for memory;", "8374": "because the fruit which is the most useful and truly eatable for souls is lasting memory, which never forgets.", "8375": "Memory, therefore, exists best when meeting with manly and solid natures, in respect of which it is looked upon as younger, having been brought forth late ;", "8376": "but forgetfulness and recollection, almost from the earliest birth of a man, dwell alternately with every one, on which account recollection has the prece­ dence in point of time, and is placed on the left hand by the wise man when he is arranging the two in order;", "8377": "but memory will share the chief honours of virtue, which the lover of God, receiving eagerly, will think worthy of a better portion by himself.", "8378": "Therefore, the first man, being become sober, and know­ ing what his younger son had done to him, imprecates very terrible curses on him;", "8379": "for, in truth, when the mind reco­ vers its sobriety, it does in consequence immediately perceive all that innovating wickedness has previously done to it, which, while it was intoxicated, it was unable to compre­ hend.", "8380": "VII.", "8381": "We must now then consider whom the wise man here curses ;", "8382": "for this is one of the matters especially deserv­ ing of investigation, since he curses not the son who appears to have done the wrong, but his son, and his own grandson, of whom he has not mentioned any apparent sin at present, either small or great;", "8383": "for he who from superfluous curi­ osity wished to see his father naked, and who laughed at what he saw, and who divulged what ought properly to have been concealed in silence, was Ham, the son of Noah ;", "8384": "but he who bears the blame for the offences committed by the other, and who reaped the fruit of them in curses is Canaan;", "8385": "for it is said, \" Cursed is Canaan the son, the servant, the ser­ vant of servants, shall he be to his brethren.\"*", "8386": "And yet, as I said before, what sin had he committed ?", "8387": "But they, who are accustomed to explain the formal, and literal, and obvious interpretations of the laws have'perhaps consi­ dered this by themselves;", "8388": "but we, being guided by right reason, as it suggests itself to us, will interpret it according to the explanation which is ready to hand, having just made this necessary preface.", "8389": "VIII.", "8390": "A stationary position and motion differ from one another ;", "8391": "for the one is a state of tranquillity, but motion is impetuosity, of which last there are two species-the one that which changes its place, the other that which is con­ stantly revolving about the same place.", "8392": "Now habit is closely akin to the stationary position, and energy to motion;", "8393": "and what we have here said may be more easily understood by an appropriate example.", "8394": "It is customary to call an architect, or a painter, or a farmer, or a musician (and so on with other artists), by the aforesaid name of their profession, even if they remain inactive, doing nothing in the way of working at their respective arts, with reference to the skill and knowledge which they have each of them acquired in their respective professions;", "8395": "but when the architect has taken a material of wood and is working it up, and when the painter having mixed his proper colours on his pallet, paints the figures which he has in his head ;", "8396": "and when, again, the former cutting furrows in the earth, throws in the seed, and plants, cuttings, and shoots of trees;", "8397": "and when, also, by way of supplying what he has planted with nourishment, lie waters them and draws up channels of water to their roots, and does every thing else which a farmer may be expected to do;", "8398": "and also, when the musician adapts metres, and rhythm, and all kinds of melody to his flutes, and harps, and other instruments, and is able even without any manufactured instruments to use the organ with which he is furnished by nature by means of his voice which is furnished with all the tones;", "8399": "and so on with all the other artists, if it were worth while to mention them separately.", "8400": "In all these cases, besides the aforesaid names derived from their profession, other names akin to the former ones are added with refer­ ence to their work;", "8401": "so that we predicate of the architect that he builds, of the painter that he portrays, of the farmer that he cultivates the land, of the musician that he plays the flute or the harp, or that he sings, or does some­ thing similar.", "8402": "Now, what men are followed by praise and blame ?", "8403": "Is it not those men who energise and do something ?", "8404": "For when they succeed they meet with praise;", "8405": "and when, on the other hand, they fail they incur blame ;", "8406": "but those who are scien­ tific, without proceeding to action, remain in tranquillity, having attained this one honour unattended with danger, namely, peace.", "8407": "IX.", "8408": "Therefore, the same assertion applies to those who live according to folly, and also to all those who live in accordance with virtue or vice.", "8409": "Those who are prudent, and temperate, and manly, and just men in their disposi­ tions are infinite in number, having a happy portion in nature, and institutions in accordance with the law, and exerting themselves in invincible and unhesitating labours;", "8410": "but the beauty which exists in the ideas in their minds they are not able to display by reason of their poverty, or of their want of rank, or of some disease of the body, or of some one of the other disasters which surround human life;", "8411": "therefore, they being good have got their good things as it were in bondage and prison.", "8412": "But there are others who have them in an unconfined, and emancipated, and wholly free condition, having unlimited materials and opportunities for their exhibition.", "8413": "The wise man having an abundance of private and public assisting circumstances by which he can display his acuteness and his wisdom ;", "8414": "the temperate man will make riches which are usually blind and accustomed to excite and tempt men to luxury, farsighted for the future:", "8415": "the just man will exer­ cise authority by which he will for the future be able to assign to each individual without any hindrance, such a share of existing things as agrees with his deserts.", "8416": "The practiser of virtue will display piety, holiness, and a proper care of the sacred places and of the sacred rites performed in them.", "8417": "But without proper opportunities virtues indeed exist, but they are immoveable and like silver and gold, which is of no use in the world, because it is treasured up in the secret recesses of the earth.", "8418": "On the other hand again, one can see innumerable persons unmanly, intemperate, foolish, unjust, impious in their minds, but unable fully to display the disgraceful character of all their vices by reason of the want of opportunity to sin;", "8419": "but if any important or frequent opportunities present themselves, then filling earth and sea to its extremest boundaries with unspeakable wickedness, and leaving nothing whether great or small uninjured, they overturn and destroy everything at one blow.", "8420": "For as the power of fire is quiet when it has no fuel, but when there are proper materials it blazes up ;", "8421": "so also all the powers which have reference to the virtue or vice of the soul are extinguished by want of opportunity, as I have said before, but are kindled by a favourable occasion and a happy concurrence of circumstances.X.", "8422": "Why then have I said these things, except with the object of teaching that Ham, the son of Noah, is the name of wickedness in a state of inactivity, but his grandson, Canaan, is the name of wickedness in a state of motion?", "8423": "For Ham being interpreted, means \"warm,\" but Canaan means “commotion;", "8424": "” and warm in a body implies fever, but in the soul it implies wickedness.", "8425": "For as I suppose disease is the foundation of fever, not only of a part but of the whole body;", "8426": "so also wickedness is a disease of the whole soul.", "8427": "But at one time it is in a state of tranquillity, and at another in motion ;", "8428": "now he calls its motion commotion (σάλος), which in the Hebrew language is called Canaan.", "8429": "But no lawgiver ever affixes a punishment to wicked men while in a state of inaction, but only when they are in a state of motion and practise actions in accordance with injustice, just as a moderate man would not care about killing a snake if it were not about to bite him.", "8430": "For we must leave out of the question, that natural cruelty of soul which in the case of some persons delights to deal destruc­ tion upon everything.", "8431": "Very appropriately, therefore, the just man will appear to have launched his curses against his grandson, Canaan.", "8432": "But I have used the expression \" will appear,\" because in effect he is cursing his son Ham through the medium of Canaan;", "8433": "for Ham being moved to commit sin does himself become Canaan.", "8434": "For there is one subject, namely wicked­ ness, of which one kind is contemplated in a stationary condition, and the other in motion.", "8435": "But a stationary condition is antecedent to motion, so that that which is moved appears to have the relation of offspring to that which is stationary.", "8436": "In reference to which fact Canaan is, according to the order of nature, described as the son of Ham;", "8437": "commotion as the offspring of tranquillity, in order that the statement made in another passage may be true, namely, \" visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generations.\"*", "8438": "For against these accomplishments of, and as it were, children of thoughts, punishments advance which await them, but which will hardly seize upon these thoughts which are not carried out by any action, and which consequently escape accusation.", "8439": "On this account, therefore, in the law concerning leprosy the great and wise Moses speaks of motion and its further progress and diffusion as unclean, but of tranquillity as pure.", "8440": "For he says, \"If it be diffused over the skin the priest shall pronounce him polluted.", "8441": "But if the bright colour remain in its place and be not diffused, fhe shall pronounce him clean. \"t", "8442": "So that, as tranquillity is an abiding of evils and of the passions within the soul (for that is what is intimated by leprosy), it is not liable to reproach ;", "8443": "but its motion and progress are of necessity open to accusation.", "8444": "There is also something like this in the sacred scriptures, where the account of the creation of the universe is given and it is expressed more distinctly.", "8445": "For it is said to the wicked man, \" 0 thou man, thou hast sinned.", "8446": "Cease to sin:", "8447": "”‡ because sin is condemned with reference to its being in motion and energising according to wickedness :", "8448": "but tranquillity is free from blame, and is even preservative because of its remaining stationary and inactive.", "8449": "XI.", "8450": "These things then, I imagine, have now been sufficiently discussed.", "8451": "Let us now examine the affair of the curses, and see what the case is with respect to them:", "8452": "\"Cursed,\" says the scripture, \" is Canaan the child;", "8453": "he shall be a servant to his brethren.", "8454": "Blessed be the Lord God of Shorn;", "8455": "and Canaan shall be a servant unto them.\"", "8456": "We said some time ago that Shem bears the same name as good, being called not by a special name, but the whole genus of good is his name;", "8457": "in reference to which, the good is the only thing to be named, the only thing worthy of a good report and of glory ;", "8458": "as, on the other hand, evil is the thing with no good report and with an evil fame.", "8459": "Of what prayer then does he think the man worthy who has received a share of the nature of good ?", "8460": "Surely of some new and extraordinary benediction, which no mortal is able to act up to, and from which, almost as from the ocean itself, abundant and unceasing springs of good things do gush out ever rising high and overflowing ;", "8461": "for he calls the Lord and God of the world and of all the things in it, by a particular grace, the private especial God of Shem.", "8462": "And see now how this exceeds all imaginable excess;", "8463": "for the man of whom such a thing is said, almost receives equal honour with the world ;", "8464": "for when the same being cares for and superintends them both, it follows of necessity that the two things so superintended must be of equal honour and importance ;", "8465": "may we not even say that these gifts are poured out upon him abundantly ?", "8466": "For the master and benefactor of the world, perceptible by the external senses, is called by these appellations, Lord and God;", "8467": "but of the Good which is appreciable by the intellect, he is merely called the saviour and benefactor, not the master or lord ;", "8468": "for what is wise is dearer to God than what is slavish.", "8469": "In reference to which principle he speaks clearly in

alone is nobly born, inasmuch as he has God attributed to him as his father, and being his adopted only son, he is not rich, but all-wealthy, dwelling luxuriously in abundance and among genuine good

irresistible power, without a rival, and authority over all things.", "8474": "He is the only free man, being emancipated from that most grievous mistress, vain opinion, whom God who makes free has

the words, “Blessed is the Lord God of Shem;", "8478": "\"* since it it becomes him who has received the inheritance of God to bless and praise him, since this is the only requital that it is in his power to offer, and since he is utterly unable by any means whatever to do anything further.", "8479": "XII.", "8480": "This, then, is the prayer which Noah offers for Shem ;", "8481": "let us now see

object of a man who thinks nothing beautiful but what is good is limited and contracted, for of all the innumerable guides which influence different men he is confined to one alone, namely, to the mind.", "8484": "But the object of a man who attributes good to three different kinds of things, dividing it as it has reference to the soul, and to the body, and to external things, is more extended, inasmuch as he cuts np the good into a number of small and dissimilar fragments ;", "8485": "on which account Noah very appropriately prays that breadth may be added to him, in order that he may be able to exercise the virtues of the soul, prudence, and tempe­ rance, and all the others, and likewise the vigorous health and acute perceptions of the body, strength and vigour, and the other qualities akin to them;", "8486": "and also the external ad­ vantages which contribute to wealth and glory, and to the enjoyment and use of necessary pleasures.", "8487": "XIII.", "8488": "Thus much

Lord of the universe ;", "8491": "for what more suitable and beautiful abode in all creation could be found for God beyond a soul completely purified, and thinking nothing beautiful but what is good,

fruit, namely, Abraham, of whom the self-instructed and self-teaching off­ spring, Isaac, was the fruit, by whom again the virtues which are displayed in labour are sown, the practiser of which is

call the \" kingdom and priesthood of God,\" * in reference to their agreement with the original author of their race, Shem, in whose house it was prayed that God might dwell;", "8498": "for a kingdom is the house of a king, being truly sacred, and the only house free from danger of being plundered.", "8499": "Perhaps, indeed, the prayer has reference also to Japhet, that he also may make his abode in the dwell­ ings of Shem, for it is well to pray for one who thinks the good things of the body and external advantages the only goods, that he may come over to the only true good, that of the soul, and may not wander from true opinions all his life, thinking advantages which are common to the most accursed and worst of men, such as health, and riches, and all such things as those, goods, when nature has not given any portion of what is really good to any wicked man;", "8500": "for, by its own nature, what is good can have no participation in what is bad.", "8501": "On this account good is
