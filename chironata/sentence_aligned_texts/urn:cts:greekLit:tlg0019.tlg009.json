Eleusinia being held at Athens and Eleusis (10 miles distant), in September, the lesser at Agrae, in the environs of the city, in March.", "2050": "Professor Tucker has shown, with almost absolute certainty, that the latter are repre­ sented in this play.", "2051": "The Chorus is composed of those who were initiated at this Festival, the ceremony including the sacrifice of a pig, ritual washings, ceremonial purifications, the taking of an oath of secrecy, and certain services of instruction;", "2052": "it was regarded as introductory to the higher initiation at the Greater Festival.", "2053": "The representation, beginning at line 324, and ending at line 460, opens with a Hymn to Iacchus, 324-52, while the pig is (in imagination) being sacrificed (1. 338).", "2054": "Then follows an imitation of the customary warning to the unholy and uninitiated to withdraw, literary and political offenders being substituted for these trans­ gressors.", "2055": "Three hymns are then sung, the first (372-81) in honour of Persephone, the second (384-93) addressed to Demeter, and the last (398-413) a processional hymn to Iacchus, supposed to be sung on the way to the shrine of his mother Demeter.", "2056": "Though lacchus is also called Dionysus, he is not identical with the Dionysus who is one of the characters in this play, and who was the son of Semele.", "2057": "The procession halts at an imaginary bridge, to reproduce the customary topical songs', which dealt with public characters with an unrestrained licence and a freedom of abuse unfamiliar to us, and probably (as Professor Tucker says of Greek abuse in general) meaning nothing in particular, but used in a ‘ Pickwickian sense’.", "2058": "These jokes at the Bridge were said to have been originally made by some one (Iambe or Baubo), who when Demeter, heartbroken at the loss of her daughter Persephone, sat weeping at the bridge over the Cephisus, in Attica, tried to make her laugh by jokes of this kind.", "2059": "At line 449 the women who have joined in this pageant pass out of the theatre, and the men remain to fill the part of the regular chorus in the play.", "2060": "These Lesser Mysteries were connected with the annual festival Anthesteria, held in honour of Dionysus about a month after this play was brought out.", "2061": "The festival lasted for three days, which were called ' The Broaching of the Casks ’,‘ The Cups ’, and ' The Pitchers'.", "2062": "The second day was devoted to drinking, from the effects of which those who, on the third day, offered pitchers or pots full of flowers, vegetables, &c., still suffered when they came to worship (see line 218).", "2063": "It has been conjectured that the second performance of this play took place at this festival."}, "tgt_lang": "en"}, "aristophanes_3_1830": {"aligns_idx": {"null": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,

fut pas le seul bienfait que les Grecs du— rent à Cérès, ou à celui qui leur fit connaître cette déesse.", "4259": "Le même qui avait enseigné à cultiver la terre, fit en même temps sentir le bonheur de vivre sous des lois :", "4260": "c’était la suite naturelle de la nouvelle manière de vivre que les hommes embrassaient.", "4261": "Ces deux avantages ont fait le double objet de la reconnaissance des Grecs pour la divinité dont ils croyaient les tenir.", "4262": "De là le double culte de Cérès, comme inventrice du labourage et comme légis- latrice :", "4263": "de là les mystères d’Éleusis et les Thesmophories.Il y avait à Athènes un temple appelé le Thesmophorion, destiné particulièrement à la célébration des Thesmophories.", "4264": "On y voyait un autel et une statue de Cérès;", "4265": "un vers d’Aristophane (895) ferait croire qu’on y gardait un trésor.", "4266": "Ce temple, séjour de la chas télé, était interdit aux hommes, et les lois avaient prononcé les peines les plus sévères contre ceux qui auraient osé s’y introduire.", "4267": "Cependant il yen eut quelquefois qui ne craignirent pas de s’exposer au danger.", "4268": "Le caractère particulier des Thesmophories était que les femmes seules en pouvaient être les ministres;", "4269": "ce qui les distingue des Mystères.", "4270": "La formule même du serment, νή τὼ θεώ, les distinguait des autres.Triplolème en avait institué la célébration au temps des semailles et toutes les cérémonies, en rappelant le rapt de Proserpine, faisaient allusion au temps que le blé allait rester caché dans le sein de la terre, pour reparaître à l’époque de la moisson suivante.", "4271": "Le temps des semailles tombait dans le mois Pyanepsion, qui répond à nos mois d’octobre et de novembre.Toutes les femmes n’avaient pas également part à la célébration de la fête.", "4272": "Il y en avait qui n’étaient que spectatrices de la pompe;", "4273": "d’autres qui pouvaient l’accompagner jusqu’à une certaine distance, et d’autres enfin qui pénétraient jusqu’au Thesmophorion.", "4274": "C’étaient ou des vierges, ou des femmes mariées, de mœurs irréprochables.", "4275": "On les appelait Thesmophoriazuses:", "4276": "Toutes les femmes qui devaient par- ticiper aux sacrifices secrets, se ren- daient au Thesmophorion, suivies de leurs esclaves, qui portaient dans des corbeilles des gâteaux, offrandes destinées à la déesse;", "4277": "mais à la porte elles renvoyaient ces esclaves, auxquelles il n’était pas permis de pénétrer dans le temple, ni d’assister à l’assemblée.", "4278": "Celte assemblée se faisait par tribus :", "4279": "chaque tribu élisait deux femmes qui prési daient à la fête;", "4280": "et pour être éligibles, il fallait qu’elles eussent été épousées légitimement, et qu’elles fussent nées d’un mariage légitime.", "4281": "Comme cette présidence entraînait probablement des frais considérables, on choisissait toujours celles dont les maris étaient en état de payer la dépense :", "4282": "c’était une chose honorable, et les maris ne pouvaient s’en dispenser, lorsqu’ils avaient trois talens en fonds.", "4283": "Le reste des femmes s’arrangeait ensuite par chambrées :", "4284": "un vers d’Aristophane fait croire que ces chambrées n’étaient que de deux.", "4285": "(Voy. pag. 282.", "4286": ")Le onzième jour du mois Pyauepsion, elles partaient pour aller chercher à Eleusis la corbeille sacrée appelée calar thus.", "4287": "Ce jour s’appelait ἄνοδος, ou jour de la montée, parce que les femmes montaient à Eleusis.", "4288": "Dans leur mar— che, elles portaient sur leur tête les livres sacrés où étaient écrites les lois de Cérès, appelées θεσμοί .", "4289": "Il paraît qu’elles couchaient à Eleusis, et même qu’elles y restaient plusieurs jours.", "4290": "Ce temps qu’elles devaient passer dans la plus grande chasteté, elles l’employaient à se purifier.Il semble, d’après ceci, que ces fêtes devaient être l’école de la plus austère pudeur.", "4291": "Toutefois on ne peut douter qu’il ne s’y passât bien des choses qui feraient rougir la femme la moins sévère.", "4292": "Certains symboles obscènes, objet d’un culte particulier, annoncent ce que pouvaient se permettre ces femmes assemblées, sûres de leur secret entre elles, et n’ayant à craindre les regards indiscrets d’aucun homme.", "4293": "La comédie d’Aristophane, bien qu’on ne puisse prendre à la lettre toutes ses plaisan teries, fait connaître l’idée que les Athéniens avaient de la conduite des femmes pendant ces fêtes mystérieuses.", "4294": "Si l’on eût cru généralement la vertu respectée dans ces assemblées nocturnes, Aristophane n’eût jamais osé en parler avec irrévérence.", "4295": "Le seizième jour du mois était celui du jeûne, νηστεία, observé par les femmes renfermées dans le temple de Gérés.", "4296": "Yers le soir, la pompe sacrée se mettait en marche.", "4297": "On voyait descendre d’Eleusis le calathus sur un char tiré par quatre chevaux blancs, emblème des quatre saisons.", "4298": "Cela s’appelait la des- cente, χάθοδος, comme le jour où les femmes se transportaient à Eleusis s’appelait la montée.", "4299": "Le calathus était le symbole des productions de Gérés, tantôt cachées dans le sein de la terre, tantôt reparaissant à la vue des hommes.", "4300": "En accompagnant la pompe, les Thesmophoriazuses marchaient les che- veux épars et pieds nus.", "4301": "Ce rite paraît avoir été particulièrement affecté aux Thesmopnories, et est d’autant plus singulier, qu’il était réputé indécent pour les femmes de montrer leurs pieds nus.", "4302": "Pendant la marche, on chantait des hymnes, comme l’hymne de Callimaque, que nous avons en entier, ou l’hymne d’Homère, dont il reste des fragmens.", "4303": "L’hymne d’Orphée, qui ne contient que l’énumération des noms et des épithètes donnés à la divinité qui y est célébrée, paraît avoir été plus propre aux fêtes d’Eleusis qu’aux Thesmophories.", "4304": "Entrée dans la ville, la pompe devait passer d’abord au Pry— tanée, et rendre hommage au temple de Testa.", "4305": "Là, les jeunes filles non initiées quittaient la pompe, et les véri— tables Thesmophoriazuses continuaient leur route jusqu’au Thesmophorion.", "4306": "Cependant, comme il y avait environ quatre lieues depuis Eleusis jusque-là, celles à qui l’âge ou la grossesse ne permettait pas de faire tout le chemin, pouvaient s’arrêter où les forces leur manquaient.Le jour suivant, qui était le troisième de la fête, et qu’Aristophane appelle le jour du milieu, on offrait le sacrifice.", "4307": "Le sénat et les tribunaux vaquaient;", "4308": "on délivrait les prisonniers que leurs crimes ne rendaient pas incapables de participer aux sacrifices.", "4309": "Il parait, parles vers d’Aristophane, qu’on ne se bornait pas à invoquer Cércs et Proserpine, mais qu’on leur joignait d’autres divinités, telles que Jupiter, Apollon, Diane, Bacchus et Minerve.", "4310": "Indépendamment du nom de Thesmo— pbore, sous lequel on invoquait Cércs, on l’invoquait aussi sous le nom de Calligénie.", "4311": "Meursius penche à croire que Calligénie était une déesse différente de Cérès, et Aristophane semble en effet les distinguer de l’autre (v. 299).", "4312": "Toutes les cérémonies des Thesrao— phories étaient, aussi bien que celles des mystères, des cérémonies nocturnes qui se faisaient à la lueur des flambeaux.", "4313": "Les vers d’Aristophane supposent presque partout que la scène se passe pendant la nuit.", "4314": "C’est ce qui favorisait la licence des débauches.Reste à fixer la durée de la fête, par les passages des divers auteurs, qui semblent se contredire.", "4315": "On voit d’abord dans Aristophane (v. 80) :", "4316": "« Les tribu« naux ne jugent point aujourd’hui, « et le sénat ne s’assemble pas;", "4317": "car « c’est le troisième jour de la fête, le « jour du milieu des Thesmophories.", "4318": "» Et plus bas (v. 376), il l’appelle encore le jour du milieu.", "4319": "D’après cela, on est porté à conclure que la fête durait cinq jours.", "4320": "Mais Hésycliius s’étonne « qu’A« rislophane ait appelé le troisième jour « des Thesmophories le jour du milieu, « puisqu’elles ne durent que quatre « jours, » Le passage d’Aristophane est formel, et le témoignage d’un poète contemporain ne saurait guère être infirmé par le doute d’un compilateur qui vivait long-temps après.", "4321": "D’un autre côté, Athénée fait dire à un de ses convives :", "4322": "« Quoi donc?", "4323": "sommes-nous « au jour du jeune (νηστεία), le jour « du milieu des Thesmophories?", "4324": "» Pour concilier ces témoignages divers, il faut se rappeler que le premier jour, ανοίος, ne comptait pas comme appar- tenant à la fête;", "4325": "ce n’était qu’une pré paratiop :", "4326": "il était séparé du second par un intervalle de quelques jours.", "4327": "Ainsi le second jour était proprement le premier de la fête :", "4328": "celui du milieu, qui est celui du jeûne, pourra ainsi être compté comme le second ou le troisième, selon qu’on tiendra ou non compte du jour préparatoire.", "4329": "Les deux derniers jours seront marqués, l’un par le sacrifice secret appelé la poursuite, l’autre par le sacrifice

pre-eminent attraction, the literary contest between Aeschylus and Euripides.", "9": "It was for the lofty strain of patriotism which breathed through all its political allusions, and was especially felt in the advice tendered, obviously with some misgiving as to the spirit in which the audience would receive it, in the epirrhema of the parabasis.", "10": "There the poet appeals to the Athenian people to forego all party animosities, to forget and forgive all political offences, to place the state on a broader basis, to leave no Athenian disfranchised.", "11": "More particularly, he pleads for those who having been implicated in the establishment of the Council of Four Hundred had1 ever since been deprived of all civic rights.", "12": "They could vote for no candidate, hold no office, and take no part in the popular assemblies.", "13": "Other citizens, however illiterate, enfranchised slaves, half-breeds, and the like, would be hurrying on to support the most ill-judged proposals of Cleophon;", "14": "but they—men of the purest Athenian blood, and the highest and most liberal Athenian culture- must needs stand aside, as though they had neither part nor lot in the Republic of Athens.", "15": "Aristophanes calls upon the people to put an end to this anomalous state of things, and to re-enfranchise all dis- franchised Athenians;", "16": "τοὺς ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμ", "17": "ους ποιῆσαι.", "18": "His doubt as to the reception of his appeal is manifested in every part of the epirrhema.", "19": "It is the Mystic Chorus, he insists, the Company of the Blessed Dead who are taking upon themselves to advise the Athenian people;", "20": "the errors of the excluded citizens are described as slips and slidings, not deliberate, but occasioned by the wily machinations of Phrynichus ;", "21": "the people whom he is addressing are mollified by the appellation ὦ σοφώτατοι φύσει, although in the antepirrhema, where he feels himself on safer ground, he resorts to his more customary address ὠνόητοι;", "22": "while, both before and afterwards, he indulges in a wild vein of harmless jocularity, calculated to mitigate any ire which his boldness may have aroused.", "23": "It tells much for the generosity of the Athenian people, that instead of resenting the poet's appeal, they rewarded it with the highest and most exceptional honours.", "24": "For we are told on the authority of Dicaearchus, a writer of.", "25": "the very greatest weight on such matters, that it was this very appeal which won the admiration of the public, and obtained for the play the honour of a second representation 1.", "26": "And this is fully borne out by the well-known fact that on the next political crisis, imme- diately after the disaster of Aegospotami, the Athenians followed to the letter the advice of Aristophanes, and their very first step was Tous ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμ", "27": "ους ποιῆσαι, to enfranchise the disfranchised citizens. \"", "28": "When your fleet was destroyed, and the siege commenced,” says Ando- cides 2, “ye took counsel together to create harmony in the state, and ye determined to enfranchise the disfranchised, and Patrocleides it was who introduced the decree.\"", "29": "He then sets out the decree, TO ψήφισμα", "30": "To Πατροκλείδον, and adds, \" So then in pursuance of this decree, ye enfranchised the disfranchised3.”", "31": "So Xenophon speaking of the commencement of the siege says 4, “The Athenians, having enfranchised the disfranchised, held out.\"", "32": "So Lysias, though with his usual vague- ness and inaccuracy, says 5, \" Your disposition was such that ye recalled the exiles, and enfranchised the disfranchised.\"", "33": "I say \" with his usual inaccuracy,\" because it is certain that the exiles did not return until after the city had been surrendered to Lysander, and could not help itself.", "34": "It was one of the conditions of peace imposed by the Spartans.", "35": "Indeed, the passage already cited from Andocides goes on, \"In pur- suance of this decree ye enfranchised the disfranchised.", "36": "But Patrocleides did not propose, nor did ye decree, the return of the exiles.", "37": "But when the treaty with the Lacedaemonians was concluded, and ye dismantled your walls and received back the exiles,” &c.", "38": "It seems certain that the comedy has come to our hands in the revised form which it assumed on its second representation.", "39": "The strange duplication of certain passages towards the end of the play must force itself upon the attention of the most unobservant reader:", "40": "a duplication which in my opinion arises in almost every case from the fact that the reading of the original play has crept from the margin into the text of the revised edition 1.", "41": "There is a very similar duplication, arising from the same circumstance, in some of Biron's speeches in Activ. scene 3, and Act v. scene 2, of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost.", "42": "But to my mind the most convincing passage is that contained in lines 1109-1114.", "43": "The Chorus have been exhorting the rival poets not to rest content with a mere general criticism of their respective aims and merits, but to come to close quarters, and to attack each other's dramas in every possible way, with a minute dissection of individual lines, phrases, and metres.", "44": "This would obviously require an audience not only thoroughly intelligent, as an Athenian audience would naturally be, but also thoroughly primed in the details about to be discussed ;", "45": "and it is impossible to doubt that on the first representation of the Frogs many of the most delicate hits would pass altogether unnoticed.", "46": "But this would not be so on the second representation.", "47": "The play would then have become public property;", "48": "it would be in the hands of the spectators, and they would not fail to appreciate and applaud every point as it arose.", "49": "And it is on this very ground that the Chorus encourage the rivals to proceed.", "50": "But if this ye fear, lest there be in the spectators any lack of knowledge, so that they will not recognize your subtleties when ye speak them, be not afraid of this, since the matter is no longer so.", "51": "For they are old campaigners now;", "52": "and each of them holding a book of the words is conning your clever hits.", "53": "The words οὐκ 'EO' οὕτω ταῦτ’ἔχει seem to imply that on the first representation of the play the audience were not always able τὰ λεπτὰ γνῶναι.", "54": "The play was acted about six months after the great naval victory of Arginusae;", "55": "about four months after the death of Euripides;", "56": "and about two months after the death of Sophocles.", "57": "The victory of Arginusae was the result of an almost unexampled effort on the part of the Athenian people.", "58": "Conon, their most brilliant officer, had been defeated at Mitylene, and was closely blockaded there.", "59": "One trireme managed to run the blockade, and bring news of his peril to Athens.", "60": "The Athenians received the intelligence in a spirit worthy of their best traditions.", "61": "All classes at once responded to the call with hearty and contagious enthusiasm.", "62": "In thirty days a fleet of 110 triremes, fully equipped and manned, was able to put to sea.", "63": "The knights had emulated the devotion of their forefathers (as recorded in the parabasis of the comedy which bears their name), and volunteered for service on the unaccustomed element.", "64": "The very slaves had been induced to join by the promise of freedom and, what was even more than freedom, the privileges of Athenian citizenship.", "65": "Further triremes, as the fleet went on, were obtained from the islands, till it finally reached a total of more than 150 vessels.", "66": "These exertions were rewarded by a victory which, if it was the last, was also the most considerable of all that were gained by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War.", "67": "And the slaves who fought in the great battle were admitted to be free Athenian citizens1 on the same liberal terms as had been granted to the Plataeans who had escaped from their beleaguered city some one and twenty years before.", "68": "They were enrolled in Athenian tribes and domes and enjoyed all the privileges of Athenian citizens, they and their sons after them for ever;", "69": "save only that the individuals first enfranchised were not eligible for certain hereditary priesthoods (such as those of the Eumolpidae, the Eteobutadae, and the Ceryces), nor yet for the office of Archon.", "70": "This exception was right and proper.", "71": "It would have been very unpalatable for an Athenian to see a man who had been brought up altogether outside the Athenian traditions, and still more so for a master to see his former slave, occupying the supreme position of Archon.", "72": "Yet even these excepted offices were not withheld from the children of the Plataean, or of the slave, even though they were born before their father acquired the Athenian citizenship.", "73": "The wholesale conversion of loyal slaves into free Athenian citizens, which met with the warmest approval of Aristophanes, readily lent itself to comic humour;", "74": "and throughout the play, whenever he alludes to the battle of Arginusae, this incident is sure to crop up.", "75": "In the epirrbema, which we have already discussed, “Shalt we give the fran- chise,” ask the Chorus, \" to slaves who have fought but one battle, and yet withhold it from freeborn Athenians, who, and whose fathers before them, have fought so many battles for Athens ?” \" 0 why was I not at the sea-fight ? \" cries Xanthias to his master1, \" I would have bidden you go and be hanged;", "76": "I would hare snapped my fingers at your commands.”", "77": "“I take no slave on my ferry,” says Charon 2, “unless he fought in the sea-fight,” in which case, be it observed, he would not be a slave at all.", "78": "And this consideration will, I think, lead us to the true signification of a much misunderstood phrase in the last-mentioned passage, where the battle of Arginusae is described as the sea-fight περὶ τῶν κρεῶν.\"", "79": "I take no slave,\" says Charon, A μὴ νεναυμάχηκε τὴν περὶ τῶν κρεῶν.", "80": "The word κρέας, as Aristarchus 3 is quoted by the Scholiast as saying, is frequently used for σῶμα;", "81": "and such is doubtless its meaning here.", "82": "Now a slave's body belonged not to himself but to his master.", "83": "For a slave's body, such is fate, belongs", "84": "Not to himself, but to the man who bought him.", "85": "But a free man's body is his own;", "86": "and he therefore who, in the courts of law or elsewhere, was contending for his freedom (as opposed to slavery), was said περὶ TOV σώματος ἀγωνίζεσθαι to be contending for his body, that is to say, for the ownership of his body.", "87": "A remarkably apposite illustration of this usage is supplied by the brief, but inter- esting, oration of Lysias, Against Pancleon.", "88": "The plaintiff had taken proceedings before the Polemarch against Pancleon, believing him to be a resident alien.", "89": "To these proceedings Pancleon pleaded that he was a \" Plataean \" enrolled in the tribe Hippothoontis, and the deme of the Deceleians, and was therefore a full Athenian citizen, over whom the Polemarch had no jurisdiction.", "90": "And the action was accordingly set down to be heard, not on its merits, but on this preliminary plea to the jurisdiction.", "91": "The oration of Lysias was intended for the plaintiff's speech on the trial of this preliminary issue.", "92": "It attempts to show that Pancleon, so far from being a “Plataean,” was not even a free man (μὴ ὅτι Πλαταιέα εἶναι, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐλεύθερον), but the runaway slave of a \" Plataean” master;", "93": "and that on a previous occasion he feared to bring his claim to the proof;", "94": "εὖ εἰδὼς ἑαυτὸν ὄντα δοῦλον, ἔδεισεν ἐγγυητὰς καταστήσας περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι, metuisse, as Reiske translates it, periculum judicii de ingenuitate adire.", "95": "Here we have the expression περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι applied to a slave contending for the rights of a “Plataean,” the identical position of the slaves who fought at the battle of Arginusae.", "96": "So far, therefore, as these slaves are con- cerned—and it is only to them that the observation of Charon is addressed—the battle of Arginusae was in truth a μάχη περὶ τῶν σωμάτων, or in a comedians language, a μάχη περὶ τῶν κρεῶν.", "97": "And this, I am persuaded, is the sense in which the words are here employed.", "98": "The opinions which have hitherto prevailed are given in the note below1.", "99": "To the subsequent tragedy, which made the victory of Arginusae a word of shame, instead of a word of glory, in the annals of Athens-", "100": "I mean the condemnation of the victorious generals, and the execution of the six who ventured within the reach of the democracy—Aristophanes makes but one, and that a very faint and obscure, allusion.", "101": "Aeschylus is considering whether it is right to predicate of Oedipus that he was ever deserving of the epithet εὺδαίμων ;", "102": "and running through the various calamities of his life, he comes at last to the statement, he blinded himself, whereupon Dionysus at once cuts in with the remark- meaning, I suppose, that had Oedipus been a colleague of Erasinides in the στρατηγία, his blindness would have been a piece of good fortune.", "103": "For then he would not have gone to the great battle, and so would not have fallen a victim to the machinations of Theramenes and the madness of the people.", "104": "This is the only direct allusion to the fate of the generals.", "105": "But doubtless it was to the attack of \"the blear-eyed Archedemus \" upon Erasinides, the precursor of the graver charge, that the scorn and contempt with which he is twice2 mentioned in this play are mainly due;", "106": "and Theramenes owes the ironical censure twice3 passed upon his career rather to the fatal ingenuity with which he shifted the blame from his own shoulders to those of.", "107": "the generals, than to his former double- dealing in the affair of the Four Hundred.", "108": "At the commencement of the play we find Dionysus journeying to the world below, for the express and only purpose of bringing back Euripides to the Athenian stage.", "109": "And one reason which he gives for the selection of Euripides is that he is a πανοῦργος, a man up to anything, a master of shifts and evasions, who would readily assist in carrying out any plan that might be devised for his rescue.", "110": "We should therefore naturally suppose that we were intended presently to witness a series of scenes analogous to those in the Thesmophoriazusae ;", "111": "we should expect to see Euripides utilizing for the purpose of effectuating his own escape some of the ingenious schemes and devices contained in his own plays, just as he had utilized them in the earlier comedy for the purpose of effectuating the escape of Mnesilochus.", "112": "But nothing of the kind occurs ;", "113": "there is no idea of an escape;", "114": "no artful contrivance is required;", "115": "the plot takes an entirely different trend;", "116": "nor is Euripides brought back.", "117": "We shall return to this subject shortly.", "118": "The Chorus of the play are the Blessed Mystics, those who had on earth been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, and had led a holy and virtuous life in accordance with the doctrines therein inculcated.", "119": "But before they make their entrance in that character their voices have been heard from behind the scenes chanting the melodious songs of the dead frogs, from whom the comedy derives its name.", "120": "They do not enter until some scenes later, and then they come in singing a series of hymns and songs, which are not, as commonly supposed, mere unconnected lyrics, but are a continuous presentation of the earlier stages of their annual procession to Eleusis, from the moment when they call Iacchus forth from his sumptuous temple at Athens down to the time when, having passed over the bridge of Cephisus, they are streaming away to weave their mystic sports and dances on the Thriasian plain.", "121": "Brimful as the comedy is of genial humour and exuberant vivacity, it nevertheless, to my mind at least, is everywhere invested with a certain solemnity.", "122": "This is doubtless due, in part, to the fact just mentioned, that the Chorus consists not, as in other comedies, of Athenian citizens, or of comic creations, but of dead mystae, performing in the world below the religious ceremonies which they had, in life, performed in the world above ;", "123": "and partly again to the circumstance that the action lies chiefly among the dead, and that the great poetical contest which it describes is a contest between two dead poets;", "124": "but most of all, perhaps, to our knowledge of the terrible time at which the play was produced, when the long anguish of the Deceleian War was visibly drawing to a close, and when the Athenian Empire certainly, and possibly the very existence of Athens, seemed in risk of immediate extinction.", "125": "After passing through various adventures Dionysus arrives safely at the halls of Pluto, and we are at once confronted with an entirely unexpected situation.", "126": "For it so happens that, at the moment of his arrival, a dramatic contest is about to commence between Aeschylus and Euripides;", "127": "and Dionysus, clean forgetting the errand on which he came, readily undertakes to act as judge.", "128": "The actual contest, without reckoning either the preliminary discussions or the political catechism by which it is succeeded, occupies 551 lines (from 875 to 1413, according to Brunck's numbering, which is adopted by all editors, whatever the number of their own lines may be), more than a third of the entire play.", "129": "Its object is to determine which is the better tragedian of the two;", "130": "and the rivals discuss not only their general merits and demerits, but also various subordinate questions, their prologues, their choral metres, and the weight of their iambic verses.", "131": "And all their dramatic stores, both old and new, TO.", "132": "τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ καινὰ, are ransacked for passages to support their respective contentions.", "133": "It is difficult to believe that all this detailed and elaborate criticism, together with the remainder of the play in which it is found, can have been entirely worked out during the very brief period which had elapsed since the death of Euripides;", "134": "especially since from that period itself we must deduct, at its commencement, the time that would pass before the news of the poet's death, which occurred in Macedonia, would have been received at Athens;", "135": "and at its'close, the time required for the submission of the play to, and its acceptance by, the Archon;", "136": "the granting of a Chorus;", "137": "the training of the Chorus;", "138": "the rehearsals;", "139": "and all the arduous preparation required for placing the comedy on the stage.", "140": "It seems far more probable that the contrast between Aeschylus and Euripides, which had been present 1 to the mind of Aristophanes from the very commencement of his career, had taken this form before the younger tragedian's death;", "141": "and that Aristophanes, finding the time too short for the completion of the play on the lines originally intended, fell back upon this great scene which was ready to his hand, and inserted it in a comedy with the plot of which it was quite unconnected.", "142": "And, indeed, it can hardly be said to be woven into the texture of the play at all;", "143": "it is but loosely tacked on, and the stitches by.", "144": "which it is attached to the main fabric are quite visible to a careful observer.", "145": "Nothing can be more abrupt than the manner in which the first mention of the contest is dragged in, some 120 lines before the contest itself begins.", "146": "It does not spring out of anything which has gone before.", "147": "Two slaves are talking, and in the very midst of a speech one of them breaks off, and asks the other, 1 Why, what is the meaning of all that hubbub ?", "148": "And the other explains that a contest is impending between the two great tragedians.", "149": "And when we come to the contest itself there is not, throughout its whole progress (from line 875 to line 1413), a single syllable tending to show that it is taking place in the world below;", "150": "nor is Euripides ever spoken of as if he were dead.", "151": "On the contrary, there is one passage from which, if this scene were detached from the rest of the play, we should certainly assume that he was still alive.", "152": "To the question what Euripides deserves if the charges brought against him by Aeschylus are sustained, Dionysus promptly replies, \" He deserves to DIE 2.\"", "153": "In itself the language seems to imply that he was still alive:", "154": "although, as the play stands, it is of course a mere joke, the joke of dooming to death a person who is already dead.", "155": "And in truth the poetical contest is so foreign to the general purpose of the play, that we cannot be surprised to find that it ends in a complete fiasco.", "156": "Dionysus, the chosen judge, having heard the entire competition, declares himself unable or unwilling to give any judgement at all.", "157": "And now a singular thing occurs.", "158": "Pluto, who has been present during the last 600 lines, or thereabouts, without once opening his mouth, suddenly breaks silence, and announces that the successful poet-whose promised reward has hitherto been the right to occupy the Chair of Tragedy in the Prytaneum of Hades-shaH return with Dionysus to the world above.", "159": "We therefore, at the close of the poetical contest, return to the old purpose of the play as abruptly as we left it when that contest commenced.", "160": "And Dionysus marks the change more distinctly by declaring that he will choose, not necessarily the better tragedian (which was the sole object of the poetical competition), but the man who can give to the State the wiser political counsel.", "161": "The counsel of Aeschylus—that Alcibiades shall be recalled, and the entire resources of the State devoted to the aggrandizement of the fleet-commends itself to Dionysus, who on that ground, and that only, awards the victory to Aeschylus.", "162": "And Aeschylus therefore it is who .reascends to earth, to do what he can for the city in her hour of need.", "163": "Yet the decision, though made without the slightest reference to the dramatic merits of the two contending tragedians, carries with it, strangely enough 1, the right to occupy the Tragic Chair.", "164": "All this curious jumble is occasioned by the clashing of the two motives, the motive of the poetical contest, and the motive of the general plot of the comedy.", "165": "Whatever may be the secret history of this poetical contest, it has always formed a most important, and to modern readers probably the most interesting, section of the Comedy of the Frogs.", "166": "It consists of four distinct trials of strength, divided from each other by choral songs;", "167": "the rivals discussing (1) their general merits and demerits, (2) their prologues, (3) their choral metres, and (4) the weight of their iambic verses.", "168": "It may, perhaps, be permissible to make a few observations on this great contest here, at somewhat greater length than would be con- venient in a footnote.", "169": "This, though by far the most important, one might almost say the only important and serious, part of the criticism, need not delay us long.", "170": "To enter at large into the perennial controversy as to the relative merits of Aeschylus and Euripides is no part of the duty of an editor of Aris- tophanes.", "171": "But a few brief remarks may not be considered out of place.", "172": "It must be remembered that this is not the case of two poets striving after the same ideal, and one approaching it more closely than the other.", "173": "Their ideals, their aims, their views of the tragic art are in almost every respect diametrically opposed;", "174": "so that what to the one might seem the chief merit of a play, to the other might appear its greatest defect.", "175": "The object of Aeschylus was to elevate the drama :", "176": "to give to his audience an impressive and worthy representation of the demigods and heroes of their noble traditions.", "177": "To this end he intro- duced the stately robe, the lofty buskin :", "178": "and, far more important than robe or buskin, the lofty sentiment and the stately language.", "179": "To Euripides all this appeared mere idle pomposity:", "180": "his aim was to bring down the drama to the level of ordinary humanity and every-day life.", "181": "And this contrast is the main topic in the first encounter of the poetical contest.", "182": "In it each poet is made to give his own view of the aims and objects which tragic poets should set before them:", "183": "Aeschylus considering it their duty to describe heroic deeds, and clothe noble thoughts in noble language;", "184": "whilst Euripides insists that they ought to portray the world as they find it, describing the deeds, unveiling the motives, and employ- ing the language, of daily life.", "185": "The idea of Aeschylus is to elevate and exalt the minds of the audience:", "186": "the idea of Euripides is to paint the world, its passions and infirmities, as they really are 1.", "187": "Each may be considered to have summed up his own theory in a single half-verse.", "188": "Πάνυ δὴ ΔΕl χρηστὰ λέλειν ἡμᾶς (1056),", "189": "It is our bounden duty to speak what is noble and good, is the language, and might be taken as the motto, of Aeschylus;", "190": "χρὴ φράζειν ἀνθρωπείως (1058),", "191": "We ought to speak all other men speak, is the language and motto of Euripides.", "192": "Each theory will always have its advocates ;", "193": "it is my good fortune, as a translator of Aristophanes, to be in entire accord with the views of my author.", "194": "From the foregoing considerations it naturally follows that neither poet altogether denies the charges advanced by the other.", "195": "He merely denies that the characteristic attacked is a blemish, and claims it as a merit.", "196": "If Euripides reproaches Aeschylus with his gigantic com- pounds and grandiloquent language, Aeschylus does not deny the grandiloquence, but maintains that his is the only diction befitting the divine and heroic personages which both poets brought upon the stage.", "197": "If Aeschylus censures his opponent for infusing a talkative and argumentative spirit into the Athenian people, Euripides is so far from denying the charge, that he glories in it as one of his brightest achieve- ments.", "198": "They agree as to the facts :", "199": "they differ only in their estimate of the facts.", "200": "Perhaps one other point should be mentioned.", "201": "It is frequently said that the antagonism of Aristophanes to the dramatic influence of Euripides was based on considerations of morality.", "202": "And this is per- fectly true;", "203": "only it must not be understood as suggesting that Euripides was, in any sense whatever, the holder or propagator of immoral prin- ciples.", "204": "But1 the great civic and social virtues, honour and justice and valour, patriotism and self-devotion, respect to parents and reverence to the gods, and the like-virtues which to Aeschylus, and generally to the Athenians of the old heroic days, were matters of conscience, about which no discussion could be tolerated-were by Euripides brought to the test of \" that universal solvent, the wild living intellect of man.\"", "205": "There were few, if any, virtues, and few, if any, vices, for and against which a store of arguments might not be found somewhere in the plays of Euripides.", "206": "And though he himself might conclude in favour of the right, yet he left it open for a more powerful or more plausible reasoner to turn the scale in favour of the wrong.", "207": "Euripides might hold, as Hippolytus in the tragedy named after him did certainly hold, that an oath must be kept inviolate, even though taken in ignorance of what it involved;", "208": "but the theory that in some circumstances an oath might not be binding on the conscience, had been disseminated amongst a quick and ingenious audience, and might bring forth fruit which the poet little meant.", "209": "I do not propose to enter more largely into this part of the con- troversy between the two poets;", "210": "but some very admirable and instructive remarks on the subject, which I have been permitted by the kindness of Sir R. C. Jebb to extract from his lectures on \" The Growth and Influence of Classical Greek Poetry,\" will be found in a separate note at the end of this Introduction.", "211": "In the second encounter the combatants no longer deal with the general theory of tragic poetry, but commence their criticism of special portions of a tragic play.", "212": "\"We will first begin with the prologue,\" Euripides is made to observe, since the prologue is the first beginning of a play.\"", "213": "But in truth there is no method in these attacks.", "214": "Aristo- phanes merely selects one point here and another there, just as they seem to afford the readiest handle to his wit and satire.", "215": "Euripides was accustomed to make his prologue an exposition of the facts upon which his play was founded ;", "216": "a vehicle for conveying to the audience the information which was necessary to bring them to the point at which the action of the drama commenced.", "217": "His prologues, as a rule, consisted of a lucid and neatly-worded historical narrative;", "218": "and the charge which he first brings against his rivals prologues is founded on the obscurity and ambiguity (ἀσάφεια) of their language.", "219": "It must be admitted that he could not have selected a prologue more suitable for his purpose than the stately and impressive lines with which the Choephoroe opens;", "220": "lines, it is to be observed, which do not exist in the imperfect MS. of the Choephoroe, and which would have been altogether lost if they had not been cited in the Frogs.", "221": "The lines are spoken by Orestes over the grave of his murdered father :", "222": "—", "223": "The first line consists of five words only ;", "224": "but each of its '.last three words is susceptible of two very different interpretations,

to his hand in the Myrmidons of Aeschylus,Euripides therefore selects five lines from the choral odes of Aeschylus— one from each of the following tragedies, the Myrmidons, the Psychagogi, the Telephus, the Priestesses, and the Agamemnon-and shows that the last twelve syllables of each are in the exact metre of the standard, ἰὴ κοπον, οὺ πελάθεις ἐπ'ἀρωγάν.", "282": "To make this perfectly

the standard after every selected line might easily grow δι' ὄχλου rots θεωμένοις.", "291": "Euripides therefore discards it;", "292": "he calls his second series of lines κιθαρῳδικὰ, not because, in the tragedies of Aeschylus, they differed in this respect from the former series;", "293": "but because, whilst lie had recited the former to the music of the αὐλὸς, he is about to recite these to the

metrical system occurs in the choruses of Aeschylus.", "300": "Euripides might easily have increased the number.", "301": "Three of the nine instances are taken from the first chorus of the

music had formed the accompaniment.", "306": "And Aeschylus replies that he had transplanted it from one fair soil to another, in TOV καλοῦ ἐς τὸ καλὸν, meaning, from the Homeric epos to the Athenian drama.", "307": "There was doubtless nothing Homeric in the lays of Phrynichus.", "308": "In drawing his inspiration, therefore, from the wells of Homer, Aeschylus was striking out a new and

topsy-turvy, the jest upon all things Olympian or human, the unsparing personal satire.", "510": "Let that popular religion once lose its hold, and then, though Tragedy might survive, Comedy, such as Aristophanes wrote, must lose its sacred privileges, and, with them, its reason for existing.", "511": "By the first law of its being, the Old Comedy was the sworn foe of all things which could undermine the sway of Dionysus, the god who not only inspires the poet, but protects his liberties.", "512": "And the nearer Tragedy stood to the original form which the Dionysiac cult had given to it, the closer was the kinship which Comedy felt with it.", "513": "For this reason Aeschylus represents, even better than Sophocles, the form of Tragedy with which the muse of Aristophanes was in spiritual accord ;", "514": "and Euripides represents everything which that muse abhors.", "515": "Euripides, who dwarfs the heroic stature, and profanes heroic lips with the rhetoric of the ecclesia

Dionysia against the very faith to which that festival was devoted, and whose poetry was the subtle solvent by which Comedy and Tragedy alike were destined to perish.", "517": "It was a happy fortune that, before its short life came to an end, the essence of Attic Comedy was so perfectly expressed by the great satirist who was also a great poet.", "518": "The genius of Aristophanes indeed transcends the form in which he worked ;", "519": "but it exhibits all the varied capabilities of that form.", "520": "He can denounce a corrupt demagogue or an unworthy policy with a stinging scorn and a force of righteous indignation which make the poet almost forgotten in the patriot.", "521": "He can use mockery with the lightest touch.", "522": "But it is not in denunciation or in banter that his most exquisite faculty is revealed.", "523": "It is rather in those lyric passages where he soars above everything that can move laughter or tears, and pours forth a strain of such free, sweet music and such ethereal fancy as it would be hard to match save in Shakespeare.", "524": "A poet who united such gifts brought keen insight and fine taste to the task of the critic.", "525": "In reading the Frogs, we do not forget that it is a comedy, not a critical essay.", "526": "And we allow for the bias against Euripides.", "527": "But no careful student of the play can fail to admire how Aristophanes seizes the essential points in the controversy between the two schools of Tragedy.", "528": "When Aeschylus has said that a poet ought to edify, Euripides rejoins (in effect), ' Are you edifying when you indulge in dark grandiloquence, instead of explaining yourself in the language of ordinary humanity ?'", "529": "Now observe the rejoinder of Aeschylus.", "530": "He replies, ' Great sentiments and great thoughts are suitably clothed in stately words.", "531": "Besides, it is natural that the demigods (τοὺς ἡμιθέους) should have grandeur of words ;", "532": "for their

right, too, when he enforces his point by referring to the stately costume which he had devised for Tragedy.", "538": "This was a visible symbol of the limit set to realism.", "539": "When Aristophanes passes from the ground of art to that of ethics, the justice of his criticism may be less evident to moderns, but here also he is substantially right from the Athenian point of view.",

contributed to tendencies setting in that direction.", "542": "Homer had been regarded by the Greeks as their greatest teacher, because the heroes were the noblest ideals of human life which they possessed.", "543": "Aeschylus and Sophocles, in their different ways, had preserved the Homeric spirit.", "544": "If the heroes once ceased to be ideals of human life, the ordinary Greek of the fifth century had no others.", "545": "To depose the heroes from their elevation above commonplace humanity was also to destroy an indispensable link between god and man in the popular religion.", "546": "But that religion was at the root of the Greek citizen's loyalty to the city.", "547": "In the smaller details of his polemic against Euripides, the comic poet is sometimes acute and just, sometimes excessively unfair.", "548": "We are not here concerned with such details.", "549": "The broad facts which claim our attention are simply these.", "550": "Attic Comedy, as such, was the natural foe of a tragic poet like Euripides.", "551": "Aristophanes clearly understood the artistic limits proper to Attic Tragedy.", "552": "He clearly saw where and how Euripides had transgressed them ;", "553": "he also saw that this error of Euripides in art was, for the Athens of his day, inseparable from a bad moral influence.", "554": "And Aristophanes can sum up his judgement by saying that Euripides,

d’anecdotes, raconte, on ne sait sur quelle autorité, qu’Anytus et Mélitus, voulant essayer l’effet de l’accusation qu’ils méditaient contre Socrate, avaient payé Aristophane pour le tourner en ridicule dans une de ses pièces, et animer le peuple contre lui.", "1360": "Dans cette supposition, la représentation des Nuéesaurait eu lieu peu de temps avant le procès, et les accusa teurs auraient profité de l’animosité publique, pour porter le coup décisif.", "1361": "Mais ce système est contredit par la date même de la représentation, que des témoignages authentiques fixent à la 1e année de

des Guêpes, jouées en 423 (89e olympiade, 2e année), Aristophane se plaint du mauvais succès des Nuées ;", "1368": "car on sait que les juges lui avaient préféré ses rivaux :", "1369": "le prix avait été donné au Pytina de Cratinus, et au Connus d’Amipsias.", "1370": "Ces mêmes plaintes, il les exhale dans la parabase des Nuées, telles que nous les avons au- jourd’hui ;", "1371": "en effet, après

"Ce qui précède suffit donc pour disculper Aristophane d’avoir vendu sa plume à Anytus et Mélitus ;", "1374": "il est à remarquer, d’ailleurs, que dans l’Euthyphron de Platon, écrit long-temps après cette comédie, il est parlé de Mélitus comme d’un jeune homme.", "1375": "Toutefois, si le poëte se trouve ainsi justifié d’imputations odieuses, nous ne prétendons pas l’absoudre complètement, quant au résultat.", "1376": "Ces incriminations mêlées de bouffonneries, purent préparer de loin une accusation plus sérieuse :", "1377": "les griefs articulés au procès, presque dans les mêmes termes que ceux de la comédie, sont toujours de corrompre la jeunesse, de mépriser les dieux de la patrie, et d’introduire des dieux étrangers.", "1378": "C’est ce que nous atteste encore l’apologie écrite par Platon.Quels motifs purent donc porter Aristophane à attaquer un sage, qui nous apparaît aujourd’hui comme l’auteur d’une grande révolution morale, comme le réformateur de l’humanité ?Il γ avait alors une guerre déclarée entre les philosophes et les poë'tes comiques ;", "1379": "ainsi aux partis politiques qui divisaient Athènes, se joignaient encore les partis littéraires.", "1380": "Les philosophes blâmaient le dévergondage et la licence obscène des comiques ;", "1381": "ceux-ci tour naient en ridicule les disputes subtiles de leurs adversaires.", "1382": "Les philosophes Hippon et Bæda avaient été attaqués par les poëtes Cratès et Diphile ;", "1383": "Eupolis n’épargnait pas les plaisanteries à Socrate, et Amipsias le joua dans une de ses comédies.", "1384": "Socrate, de son côté, ne dissimulait pas son mépris pour leurs bouffonneries licencieuses.", "1385": "Il était d’ailleurs ami d’Euripide, et l’opinion courut même qu’il l’aidait dans ses tragédies.", "1386": "Aristophane, qui ne ménageait pas Euripide, n’avait nulle raison de s’interdire, à l’égard du philosophe, ce que se permettaient d’autres poëtes.", "1387": "Quant à la question de savoir si dans les Nuées c’est la personne même de Socrate qu’il a voulu jouer, ou s’il le prend simplement comme un type général, comme le représentant des sophistes, rien ne s’oppose à ce qu’on prête à la fois l’une et l’autre intention à un esprit si riche en moquerie.Bien connu de la populace d’Athènes, Socrate faisait profession de discuter avec le premier venu, sur la place publique, ou dans les boutiques des barbiers et des cordonniers ;", "1388": "son extérieur, ses habitudes, la familiarité de son langage et de ses comparaisons, étaient une bonne fortune pour les poëtes comiques, qui, lorsqu’ils trouvaient le moyen de faire rire, ne se piquaient pas d’un extrême respect pour les personnes.", "1389": "Il n’était pas malaisé de lui prêter une teinte de ridicule, et Aristophane accumula sur lui une foule de traits dont les autres philosophes avaient bien à réclamer leur part.", "1390": "Ainsi se trouva confondu avec les sophistes celui qui était leur plus redoutable adversaire.", "1391": "Au
