AT COLONUS 67ELECTRA 199THE appearance of a new translation of the seven extant plays of Sophocles may appear almost like presumption, at a time when Professor Jebb's masterly edition, combining text, notes, and an English version, is gradually approach­ ing completion;", "5": "nor, indeed, would such a task have been undertaken by the translator, were not his own efforts solely directed towards replacing, without delay, the volume in Bohn's Classical Library, for which the publishers have for some time been seeking a substitute.", "6": "When they suggested this work to me, I pointed out, and they fully perceived, the disadvantage, under which any less well-known scholar would necessarily labour in following Professor Jebb over ground he had so recently and so thoroughly explored.", "7": "However, as a translation of Sophocles was required for their old­ standing series, and as further delay was undesirable, I consented to undertake the work.", "8": "Comparison between Jebb's great masterpiece of modern scholarship and my own humble effort will not, of course, be made by those qualified to offer an opinion;", "9": "his is essentially an edition, complete and exhaustive, for advanced students;", "10": "mine is merely one part of such an undertaking, produced, too, as well for the general reader as for the critical scholar.", "11": "Again, the necessarily long time, which has elapsed since Jebb's first volume appeared,-the “Œdipus Tyrannus,\" in 1883,—and the period, which must yet elapse before the edition is complete, coupled with the costliness of the work, offer, perhaps, some excuse for the production of a translation in a more popular form.", "12": "Having used Jebb's text as a basis for the following translation, I should wish, at the very outset, gratefully to record my heavy obligations to him.", "13": "To have neglected this latest recension of Sophocles would have been mere folly, though its very excellence has not infrequently caused me a feeling of deep dissatisfaction with my own attempts.", "14": "The consciousness, too, that in places my own version may seem to be a faint echo of the Professor's inimitable translation, has not by any means decreased my difficulties.", "15": "Wilful plagiarism", "16": "I can honestly disclaim;", "17": "acci­ dental similarities of expression may well be excused, for such cases do undoubtedly occur in work of this kind, even when one writer has never seen the book, from which he may appear to borrow.", "18": "Certain turns in translating become almost stereotyped in classical circles;", "19": "and in all versions, that aim at literal accuracy, there must, in the nature of things, be many verbal resemblances.", "20": "If it be necessary to give reasons for the selection of Jebb's text, one might shortly settle the matter by saying, that the universal chorus of approbation, which has greeted the periodical appearance of his volumes, is sufficient evidence that it is generally regarded as the best;", "21": "to have used any other, under these circumstances, would have argued either want of sense or want of appreciation.", "22": "But there is a further reason:", "23": "printed, as his volumes are, under the auspices of the Cambridge University Press, there can be little doubt, that, even apart from the intrinsic excellence of the work, it will ere long become the standard text for a large majority of English students.", "24": "So much has already been written elsewhere, and by more able critics, on Professor Jebb's methods, that little need be added here.", "25": "Suffice it to say, that his text contains far less of daring emendation, and far more of lucid correction,­ where correction is necessary,-than any of its predecessors;", "26": "it is conservative in the best sense,-no MSS.", "27": "reading having been lightly rejected, and no conjecture admitted without good reasons being given for its acceptance;", "28": "cases of hope­ less corruption have been noted, and temporary makeshifts quoted or provisionally adopted for what they arc worth;", "29": "in no single instance have difficulties been slurred over;", "30": "and the result is a text, which, without any wide divergence from authority, is completely intelligible.", "31": "And this presum­ ably is the kind of text, which any one, bent on translating an ancient classic, would naturally select.", "32": "Speaking of editions of Sophocles, Blaydes, in the preface to his edition, wrote:", "33": "\" Of English editions of Sophocles we cannot boast much\";", "34": "and in a similar strain we find Professor Kennedy saying:", "35": "\" An adequate edition of Sophocles remains yet to be achieved in England.\"", "36": "This reproach to English scholarship or diligence can never be urged again since the appearance, first of Professor Camp­ bell's edition, and now of Professor Jebb's, which bids fair to remain long without a rival.", "37": "It was also to supply this felt want that Blaydes produced his edition, which, deserv­ ing as it was of the gratitude of scholars at the time of its appearance, has now been pushed into the background by a newer school of criticism.", "38": "Blaydes' edition was too full of corrections of the text and conjectural readings to have more than an ephemeral existence.", "39": "It is true he proposed to himself for his guidance the famous dictum of Person :", "40": "\"", "41": "The first care of an editor ought to be to settle the text, so as to preserve a due medium between rashness and timidity\";", "42": "but it cannot fairly be said that Blaydes altogether succeeded in following these lines.", "43": "Two great merits he undoubtedly had:", "44": "he acted as a pioneer to all who should go over the same ground after him, often detecting errors, if not happily emending them;", "45": "and secondly, he has applied the following canon with good results,-the interpretation of Sophocles by himself, that is, by a careful study and comparison of his style and language.", "46": "Blaydes belonged to that school of critics, who assume an extensive and deep-seated corruption in all the existing MSS., and regard conjectural emendation as our only chance of restoring a text;", "47": "whereas the criticism, of which Paley, Campbell, and Jebb are, in recent times, among our most distinguished English exponents, considers it safer and wiser, as a general rule, to adhere closely to the written text, so long as sense, metre, and grammar permit it.", "48": "The followers of the first school, as Paley points out, reduce the text of an ancient author to little better than a field for the exercise of ingenious guessing;", "49": "and they run a risk of at last entirely losing the original words of the writer, and making emendations, not upon him, but upon previous emendations.", "50": "To translate from such a text would be hope­ less work, and would necessitate innumerable footnotes explanatory of the reading;", "51": "added to which, any work, based upon such a shifting foundation, would become obsolete in the very short period required for the growth of a new school of these wholesale correctors, who will have none of their predecessors' work, but start at once on a crusade of destruction against it, only to expose them­ selves to as certain a fate at the hands of others like them­ selves.", "52": "Having explained, then, why and how Jebb's text has been used, it remains for me to add a word on the footnotes appended to this translation.", "53": "These are both explanatory of the text and of the more obscure allusions.", "54": "Of the latter I need say nothing.", "55": "With regard to the former, they have, as a rule, been added only on such passages as are well known for textual corruption or difficulty.", "56": "Occasionally the Greek words have been cited in full, that those who have not Jebb's edition by them, and yet are tolerably familiar with the ancient language, may see the reading he has pre­ ferred, or be warned, where conjecture has been resorted to.", "57": "In the very few cases, where any departure from Jebb's text has been admitted, a note to that effect is appended, and his reading given as well.", "58": "Where two or more explanations of a difficult passage seem equally plausible, they have sometimes been all given;", "59": "for in a writer like Sophocles, who seems to aim at saying ordinary things in an unusual way, there will admittedly be cases, in which a final decision is well-nigh hopeless.", "60": "Emendations, which have by this time won general acceptance, have not been noticed, as they have practically become part of the received text.", "61": "In short, the aim has been to make these notes as few as seemed consistent with clearness, and yet to enable even those, who are using a different text, to see at a glance any striking variations from it, and, as far as may be, to put the best accepted explanations before them.", "62": "It should also be added that Professor Campbell's valuable edition of Sophocles has been consulted throughout, and much help derived from his sympathetic treatment of a difficult author.", "63": "Students of Sophocles have indeed little cause for com­ plaint nowadays, with two such works as Campbell's and Jebb's before them, issued respectively by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge,—sufficient guarantee, if the names of such scholars needed any such, for the high standard of their work.", "64": "The former of these, in an introductory essay, supplies practically a complete commentary to the chief “cruces ” in Sophocles;", "65": "and this, together with the same scholar's “Sophocles \" in the \" Classical Writers \" series of Macmillan and Co., will enable any student to approach the poet with a fair hope of understanding his meaning and realizing his beauties, and at the same time of getting to know all, that intelligent study in the past has done to eluci­ date his many obscurities of language and style.", "66": "For a list of editions and works bearing on Sophocles, ample information may be obtained from any of the follow­ ing

shall be fairly qualified to re­ construct his life even from rather scanty materials.", "125": "Now the long life of Sophocles, extending from B.C. 496 or 5 to 406 or 5, is coincident with scenes the

for supremacy between Athens and Sparta, unfolded them­ selves one by one before his eyes.", "129": "Death came to him at a singularly fortunate moment.", "130": "The battle of Arginusæ had restored to Athens some of her old prestige, and, though it was but a momentary success, the old poet did not live to see all hope finally extinguished by the disastrous defeat at Ægospotami.", "131": "What a

with many of whom so popular a poet as Sophocles was doubtless on friendly terms.", "142": "Little wonder then that his plays, the outcome as they were of a period so intellectually rich, exhibit that perfect workmanship and marvellous finish that have been the delight and despair of all succeeding dramatists.", "143": "Passing from the poet's surroundings to the actual facts of his personal life, we find not only that our authorities are extremely scanty, but also that much of what they tell us is little better than the doubtful gossip which ever pursues the steps of those who are something different from the mass.", "144": "An anonymous life of the poet, of uncertain date, a brief notice in Suidas, with certain incidental remarks scattered through the works of Athenæus, most garrulous of story-tellers, or gleaned from the pages of the accom­ plished Plutarch, are our main sources for the little that is related about Sophocles.", "145": "He was born in B.C. 496 or 5, at Colonus, an Attic deme of great natural beauty on the banks of the Cephissus, within easy walking distance of Athens.", "146": "His father, Sophilus or Sophillus by name, must have been a man of some means, though his exact employment is unknown ;", "147": "for he gave his son the very best education then obtainable.", "148": "And such skill did the son acquire in music, dancing, and gymnastics, and so naturally graceful was his figure, that he was chosen in B.C. 480 to lead the chorus of young Athenians in the triumphal dance round the trophy erected after the victory at Salamis.", "149": "Twelve years later comes a great epoch in his life.", "150": "It was the spring festival of the Dionysia, and Sophocles had entered the lists with the veteran Æschylus.", "151": "Public opinion was divided, and it was only after considerable delay that the Archon Eponymus, whose duty it was to select by lot the judges in the dramatic contest, hit upon the happy expedient of calling upon the general, Cimon, and his colleagues, who had just returned from Scyros with the bones of the hero Theseus, to take the oath and decide between the two.", "152": "They awarded the first prize to Sophocles, the second to Æschylus.", "153": "According to Plutarch, the old poet was so mortified at his defeat that he retired to Sicily;", "154": "but Aristophanes, in the “Frogs,\" depicts such a friendly feeling as subsisting between the two poets, that we might fairly surmise other reasons for the retirement of Æschylus from Athens.", "155": "What the plays were on this memorable occasion, we are not told.", "156": "Critics, who have gone deeply into the question, believe that Sophocles exhibited the \" Triptolemus,\" a play dealing with the Eleusinian mysteries;", "157": "but this is little more than guess­ work.", "158": "From the year B.C. 468 till his death, Sophocles enjoyed unshaken popularity, gaining no less than eighteen or twenty first prizes, and, even when defeated, never falling below the second place, and that, too, with such a formidable rival as Euripides, who began exhibiting in B.C. 455, a year after the death of Æschylus, and gained the first prize in B.C. 441, the very year before Sophocles made such a deep impression with his “Antigone.\"", "159": "It is said that, by way of compliment to the author of this play, Sophocles was chosen in that year, with Pericles and eight other generals, for the subduing of Samos.", "160": "He does not seem, however, to have evinced any taste for military service;", "161": "and Pericles is reported by Athenæus to have said of him, that he was a good poet, but a bad general.", "162": "Not only, then, must Sophocles have .", "163": "been brought into close contact with the greatest statesmen of the day, but it was also during this expedition, if we may credit our authorities, that he made the acquaintance of Herodotus, the father of historians.", "164": "That a close friendship did spring up between the two can scarcely be doubted, for there is a fragment of a hymn to Herodotus written by Sophocles;", "165": "and further, the striking parallelisms in their works suggest that one of them was more deeply influenced by the other than would have been the case, probably, if one had merely been familiar with the other's writings.", "166": "Of the latter part of the poet's life we have very few details.", "167": "It was the period of his greatest poetical activity, and perhaps for that very reason the least marked by any stirring incident.", "168": "To these later years, from B.C. 440 onwards, belong all his extant dramas.", "169": "Still, it would be unjust to suppose that he shirked his duties to the state.", "170": "On the contrary, we find among the ten πρόβουλοι, a committee appointed to provide for the public safety after the news of the disaster in Sicily, the name of Sophocles.", "171": "If this was the poet, which some have doubted, he would have been performing a somewhat arduous duty for his country at a very critical time and at a very advanced age.", "172": "Towards the close of his life, his peace was temporarily disturbed by the unfilial conduct of his elder son.", "173": "The circumstances were as follows:", "174": "Sophocles had married twice;", "175": "by his first wife he had a son Iophon ;", "176": "by his second.", "177": "a son Ariston.", "178": "Now Ariston had a son called Sophocles, for whom the old poet conceived so deep an affection, that Iophon suspected he would leave him an undue portion of his property.", "179": "Accordingly he brought his father before a jury of his tribe, charging him with senile imbecility and consequent incapacity to manage his estate,-a charge from which the old poet triumphantly cleared himself by reciting to his judges that magnificent eulogy on his native place which is contained in the \" CEdipus at Colonus.\"", "180": "All know the dramatic sequel:", "181": "how the judges rose in a body and escorted the poet to his home after severely rebuking his son.", "182": "This is all that we really know of the life of Sophocles.", "183": "Neither the date or manner of his death are precisely ascertained, but it probably took place either in B.C. 406 or 5, and as this would bring the poet to his ninetieth year, we shall not, perhaps, be very far wrong in attributing it rather to natural decay than to any of the more fanciful causes which later writers, with an eye to realistic effect, have delighted to invent.", "184": "So died Sophocles ;", "185": "full of years and full of honour, blest in his death as in his life, having seen his country in her triumph, and being spared the grief of her humiliation;", "186": "retaining his faculties to the end, and leaving behind him, if ever poet did, κτῆμα ἐς ἀεὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχοῆμα ἀκούειν.", "187": "The deep respect with which the memory of Sophocles was treated by Phrynichus and Aristophanes is no small evidence of his universal and well-deserved popularity;", "188": "both publicly made honourable allusion to him in the year following his death.", "189": "Why he was so popular is best explained, perhaps, by the epithet εὒκολος, \"a man of easy temper,\" which Aristophanes so emphatically applies to him.", "190": "In him, too, Nature and training had combined to produce almost the Greek ideal of a man,—a beautiful mind in a beautiful body,-and this happy combination, together with his even temperament, no doubt made it easy for him to gain many friends and make few enemies.", "191": "If it be worth noticing a charge afterwards brought against him, that he was too much addicted to sensual pleasures, a sufficient answer may be found to it in the following sentence of Mr. John Addington Symonds:", "192": "\"That a poet, distinguished for his physical beauty, should refrain from sensual enjoyments in the flower of his age, is not a Greek, but a Christian notion.", "193": "Such abstinence would have indicated in Sophocles mere want of inclination.\"", "194": "That he was no lifelong slave to his passions is proved by the passage in the \"Republic\" of Plato (p. 329), where Cephalus is telling Socrates how Sophocles, in his old age, rejoiced to have escaped from carnal pleasure as from \" a frantic and savage master.\"", "195": "These are scarcely the words of a sensualist.", "196": "A second charge brought against him is really scarcely better supported.", "197": "On a passage in the \" Peace \" of Aristo­ phanes (11. 696-700), some have built up a theory that Sophocles, in his old age, turned a second Simonides in his greed for gain.", "198": "It is, of course, conceivable, as these critics urge, that he may have found himself forced to work for pay in order to meet his expenses;", "199": "but the remark of Aristophanes is far more probably a piece of banter, not seriously meant;", "200": "and even were it otherwise, the evidence is far too slight to convict Sophocles of miserly avarice.", "201": "The feeling against taking money for intellectual work was undoubtedly strong in Greece;", "202": "this was one of the chief causes of prejudice against the Sophists, that they taught for pay;", "203": "and, this being so, we can scarcely believe that, had Sophocles offended in this respect, he would have retained his popularity to the end of his life, or that his country­ men would have paid him such extravagant honours after his death as to institute a solemn yearly sacrifice to his memory.", "204": "One hundred and thirty plays were anciently ascribed to him;", "205": "of these, seventeen were regarded as spurious by Aristophanes the critic of Byzantium ;", "206": "there were also other works that passed under his name.", "207": "Seven tragedies alone are extant, with a great number of fragments, mostly very short and unimportant.", "208": "These seven were generally sup­ posed to have been the poet's best work,-the \"Trachiniæ,” perhaps, excepted, in which there are not wanting traces of that inequality of composition noticed by ancient critics.", "209": "Too little is known about the order of their production for any dates to be given, save in

supposed parents, and was partly reassured ;", "236": "still, to set his own mind completely at rest, he started off secretly to consult the oracle of Delphi and learn the story of his birth.", "237": "Apollo gave him, however, no clear answer on this point, but thrilled him with amazement and horror by foretelling that he should murder his own father, marry his mother, and beget unnatural offspring.", "238": "His resolve is taken at once ;", "239": "he will never see Corinth and his parents any more.", "240": "Accordingly he turns his steps towards Thebes, taking the road through

surmised, CEdipus arrives at Thebes, where he finds the city, already distracted by the ravages of the Sphinx,-a monster sent by Hera to persecute the old home of her rival Semele,—plunged into utter
