Then Lucius remarked:", "2711": "\" These are about the most important of the theories current;", "2712": "but first of all, take in hand, if you please, the explanation de­ rived from the figure of the shadow ;", "2713": "for it is a cone, as though a great fire or light projected a mass, less indeed than a sphere, but still spherical in form, for which reason in eclipses of the moon the outlines of the darkened parts against the bright ones have their edges circular;", "2714": "for whatever sections a round thing coming in contact with another round thing, may either receive or produce, as they go off in all directions, they are made circular by reason of their resemblance [to what produced them].", "2715": "In the second place, I fancy you know that the moon is first eclipsed on the parts towards the east;", "2716": "whereas the sun is on those towards the west, because the earth's shadow moves to­ wards the west from the east.", "2717": "The sun and the moon, on the contrary, move towards the east.", "2718": "All this, visible facts enable us to discover, and may be understood without very lengthy explanations, and from them the shadow as the cause of the eclipse is established.", "2719": "For when the sun is eclipsed by being overtaken by, and the moon by meeting that which causes the eclipse, probably, or rather, necessarily, the sun' is first overtaken from behind, the moon from the front, for the occultation begins from that side where the object in front first casts the shadow, and the moon first casts it upon the sun from the west, as she is racing against him, but upon her he casts it from the east, be­ cause she is moving below in a contrary direction, from the east.", "2720": "Thirdly, then, consider the question of the duration, and of the extent of her eclipses.", "2721": "When she is eclipsed high in heaven and at her apogee she is obscured for only a short time, but being in her perigee and low when thus affected, she is greatly oppressed, and emerges with diffi­ culty from the shadow.", "2722": "And yet, when she is low, she is making the greatest movements, but when high the smallest of all.", "2723": "But the cause of the difference lies in the shadow, for it is broadest at the base, as all cones are, and contract­ ing gradually, at the top it ends in a sharp and fine point.", "2724": "Consequently, the moon entering into this shadow when she is low down, is caught by it in its largest circumference and passes through its deepest and darkest part, but when up high, just grazing the shadow, as though in shallow water, she quickly makes her escape.", "2725": "I shall pass over all that has been said with special reference to bases 2 and transits;", "2726": "because they admit the cause so far as possibility goes.", "2727": "But I return to the argument before me, that has ocular demonstration for its starting point.", "2728": "For we see that fire out of a shady place shows itself and shines abroad all the more;", "2729": "whether through the density of the obscured air not allowing of divergences and dispersions, but keeping together and compressing the element in one place;", "2730": "or else this is an affection of the sense [vision], just as hot things compared with cold seem hotter, and plea­ sures compared with pains seem more intense, even so bright things contrasted with dark become conspicuous, because they exaggerate their appearance through the op­ posite affections of the sense:", "2731": "the former supposition of the two is likely to be the more probable, for in the sunshine every sort of fire doth not only lose its brightness, but through yielding thereto becomes inoperative and duller;", "2732": "because the heat disperses and diffuses its proper force.", "2733": "If then the moon possesses an infantine and ineffective fire, being ‘a feminine star,' as these philosophers pretend, it befits her to be affected in none of the ways in which she is affected at present, but altogether the contrary of them all;", "2734": "she ought to appear where now she is hidden, and be hidden exactly where she now appears:", "2735": "that is to say, be hidden for the rest of the time as being obscured by the cir­ cumambient tether, but emerge and become visible every six months, and again every five, when she enters into the shadow of the earth.", "2736": "For the 365 revolutions of the ecliptic full moons contain 404 periods of six months, and the rest of five months each.", "2737": "It would therefore be neces­ sary that the moon should be visible at intervals of so many months, because she became conspicuous in the shadow;", "2738": "1 but she .... becomes eclipsed and loses her light, but recovers it again, when she emerges from the shadow, and often shows herself by day, as being anything rather than a fiery or star-like substance.", "2739": "\"XXI.", "2740": "Lucius having said this, Pharnaces and Apollonides in a way came into collision with each other [in their eager­ ness to answer him], but when Apollonides gave up the turn, Pharnaces continued, \" This fact does most of all prove the moon to be a fire or a star, for she is not entirely invisible during eclipses, but displays the hot-coal 1 and grim colour which is her own proper hue.\"", "2741": "But Apollonides stood firm with respect to the shadow, \"for [he said] the mathema­ ticians always so denominated the unillumined place, and that the heavens did not admit of ' shadow.’ \" \"", "2742": "This [said I] is rather the disputing captiously with a name than

that the moon, on coming into it .... and altogether,” added I, \" it is silly to say the shadow of the earth does not reach so far .... the shadow of the moon impinging upon the sight, and .... towards the earth, causes an eclipse of the sun.", "2743": "I will now turn to you, Phar­ naces, for that coal-like and glowing 2 colour, which you pretend is the natural complexion of the moon, is really that of a body that possesses density and depth;", "2744": "for in.", "2745": "things unsubstantial no remnant or vestige of flame is accustomed to remain;", "2746": "nor is there any food for

wide.'", "2748": "For the ‘ charcoal' is probably not fire, but an ignited sub­ stance, and affected by fire dwelling upon, and wearing itself out upon a mass which is both solid and possessed of durability;", "2749": "whereas the flames are but the lighting up and jets of an unsubstantial nutriment and material, speedily consumed by reason of its weakness.", "2750": "Conse­ quently, nothing could have been so convincing a proof that the moon is an earthy and dense substance, than if ' smouldering coal' were proper to her as her colour.", "2751": "But is it not the case, my dear Pharnaces, that moons in eclipse assume various colours;", "2752": "and mathematicians (astrologers) define these colours, and distinguish them according to the time and the season ?", "2753": "For instance, if the moon be eclipsed in the evening, she appears dreadfully black up to the third 1 and one-half hour, but if at midnight she emits this [just mentioned] purplish light, and fire, and flame-colour, whilst from the hour of morning2 and half an hour later, the blush rises on her face;", "2754": "and finally at daybreak she puts on a dark blue and cheerful complexion, from which in reality the poets and Empedocles style her the ‘Blue-eyed.'3", "2755": "When, therefore, we see the moon putting on so many different colours when in the shadow, they do not deal fairly in dwelling upon a single one of them, namely, the smoulder­ ing coal, which we really may say is the most uncongenial to her of them all;", "2756": "and is rather a mixture and remnant of the fire shining through the shadow round about her;", "2757": "but her natural colour [we define] to be dark-blue and earthy.", "2758": "For whereas here below shady places in the vicinity of lakes and rivers that catch the sun are similarly dyed and made brilliant in robes of purple, yea, even of scarlet 4 and give forth many various images of colour, through the reflections of the light, what wonder is it if the vast flood of shadow, falling as it were into a celestial ocean of light, not steady nor at rest, but agitated by stars infinite in number, and receiving mixtures and changes of all kinds, should extract different colours at different times, and give them out from the moon ?", "2759": "A star, or a fire, would not in the shadow show itself black, or glaucous, or dark blue ;", "2760": "but over mountains, or plains, or sea, many variations of colour from the sun go and come ;", "2761": "and he casts the lustre of the dye,1 tempered with shadows and with mists, as with the hues of the painter's palette ;", "2762": "whereof that of the sea, widely diffused, Homer hath given a name to, calling it ‘violet-coloured,’ 2 and wine-faced ocean,' and else­ where the ‘purple wave ;", "2763":

which Socrates of old told a fable, whether that he was hinting at this, or describing, it may be, some other creation.", "2767": "3", "2768": "For it is neither in­ credible nor astonishing if she, having nothing in herself that is corrupting or turbid, but extracting the pure light out of heaven, and being full of heat, not of a consuming and fierce fire, but one that is liquid and harmless, and consistent with her nature, should possess wondrous beau- ties of scenery, flame-coloured hills, zones of purple, gold and silver, not dug out from her bowels, but cropping up in abundance to the surface, or overlaid upon polished eminences.", "2769": "1", "2770": "And if the sight (vision) of these things penetrates through the shadow differently at different times, as far as us, by reason of some difference and varia­ tion of the surrounding medium (atmosphere), the moon doth not thereby lose the preciousness nor the holiness of her glory, which .... being held sacred by mankind, she is something more than ‘a turbid and dreggy fire,' as the Stoics pretend.", "2771": "Fire, however, with the Medes and Assy­ rians enjoys honours well suited to barbarians, who worship things hurtful

believe that] in the same way she too is opened out into vast gulfs, containing either water or darkened air, into which the sun's light doth not descend, or even touch, but falls short of them

reflected light, the water producing the reflection, and the Sun himself from whom the ray, falling upon the water, has been reflected.", "2803": "These points being confessed and evident, (the Stoics) re­ commend such as assert the earth to be illuminated by the moon,1 to demonstrate that the Sun shows himself (is reflected) in the moon in the same manner2 by night, when the reflection from him is produced.", "2804": "But as he does not appear then, they believe that the illumination takes place in some other way than by reflection:", "2805": "but if this be not so, then neither is the

reflection from every distance-for in so doing they are fighting against demonstration.", "2811": "But those who make out the moon to be a body, neither polished nor fluid like water, but ponderous and earthy, I understand how they borrow from the sun what the appearance is in her that meets the sight:", "2812": "for neither does milk produce the same kind of mirrors, 5 nor render back reflections (as the water), owing to the inequality and density of its particles:", "2813": "by what means, therefore, is it possible that the moon should send out from herself an image in the same way as the more brilliant surfaces of mirrors?", "2814": "And yet, even in these, if a cobweb, or rust, 6 or roughness should cover the focus from which the image is generated it is [not] 1 re­
