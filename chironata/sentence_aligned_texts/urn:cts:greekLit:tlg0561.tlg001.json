Fiction,\" will be useful.\"", "2": "The action of the romance is supposed to take place pre­ vious to the age of Alexander the Great, while Egypt was tributary to the Persian monarchs.", "3": "During that period a queen of Ethiopia, called Persina, having viewed at an amorous crisis a statue of Andromeda, gives birth to a daughter of fair complexion.", "4": "Fearing that her husband might not think the cause proportioned to the effect, she commits the infant in charge to Sisimithres, an Ethiopian senator, and deposits in his hands a ring and some writings, explaining the circumstances of her birth.", "5": "The child is named Chariclea, and remains for seven years with her reputed father.", "6": "At the end of this period he becomes doubtful of her power to preserve her chastity any longer in her native country;", "7": "he therefore determines to carry her along with him, on an embassy to which he had been appointed, to Oroondates, satrap of Egypt.", "8": "In that land he accidentally meets Charicles, priest of Delphi, who was tra- Telling on account of domestic afflictions, and to him he transfers the care of Chariclea.", "9": "Charicles brings her to Delphi, and destines her for the wife of his nephew Alca­ menes.", "10": "In order to reconcile her mind to this alliance, he delivers her over to Calasiris, an Egyptian priest, who at that period resided at Delphi, and undertook to prepossess her in favour of the young man.", "11": "About the same time, Theagenes, a Thessalian, and descendant of Achilles, comes to Delphi, for the performance of some sacred rite:", "12": "The­ ogenes and Chariclea, having seen each other in the temple, become mutually enamoured.\"", "13": "Calasiris, who had been engaged to influence the mind of Chariclea in favour of her intended husband Alcamenes, is warned in a vision by Apollo that he should return to his own country, and take Theagenes and Chariclea along with birD.", "14": "Henceforth his whole attention is directed to deceive Charicles, and effect his escape from Delphi.", "15": "Having met with some Phœnician merchants, and having informed the lovers of bis intentions, he sets sail along with them for Sicily, to which country the Phœnician vessel was bound ;", "16": "but soon after, passing Zacynthus, the ship is attacked by pirates, who carry Calasiris and those under his protection to the coast of Egypt.\"", "17": "On the banks of the Nile, Trachinus, the captain of the pirates, prepares a feast to solemnize his nuptials with Cha­ riclea;", "18": "but Calasiris, with

other pirates, espousing different sides of the quarrel, are all slain except Pelorus, who is attacked and put to flight by Theagenes.", "20": "The stratagem of Calasiris, however, is of little avail, except to himself:", "21": "for immediately after the contest, while Calasiris is sitting on a hill at some distance, Theagenes and Chariclea are seized by a band of Egyptian robbers, who conduct them to an establishment formed on an island in a remote lake.", "22": "Thyamis, the captain of the banditti, becomes enamoured of Chariclea, and declares an intention of espous­ ing her.", "23":

compelled to assume this character of sister. \"", "25": "The colony is speedily destroyed by the forces or the satrap of Egypt, who was excited to this act of authority by a complaint from Nausicles, a Greek merchant, that the banditti had carried off his mistress.", "26": "Thyamis, the captain of the robbers, escapes by flight, and Cnemon, a young Athenian, who bad been detained in the colony, and with whom Theagenes had formed a friendship during his con­ finement, sets out in quest of him.\"", "27": "Theagenes and Chariclea depart soon after on their way to a certain village, where they had agreed to meet Cnemon, but are intercepted on the road by the satrap's forces.\"", "28": "Theagenes is sent as a present to the King of Persia;", "29": "and Chariclea, being falsely claimed by

honours of the house to Cnemon in the landlord's absence.", "32": "Chariclea being recognised by Calasiris, Nausicles abandons the claim to her which he had advanced, and sets sail with Cnemon for

satrap could arrive to its succour, the Æthiopian army having appeared at its gates before any intelligence was received that it was in motion.", "4450": "Bagons, therefore, turned out of the road to Thebes, and took that of Syene.", "4451": "When he came near the place, he fell in with a troop of Æthiopians, who had been sent out to scour the country, and to ascertain the safety of the roads for the march of their own army.", "4452": "Overtaken by night, and ignorant of the ground, they had concealed themselves behind some bushes (in obedience to the orders given them), watching for the passing by of any prey which they might seize, and also providing for their own security.", "4453": "At break of day they perceived the approach of Bagoas and his company.", "4454": "They despised the smallness of their number, but let them all pass by, in order to assure themselves that there was no greater force behind;", "4455": "and then suddenly rushing from their concealment in the marsh, they pursued and attacked them with a great shout.", "4456": "Bagoas and his men, astonished at the sudden noise and assault, seeing from their colour that they were Ethiopians, and from their number (which amounted to near a thou­ sand light-armed men), that resistance was vain, did not await their approach, but took to flight.", "4457": "They retreated at first with some degree of order, to avoid the appearance of a complete rout.", "4458": "The enemy detached after them a bard of two hundred Troglodites.", "4459": "The Troglodites are a pastoral nation, on the borders of Arabia, of great natural agility, which they increase by exercise..", "4460": "They are unused to heavy armour, but, with slings and missile weapons, endeavour to make an impression upon the enemy at a distance, from whom, if they find them superior, they immediately retreat.", "4461": "The enemy do not take the trouble to pursue them, knowing them to be swift as the wind, and given to hide themselves in caverns, which they make their habitations.", "4462": "They, though on foot, soon overtook Bagoas and his flying squadron, and making use of their slings, wounded some of them from afar, yet, on their facing about, did not await their assault, but retreated headlong to their own comrades.", "4463": "The Persians seeing this, and perceiving the smallness of their number, ventured to attack them;", "4464": "and having easily repulsed them for a space, turned again, and putting spurs to their horses, continued their flight with slackened rein and with the utmost speed.", "4465": "Some, deserting the main body, and hurrying to a bend in the Nile, hid themselves under its banks.", "4466": "The horse of Bagoas fell with him;", "4467": "one of his legs was fractured with the fall, and being unable to move, he was taken prisoner.", "4468": "Theagenes and Chariclea, too, were made captives.", "4469": "They thought it dishonourable to desert Bagoas, who had shown them much kindness, and from whom they hoped more in future.", "4470": "They kept, therefore, by his side, dismounting from their horses, and voluntarily offered themselves to the enemy;", "4471": "Theagenes saying to Chariclea, \"This explains my dream:", "4472": "these are the Æthiopians into whose lands wo are fated to go:", "4473": "let us give ourselves up into their hands, and await an uncertain fortune with them, rather than expose ourselves to manifest danger with Oroondates.", "4474": "\"Chariclea thought she could now perceive herself to be led on by the hand of destiny:", "4475": "a secret hope of better fortune began to insinuate itself into her bosom, and she could not help considering those who attacked them as friends rather than enemies;", "4476": "but not venturing to disclose her presages to Theagenes, she contented herself with expressing her consent to his advice.", "4477": "When the Æthiopians approached, and observed Bagoas, from his features, to be a eunuch, and incapable of resist­ ance, and the others unarmed and in chains, but of extra­ ordinary grace and beauty, they inquired who they were.", "4478": "They made use of an Egyptian interpreter, whom they carried with them, who understood besides a little Persian, concluding that the prisoners spoke one or other of these tongues;", "4479": "for experience had taught them that a body detached as spies and scouts ought always to have some one with them who naturally speaks or understands the language of the country which they are sent to reconnoitre.", "4480": "Theagenes, who, from his long residence in the land, had acquired something of the Egyptian tongue, replied, that the eunuch was one of the chief officers of the Persian viceroy;", "4481": "that he himself and Chariclea were Grecians by birth, taken prisoners, first by the Persians, and now volun­ tary captives to the Æthiopians, as they hoped, under better auspices.", "4482": "The enemy determined to spare their lives, and to deliver them,

were prisoners in a foreign land, and on the verge of being brought out to a public and ignominious execution ;", "4488": "now they were being carried, or rather escorted, though in captive guise, by those destined, ere long, to be their subjects.", "4489": "Such was their present situation.", "4490": "SYENE was now closely blockaded, and on every side, as with a net, invested by the Æthiopian army.", "4491": "Oroondates, as soon as he was informed of the design and sudden approach of the enemy (who, having passed the ataracts, were pressing towards the place), using the utmost diligence and expedition, had contrived to throw himself into the city before their arrival;", "4492": "and after planting his engines and artillery upon the walls, awaited the attack, and made every preparation for a vigorous defence.", "4493": "Hydaspes, the king of Æthiopia, though be was deceived in the hope of surprising the town before they had any notice of his approach, invested it, however, on all sides, and surrounding it with a line of circumvallation, made for the present no attack, but sat down quietly before it, filling and exhausting the plains of Syene with myriads of men, beasts, and cattle.", "4494": "Here the party which has been men­ tioned brought their captives into his presence.", "4495": "He was delighted at the sight of the young people;", "4496": "his

of Æthiopia require, to the gods of our country, when we shall have subdued our foes.\"", "4500": "And having praised and rewarded the captors, he sent them, together with their prisoners, to the rear of the army, ordering the latter to be kept under a guard (many of whom understood their language), to be treated, attended, and provided for in the most careful and splendid manner, and especially to be preserved from all contamination, as destined to be sacred victims.", "4501": "He directed their iron chains to be taken off, and fetters of gold to be put on in their room—for this metal is used by the Æthiopians in the way in which other nations use iron.", "4502": "His commands were obeyed;", "4503": "and the lovers, when they saw their first chains taken off, began to entertain hopes of liberty, which were soon crushed by the appearance and application of the golden ones.", "4504": "Theagenes could not forbear smiling, and exclaimed \"", "4505": "Here is, indeed, a splendid mutation

by insulting speeches, determined no longer to continue the blockade, by which, the city might at last be taken, to the destruction of some and the escape of others:", "4510": "but, by a new and unusual way of assault, to involve the town, and its defenders, in one common and universal ruin.", "4511": "His plan of attack was this:", "4512": "he described a circle round the walls, which he divided into portions of ten cubits each, assigning ten men to every division, and ordering them to dig a wide and deep ditch.", "4513": "They dug it accordingly, while others, with the earth they threw out, raised a mound or wall parallel with, and nearly equal in height, to that of the place which they were besieging.", "4514": "The garrison made no attempt to hinder these operations—the besieging army was so nume­ rous, that they durst not venture on a sally—and the works were carried on at such a distance from the walls, as to be out of the reach of their missile weapons.", "4515": "When he had completed this part of his plan, with wonderful dispatch, owing to the multitude of men em­ ployed in it, and the diligence with which he urged on their labours, he proceeded to execute another work.", "4516": "He left a part of the circle, to the space of about fifty feet, plain and unfilled up.", "4517": "From each extremity of the ditch above de­ scribed, be extended a long mound down to the Nile, raising it higher and higher as it approached the river.", "4518": "It had the appearance of two long walls, preserving all the way the breadth of fifty feet.", "4519": "When he had carried on his lines so that they joined the river, he cut a passage for it.", "4520": "and poured its waters into the channel, which he had provided for them.", "4521": "They, rushing from higher into lower ground, and from the vast width of the Nile into the narrow channel, and confined by the mounds on each side, thundered through the passage and channel with a noise and impetuosity that might be heard at a great distance.", "4522": "The fearful sight and sound struck the ears and met the eyes of the astonished inhabitants of Syene.", "4523": "They saw the alarming circumstances in which they were, and that the view of the besiegers was, to overwhelm them with the waters.", "4524": "The trenches which surrounded, and the inundation which was now fast approaching, prevented their escaping out of the city, and it was impossible for them to remain long in it, without the extremest danger;", "4525": "they took measures, therefore, as well as they were able, for their own pro­ tection.", "4526": "In the first place, they filled up and secured every opening and crevice in the gates with pitch and tow;", "4527": "then they propped and strengthened the walls with earth, stones, and wood, heaping up against them anything which was at hand.", "4528": "Every one was employed;", "4529": "women, children, and old men;", "4530": "for no age, no sex, ever refuses labour when it is for the preservation of their lives.", "4531": "They who were best able to bear fatigue were employed in digging a subterraneous and narrow passage, from the city to the enemy's mound, which work was thus conducted:", "4532": "They first sunk a shaft near the walls, to the depth of five cubits;", "4533": "and when they had dug it below the founda­ tions, they carried their mine on forwards towards the bulwarks with which they wore inclosed, working by torch­ light;", "4534": "those who were behind receiving, in regular order, the earth thrown out from those who were before, and

outlet to the waters, in case they should reach the city;", "4536": "but the approach of the calamities which threatened them was too speedy for their endeavours to prevent it.", "4537": "The Nile, rolling through the channel which bad been prepared for it, soon reached the trench, overflowed it everywhere, and formed a lake of the whole space between the dyke and the walls;", "4538": "so that an inland town seemed like an island in the midst of the sea, beaten and dashed against on all sides by the waves.", "4539": "At first, and for the space of a day, the strength of the walls resisted;", "4540": "but the continued pressure of the waters, which were now raised to a great height, and penetrated deeply into an earth black and slimy, which was cleft in many places, from the summers heat, sensibly under­ mined the walls;", "4541": "the bottom yielded to the pressure of the top, and wherever, owing to the fissures in the ground, a settlement took place, there the walls began to totter in several places, menacing a downfall, while they who should have defended the towers were driven from their stations by the oscillation.", "4542": "Towards evening a considerable portion of the wall between the towers fell down;", "4543": "not so much, however, as to be even with the ground, and afford a passage to the waters, for it was still about five cubits above them;", "4544": "but now the danger of an inundation was imminent and most alarming.", "4545": "At this sight a general cry of horror and dismay arose in the city, which might be heard even in the enemy's camp— the wretched inhabitants stretched out their hands to the gods, in whom only they had hope, and besought Oroondates to send deputies with oilers of submission to Hydaspes, He, reduced to be the slave of Fortune, unwillingly listened to their entreaties;", "4546": "but he was entirely surrounded with water, and it being out of his power to send an officer to the enemy, he was reduced by necessity to this contrivance -he wrote down the purport of their wishes, tied it to a stone, and endeavoured, by means of a sling, to make it serve the pur­ pose of a messenger by traversing the waters;", "4547": "but his design was disappointed;", "4548": "the stone fell short, and dropped into the water before it reached the other side.", "4549": "He repeated the experiment several times.",

out their hands to the enemy, who stood on their works spectators of their distress, the miser­ able citizens implored their compassion by the most piteous gestures, and endeavoured to signify what was meant by their ineffectual stones and arrows-now clasping their hands together, and holding them forwards in a suppliant manner—now putting their arms behind their backs, in token that they submitted to servitude.", "4553": "Hydaspes understood their signs, and was ready to receive their submission—for great minds are easily inclined to clemency by the sight of a prostrate enemy-but he was desirous first to make trial of their intentions.", "4554": "He had already prepared some river-craft, which floating down the Nile, were drawn up near the mound:", "4555": "be chose ten of these,

the city observed the boats making for the part of the wall which had fallen down, and their spirits being sunk with their misfortunes, surrounded as they were with perils, they began to suspect and dread the designs of those who were coming for their preservation:", "4560": "for, in such ex­ tremity of danger, everything is a cause of suspicion and of fear..", "4561": "They began, therefore, to cast their darts and to shoot their arrows towards those who were in the boats:", "4562": "for men, who despair of safety, think even the shortest delay of destruction as so much gained.", "4563": "They flung their weapons, however, in such a manner as not to inflict wounds, but only to hinder the approach of the enemy.", "4564": "The Æthiopians returned the attack more in earnest, not knowing the intentions of the Persians:", "4565": "they wounded several of those who were upon the ramparts, some of whom tumbled over into the water.", "4566": "The engagement was pro­ ceeding with greater warmth, one party endeavouring merely to repulse;", "4567": "the other to attack, when an old man, of great authority among the Syenæans, who stood upon the wall, thus addressed his fellow-citizens:",

they were ready and disposed to resist and fight, if by any means he could escape, and put himself at their head.", "4689": "He now proceeded to put into practice his treacherous intent, for upon his arrival at Elephantine, finding them in such a disposition as he could wish, he led them out without delay, and proceeded with all expedition against the enemy;", "4690": "relying chiefly for success

plain glistening as he moved along, with gold and silver armour.", "4693": "The rays of the rising sun falling directly upon the advancing Persians, shed an indiscribable brightness to the most distant parts, their own armour flashing back a rival brightness.", "4694": "The right wing was composed of native Medes and Persians—the heavy armed in front-behind them the archers, unincumbered with defensive arms, that they might with more ease and readiness perform their evolutions, protected by those who were before them.", "4695": "The Egyptians, the Africans, and all the auxiliaries were in the left wing.", "4696": "To these likewise were assigned a band of light troops, slingers and archers, who were ordered to make sallies, and to discharge their weapons from the flanks.", "4697": "Oroondates himself was in the centre, splendidly accoutred and mounted on a scythed chariot.*", "4698": "He was surrounded on either side by a body of troops, and in front were the barbed cavalry, his confidence in whom had principally induced him to hazard an engagement.", "4699": "These are the most warlike in the Persian service, and are always first opposed, like a firm wall, to the enemy.", "4700": "The following is the description of their armour-A man, picked out for strength and stature, puts on a helmet which fits his head and face exactly, like a mask ;", "4701": "covered completely down to the neck with this, except a small opening left for the eyes, in his right hand he brandishes a long spear-his left remains at liberty to guide the reins-a scimitar is suspended at his side;", "4702": "and not his breast alone, but his whole body also, is sheathed in mail, which is composed of a number of square separate plates of brass or steel, a span in length, fitting over each other at each of the four sides, and hooked or sewn together beneath, the upper lapping over the under;", "4703": "the side of each over that next to it in order.", "4704": "Thus the whole body is inclosed in an imbricated scaly tunic, which fits it closely, yet by contrao­ tion and expansion allows ample play for all the limbs.", "4705": "It is sleeved, and reaches from neck to knee,* the only part left unarmed being under the cuishes, necessity for the seat on horseback so requiring.", "4706": "The greave extends from the feet to the knee, and is connected with the coat.", "4707": "This defence is sufficient to turn aside all darts, and to resist the stroke of any weapon.", "4708": "The horse is as well protected as his rider;", "4709": "greaves cover his legs, and a frontal † confines his head.", "4710": "From his back to his belly, on either side, hangs a sheet of the mail, which I have been describing, which guards his body, while its looseness does not impede

of an iron man.", "4713": "His long and pointed spear extends far before him, and is sustained by a rest at the horse's neck, the butt being fixed in another at his croupe.", "4714": "Thus the spear does not give way in the conflict, but assists the band of the horseman, who has merely to direct the weapon, which pressing onwards with mighty power pierces every obstacle, sometimes transfixing and bearing off by its impulse two men at once.", "4715": "With such a force of cavalry and in such order, Croon­ dates marched against tho enemy, keeping the river still behind him, to prevent his being surrounded by the Æthio­ pians, who far exceeded him in number, Hydaspes, Oil the other hand, advanced to meet him.", "4716": "He opposed to the Medes and Persians in the right wing, his forces from Meröe, who were well accoutred, and accustomed to close fighting.", "4717": "The swift and light-armed Troglodites, who were good archers, and the inhabitants of the cinnamon region,* he drew up to give employment to those posted on the left.", "4718": "In opposition to the centre, boasting as they did of their barbed cavalry, he placed himself, with the tower-bearing elephants, the Blemmyæ, and the Seres, giving them instruc­ tions what they were to do when they came to engage.", "4719": "Both armies now approached near, and gave the signal for battle;", "4720": "the Persians with trumpets, the Æthiopians with drums and gongs.", "4721": "Oroondates, cheering on his men, charged with his body of horse.", "4722": "Hydaspes ordered his troops to ad­ vance very slowly, that they might not leave their elephants, and that the enemy's cavalry, having a longer course to take, might become exhausted before the conflict.", "4723": "When the Blemmyæ saw them within reach of a spear's cast, the horsemen urging on their horses for the charge, they pro­ ceeded to execute their monarch's instructions.", "4724": "Leaving the Seres to guard the elephants, they sprang out of the ranks, and advanced swiftly towards the enemy.", "4725": "The Persians thought they had lost their senses, seeing a few foot presume to oppose themselves to so numerous and so formidable a body of horse.", "4726": "These latter galloped on all the faster, glad to take advantage of their rashness, and confident that they should sweep them away at the first onset.", "4727": "But the Blemmyæ, when now the phalanx had almost reached them, and they were all but touched by their spears, on a sudden, at a signal, threw themselves on one knee, and thrust their heads and backs under the horses, running no danger by this attempt, but that of being tram­ pled on :", "4728": "this manœuvre was quite unexpected, many of the horses they wounded in the belly as they passed, so that they no longer obeyed tho bridle, but became furious, and throw their riders;", "4729": "whom, as they lay like logs, the Blemmyæ pierced in the only vulnerable part, tho Persian cuirassier being incapable of moving without help.", "4730": "Those whose horses were not wounded proceeded to charge the Seres, who at their approach retired behind the elephants, as behind a wall or bulwark.", "4731": "Here an almost total slaughter of the cavalry took place.", "4732": "For the horses of the Persians, as soon as the sudden retreat of the Seres had discovered these enormous beasts, astonished at their unusual and formidable appearance, either turned short round and galloped off, or fell back upon the rest, so that the whole body was thrown into confusion.", "4733": "They who were stationed in the towers upon the elephants (six in number, two on either side (except towards the beast's hind quarters), discharged their arrows as from a bulwark, so continuously and with such true aim, that they appeared to the Persians like a cloud.", "4734": "Fighting upon unequal terms against mailed warriors, and depending upon their skill in archery, so unfailing was their aim at the sight holes.", "4735": "of the enemy, that you might see many galloping in confusion through the throng, with arrows projecting from their eyes.", "4736": "Some, carried away by the unruliness of their horses to the elephants, were either trampled under foot or attacked by the Seres and the Blemmyæ, who rushing out as from an ambush, wounded some, and pulled others from their horses, in the melee.", "4737": "They who escaped unhurt retreated in disorder, not having done the smallest injury to the elephants :", "4738": "for these beasts are armed with mail when led out to battle, and have, besides, a natural defence in a hard and rugged skin, which will resist and turn the point of any spear.", "4739": "Oroondates, when he saw the remainder routed, set the example of a shameful flight;", "4740": "and descending from his chariot, and mounting a Nysæan horse,t galloped from the field.", "4741": "The Egyptians and Africans in the left wing were ignorant of this, and continued still bravely fighting, receiv­ ing, however, more injury than they inflicted, which they bore with great fortitude and perseverance;", "4742": "for the inha­ bitants of the cinnamon region, who were opposed to them, pressed and confounded them by the irregularity and activity of their attacks, flying as the Egyptians advanced, and dis­ charging‡ their arrows backward as they fled.", "4743": "When the Africans retreated, they attacked them, galling them on all the flanks, either with slings or little poisoned* arrows.", "4744": "These they fixed around their turbans, the feathers next their heads, the points radiating outwards;", "4745": "and drawing them thence as from a quiver, they, after taking a sudden spring forward, shot them against the enemy, their own bodies being naked, and their only clothing this crown of arrows.", "4746": "These arrows require no iron point;", "4747": "they take a serpent's back bone, about a foot and a half in length, and after straightening it, sharpen the end into a natural point, which may perhaps account for the origin of the word arrow.", "4748": "†The Egyptians resisted a long time, defending themselves from the darts by interlocking shields-being naturally patient, and bravely prodigal of their lives, not merely for pay but glory;", "4749": "perhaps, too, dreading the punishment of runaways.", "4750": "But when they heard that the barbed cavalry, the strength and right hand‡ of their army, was defeated­ that the viceroy had left the field, and that the Medes and Persians, the flower of their foot, having done little against, and suffered much from, those to whom they were opposed, had followed his example, they likewise, at last, gave up the contest, turned about, and retreated.", "4751": "Hydaspes, from an elephant's back, as from a watch tower, was spectator of his victory;", "4752": "which when he saw decided, he sent messengers after the pursuers, to stop the slaughter, and to order them to take as many prisoners as they could, and particularly, were it possible, Oroondates.", "4753": "Success crowned his wishes, for the Ethiopians extending their numerous lines to a great length on each side, and curving the extremities till they surrounded the Persians, left them no way to escape but to the river.", "4754": "Thus the stra­ tagemwhich Oroondates had devised against the enemy they found turned against themselves, multitudes being forced into the river by the horses and scythed chariots, and the confusion of the crowd.", "4755": "The viceroy had never reflected, that by having the river in his rear be was cutting off his own means of escape.", "4756": "He was taken prisoner with Achæmenes the son of Cybele.", "4757": "This latter informed of what had hap­ pened at Memphis, and dreading the resentment

tumult.", "4758": "lie did not, however, give him a mortal wound, and the attempt was instantly revenged, for he was transfixed with an arrow by an Æthiopian, who watched, as he had been commanded, over the safety of the viceroy;", "4759": "and who saw, with indignation, the treacherous attempt of one, who, having escaped the enemy, took the opportunity presented by fortune, to wreak his revenge against his commander.", "4760": "Oroondates was brought before Hydaspes, faint and bleeding;", "4761": "but his wound was soon staunched by the remedies applied, the king being resolved, if possible,

Nile, in his path, greeting him with songs of victory.", "4776": "He entered the city on an elephant, as on a triumphal chariot, and immediately turned his thoughts to holv matters and thanksgivings to the gods.", "4777": "He made inquiries concern­ ing everything worthy ot his curiosity, particularly about the origin of the feasts of the Nile.", "4778": "They shewed him a tank which served as a nilometer, like that which is at Memphis, lined with polished stone, and marked with degrees at the interval of every cubit.", "4779": "The water flows into it under ground, and the height to which it rises in the tank, shews the general excess, or deficiency, of the inundation, according as the degrees are covered or left bare.", "4780": "They shewed him dials, which, at a certain season of the year, cast no shade at noon;", "4781": "for, at the summer solstice, the sun is vertical at Syene, and darts its rays perpendicularly down, so that the water,!", "4782": "at the bottom of the deepest

frequently turned her eyes upon Daphnis;", "5685": "again he appeared to her beautiful as he was playing upon his pipe, and the attributed his beauty to the melody, so that taking the pipe she played upon it, in order, if possible, to appear beautiful herself.", "5686": "She persuaded him to bathe again, she looked at hint when in the bath, and while looking at him, touched his skin:", "5687":

in his presence, bathed her own person, fair and radiant with beauty, and needing no bath to set off its comeliness.", "5927": "Then, after gathering the flowers which the season afforded, they crowned the statues with garlands, and suspended Dorco's pipe as a votive offering to the Nymphs.", "5928": "Having done this they returned to look for their flocks, which they found lying on the ground neither feeding nor bleating, but looking about, as if waiting in suspense for their re-appearance.", "5929": "When they came in view of them, and called to them in their usual manner, and sounded their pipes, the sheep got up, and began to feed, while the goats skipped about, and bleated as if exulting at the safety of their herdsman.*", "5930": "But Daphnis could not attune his soul to joy;", "5931": "after seeing Chloe naked, and her formerly con­ cealed beauties unveiled, he felt an inward pain as though preyed upon by poison.", "5932": "His breath went and came as though he were flying from some pursuer;", "5933": "and then it failed, as though he were exhausted with running.", "5934": "Chloe had come from the bath with redoubled charms, and the bath was thus more fatal to Daphnis than the ocean.", "5935": "As for him­ self, he attributed his feelings to being, in fancy, still among the thieves,†—rustic as he was, and as yet ignorant of the thievish tricks of love.", "5936": "IT was now the middle of autumn :", "5937": "-the vintage* was at hand, and every one was busy in the fields.", "5938": "One† pre­ pared the wine-presses, another cleansed the casks, and another twisted the osiers into baskets.", "5939": "Each had a sepa­ rate employ-in providing short pruning hooks, to cut the grapes;", "5940": "or a heavy stone, to pound them;", "5941": "or dry vine branches, previously well bruised, to serve as torches, so that the must might be carried away at night.", "5942": "Daphnis and Chloe neglected for a time their flocks and mutually assisted one another.", "5943": "He carried the clusters in baskets, threw them into the wine-presses, trod them, and drew off the wine into casks ;", "5944": "she prepared their meals for the grape-gatherers, brought old wine for their drink, and plucked off the lowest bunches.", "5945": "Indeed, all the vines in Lesbos were of lowly growth, and instead of shooting up­ wards, or twining around trees, they spread their branches downwards, which trailed along, like ivy, so close to the ground, that even an infant might reach the fruit.", "5946": "The women, who, according to the custom at this festival of Bacchus, and birth of the vine, were called from the neighbouring villages to lend their assistance, all cast their eyes upon Daphnis, and exclaimed that he was equal in beauty to Bacchus himself.", "5947": "One of the most forward of these wenches gave him a kiss, which inflamed Daphnis, but sadly grieved poor Chloe.", "5948": "On the other hand, the men who-were treading the wine- press indulged in all manner of jests about Chloe, they danced round her as furiously as so many Bacchanals round a Bacchante, and exclaimed that they would gladly become sheep to be fed by her hand.", "5949": "These compliments delighted Chloe, but tormented poor Daphnis.", "5950": "Each of them wished the vintage over, that they might return to their usual haunts, and instead of this discordant din might hear the sound of their pipe, and the bleating of their sheep.", "5951": "In a few days the vines were stript,—the casks were filled,—there was no longer any need of more hands, they therefore drove their flocks to the plain.", "5952": "In the first place, with sincere delight they went to pay their adoration to the Nymphs, and carried vine-branchés with clusters of grapes on them, as first-fruit offerings from the vintage.", "5953": "Indeed, they never had hitherto passed by the Grotto without some token of respect, but always saluted them as they passed by with their flocks to their morning pasture, and when they returned in the evening, they paid their adoration, and presented, as an offering, either a flower, or some fruit, or a green leaf, or a libation of milk.", "5954": "This piety, as we shall see, had in the end its due reward.", "5955": "At the time we speak of, like young hounds just let loose, they leaped about, they piped, they sang, and wrestled and played with their goats and sheep.", "5956": "While thus sporting and enjoying themselves, an old man, clothed in a coarse coat of skin, with shoes of undressed leather on his feet, and with a wallet (which, by the by, was a very old one) at his back, came up, seated himself near them, and addressed them as follows :", "5957": "— \"I who now address you, my children, am PHILETAS.", "5958": "I have often sung the praises of the Nymphs of yonder Grotto—I have often piped in honour of Pan, and have guided my numerous herd by the music of my voice.", "5959": "I come to acquaint you with what I have seen and heard.", "5960": "I have a garden* which I cultivate with my own hands, and in which I have always worked, since I became too old to tend my herds.", "5961": "In it is every production of the different seasons;", "5962": "in spring it abounds with roses, lilies, hyacinths, and either kind of violets;", "5963": "in summer with poppies, pears, and apples of every sort;", "5964": "and now in autumn, with grapes, figs, pomegranates, and green myrtles.", "5965": "A. variety of birds fly into it every morning, some in search of food, and some to warble in the shade;", "5966": "for the over­ arching boughs afford thick shade, and three fountains water the cool retreat.", "5967": "Were it not inclosed with a wall, it might be taken for a natural wood.", "5968": "As I entered it to- day, about noon, I espied a little boy under my pomegra­ nates and myrtles, some of which he had gathered ;", "5969": "and was holding them in his hands.", "5970": "His complexion was white as milk, his hair a bright yellow, and he shone as if he had just been bathing.", "5971": "He was naked and alone, and amused him­ self with plucking the fruit with as much freedom as if it had been his own garden.", "5972": "Apprehensive that in his wantonness he would commit more mischief and break my plants, I sprang forward to seize him, but the urchin lightly and easily escaped from me, sometimes running under rose.", "5973": "trees, and sometimes hiding himself like a young partridge under the poppies.\"", "5974": "I have frequently been fatigued with catching my suck.", "5975": "ing kids, or my new-dropt calves;", "5976": "but as to this mischievous creature, in perpetual motion, it was utterly impossible to lay hold of him.", "5977": "Old as I am I was soon weary with the pursuit;", "5978": "so, leaning on my staff for support, and keeping my eyes on him lest he should escape, I asked him to what neighbour he belonged, and what he meant by gather­ ing what grew in another person's garden.“", "5979": "He made no reply, but approaching very near me, smiled sweetly in my face, and pelted me with myrtle-berries, and (I know not how) so won upon me, that my anger was appeased.", "5980": "I intreated him to come close to me, and assured him that he need not be afraid, swearing by the myrtles, by the apples, and by the pomegranates of my garden, that I wished only to give him one kiss,.", "5981": "for which he should ever afterwards have liberty to gather as much fruit, and to pluck as many flowers as he pleased.“", "5982": "Upon hearing me thus address him, he burst into a merry laugh, and with a voice sweeter than that of the swallow or the nightingale, or of the swan when grown aged like myself, he replied:", "5983": "'I grudge you not a kiss, Philetas, for I have more pleasure in being kissed, than you would have in growing young again;", "5984": "but consider whether the gift would suit your time of life;", "5985": "for, old as you are, one kiss would not satisfy you, nor prevent you from running after me, while if even a hawk, an eagle, or any other swifter bird, were to pursue me it would pursue in vain.", "5986": "I am not the child which I appear to be ;", "5987": "but I am older than SATURN, ay, older than TIME himself.", "5988": "I knew you well, Philetas, when you were in the flower of your youth, and when you tended your widely-scattered flock in yonder marsh.", "5989": "I was near you, when you sat beneath those beech-trees, and were wooing your Amaryllis :", "5990": "I was close to the maiden, but you could not discern mo.", "5991": "I gave her to you, and some fine boys, who are now excellent husband­ men and herdsmen, are the pledges of your love.", "5992": "At this present time I am tending Daphnis and Chloe like a shep­ herd;", "5993": "and when I have brought them together in the morning, I retire to your garden:", "5994": "here I disport myself among your flowers and plants, and here I bathe in your fountain.", "5995": "Through mo it is that your flowers and shrubs are so beauteous, for the waters, which have bathed me, refresh them.", "5996": "Look now, if any of your plants be broken down!—see, if any of your fruit be plucked !-examine whether the stalk of any flower be crushed -or the clearness of any one of your fountains be disturbed !", "5997": "and rejoice that you alone, in your old age, have bad the privilege of beholding the boy who is now before you.'", "5998": "With these words he sprang like the youngling of a nightingale among the myrtles, and climbing from bough to bough ascended through the foliage to the summit of the tree.", "5999": "I observed wings upon his shoulders, and between them a tiny bow,.", "6000": "and arrows;", "6001": "but in a moment I could neither see him nor them.", "6002": "Unless I have grown grey in vain, unless I have got into my dotage in growing old, you may rely on me, when I assure you, that you are consecrate to LOVE, and . that you are under his peculiar care.", "6003": "\"Daphnis and Choe were delighted, but they regarded what they had heard as an amusing story rather than a sober fact;", "6004": "and inquired ot Philetas who and what this LOVE could be ?", "6005": "whether he were a boy or a bird ?", "6006": "and of what powers he was possessed ? “", "6007": "My young friends,\" said Philetas, “ he is a god, young, beautiful, and ever on the wing.", "6008": "He rejoices, therefore, in the company of youth, ho is ever in search of beauty, and adds wings to the souls of those he favours.*", "6009": "He has

lowing circumstance spread tumult and confusion through­ out their neighbourhood.", "6076": "Some rich young men of Methymnn, who had formed a pleasure party for passing the vintage-season out of town, launched a small vessel, employing their servants as rowers, and shaped their course towards the fields of Mitylene, which lie near the sea-coast.", "6077": "They knew that there was an excellent harbour for them, with every thing adapted for their accommodation, as the shore was adorned with handsome houses, with baths, with gardens, and with groves, some of which were the productions of nature, and some of art.", "6078": "Here the party arrived, and drew their boat into a safe place, after which they committed no acts of mischief, but amused themselves in various ways, with rod and line angling for rock-fish, which were found under the different promontories, or hunting the hares, which, terrified by the noise of the grape gatherers, had fled towards the shore, and capturing them by means of dogs and nets.", "6079": "Part of their amusement also was to set snares for birds:", "6080": "many wild ducks, wild geese and bustards were caught, so that their sport supplied their table in a great measure;", "6081": "and whatever addition they wanted was easily procured from the labourers in the fields, who were paid more than its worth for everything which they supplied.", "6082": "Their chief inconvenience was want of bread and wine, and a good lodging at night;", "6083": "for as it was late in the autumn, they did not think it safe to sleep on board their boat, but in appre­ hension of storms, usual at this season, were ,,'ont to draw it up on shore.", "6084": "It so happened that a countryman had broken the old rope to which the stone was suspended for crushing his grapes after they had been trodden in the wine-press, and being in want of another to supply its place, had come clandestinely down to the sea-shore, and taking the cable from the boat, which was left without any one to watch it, had quietly conveyed it home to supply his need.", "6085": "The young Methymnæans, in the morning, made inquiries after their rope;", "6086": "but as no one confessed the theft, after venting their reproaches on this breach of hospitality, they launched their boat, and left that part of the coast.", "6087": "After sailing rather more than a league, they landed on the estate where Daphnis and Chloe dwelt.", "6088": "It appeared to them to be a good country for hare-hunting.", "6089": "Having no rope to serve as a cable, they twisted some vine-branches as a substi.", "6090": "tute, and tied the head of their boat to the shore:", "6091": "then let loose the dogs to scent about in the places most likely for game, and fixed their nets.",

coast, approached the boat and gnawed the branches which were fastened as a cable.", "6093": "At the same moment a swell set in, owing to the breezes blowing from the mountains.", "6094": "The motion of the waves began to carry off the boat, and, at length, bore it out to sea.", "6095": "The l\\lethymnæans saw the accident :", "6096": "some of them ran in great haste down to the shore:", "6097":

for the wind increased, and the boat was driven down the current.", "6100": "When the Methym­ næans found themselves thus deprived of it, and of the con­ siderable property which it contained, they inquired for the goat-herd, and finding him to be Daphnis, they beat him severely and stripped him.", "6101": "One of them took a dog-leash, and bending Daphnis’ arms behind his back, was preparing to bind him.", "6102": "Poor Daphnis, smarting with his beating, roared out for assistance :", "6103": "he called upon all his neighbours, but upon Lamon and Dryas in particular.", "6104": "The old men

they, “ to hunt, and fastened our boat to the shore with some vine-branches, while we roamed about with our dogs in search of game.", "6111": "In the meantime, this young man’s goats came down to the coast and ate the fastening of our boat, which has proved the loss of it.", "6112": "You yourself, saw it driven out to sea, and what valuables think you it had on board ?", "6113": "Why, store of clothes and of dog-gear, and of money—money enough to have purchased all these fields around us.", "6114": "In return for what we have lost, we have surely a right to carry off this heedless goatherd,

such a barking, and like so many wolves driving my sheep from hill and dale down to the sea.", "6120": "The poor brutes eat the vine branches;", "6121": "no wonder, for they could find no grass, nor shrubs, nor thyme upon the sands.", "6122": "The sea and the winds destroyed the boat;", "6123": "let the storm bear the blame and not my goats.", "6124": "They say, that they had left their clothes

into tears, which moved all his countrymen with compassion.", "6127": "Philetas, the judge, swore by Pan and the Nymphs, that neither Daphnis nor his goats were in fault;", "6128": "that only the sea

bind him.", "6130": "The villagers irritated at such behaviour, full upon them as thick as starlings or rooks, and rescued Daph­ nis, who now began to fight in his own defence.", "6131": "In a very short time the Mitylenæans, by dint of their clubs, put the strangers to flight, and did not desist from the pursuit, till they had driven them into a different quarter of the island.", "6132": "While they were engaged in the pursuit, Chloe led Dapin­ nis gently by the hand to the grotto of the Nymphs ;", "6133": "their she washed the blood from his face and nostrils, and taking a slice of bread

townsmen, and in­ treated them to take up arms to avenge their cause, which they represented in their own way, altogether concealing the real truth of the matter, for fear of being laughed at for having been so soundly beaten by a few shepherds.", "6140": "They accused the people of Mitylene of having seized their boat, as if it belonged to an enemy, and of plundering it of all its contents.",

in milking and making cheese, told her the good news of their approaching wedding, kissed her openly, as though she were already his wife, and not by stealth as he used to do, and began to assist her

destroy its beauty.", "6771": "He was aware that should he venture to cut down the trees, the noise would betray him, he determined therefore to vent his rage against the flowers, so waiting till it was dark, he climbed over the hedge, and like a wild-boar, rooted up some, broke others, and trampled upon every flower.", "6772": "Having done this, he went away unobserved.", "6773": "When Lamon came the next morning he was about to water his flowers with the streams which had been conducted from the fountain, but seeing the whole spot laid waste, and the damage of such a kind as some

him all particulars.", "6809": "A stylus listened with great commiseration, and when he came to the garden, and saw the havoc which had been committed, he promised to plead their excuse with his

offerings of Daphnis, and immediately betook himself to hare hunting, as was natural in a young man abounding in wealth, nursed in luxury, and who had come into the country merely for some change in his amusements.", "6814": "Gnatho* being a fellow whose whole science consisted in eating and drinking to excess, and who was nothing, in fact, but a compound of gluttony, drunkenness, and sensuality

attempt upon Daphnis, thinking easily to gain over a mere shepherd youth.", "6816": "Having formed this determination, instead of going to hunt with Astylus, he proceeded to the spot where Daphnis was feeding his flock, under pretence of looking at the goats, but in reality to gaze upon their master.", "6817": "In order to gain his goodwill, he began by praising the appearance of the animals, and requested him to play a pastoral tune upon his pipe, adding, that by his influence he could soon obtain his freedom.", "6818": "Having in this manner put him at his ease, he watched his oppor­ tunity, and when Daphnis was driving home his herd at night, he ran up and kissed him, and then went on to make proposals to him.*", "6819": "For some time the youth did not understand his meaning, but when at last he did, he laid him prostrate with a blow;", "6820": "for he was in liquor, and hardly able to stand;", "6821": "and then left him sprawling, in need not of a boy whose beauty he might admire,

the country,-to Ceres, to Bacchus, to Pan, and to the Nymphs, and caused to be prepared one common bowl for all present.*", "6831": "During the following day he inspected Lamon's labours, and when he saw the fields well ploughed, the flourishing condition of the vines, and the beauty of the garden (for Astylus had taken the blame about the flowers on himself), he was very much delighted, praised

driven to despair, his love changes into hate and urges him to take vengeance upon the obstacle to his desires;", "8412": "and supposing be has the power to do this with impunity, the very fact of being free from fear deepens his resentment and urges him on to his revenge.\"", "8413": "In the midst of our deliberation some one hastily entered, and informed us that Leucippe while walking about had suddenly fallen down, and lay there wildly rolling her eyes.", "8414": "We hurried to her, and finding her still lying on the ground, we asked what ailed her?", "8415": "No sooner did she see me,

the rudder and the hook,. sailors' cabins and labourers' huts, a resort for fishes and a resting-place for oxen;", "8462": "where but lately a ship sailed, is seen a cultivated plain, and anon the cultivated plain becomes a watery space ;", "8463": "for the Nile periodically comes and goes, and the Egyptians count the days and anxiously await the inundation, while the river on his part keeps to his appointed time, regulates the rising of his waters, and never exposes himself to the imputation of unpunctuality.", "8464": "Then comes the rivalry between the land and water;", "8465": "each exerts its power against the other;", "8466": "the water strives to flood the land, and the land does its endeavour to absorb the fertilizing water;", "8467": "in the end, conquest can be assigned to

when the Nile retires, the lakes formed by its inundation continue filled with watery mud ;", "8469": "over these the inhabitants can either wade on foot or pass in boats, each of which will contain one person;", "8470": "any other kind would be imbedded in the mud, but those which they employ are so light† as to require very little water, and should none be found they take them on their backs,

rochers escarpés les chèvres trop pétulantes ;", "90": "quelquefois l’un d’eux surveillait les deux troupeaux, pendant que l’autre s’ébattait et jouait gaiement.", "91": "Leurs jeux étaient jeux de bergers et d’enfants :", "92": "elle, recueillant de côté et d’autre des brins de jonc, en tressait un piège à cigale, et, tout occupée de ce soin, ne s’inquiétait plus de ses moutons ;", "93": "lui,

ensemble leur lait, leur vin, et mettaient en commun ce qu’ils avaient apporté de la maison pour leurs repas.", "95": "On eût plutôt vu les brebis et les chèvres paître séparément, que Chloé séparée

fosses larges d’une orgye, profondes de quatre.", "100": "Ils emportèrent et répandirent au loin la plus grande partie des déblais ;", "101": "puis, étendant sur l’ouverture de longues branches

faibles que brins de paille, et montré clairement que ce n’était pas terrain solide, mais trompeuse apparence.", "103": "Cependant quoiqu’ils eussent fait bon nombre de ces fosses et sur les collines

des aboiements furieux, s’élancèrent sur lui comme sur un loup.", "277": "Avant que la surprise lui eût permis de se relever entièrement, ils l’avaient entouré et le mordaient à belles dents à travers la peau.", "278": "Honteux de se découvrir et garanti par la peau qui le cachait, il resta d’abord tapi sans mot dire dans les broussailles ;", "279": "mais lorsque Chloé, après un premier moment d’effroi, causé par sa vue, eut appelé Daphnis à son secours, lorsque les chiens eurent déchiré la peau et le mordirent lui-même, il se mit à crier de toute sa force, appelant à son aide et la jeune

hardis manèges de l’amour, qu’ils ne virent qu’une facétie pastorale dans cette peau dont il s’était affublé.", "284": "Sans lui en vouloir aucunement, ils essayèrent même de le consoler et ne le quittèrent qu’après l’avoir reconduit par la main une partie du chemin.XXII.", "285": "Après un pareil danger, Dorcon, tiré non, comme on dit, de la gueule du loup, mais de celle du chien, alla soigner ses blessures.", "286": "Quant à Daphnis et à Chloé, ils eurent bien de la peine, jusqu’à la nuit, à rassembler leurs chèvres et leurs brebis.", "287": "Effrayées par la peau du loup,

suivre gaiement le son de la flûte, à se rassembler sur un simple battement de mains ;", "289": "mais alors la peur leur avait fait tout oublier.", "290": "A grand’peine les trouvèrent-ils en les

sur le midi, pendant que les troupeaux reposaient à l’ombre, Chloé s’endormit sans y prendre garde.", "324": "Daphnis la voyant ainsi, pose sa flûte, et la contemple do tous ses yeux, sans pouvoir se rassasier ;", "325": "car il n’avait plus alors nulle honte.", "326": "En mêmé temps il murmurait doucement en lui-même :", "327": "« Comme ses yeux dorment !", "328": "comme sa bouche respire.",

tête, et Daphnis rire de sa crainte, elle sa rassura et frotta ses yeux qui voulaient dormir encore.", "344": "En ce moment la cigale cachée dans son sein se mit à chanter semblable à une suppliante

retourner à leurs quartiers accoutumés et entendre, au lieu de ces cris discordants, le son de la flûte ou le bêlement de leurs troupeaux.", "458": "Aussi, quelques jours après, lorsque les vignes furent vendangées, que les tonneaux eurent reçu le vin doux, et qu’il ne fut plus besoin du secours de tant de bras, ils se remirent à conduire leurs troupeaux aux champs.", "459": "Pleins de joie,

rendre.", "461": "Toujours, en commençant la journée, ils les venaient saluer, et ils les adoraient encore en quittant le pâturage.", "462": "Toujours ils leur apportaient quelque offrande, fleurs,

suis fatigué à courir après de petits veaux nouveau-nés ;", "486": "mais là c’était bien autre chose ;", "487": "nul moyen de le prendre.", "488": "Fatigué, car je suis bien vieux, je m’appuyai sur mon bâton, et tout en veillant à ce qu’il ne pût s’échapper, je lui demandai à qui de nos voisins il était, et pourquoi il venait ainsi fourrager dans le jardin d’autrui.", "489": "Il ne me répondit rien, mais vint se placer près de moi, et se prit à me sourire le plus doucement du monde, en me lançant des grains de myrte ;", "490": "si bien que, je ne sais comment, je me trouvai tout charmé et incapable de me fâcher davantage.", "491": "Je le priai de venir dans mes bras, sans plus rien craindre ;", "492": "je lui jurai par mes myrtes que je le laisserais aller, que je lui donnerais pommes

brisais mes flûtes de dépit de ce qu’elles charmaient mes vaches obéissantes et n’attiraient pas à moi Amaryllis.", "539": "Car il n’y a aucun remède à l’amour, ni breuvage, ni manger, ni paroles

l’autre.", "571": "Quant au troisième remède, se coucher tout nus, ils n’osèrent.", "572": "C’était chose par trop hardie, non seulement pour une jeune fille, mais même pour un chevrier.", "573": "La nuit suivante se passa encore sans sommeil, à songer à ce qu’ils avaient fait, à regretter ce qu’ils avaient négligé ;", "574": "nous nous sommes baisés ;", "575": "rien ne sert :", "576": "nous nous sommes étreints ;", "577": "je n’y ai trouvé aucun soulagement.", "578": "Se coucher est donc le seul remède de l’amour ;", "579": "il le faut essayer aussi ;", "580": "pour sûr il doit y avoir là

fit d’elle-même.XI.", "590": "Assis côte à côte sous une cépée de chêne, ils avaient commencé à goûter la douceur des baisers, et s’enivraient de volupté sans pouvoir s’en rassasier.", "591": "Sous l’étreinte de leurs bras enlacés, leurs bouches se pressaient plus étroitement encore.", "592": "Dans l’ardeur de ces embrassements, Daphnis attira Chloé un peu trop vivement ;", "593": "elle se coucha à demi sur le côté, et il se laissa aller avec elle, pour suivre sa bouche et ne rien perdre du baiser.", "594": "Reconnaissant là une image de leur songe, ils demeurèrent longtemps couchés ainsi et comme liés ensemble.", "595": "Mais ne sachant rien au delà, s’imaginant que c’était là le dernier terme des jouissances amoureuses, ils consumèrent dans ces vaines étreintes la plus grande

roseau, ils pêchaient, du haut d’un cap suspendu sur la mer, les poissons qui fréquentent les rochers.", "604": "Tantôt avec des chiens et des filets, ils prenaient les lièvres chassés des vignes par le bruit des vendangeurs.", "605": "Ou bien ils chassaient aux oiseaux et prenaient au lacet les oies sauvages, les outardes, les canards ;", "606": "tout en se divertissant, ils fournissaient aux

vin et le coucher, car ils ne trouvaient pas sûr, en automne, de cou cher à la mer ;", "609": "ils tiraient donc leur barque à terre, de peur de quelque tourmente pendant la nuit.XIII.", "610": "Il arriva qu’un paysan, ayant besoin d’une corde à soulever la meule du pressoir, pour remplacer la sienne qui était usée, descendit secrètement au bord de la mer, trouva la barque non gardée, détacha

reproches à leurs hôtes, et se mirent en mer.", "613": "Après avoir parcouru quelques trente stades, ils prirent terre aux champs où se tenaient Daphnis et Chloé ;", "614": "car il leur sembla qu’il y avait là une belle plaine à chasser le lièvre.", "615": "Comme ils n’avaient pas de corde pour amarrer, ils prirent de longues tiges d’osier vert, les tressèrent en forme de corde et attachèrent leur barque à terre par l’extrémité de la poupe.", "616": "Ensuite ils lancèrent leurs chiens et tendirent les toiles aux passages qui leur parurent les plus favorables.", "617": "Les chiens, courant çà et

bateau et rongèrent l’osier vert qui le retenait attaché.XIV.", "619": "La mer était alors quelque peu agitée par le vent qui descendait des coteaux.", "620": "Le bateau détaché, la vague en refluant l’entraîna insensiblement et le porta au large.", "621": "Dès que les Méthymniens s’en aperçurent, les uns coururent à la mer, les autres rappelèrent leurs chiens.", "622": "Tous criaient en même temps, tant et si bien que de toutes parts on accourut des champs voisins à leur appel.", "623": "Mais rien n’y fit ;", "624": "car, le vent ayant fraîchi, la barque fut emportée au gré du flot avec une irrésistible rapidité.", "625": "Les Méthymniens, qui perdaient par là une valeur considérable, se mirent en quête du gardien des chèvres ;", "626": "ils trouvèrent Daphnis, et commencèrent à le battre et à le dépouiller.", "627": "Déjà même l’un d’eux avait saisi la laisse d’un des chiens et la lui passait autour des bras comme pour le lier.", "628": "Le malheureux criait sous les coups ;",

champs, s’interposèrent aussitôt et demandèrent qu’on s’expliquât mutuellement sur les faits.XV.", "631": "Cet avis unanimement adopté, on choisit pour arbitre le bouvier Philétas.", "632": "C’était le plus vieux des assistants, et il avait dans le pays une réputation bien établie d’impartialité.", "633": "Les Méthymniens exposèrent les premiers leurs griefs, clairement, succinctement, par-devant le bouvier juge.", "634": "« Nous sommes venus sur cette plage avec l’intention de chasser.", "635": "Après avoir attaché notre barque avec de l’osier vert, nous l’avons laissée sur le rivage, et nous sommes allés avec nos chiens en quête du gibier.", "636": "Pendant ce temps, les chèvres de celui-ci sont descendues vers la mer, ont brouté l’osier et détaché la barque.", "637": "Vous l’avez vue

chiens !", "641": "quelle quantité d’argent !", "642": "Avec la charge on eût pu acheter tous ces champs.", "643": "Comme dédommagement nous demandons à emmener cet homme, ce méchant chevrier, qui mène paître ses chèvres à la mer, comme s’il était marin.", "644": "»XVI.", "645": "Ainsi parlèrent les Méthymniens.", "646": "Quant à Daphnis, il était en assez tristes dispositions, grâce aux coups qu’il avait reçus.", "647": "Cependant, voyant Chloé devant lui, il ne s’inquiéta plus de rien et parla ainsi :", "648": "« Je garde les chèvres comme je le dois :", "649": "jamais un seul des

mal dressés courent partout, aboient affreusement ;", "652": "ils ont, semblables à des loups, chassé mes chèvres des collines et des plaines vers la mer.", "653": "Elles ont mangé l’osier ?", "654": "soit !", "655": "mais aussi n’avaientelles sur le sable ni gazon, ni thym, ni arbousier.", "656": "Mais le bateau a été perdu, grâce au vent et à la mer ?", "657": "C’est là l’affaire du mauvais temps, et non de mes chèvres.", "658": "Mais il y avait des habits, de l’argent.", "659": "— Quel homme de sens croira qu’un bâtiment chargé de tant de choses eût une amarre d’osier.", "660": "»XVII.", "661": "A ces mots, Daphnis se mit à pleurer et fit grand’pitié à tous les villageois ;", "662": "si bien que Philétas, l’arbitre de la querelle, jura Pan et les Nymphes que ni Daphnis, ni les chèvres n’avaient aucun tort ;", "663": "que la faute était à la mer et au vent qui n’étaient point de son ressort.", "664": "Les Méthymniens, fort peu convaincus par ces paroles de Philétas,

poursuivre qu’après les avoir relancés au delà des limites de leur territoire.XVIII.", "668": "Pendant qu’ils donnaient ainsi la chasse aux Méthymniens, Chloé eut tout le loisir de conduire Daphnis auprès des Nymphes :", "669": "elle lava son visage tout souillé de sang qu’un coup avait fait jaillir du nez ;", "670": "puis elle tira de sa besace un morceau de pain avec une tranche de fromage et les lui donna à manger.", "671": "Mais ce qui valait mieux que tout le reste pour le réconforter, ce fut un baiser de ses tendres lèvres, baiser plus doux que le miel.XIX.", "672": "Tel fut le danger

contusions en échange de leur gaieté, convoquèrent l’assemblée des citoyens, se posèrent en suppliants et réclamèrent vengeance.", "675": "Ils se gardèrent bien de rien dire de la vérité, de peur de prêter à rire d’avoir été tant et si bien houspillés par des pâtres.", "676": "Tout au contraire, ils accusèrent les Mityléniens d’avoir pris leur bateau et pillé, comme en temps de guerre, tout ce qu’il contenait.", "677": "Les Méthymniens, persuadés par leurs blessures qu’ils disaient vrai, jugèrent convenable de venger des jeunes gens appartenant à leurs premières familles ;", "678": "ils votèrent-aussitôt la guerre contre les Mityléniens, sans déclaration préalable, et ordonnèrent à leur général de mettre dix vaisseaux à la mer pour aller ravager les côtes de Mitylène :", "679": "car,

rameurs il se dirigea vers la région maritime de la Mitylénie.", "682": "Là, il enleva force troupeaux, du blé et du vin en abondance, — car la vendange finissait à peine, — sans compter bon nombre d’hommes occupés aux divers travaux.", "683": "Il cingla en particulier vers les champs que fréquentaient Daphnis et Chloé, y descendit à l’improviste et pilla tout ce qu’il trouva devant lui.",

ennemis, il s’était caché dans le creux d’un vieux hêtre.", "687": "Chloé, au contraire, était aux champs ;", "688": "poursuivie par l’ennemi, elle se réfugia suppliante auprès des Nymphes et pria les soldats de l’épargner, elle et ses bêtes, en considération des déesses.", "689": "Mais ce fut peine perdue.", "690": "Les Méthymniens, après raille dérisions aux statues, emmenèrent les troupeaux, et

leur course à terre.", "748": "Ayant rencontré un promontoire avancé sur la mer, dont l’extrémité formait un croissant à l’intérieur duquel le flot était plus calme que dans aucun port, il y fit jeter l’ancre, mais à distance du rivage, de peur que les habitants ne pussent, de la côte, rien tenter contre aucun de ses bâtiments ;", "749": "puis il laissa les Méthymniens se réjouir et s’ébattre en toute tranquillité.", "750": "Comme ils avaient tout en abondance, grâce à leur butin, ils se mirent à boire et à jouer ;", "751": "chacun était en fête comme après une victoire.", "752": "Mais au moment où le jour cessait, quand la nuit mit fin aux réjouissances, la terre soudain parut tout en feu ;", "753": "un bruit lointain de rames se fit entendre sur les flots, comme à l’approche d’une

gloire à Pan, des prodiges plus étranges encore apparurent sur l’un et l’autre élément ;", "802": "les vaisseaux des Méthymniens se mirent à voguer avant qu’on eût retiré les ancres ;", "803": "un dauphin, bondissant sur les flots, conduisait le vaisseau amiral.", "804": "En même temps l’harmonieuse et douce mélodie d’une flûte de Pan précédait les troupeaux ;", "805": "moutons et chèvres

feuillée, il lui demanda comment elle avait échappe à de si nombreux ennemis.", "813": "Elle lui raconta tout en détail :", "814": "le lierre autour des cornes des chèvres, les hurlements des moutons, les branches de pin sur sa tête, la terre en feu, le bruit sur la mer, la flûte de Pan chantant alternativement la guerre et la paix ;", "815": "les terreurs de la nuit, son ignorance de la route, la mélodie qui l’avait dirigée.", "816": "Daphnis, reconnaissant l’effet de ce que les Nymphes lui avaient promis en songe et l’intervention de Pan, lui raconte de son côté tout ce qu’il a vu, ce qu’il a entendu ;", "817": "comment, se mourant de douleur, il a été rendu à la vie par les Nymphes ;", "818": "puis il l’envoie chercher Dryas et Lamon, avec tout ce qui est nécessaire pour un sacrifice.",

avoir couronné de pin le plus beau bouc du troupeau, ils le conduisirent près du pin consacré à Pan.", "829": "Là ils firent des libations de vin, invoquèrent le Dieu, immolèrent la victime, la suspendirent et l’écorchèrent.", "830": "Quand les chairs furent cuites et rôties, ils les placèrent près de là, sur un lit de feuillage, au milieu de la prairie.", "831": "La peau, offrande pastorale

répandue ;", "834": "Chloé chanta, Daphnis joua de la flûte.XXXII.", "835": "Ils s’étaient assis et avaient commencé leur festin, lorsque le hasard amena près d’eux le bouvier Philétas.", "836": "Il

;", "841": "comment ils gardaient les troupeaux quand ils étaient jeunes, comment ils avaient échappé à maintes descentes de pirates.", "842": "L’un se vantait d’avoir tué un loup, l’autre que Pan

habileté et à jouer de la flûte en l’honneur du Dieu auquel la flûte est chère.", "845": "Il y consentit, et, tout en se plaignant de ce que la vieillesse ne lui laissât plus d’haleine, il prit la flûte de Daphnis.", "846": "Mais, appropriée à la bouche d’un enfant, elle se trouva trop petite pour faire montre de beaucoup de savoir.", "847": "Il envoya donc Tityre chercher la sienne à sa maisonnette, éloignée de dix stades.", "848": "L’enfant jeta aussitôt sa jaquette et courut, léger comme un faon.", "849": "Pendant ce temps, Lamon proposa de leur conter l’histoire de la flûte de Pan

gracieux, et déploya devant eux toutes les ressources d’un art consommé.", "868": "Il joua les airs qui conviennent à un troupeau de bœufs, ceux avec lesquels on mène les chèvres, ceux auxquels se plaisent les brebis :", "869": "une harmonie douce pour les moutons, grave et forte pour les bœufs, aiguë et claire pour les chèvres ;", "870": "en un mot, il imita toutes les flûtes avec une seule.XXXVI.", "871": "Pendant que tous, doucement couchés et sous le charme, l’écoutaient en silence, Dryas se leva, le pria de jouer un air bachique et se mit à danser une danse de pressoir.",

cacher dans la forêt en guise de marais.", "880": "Daphnis prit alors la grande flûte de Philétas et en tira des sons douloureux, comme les plaintes d’un amant, puis des chants passionnés, comme pour toucher son cœur, puis un air de rappel comme s’il l’eût cherchée ;", "881": "si bien que Philétas, transporté d’admiration, se leva pour l’embrasser, et, après l’avoir baisé, lui fit cadeau de sa flûte, en priant les Dieux que Daphnis la laissât à un successeur tel que lui.", "882": "Daphnis consacra à Pan la petite flûte dont il s’était servi jusque-là ;", "883": "il embrassa Chloé comme s’il

Nymphes, puis le dieu Pan, ils allèrent s’asseoir sous le chêne et y jouer de la flûte ;", "890": "puis ils se baisèrent l’un l’autre, s’enlacèrent, se couchèrent à terre, mais sans rien faire de plus.", "891": "Quand ils furent relevés, ils songèrent à manger et burent ensemble du vin mêlé de lait.XXXIX.", "892": "Tout cela les ayant échauffés et rendus plus hardis, ils se mirent à contester d’amour, et peu à peu ils en vinrent à se jurer une fidélité mutuelle.", "893": "Daphnis alla sous le pin et attesta Pan qu’il ne saurait vivre sans Chloé, ne fût-ce qu’un seul jour.", "894": "Chloé, dans l’antre des Nymphes, les prit à témoin du serment qu’elle fit à Daphnis de vivre et de mourir avec lui.", "895": "Telle était l’innocence de Chloé, telle sa simplicité de jeune fille, qu’au sortir de la grotte elle voulut que Daphnis lui fît un nouveau serment :", "896": "« Daphnis, lui ditelle, Pan est un dieu volage et inconstant ;", "897": "il a aimé Pitys, il a aimé Syrinx, sans

cavaliers, et on les envoya par terre sous la conduite d’Hippasos ;", "910": "car la voie de mer paraissait dangereuse aux approches de l’hiver.II.

une ville voisine.", "915": "Aussi n’avaient-ils rien tant à cœur que de rendre tout le butin et de rétablir en toute sécurité les bons rapports entre les deux villes, sur terre et sur mer.", "916":

son gouver nement.", "919": "Au bout de deux jours, le messager revint avec ordre pour le général de recevoir les restitutions et de rentrer à la ville sans commettre aucun acte d’hostilité.", "920":

laboureurs.", "924": "Des torrents impétueux se précipitaient des montagnes, l’eau se gelait, les arbres semblaient ensevelis sous les frimas ;", "925": "la terre était partout cachée, excepté au bord

réunissait autour d’un grand feu, et là les uns filaient le lin, les autres tissaient le poil des chèvres ou fabriquaient des pièges pour les oiseaux.", "929": "On n’avait plus d’autre souci que de donner aux bœufs de la paille dans la crèche, aux chèvres et aux brebis du feuillage à l’étable, aux porcs dans le têt du faîne et du gland.IV.", "930": "Cette nécessité qui retenait tout le monde à la maison était loin de déplaire aux autres laboureurs et bergers.", "931": "Ils y trouvaient quelque relâche à leurs travaux, mangeaient bien dès le matin et faisaient long somme.", "932": "Si bien

lierre.", "952": "Daphnis prit donc prétexte d’aller chasser ces oiseaux ;", "953": "il partit la besace pleine de gâteaux au miel, sans oublier la glu et les collets, afin de ne donner aucune prise au doute.", "954": "Quoique la distance fût au plus de dix stades, la neige, qui n’était pas encore durcie, lui donna beaucoup de mal ;", "955": "mais rien n’est impraticable à l’amour, pas même le feu, l’eau, la neige de Scythie.VI.", "956": "Il arriva donc tout d’une course à la cour de Dryas.", "957": "Après avoir secoué la neige de ses pieds, il plaça ses collets et étendit la glu sur de longs rameaux ;", "958": "puis il s’assit, attendant avec anxiété les oiseaux et surtout Chloé.", "959": "Quant aux oiseaux, ils vinrent en grand nombre :", "960": "il en prit tant, qu’il eut fort à

table, les grives et les merles dont il était chargé.", "993": "Il raconta comment, s’ennuyant de garder le logis, il était allé à la chasse aux oiseaux ;", "994": "comment il les avait pris, soit au collet, soit à ia glu, en profitant de leur avidité pour les baies de myrte et de lierre.", "995": "On loua son ingénieuse activité et on l’engagea à prendre sa part de ce qu’avait laissé le chien.",

grotte, puis à Pan et au pin ;", "1046": "ensuite au chêne, où ils s’assirent, surveillant leurs troupeaux et se baisant l’un l’autre.", "1047": "Puis ils allèrent chercher des fleurs pour en tresser des couronnes aux Dieux.", "1048": "Mais les fleurs à peine commençaient à naître sous l’haleine des Zéphyrs et la douce chaleur du soleil.", "1049": "Cependant ils trouvèrent des violettes, des narcisses, du muguet et toutes les fleurs que porte le premier printemps ;", "1050": "après que Daphnis eut trait les chèvres et les brebis, ils couronnèrent de guirlandes les statues des Dieux et

saillissaient, de ci, de là, chacun de son côté.", "1055": "Plus ardents encore, les boucs poursuivaient les chèvres, bondissaient amoureusement autour d’elles et se les disputaient.", "1056": "Chacun

raison Daphnis et Chloé, jeunes, tourmentés de désirs, et depuis longtemps déjà en quête de l’amour ;", "1059": "tout ce qu’ils entendaient les enflammait ;", "1060": "ils se fondaient à ce spectacle et cherchaient, eux aussi, quelque chose de plus que le baiser et les embrassements.", "1061": "Daphnis surtout, qui avait grandi et s’était formé dans les loisirs d’un hiver passé au logis, la baisait avec fureur, l’étreignait avidement dans ses bras, et était devenu de tout point plus hardi, plus entreprenant.XIV.", "1062": "Il suppliait Chloé de lui accorder tout ce qu’il voulait, de se

élevée, ils cinglèrent dans une baie profonde en forme de croissant, leur voix s’entendit plus clairement, les chants des rameurs arrivèrent plus distincts à la terre ;", "1065": "car un ravin profond placé à l’extrémité de la plaine, semblable à un instrument qui multiplie les sons, renvoyait, comme un écho fidèle, tous les bruits qu’il recevait.", "1066": "On entendait d’une part le bruit des rames, de l’autre le chant des rameurs ;", "1067": "ils se mêlaient sans confusion et charmaient délicieusement l’oreille.", "1068": "Au moment où expiraient les sons venant de la mer, la terre en renvoyait comme un écho, qui leur succédait et les multipliait sans jamais se confondre avec eux.XXII.", "1069": "Daphnis, pour qui cela n’avait rien de nouveau, ne regardait que la mer et prenait un vif plaisir à voir la barque courir, plus rapide qu’un oiseau, sur la plaine liquide :", "1070": "il s’efforçait de retenir quelques-uns des airs pour les jouer ensuite sur sa flûte.", "1071": "Quant à Chloé, qui entendait pour la première fois ce qu’on appelle écho, tantôt elle portait les yeux vers la mer, quand les matelots chantaient, tantôt elle se retournait vers la forêt, cherchant qui leur répondait.", "1072": "Quand elle vit qu’après leur passage le silence se faisait aussi dans le ravin, elle demanda à Daphnis s’il y avait un second bras de mer derrière le promontoire, si un autre vaisseau le traversait, monté par d’autres matelots qui chantaient la même chose, si enfin tous s’étaient tus en même temps.", "1073": "Daphnis, après un doux sourire et un baiser plus doux encore, passa sur la tête de Chloé la couronne de violettes et se mit à lui raconter la fable d’Écho, réclamant, pour prix de ce récit, dix autres baisers.XXIII.", "1074": "« Il y a, chère Chloé, plusieurs

don des Muses, elle parle, elle imite tous les sons, comme autrefois la jeune fille, la voix des hommes et des Dieux, les instruments, le cri des bêtes fauves ;", "1083": "elle imite même les accords de Pan quand il joue de la flûte ;", "1084": "et lui, il saute, il court à travers les montagnes ;", "1085": "une seule pensée le poursuit, découvrir quel est le disciple qui se dérobe à ses regards.", "1086": "» Le conte de Daphnis terminé, Chloé lui donna, non pas dix baisers, mais bien plus encore ;", "1087": "car Écho avait répété presque toutes ses paroles, comme pour attester qu’il n’avait rien dit que de vrai.XXIV.", "1088": "Le soleil qui devenait plus chaud de jour en jour (car le printemps était à son terme et l’été commençait) ramena pour eux d’autres plaisirs, compagnons

chantait, émule des rossignols ;", "1092": "ils chassaient la sauterelle babillarde, prenaient la cigale harmonieuse, cueillaient des fleurs, secouaient les arbres et mangeaient les fruits nouveaux.",

bouquet de roses.", "1102": "Mieux valait, disait-elle, la faire maîtresse de maison, et recevoir eux-mêmes quelque bon présent qu’ils garderaient pour leur propre et véritable fils ;", "1103": "car il leur était né depuis peu un garçon.", "1104": "Parfois Dryas se laissait séduire à ces raisons ;", "1105": "car chacun faisait des offres bien supérieures à ce qu’on eût pu attendre pour une simple

une réalité.", "2780": "— Que les Dieux m’en préservent, reprit Théagène :", "2781": "pourquoi dis-tu cela ?", "2782": "— C’est, reprit-elle, qu’il vaudrait mieux pour moi, être privée de l’un des yeux, qu’inquiète sur ton compte.", "2783": "Je crains fort que ce songe ne se rapporte à toi que je regarde comme mes yeux, mon âme et mon tout.", "2784": "— Ne dites pas cela, répondit Cnémon, qui

perception des choses visibles, les songes désignent le père et la mère.", "2793": "— Ce serait encore là une bien triste explication, reprit Chariclée ;", "2794": "mais puisset-elle être vraie plutôt que l’autre ;", "2795": "puissent tes pronostics se réaliser de préférence, et les miens être trouvés menteurs.", "2796": "— Il en sera ainsi, n’en doutons pas, dit Cnémon ;", "2797": "mais il semble en vérité que nous rêvions, de discuter des songes et des visions, sans nous préoccuper de notre situation, maintenant surtout que cet Égyptien (il voulait désigner Thermutis) nous a laissés, tout

un plus profond abîme de maux.", "2803": "— Quant à l’infortune, reprit Cnémon, après quelques instants de silence, on ne saurait dire qui de nous l’emporte, ô Théagène ;", "2804": "car, moi aussi, la

s’élança sur la pente de toute sa vitesse et s’enfuit.", "2867": "Thermutis, arrivé au sommet de la colline, s’assit sur un rocher, pour y attendre le soir et l’obscurité ;", "2868": "car ils étaient convenus de profiter des ténèbres pour pénétrer dans le village et se renseigner sur Thyamis.", "2869": "En même temps il examinait s’il verrait revenir Cnémon, contre qui il tramait quelque perfide dessein :", "2870": "toujours assiégé du soupçon que c’était lui qui avait tué Thisbé, il songeait aux moyens de s’en défaire :", "2871": "il méditait même, dans sa rage furieuse, de tuer ensuite Théagène.", "2872": "Cependant, comme Cnémon ne paraissait pas, et que déjà la nuit était fermée, Thermutis se laissa aller au sommeil, sommeil d’airain et le dernier pour lui ;", "2873": "car la morsure d’un aspic, conduit sans doute par les destins vengeurs, termina dignement une telle vie.", "2874": "Cnémon, du moment où il eut quitté Thermutis, continua à fuir sans prendre haleine, jusqu’à ce que la nuit et l’obscurité le forcèrent à s’arrêter.", "2875": "Il se cacha à l’endroit même où la nuit l’avait surpris, accumula le plus qu’il put de branchages, et se tapit dessous.", "2876": "Mais il ne dormit guère, poursuivi qu’il était par de mortelles terreurs.", "2877": "Au plus léger bruit, au moindre souffle de vent, à l’agitation des feuilles, il se figurait entendre Thermutis.",

semblait plus longue que de coutume.", "2881": "Enfin il eut le bonheur de voir le jour.", "2882": "Tout d’abord, craignant d’effrayer ceux qu’il rencontrerait, ou de leur inspirer des soupçons, il coupa sa chevelure et en retrancha tout ce qu’il avait laissé croître chez les pâtres pour se donner l’aspect d’un brigand.", "2883": "Car les pâtres, entre autres moyens de se donner un aspect plus effrayant, ramènent leurs cheveux sur les sourcils et les laissent croître de manière à battre les épaules ;", "2884": "ils savent fort bien que la chevelure donne plus de grâce à ceux qui se vouent à l’amour, aux brigands un aspect plus terrible.XXI.", "2885": "Lorsqu’il eut retranché de sa chevelure ce qui fait la différence entre le brigand et l’élégant, il se dirigea en toute hâte vers Chemmis,

m’avez rien dit de ce qui vous concerne, quoique je vous aie interrogé le premier, et vous demandez à connaître mon histoire.", "2909": "— Eh bien, soit ! dit le vieillard ;", "2910": "je ne refuse pas ;", "2911": "car tu me parais Grec, malgré le déguisement que t’a imposé, ce semble, quelque caprice de la fortune.", "2912": "D’ailleurs, si tu désires vivement connaître mon histoire, moi-même

veux, et tu me confieras ta vie à ton tour.", "2918": "— Allons, dit Cnémon ;", "2919": "aussi bien, c’est précisément à ce bourg que je me rends, et j’ai là rendez-vous avec quelques amis que je dois attendre.", "2920": "»XXII.", "2921": "Ils montèrent dans une des nombreuses barques amarrées au rivage, pour traverser les voyageurs moyen nant salaire, et se dirigèrent vers le village.", "2922":

l’hôte, déjà grande et nubile, et par toutes les servantes de la maison.", "2924": "Elles traitaient le vieillard comme s’il eût été leur père, dressées à ces soins, je suppose, par les ordres de leur maître.", "2925": "L’une lavait ses pieds et essuyait la poussière qui couvrait ses jambes ;", "2926": "une autre s’occupait du coucher et lui préparait un bon lit.", "2927": "Celle-ci apportait de l’eau et allumait le feu ;", "2928": "celle-là servait sur la table des pains de froment et de tous les fruits de la saison.", "2929": "« Mais, s’écria Cnémon étonné, nous sommes entrés, ce me semble,

a quelques jours.", "2934": "— Et pourquoi donc cette vie vagabonde dont vous parlez ?", "2935": "— Mes enfants, dit-il, m’ont été enlevés par des brigands ;", "2936": "je connais les ravisseurs, et

retentir ses gémissements maternels, inutiles supplications, autour des oreilles barbares que la nature n’a pas faites pour connaître la pitié.", "2941": "— Ne voudriez-vous pas, lui dit Cnémon, me raconter comment et quand vous avez eu à soutenir cette lutte douloureuse ?", "2942": "— Plus tard, reprit-il ;", "2943": "maintenant il convient de réparer nos forces ;", "2944": "car c’est avec un

te sacrifier même une partie de mon corps.", "2976": "— Il n’est pas besoin d’un tel sacrifice ;", "2977": "je me croirai pleinement satisfait, si vous m’apprenez leur origine, leurs parents, comment

plaisir de l’oreille, et que les assistants suivaient ces jeunes filles à mesure qu’elles passaient devant eux, comme entraînés irrésistiblement par cette donce harmonie.", "3361": "Mais quand arriva par derrière une troupe de jeunes cavaliers, avec leur brillant capitaine, on vit bien que le spectacle de ce qui est beau efface tous les plaisirs de l’oreille.", "3362": "Ils n’étaient en tout que cinquante, partagés en deux corps de vingt-cinq ;", "3363": "au milieu, le chef de l’ambassade sacrée, gardé par eux.", "3364": "Leurs sandales, formées de bandelettes de cuir rouge entrelacées, se serraient au-dessus de la cheville ;", "3365": "une agrafe d’or retenait sur la poitrine leur manteau blanc, bordé tout autour d’une bande azurée.", "3366": "Leurs chevaux, tous thessaliens, réfléchissaient dans leur regard la mâle liberté des plaines où ils avaient été nourris ;", "3367": "ils mordaient le frein et le couvraient d’écume, comme s’ils se fussent indignés de sentir un maître ;", "3368": "et pourtant ils obéissaient sans peine, dociles en quelque sorte à la pensée du cavalier qui les dirigeait.", "3369": "Leur front était orné d’aigrettes, de plaques brillantes, les unes d’argent, les autres dorées ;", "3370": "il semblait qu’en cela chacun des jeunes gens eût voulu rivaliser de richesse.", "3371": "Mais, quel que fût leur éclat, mon cher Cnémon, leur chef (c’était Théagène, l’objet de toute ma sollicitude) les éclipsait tellement et attirait si bien sur lui seul tous les regards, qu’on eût dit un éclair rejetant dans l’ombre tout ce qui brillait auparavant.", "3372": "Tel il nous apparut, étincelant de lumière.", "3373": "Lui aussi, il était à cheval, couvert de ses armes, brandissant une lance de frêne à pointe d’airain.", "3374": "Son

la grâce du tableau :", "3378": "il soulevait doucement sa chevelure, la faisait mollement onduler sur le col, et en dispersait les boucles sur son front.", "3379": "Les bords du manteau ondoyaient sur le dos et les jambes du cheval.", "3380": "On eût dit, à voir son col ondulant comme les flots, sa tête haute, ses oreilles droites, son sourcil mobile et plein de feu, que le cheval lui-même comprenait la beauté de son maître, et que, fier de sa noble encolure, il sentait qu’il portait le plus brillant cavalier.", "3381": "Orgueilleux du poids qu’il portait, de la main qui le dirigeait, il marchait librement sous les rênes flottantes, se balançant alternativement d’un côté sur l’autre, effleurant avec légèreté la terre de l’extrémité du pied, et comme berçant son cavalier par un mouvement doux et cadencé.", "3382": "Tous contemplaient avec admiration ce spectacle ;", "3383": "le mâle visage, la beauté du jeune homme conquéraient tous les suffrages.", "3384": "Les femmes du peuple, celles qui n’ont point assez d’empire sur elles-mêmes pour déguiser les sentiments de leur âme, lui jetaient des fleurs et des fruits ;", "3385": "on voyait qu’elles voulaient obtenir de lui un regard.", "3386": "Car il n’y avait qu’une seule voix pour déclarer que jamais rien de plus beau que Théagène ne s’était vu parmi les hommes.IV. « Mais quand parut l’aurore au doigt de rose, » comme eût dit Homère, quand sortit du temple de Diane la belle, la sage Chariclée, alors nous reconnûmes bien que Théagène lui-même pouvait être vaincu, en ce sens du moins que la beauté la plus parfaite a toujours moins de grâce et d’attrait chez l’homme que chez la femme.", "3387": "Elle s’avançait sur un char attelé de deux bœufs d’une entière blancheur ;", "3388": "un manteau de pourpre,

rampaient réellement.", "3394": "Leur aspect n’avait rien d’affreux ni d’effrayant ;", "3395": "ils semblaient plutôt plongés dans un humide sommeil et comme assoupis par le plaisir de reposer sur le sein de la jeune fille.", "3396": "La matière était d’or, la couleur azurée :", "3397": "l’or était émaillé de noir, afin d’imiter par ce mélange du noir et de la couleur d’or, les saillies et l’aspect changeant des écailles.", "3398": "Telle était la ceinture de la jeune vierge.", "3399": "Ses cheveux n’étaient ni entièrement réunis en tresses, ni tout à fait libres :", "3400": "la plus grande partie, retombant sur le col, flottait sur le dos et les épaules ;", "3401": "de tendres branches de laurier, enlacées avec ceux du front et du haut de la tête, formaient comme une couronne, où la fraîcheur de la rose se mêlait aux éclatants reflets du soleil, et empêchaient les tresses de flotter au vent plus qu’il n’aurait été convenable.", "3402": "De la main gauche elle tenait un arc ;", "3403": "à l’autre épaule était suspendu un carquois ;", "3404": "sa main droite portait une torche allumée, dont l’éclat pâlissait devant les éclairs de ses yeux.", "3405": "— Ce sont bien eux-mêmes,

les as vus tels que la Grèce et le Soleil les contemplèrent en ce jour, dans toute leur splendeur, au milieu d’un applaudissement universel, elle, objet des vœux de tous les hommes, lui de toutes les femmes ;", "3410": "car, il n’y avait personne qui ne regardât comme un bonheur égal à l’immortalité d’être uni à l’un ou à l’autre.", "3411": "Seulement, les habitants du pays admiraient surtout le jeune homme, les Thessaliens inclinaient pour la jeune fille, chacun se sentant surtout attiré vers celui d’entre eux qu’il voyait pour la première fois.", "3412": "Car une chose nouvelle frappe bien plus vivement la vue que ce qui est devenu familier par l’habitude...", "3413": "Mais, ô douce déception, ô illusion délicieuse !", "3414": "comme tu m’as fait tressaillir d’espoir, quand j’ai cru que

sont point ici ;", "3419": "tu ne peux me les montrer.", "3420": "— Ne vous inquiétez pas, reprit-il ;", "3421": "ayez bon espoir, car ils viendront certainement ;", "3422": "sans doute quelque obstacle les a retenus et ne leur a pas permis d’arriver aussitôt que nous étions convenus.", "3423": "D’ailleurs, si je ne vous les ai pas montrés encore, c’est que je n’ai pas reçu tout mon salaire ;", "3424": "si donc vous avez hâte de les voir, accomplissez votre promesse et menez à fin votre récit.", "3425": "— Je redoute cette dernière partie, dit Calasiris, et pour moi-même, à cause des tristes souvenirs qu’elle me rappelle, et pour toi que je crains de fatiguer jusqu’à satiété par cette interminable histoire.", "3426": "Mais, puisque tu te montres auditeur patient, insatiable de récits honnêtes, reprenons, je le veux bien, ma narration au point où je l’ai laissée.", "3427": "Allumons d’abord la lampe, et faisons les libations du soir aux Dieux nocturnes, afin de pouvoir, ce

d’une infinité de fragments de bois, et, après y avoir entassé les parties des victimes consacrées aux Dieux, ils prièrent le prêtre d’Apollon de faire les libations et d’allumer le feu sous l’autel

dans nos âmes quelque chose de divin, et qu’elles tiennent d’en haut une sorte de parenté entre elles.", "3438": "En effet, se voir et s’aimer ne fut qu’un pour ces jeunes gens, comme si dès la première rencontre leurs âmes eussent reconnu qu’elles se ressemblaient ;", "3439": "on eût dit que, se sentant parentes par la noblesse, elles s’élançaient l’une vers l’autre.", "3440": "Tout d’abord ils restèrent immobiles et comme frappés de stupeur, elle, présentant toujours la torche, et lui, le bras tendu pour la recevoir.", "3441": "Longtemps ils restèrent ainsi, les yeux fixés l’un sur l’autre, comme si, s’étant connus ou vus auparavant, ils cherchaient à recueillir leurs souvenirs.", "3442": "Puis ils sourirent doucement, à la dérobée, d’un sourire qui ne se trahissait que par l’épanouissement de leurs yeux :", "3443": "bientôt, comme s’ils avaient honte de ce qui venait de se passer, ils rougirent tous deux ;", "3444": "et, un instant après, quand l’émotion sans doute eut pénétré jusqu’au cœur, ils pâlirent.", "3445": "En un mot, mille transformations s’opérèrent en un moment sur leurs visages, mille changements de couleur et de physionomie trahirent l’agitation de leur âme.", "3446": "Tout cela échappa à la multitude, on le conçoit aisément, chacun étant occupé de soins, de pensées différentes.", "3447": "Chariclès lui-même, tout entier à la récitation de la prière et à l’invocation d’usage, ne s’en aperçut pas.", "3448": "Mais moi, je n’étais occupé qu’à observer les deux jeunes gens ;", "3449": "car, depuis que j’avais entendu l’oracle rendu à Théagène,

entrant, langoureusement étendue sur son lit, les yeux humides et gonflés d’amour.", "3478": "Son père, après l’avoir embrassée comme de coutume, lui demanda ce qu’elle avait.", "3479": "Elle se plaignit d’un violent mal de tête et dit qu’elle reposerait volontiers, si on le lui permettait.", "3480": "Chariclès sortit alors de la chambre avec moi, recommanda aux servantes de ne faire aucun

proprement sous le nom de fascination, rend malades ceux sur qui elle tombe.", "3492": "Pour vous en convaincre, Chariclès, songez que bien souvent on est atteint d’ophtalmie ou de quelque maladie pestilentielle, sans avoir jamais touché les malades, sans s’être approché de leur lit, ni assis à la même table, mais uniquement pour avoir respiré le même air.", "3493": "Songez encore — aucune

cent portes, comme il nous l’apprend luimême ;", "3606": "son père présumé était un prêtre ;", "3607": "en réalité, il était fils de Mercure.", "3608": "Ce qui le fit regarder comme fils d’un prêtre,

marque particulière trahissait son origine et la diversité de nature de ses parents ;", "3611": "car, dès sa naissance, il portait sur l’une des cuisses1 une touffe de longs poils ;", "3612": "et ce fut de ce signe que plus tard lui vint son nom, lorsqu’il errait parmi les peuples, et en particulier chez les Grecs, chantant ses vers.", "3613": "Comme il ne révélait luimême ni son nom, ni sa patrie, ceux qui connaissaient cette marque distinctive, en tirèrent le surnom sous lequel on le connaît.", "3614": "— Mais dans quel but, mon père, taisait-il sa patrie ?", "3615": "— Peut-être parce qu’il rougissait de son exil :", "3616": "car, au moment où il sortait de l’adolescence et allait être porté sur la liste des jeunes gens voués au culte, son père l’avait chassé, parce qu’il avait reconnu sur son corps cette marque, signe de bâtardise ;", "3617": "peut-être aussi y avaitil là un dessein préconçu de s’assurer une patrie dans chaque ville, en cachant sa patrie véritable.XV. «

qu’on appelle science égyptienne n’est qu’une seule et même chose.", "3634": "Il y a une science vulgaire, qui se traîne pour ainsi dire terre à terre, esclave de vains fantômes, accroupie sur des cadavres, couchée sur des herbes magiques, plongée tout entière dans les enchantements.", "3635": "Celle-là ne tend à aucune fin utile, ne conduit à aucun but honnête ceux qui l’invoquent.", "3636":

dégradation bâtarde, celle que nous cultivons dès notre jeunesse, nous tous prêtres et hommes de race prophétique, a les yeux fixés en haut vers les cieux ;", "3640": "elle converse avec les Dieux, entre en rapport avec les êtres d’une nature supérieure, étudie le mouvement des astres, et en tire la connaissance de l’avenir.", "3641": "Supérieure à toutes ces misères terrestres, elle n’a en vue que le bien, ne se propose pour but que l’intérêt de l’humanité.", "3642": "C’est elle qui, en me faisant quitter à temps ma patrie, comme je te l’ai dit précédemment, m’a épargné les maux qu’elle m’avait prédits et la vue de la lutte fratricide de mes enfants.", "3643": "Mais, à l’égard de ces maux, remettons-nous-en à la volonté des Dieux et en particulier à celle des Destins ;", "3644": "car

pour m’adorer.", "3661": "Je l’en empêchai.", "3662": "Il me prit alors la tête, l’embrassa à plusieurs reprises, rendit grâce aux Dieux de n’avoir point été trompé dans son attente, et me supplia d’être son sauveur.", "3663": "Il n’y avait point de salut pour lui, disait-il, s’il ne trouvait sur-le-champ quelque secours, tant était grand le mal qu’il endurait, tant était brûlante la passion

et laissa voir par les diverses altérations de son visage que l’avenir se révélait à lui avec bien des alternatives de joie et de peine.", "4580": "Il posa ensuite les deux mains sur l’autel, en murmurant quelques mots à voix basse, et feignit de retirer du feu un objet qu’il avait lui-même apporté dans ce but :", "4581": "« Voici, dit-il, Nausiclès, la rançon de Chariclée que les Dieux vous envoient par mon intermédiaire.", "4582": "» En même temps il lui tendit un des anneaux royaux, d’une beauté et d’un éclat célestes :", "4583": "le cercle était d’ambre ;", "4584": "dans le chaton était enchâssée une améthyste éthiopienne, dont la grosseur égalait le globe de l’œil d’une jeune fille, et bien supérieure pour la beauté à celles d’Ibérie et de Bretagne.", "4585": "Celles-ci brillent d’un éclat un peu terne ;", "4586": "elles ressemblent à la rose, lorsque le bouton s’entr’ouvre et commence à se colorer sous les rayons du soleil :", "4587": "celles d’Éthiopie, au contraire, étincellent jusque dans leurs profondeurs d’un éclat tout printanier ;", "4588": "si on les retourne, il en jaillit un rayon d’or qui, loin d’éblouir les yeux par sa vivacité, les réjouit par sa douce et riante lumière.", "4589": "Elles ont, d’ailleurs, une vertu bien plus authentique que celles de l’Occident, et justifient véritablement leur nom d’améthystes>l, en gar- dant sobres dans les banquets ceux qui les portent.XIV.", "4590": "Telles sont toutes les améthystes de l’Inde et de l’Éthiopie.", "4591": "Mais celle que Calasiris offrait alors à Nausiclès était d’un prix bien supérieur encore :", "4592": "elle était enrichie de ciselures et représentait des animaux :", "4593": "on y voyait grave un jeune berger gardant son troupeau :", "4594": "debout sur une roche qui formait une légère saillie, afin de mieux voir, il faisait paître ses moutons au son du flageolet ;", "4595": "ceux-ci, dociles à ces sons, paraissaient paître aux accords de sa flûte.", "4596": "On eût dit qu’ils étaient chargés de toisons d’or ;", "4597": "non que cet ornement fût un effet de l’art, mais leur dos brillait naturellement des tons chauds et fauves de l’améthyste.", "4598": "On y voyait aussi les bondissements gracieux des agneaux :", "4599": "les uns accouraient en troupe vers le rocher, les autres formaient autour du berger comme un pétulant auditoire qui faisait ressembler l’éminence à un théâtre pastoral ;", "4600": "ceux-ci s’ébattaient comme au soleil dans les reflets de l’améthyste, ceux-là dans leurs bonds ne touchaient la pierre que de l’extrémité de l’ongle.", "4601": "Les plus grands et les plus pétulants semblaient vouloir s’élancer en dehors de la pierre et n’être retenus que par le cercle dont l’artiste avait entouré, comme d’une barrière d’or, et le rocher et le troupeau.", "4602": "C’était du reste un rocher véritable, et non une imitation ;", "4603": "l’ouvrier avait laissé sans la tailler la partie qui devait former la roche, et représenté ainsi la chose au naturel, jugeant inutile d’imiter une pierre sur une pierre.", "4604": "Tel était l’anneau.XV.

Calasiris ;", "4606": "c’était seulement pour parler que je demandais une rançon ;", "4607": "mon intention était de vous rendre votre fille libre, sans rien exiger en retour.", "4608": "Mais puisqu’il ne faut point négliger, suivant votre maxime, les dons précieux des Dieux, j’accepte cette pierre que le ciel m’envoie.", "4609": "Je crois fermement que Mercure, le meilleur, le plus généreux des Dieux, m’a, suivant sa coutume, envoyé cette bonne fortune, et m’a fait, par votre intermédiaire, parvenir ce présent au milieu des flammes ;", "4610": "on le voit de reste au feu dont il brille.", "4611": "Je regarde d’ailleurs comme le gain le plus précieux, celui qui sans nuire à qui donne, enrichit qui reçoit.", "4612": "» Cela dit et fait, il invita Calasiris et tous les autres

le lui conserver.XVI.", "4618": "Lorsque les convives commencèrent à s’échauffer à boire, et à se former par groupes, pour s’égayer chacun à leur convenance, Nausiclès présenta à Calasiris une coupe d’eau limpide, et lui dit :", "4619": "« A vous, mon bon Calasiris, ces nymphes pures que vous aimez ;", "4620": "elles n’ont eu aucun commerce avec Bacchus et sont véritablement vierges encore.",

les femmes se livrer à la danse pour occuper le temps que nous donnons à boire.", "4625": "Pour moi, le récit de vos courses errantes sera, si vous y consentez, le régal le plus délicieux, plus agréable mille fois que toutes les danses et tous les instruments.", "4626": "Depuis bien longtemps déjà, vous le savez, vous ajournez pour moi ce plaisir, à cause de la tristesse où vous plongeaient vos malheurs.", "4627": "Maintenant le moment est venu ;", "4628": "vous ne sauriez attendre une occasion plus favorable que celle où votre fille vous est rendue et est sous vos yeux, où vous avez l’espoir certain, avec l’aide des Dieux, de revoir bientôt votre fils, surtout si vous ne m’affligez point en différant encore ce récit.", "4629": "— Mille grâces vous soient rendues, Nausiclès, reprit Cnémon, vous qui, après avoir réuni à ce festin tous les instruments de musique, n’en tenez aucun compte maintenant et les abandonnez à des esprits plus vulgaires pour céder au désir d’ouïr des entretiens vraiment mystiques et pleins d’une volupté toute céleste.", "4630": "Vous me paraissez entendre merveilleusement les choses divines, en plaçant ainsi Mercure à côté de Bacchus et en associant les charmes du récit aux plaisirs du vin.", "4631": "J’ai admiré dans tous le reste la riche ordonnance de votre sacrifice ;", "4632": "mais on ne saurait mieux honorer Mercure qu’en sollicitant comme assaisonnement d’un festin des récits qui sont surtout de son domaine.", "4633": "» Calasiris consentit, pour complaire à Cnémon sans doute, mais aussi pour bien disposer Nausiclès à le servir à l’avenir.", "4634": "Il fit donc une narration complète, abrégeant toutefois et résumant en quelque sorte ce qu’il avait déjà dit à Cnémon, passant même sous silence certains détails qu’il ne jugeait pas utile de faire connaître à Nausiclès.", "4635": "Puis il reprit ainsi la suite de son récit, au point où nous l’avons interrompu :", "4636": "XVII.", "4637": "« Lorsqu’ils se furent embarqués sur le bâtiment phénicien, pour fuir loin de Delphes, ils naviguèrent d’abord à souhait, avec un vent léger en poupe :", "4638": "mais quand ils arrivèrent au golfe de Calydon, la mer, naturellement houleuse et mauvaise en cet endroit, commença à les battre avec violence.", "4639": "— Cnémon ne voulut point laisser passer ces mots sans réflexion et lui demanda s’il savait pourquoi la mer était particulièrement agitée sur ce point.", "4640": "« La mer d’Ionie, reprit Calasiris, vaste et spacieuse, se rétrécit en cet endroit, pénètre dans le golfe de Crissa en faisant effort pour se réunir à la mer Égée, et rencontre l’isthme du Péloponèse qui brise son impétuosité et l’empêche de passer outre.", "4641": "C’est une barrière opposée, à dessein sans doute, par la sage prévoyance des Dieux, pour l’empêcher de submerger les terres qui sont en face.", "4642": "Arrêtée par cet obstacle, elle reflue naturellement en arrière, et ses flots pressés vont s’accumuler surtout à l’entrée du golfe où ils se heurtent incessamment contre le courant qui continue à y pénétrer.", "4643": "La mer se gonfle et mugit ;", "4644": "du choc des courants contraires naît une sorte de bouillonnement

du phénomène.", "4647": "Calasiris continua ainsi :", "4648": "« Lorsque nous eûmes traversé le golfe et perdu de vue les îles Aigues, il nous sembla découvrir le promontoire de Zacynthe, comme un nuage vague qui courait sous nos yeux dans le lointain :", "4649": "le pilote ordonna aussitôt de diminuer de voiles ;", "4650": "et comme nous lui demandions pourquoi il ralentissait la marche malgré

vite cependant qu’ils ne l’avaient pensé (car le repas et la longueur des récits, dont ils ne pouvaient se rassasier, en avaient absorbé la plus grande partie), ils sortirent, sans attendre qu’il fût grand jour, et se rendirent auprès de Nausiclès.", "5045": "Ils le prièrent de leur dire où il pensait que fût Théagène, et de les y conduire le plus tôt possible.", "5046": "Nausiclès les prit avec lui et partit.", "5047": "Chariclée avait vivement insisté pour les accompagner ;", "5048": "mais force lui fut de rester, d’après l’avis de Nausiclès, qui lui promettait de ne pas aller loin et de revenir bientôt avec Théagène.", "5049": "Ils la laissèrent donc à la maison, partagée entre le chagrin de leur départ et la joie de la réunion qu’elle espérait.", "5050": "Ils venaient de sortir du village et suivaient les bords du Nil, lorsqu’ils aperçurent un crocodile qui traversait de la rive droite à la gauche, et plongeait avec impétuosité à travers le courant.", "5051": "Nausiclès et Calasiris ne virent là qu’un événement ordinaire et ne s’en inquiétèrent nullement, à cela près que Calasiris déclara qu’il voyait là le présage de quelque obstacle pour eux en chemin.", "5052": "Mais Cnémon fut vivement ému à cet aspect, quoiqu’il n’eût pas même aperçu distinctement l’animal, et n’en eût vu passer sous ses yeux qu’une ombre fugitive.", "5053": "Peu s’en fallut même qu’il ne prît la fuite.", "5054": "« Eh quoiv! dit Calasiris, pendant que Nausiclès riait aux éclats, je croyais, Cnémon, que tu ne tremblais que la nuit.", "5055": "Je savais bien que tu frissonnais au moindre bruit, mais il me semblait que c’était seulement dans les ténèbres :", "5056": "il paraît que cette téméraire audace ne t’abandonne pas même pendant le jour ;", "5057": "maintenant ce n’est plus le bruit d’un nom, c’est la vue d’une chose tout ordinaire et sans danger qui te jette hors de toi !", "5058": "— Et quel est le Dieu, dit Nausiclès, quelle est la puissance céleste, dont cet excellent jeune homme ne peut entendre prononcer le nom ?", "5059": "— Qu’il y ait quelque Dieu ou demi-Dieu dont le nom l’épouvante, reprit Calasiris, c’est ce que je ne saurais dire ;", "5060": "mais le nom d’un simple mortel, que dis-je !", "5061": "ce n’est pas même le nom d’un homme, d’un de ces héros renommés pour leur valeur, c’est le nom d’une femme, bien mieux, d’une femme morte, il le déclare lui-même, qui le fait frissonner, si on le prononce devant lui.", "5062": "Ainsi, la nuit où vous êtes revenu de chez les pâtres, ramenant Chariclée sauvée par votre généreuse amitié, je ne sais ni où ni comméntil avait entendu le nom dont je parle ;", "5063": "toujours est-il qu’il ne m’a pas laissé même un moment de sommeil, qu’il se pâmait à chaque instant de terreur, et que j’eus bien de la peine à le faire revenir à lui.", "5064": "Et si je ne craignais de le chagriner ou de l’effrayer, je vous répéterais maintenant ce nom,", "5065": "Nausiclès pour vous donner à rire encore davantage.", "5066": "» Et tout aussitôt il prononça le nom de Thisbé.II.", "5067": "A ce moment Nausiclès ne riait plus :", "5068": "il se rembrunit à ce nom et resta longtemps pensif, cherchant à s’expliquer comment, à quel titre, par suite de quelles relations, le nom de Thisbé pouvait affecter ainsi Cnémon.", "5069": "Celui-ci, au contraire, se pâmait d’aise :", "5070": "« Eh bien !", "5071": "dit-il, vous voyez, mon bon Calasiris, quelle est la puissance de ce nom ;", "5072": "ce n’est pas seulement pour moi qu’il est un épouvantail, comme vous dites ;", "5073": "voici que la même chose arrive à Nausiclès ;", "5074": "ou plutôt il s’est fait dans nos dispositions une révolution complète :", "5075": "moi, je ris maintenant, bien convaincu qu’elle est morte, tandis que notre généreux Nausiclès, qui tout à l’heure se moquait de moi à outrance... — Cessez, dit Nausiclès :", "5076": "vous vous êtes assez vengé de moi, Cnémon.", "5077": "Par les Dieux de l’hospitalité et de l’amitié, par le sel et la table, par l’accueil bienveillant que vous avez trouvé chez moi, j’aime à le croire, d’où vous vient ce nom de Thisbé ?", "5078": "la connaissezvous ?", "5079": "avez-vous voulu m’effrayer, ou bien n’est-ce qu’un jeu ?", "5080": "parlez, je vous en prie.", "5081": "— A vous la parole, Cnémon, dit Calasiris :", "5082": "bien des fois vous m’avez promis ce récit ;",

en faisant plaisir à Nausiclès, vous nous allégerez et nous ferez oublier par votre récit la fatigue de la route.", "5085": "» Cnémon céda, et reprit, en l’abrégeant, le récit qu’il avait déjà fait à Théagène et à Chariclée, son origine athénienne, son père Aristippe, sa marâtre Déménète.", "5086": "Il raconta l'amour illicite de Déménète pour lui, ses machinations quand elle eut échoué, comment elle se servit de Thisbé pour arriver à ses fins, les moyens qu’elles mirent en œuvre.", "5087": "Il dit qu’il avait été chassé de sa patrie, condamné par jugement du peuple, comme parricide ;", "5088": "que, pendant son séjour à Égine, il avait appris de Charias, un de ses compagnons de jeunesse, la mort de Déménète, les circonstances qui l’avaient accompagnée, et la manière dont elle avait été elle-même victime des intrigues de Thisbé ;", "5089": "qu’il avait su ensuite d’Anticlès que son père avait été frappé de confiscation et d’exil, grâce à une conspiration des parents de Déménète, qui avaient accrédité contre lui dans le peuple des présomptions de meurtre ;", "5090": "que Thisbé de son côté s’était enfuie d’Athènes avec le marchand de Naucratis, son amant.", "5091": "Cnémon raconta enfin qu’il s’était embarqué avec Anticlès à la recherche de Thisbé, espérant la retrouver en Égypte et la ramener à Athènes, afin de confondre les calomniateurs de son père et de la châtier elle-même.", "5092": "Il avait ensuite traversé mille dangers, subi mille infortunes, jusqu’au moment où il tomba au pouvoir d’écumeurs de mer.", "5093": "Échappé de leurs mains, il avait abordé en Egypte, où il avait été pris de nouveau par les pasteurs, autre espèce de pirates, et il avait rencontré là Théagène et Chariclée.", "5094": "Il termina par la mort de Thisbé et les événements qui suivirent, jusqu’à ceux qui étaient par- faitement connus de Calasiris et de Nausiclès.III.", "5095": "Ce récit jeta Nausiclès dans une grande perplexité :", "5096": "tantôt il voulait leur déclarer ses relations avec Thisbé ;", "5097": "tantôt il jugeait plus convenable d’ajourner ses révélations ;", "5098": "cependant il se contint, non sans peine, autant de parti pris que par suite d’une nouvelle rencontre qui vint le distraire de ses pensées.", "5099": "Ils avaient fait environ soixante stades et approchaient déjà du bourg où restait Mitranès, lorsqu’ils rencontrèrent un homme de la connaissance de Nausiclès, fort affairé et empressé.", "5100": "Ils lui en demandèrent la raison.", "5101": "« Quoi, Nausiclès, dit-il, vous me demandez où je vais en si grande hâte, comme si vous ignoriez que toutes mes actions tendent maintenant à un but unique, servir les volontés d’Isias de Chemmis :", "5102": "c’est pour elle que je laboure, pour elle que j’amasse tout ce que je gagne ;",

est par trop bonne de vous demander si peu de chose, un simple flamant, au lieu d’exiger le phénix lui-même qui nous vient de l’Éthiopie ou de l’Inde !", "5108": "— C’est ainsi, dit-il, qu’elle a coutume de se jouer de moi et de mon amour.", "5109": "Mais vous, où allez-vous et dans quel but ?", "5110": "» Ils répondirent qu’ils se rendaient auprès de Mitranès.", "5111": "« Vous perdez votre peine, dit-il, et vous n’avez que faire de vous tant hâter ;", "5112": "car pour le moment Mitranès n’est pas dans le pays.", "5113": "Il est parti cette nuit, et marche contre les pâtres du bourg de Bessa ;", "5114": "parce que ces Besséens, commandés par Thyamis, qu’ils viennent de nommer leur chef, ont enlevé dans une de leurs courses et retiennent prisonnier un jeune captif grec, qu’il faisait conduire à Memphis auprès d’Oroondatès, pour être envoyé de là, je crois, en présent au Grand Roi.", "5115": "»IV.", "5116": "Il parlait encore que déjà il avait repris sa course, en disant :",

raison, les récriminations et les mauvais traitements ne lui coûtent guère.", "5120": "» En apprenant ce nouveau contretemps, qui renversait inopinément leurs espérances, ils restèrent longtemps immobiles.", "5121": "A la fin, Nausiclès essaya de réconforter ses compagnons :", "5122": "il leur dit que, s’ils avaient échoué pour le moment, ce n’était pas une raison pour désespérer d’une meilleure issue dans un prochain avenir ;", "5123": "qu’il fallait d’abord retourner à Chemmis, délibérer sur ce qu’ils avaient à faire et se préparer à une excursion plus longue ;", "5124": "qu’ils iraient ensuite, toujours soutenus par l’espoir de retrouver heureusement Théagène, le chercher soit chez les pâtres, soit en tout autre lieu où ils apprendraient qu’il pourrait se trouver ;", "5125":

chercher Théagène, si bien qu’ils n’avaient plus maintenant qu’à tourner leurs pas vers le bourg des pâtres, comme vers un but assuré.V.", "5126": "Ils se rendirent sans peine à cet avis :", "5127":

Thyamis sauverait Théagène.", "5129": "Ils se décidèrent donc à revenir.", "5130": "A leur retour, ils trouvèrent Chariclée sur le seuil, promenant au loin ses regards dans toutes les directions.",

cette nouvelle ;", "5137": "il y a quelque humanité à annoncer brusquement un malheur ;", "5138": "car l’âme, mise subitement en présence de la douleur, est accablée par elle et la sent moins vivement.", "5139": "» Pour couper court aussitôt à l’excès de son chagrin, Cnémon lui dit :", "5140": "« Quel tourment vous vous donnez, Chariclée, vous êtes toujours disposée à voir tout en noir dans vos prédictions, et toujours vous vous trompez, fort heureusement du reste !", "5141": "Théagène est sain et sauf, grâce aux Dieux.", "5142": "» Et il lui dit, en quelques mots, où il était, et par suite de quelles circonstances.", "5143": "Calasiris reprit :", "5144": "« Vous n’avez jamais aimé, Cnémon, on le voit à vos paroles ;", "5145": "vous sauriez que les amants tremblent, même là où

Chariclée et la fit entrer, avec une sollicitude toute paternelle.", "5153": "Cependant Nausiclès, pour les distraire un peu de leurs pensées, tout en poursuivant lui-même un autre dessein, fit préparer un souper plus somptueux que de coutume, et n’y admit, outre ses hôtes, que sa propre fille, parée avec plus d’élégance et de richesse que d’ordinaire.", "5154": "Lorsqu’il lui sembla qu’on

soupir :", "5177": "« O caprices de la destinée humaine !", "5178": "s’écria-t-il, quelle est votre instabilité et votre inconstance !", "5179": "dans quel flux et reflux de maux vous vous êtes plu à me plonger après tant d’autres !", "5180": "Vous m’avez arraché à ma famille, à la maison paternelle, chassé de ma patrie, de ma ville chérie, jeté ensuite sur la terre d’Égypte (pour ne point parler

conserves pour lui.", "5283": "» Chari clée rougit à ces paroles, surtout en songeant à l’état où elle avait été surprise.", "5284": "Elle garda longtemps le silence ;", "5285": "jusqu’à ce que pressée de répondre par Calasiris :", "5286": "« Vos reproches sont justes, dit-elle ;", "5287": "mais peut-être, mon père, ai-je droit à quelque indulgence :", "5288": "ce n’est pas un sentiment vulgaire, une passion récente, qui me trouble ainsi ;", "5289": "c’est un amour chaste et honnête, pour un époux que je n’ai point connu encore, mais qui pourtant m’appartient ;", "5290": "joignez à cela que cet époux est Théagène.", "5291": "Son absence m’afflige ;", "5292": "surtout je me demande avec terreur s’il est, ou non, vivant encore.", "5293": "— Ne crains rien à cet égard, dit Calaris, car il vit, il t’est conservé par la protection des Dieux, s’il faut ajouter quelque foi aux prédictions de l’oracle sur vous.", "5294": "Nous devons en croire aussi la nouvelle qui nous a été donnée hier, qu’il avait été pris par Thyamis comme on le conduisait à Memphis.", "5295": "S’il a été pris, il est évidemment sauvé, grâce à ses relations précédentes avec Thyamis et à l’amitié qui les unissait.", "5296": "Mais le moment est venu ;", "5297": "ne tardons pas davantage et gagnons en toute hâte le bourg de Bessa, pour y chercher, toi Théagène, et moi mon propre fils ;", "5298": "car sans doute, tu as déjà entendu dire que Thyamis est mon fils.", "5299": "» A ces mots, Chariclée devint toute pensive ;", "5300": "« S’il est vrai, dit-elle, que vous ayez un fils du nom de Thyamis, si c’est celui-là même, et non un autre, si vous êtes réellement son père, nos affaires n’ont jamais été en plus grand péril.", "5301": "» Calasiris étonné lui en demanda la raison :", "5302": "« Vous savez, ditelle, que j’ai été captive chez les pâtres.", "5303": "Là aussi, cette fatale beauté que je parais avoir reçue en partage m’a fait aimer de Thyamis.", "5304": "Il est donc à craindre, si nous le rencontrons dans nos recherches, qu’en me voyant il ne reconnaisse en moi sa prisonnière et ne me force à conclure le mariage qu’il me proposait et que j’ai éludé à force de subterfuges.", "5305": "— Non, dit Calasiris, la passion ne saurait le maîtriser au point de ne pas respecter la vue et la présence de son père.", "5306": "Les regards de celui à qui il doit le jour auront assez d’empire sur un fils pour le forcer à réprimer un amour illégitime, si toutefois cet amour existe.", "5307": "Cependant, qui t’arrête ?", "5308": "rien ne t’empêche d’imaginer encore quelque artifice pour éluder les dangers qui t’effraient ;", "5309": "car il me semble que tu ne manques pas d’une certaine habileté pour inventer, contre ceux qui s’attaquent à toi, des subterfuges et des ajournements.", "5310": "»X.", "5311": "Ces paroles dissipèrent un peu la tristesse de Chariclée :", "5312": "« Je ne sais, dit-elle, si cela est sérieux ou si c’est un jeu de votre part ;", "5313": "mais peu m’importe pour le moment.", "5314": "J’ai imaginé autrefois avec Théagène une ruse à laquelle la fortune ne nous a pas permis alors de recourir ;", "5315": "j’y veux revenir maintenant ;", "5316": "puisse seulement l’issue être plus heureuse !", "5317": "Lorsque nous songeâmes à nous échapper de l’île des pâtres, nous résolûmes de prendre les vêtements les plus misérables et de traverser, déguisés en mendiants, les bourgs et les villes.", "5318": "Ayons recours à ce déguisement, si toutefois vous adoptez mon avis, et faisons-nous mendiants ;", "5319": "de cette manière nous serons moins exposés aux attaques de ceux que nous rencontrerons ;", "5320": "car chez le mendiant la misère même est une garantie de sécurité :", "5321": "la pauvreté provoque plutôt la compassion que l’envie.", "5322": "Il nous sera plus facile aussi de nous procurer la vie de chaque jour ;", "5323": "en pays étranger on trouve difficilement à acheter, quand on ne connaît personne ;", "5324": "tandis que la pitié fait donner aisément à ceux qui demandent.XI. Calasiris l’approuva et fit en toute hâte les préparatifs du voyage.", "5325": "Ils allèrent trouver Nausiclès et Cnémon, leur annoncèrent leur départ et se mirent en route le surlendemain.", "5326": "Ils n’emmenaient avec eux ni bête de somme, quoiqu’on leur en eût offert, ni aucun serviteur pour la route.", "5327": "Nausiclès et Cnémon les conduisirent au départ, avec toute la maison ;", "5328": "Nausicléa elle-même avait voulu les accompagner, et, à force de prières, en avait obtenu l’autorisation de son père, son affection pour Chariclée triomphant de sa pudeur de jeune mariée.", "5329": "Après avoir cheminé ensemble l’espace de cinq stades, ils se donnèrent mutuellement le baiser d’adieu.", "5330": "Chariclée à Nausicléa, Calasiris à Nausiclès et à Cnémon.", "5331": "Puis ils se serrèrent la main et versèrent d’abondantes larmes, en se souhaitant plus de bonheur à l’avenir.", "5332": "Cnémon s’excusa en outre sur son récent mariage de ne pas les accompagner plus loin, et promit même de les rejoindre, s’il en trouvait l’occasion :", "5333": "puis ils se séparèrent.", "5334": "Pendant que Nausiclès et les siens retournaient vers Chemmis, Chariclée et Calasiris commencèrent par se déguiser en mendiants et s’affublèrent de méchants haillons préparés dans ce but.", "5335": "Chariclée se salit ensuite le visage en le frottant de suie broyée, mêlée à de là boue.", "5336": "De son front pendait l’extrêmité d’une mauvaise loque sale qui se balançait en désordre sur l’un des yeux et le cachait.", "5337": "Sous son aisselle était attachée une besace, destinée en apparence à recevoir des bribes et des morceaux de pain, mais qui lui servait réellement à renfermer son vêtement sacerdotal de Delphes, ses bandelettes, ses bijoux et les signes de reconnaissance que sa mère avait exposés avec elle.", "5338": "Calasiris avait enveloppé le carquois de Chariclée d’une peau déchiquetée et le portait en écharpe sur son épaule, comme si c’eussent été d’autres bardes.", "5339": "L’arc débandé s’était redressé aussitôt et lui avait fourni un bâton sur lequel il s’appuyait de tout son poids.", "5340": "S’il voyait de loin quelqu’un venir à leur rencontre, il feignait de se courber encore plus que son âge ne l’y obligeait, traînait la jambe et quelquefois se faisait conduire par Chariclée.XII.", "5341": "Lorsqu’ils eurent terminé leur accoutrement, ils s’adressèrent mutuellement quelques plaisanteries et se complimentèrent ironiquement sur la grâce avec laquelle ils portaient le déguisement :", "5342": "puis ils prièrent le Dieu arbitre de leurs destinées de se contenter de leurs infortunes passées et d’y mettre désormais un terme, et ils se dirigèrent vers Bessa.", "5343": "Mais l’espoir qu’ils avaient d’y rencontrer Théagène et Thyamis fut déçu ;", "5344": "car, en approchant de Bessa, vers le coucher du soleil, ils aperçurent les cadavres d’un grand nombre d’hommes récemment égorgés.", "5345": "La plu- part étaient des Perses, bien reconnaissables à leur costume et à leur armure ;", "5346": "les autres, en petit nombre, des gens du pays.", "5347": "Ils jugèrent bien que la guerre avait passé par là, mais sans comprendre par qui, contre qui elle avait été faite.", "5348": "A la fin ils s’approchèrent des morts et les examinèrent, dans la crainte que quelqu’un des leurs ne se trouvât parmi eux ;", "5349": "car l’esprit est ingénieux à imaginer toujours tout au pire, quand il s’agit de ce qu’il aime.", "5350": "Là ils rencontrèrent une vieille femme qui tenait embrassé le corps d’un des habitants du pays, et poussait d’affreux gémissements.", "5351": "Ils résolurent de prendre quelques informations, s’il était possible, auprès de la vieille :", "5352": "s’étant donc assis près d’elle, ils essayèrent de la consoler un peu et de modérer l’excès de sa douleur.", "5353": "La vieille les écoutait avec intérêt :", "5354": "Calasiris alors lui demanda en égyptien sur qui elle pleurait et quel était ce combat.", "5355": "Elle répondit à tout en peu de mots :", "5356": "elle gémissait sur son fils étendu sans vie ;", "5357": "elle était revenue à dessein au milieu des morts, dans l’espoir que quelque ennemi la frapperait et la délivrerait de la vie ;", "5358": "en attendant elle rendait les derniers devoirs à son fils, autant qu’il était en elle, par ses larmes et ses gémissements.XIII.", "5359": "Quant au combat, voici le récit qu’elle leur fit :", "5360": "« On conduisait à Oroondatès, satrape du Grand Roi, Memphis, un jeune étranger d’une taille et d’une beauté remarquables.", "5361": "C’était, je crois, Mitranès, préfet des gardes, qui l’avait fait prisonnier, et qui l’envoyait comme un présent du plus haut prix.", "5362": "Les habitants de notre bourg (et elle montrait le village voisin) étant survenus, prétendirent qu’ils le connaissaient, soit que cela fût réellement, soit qu’ils ne voulussent qu’un prétexte ;", "5363": "et ils l’enlevèrent.", "5364": "Mitranès, naturellement irrité à cette nouvelle, marcha contre le bourg, il y a de cela deux jours.", "5365": "Mais les nôtres sont une race d’hommes belliqueuse, comme gens habitués à vivre de pillage et à mépriser la mort sous toutes les formes.", "5366": "Aussi, bien d’autres femmes déjà ont eu à gémir, comme moi maintenant, sur la perte de leurs maris et de leurs enfants.", "5367": "Lorsqu’ils reconnurent que l’ennemi approchait, ils dressèrent à l’avance des embuscades, le reçurent de pied ferme et eurent l’avantage.", "5368": "Les uns marchèrent droit à eux et les attaquèrent de front, pendant que les autres sortaient de leur embus- cade en poussant des cris, et prenaient par derrière les Perses surpris et épouvantés.", "5369": "Mitranès tomba en combattant aux premiers rangs, et avec lui presque tous ses soldats ;", "5370": "car ils étalent entourés, et l’espace leur manquait pour fuir.", "5371": "Un petit nombre des nôtres périrent également, et de ce petit nombre les Dieux cruels ont voulu que fût mon fils.", "5372": "Il est tombé, vous le voyez, frappé à la poitrine par le javelot d’un Perse.", "5373": "Et moi, infortunée, je pleure maintenant sur celui qui est ici étendu ;", "5374": "bientôt peut-être il me faudra pleurer sur le seul fils qui me reste encore ;", "5375": "car, lui aussi il est parti hier avec le reste des nôtres, pour marcher contre la ville de Memphis.", "5376": "»Calasiris lui demanda encore les motifs de cette expédition.", "5377": "La vieille répondit qu’elle les avait appris du fils qui lui restait.", "5378": "« Après avoir tué, dit-elle, les soldats royaux et le préfet des gardes du Grand Roi, nos gens savaient bien qu’un pareil attentat ne pouvait être pour eux une affaire sans consequence ;", "5379": "ils avaient tout risqué et ne se faisaient pas d’illusions sur le résultat.", "5380": "Car Oroondatès, qui commandait à Memphis, entouré de troupes nombreuses, ne manquerait pas, à la première nouvelle, de cerner tout d’abord le bourg, de prendre les habitants comme dans un filet et de les massacrer jusqu’au dernier, pour venger son offense.", "5381": "N’ayant plus rien dès lors à ménager, ils résolurent de racheter, s’il était possible, l’audace de leur entreprise par plus d’audace encore, et de prévenir Oroondatès, en tombant sur lui à l’improviste, avant qu’il eût fait ses préparatifs.", "5382": "Leur dessein est, ou de l’enlever lui-même à Memphis, s’ils peuvent l’y surprendre, ou si, comme on le dit, il est occupé au dehors par une guerre contre les Éthiopiens, de profiter de son absence pour prendre plus aisément la ville, dégarnie de ses défenseurs.", "5383": "Tout en se mettant par là à l’abri du danger pour le moment, ils veulent, en même temps, bien mériter de leur chef et le rétablir dans les fonctions sacerdotales de prophète, que son frère, plus jeune que lui, occupe contrairement à la loi.", "5384": "Que s’ils échouent dans leur entreprise, du moins ils périront en combattant, au lieu de tomber entre les mains des Perses et d’être exposés à leurs outrages et à leurs tortures.", "5385": "Mais vous, étrangers, où allez-vous maintenant ?", "5386": "— Au bourg, répondit Calasiris.", "5387": "— Il n’est pas sûr pour vous, reprit-elle, à pareille heure, et inconnus comme vous êtes, d’aller au milieu de ceux qui sont restés.", "5388": "— Mais si vous nous accordiez l’hospitalité, reprit Calasiris, nous ne désespérerions pas de trouver une retraite sûre.", "5389": "— En ce moment, dit la vieille, je ne puis ;", "5390": "car j’ai résolu de faire cette nuit quelques expiations.", "5391": "Mais si vous pouvez vous y résigner (et il le faut bien, quand même vous ne le voudriez pas), cherchez ici quelque part un lieu qui ne soit pas souillé par la présence des morts, et allez à distance attendre patiemment la fin de la nuit.", "5392": "Au jour, je vous donnerai l’hospitalité, et je vous mettrai à l’abri de toute crainte.", "5393": "»XIV.", "5394": "Quand elle eut parlé, Calasiris répéta le tout à Chariclée ;", "5395": "puis il la prit avec lui et ils s’éloignèrent.", "5396": "Après avoir fait quelques pas hors du champ des morts, ils rencontrèrent un tertre peu élevé, où ils s’arrêtèrent.", "5397": "Calasiris s’y coucha, la tête appuyée sur le carquois.", "5398": "Chariclée se fit un siège de la besace et resta assise.", "5399": "La lune se levait en ce moment et ses rayons éclairaient au loin les campagnes.", "5400": "Calasiris, naturellement appesanti par l’âge, brisé d’ailleurs par une longue route, dormait profondément.", "5401": "Chariclée veillait, tout entière aux pensées qui l’occupaient ;", "5402": "elle contemplait un spectacle exécrable et impie, mais familier aux femmes égyptiennes.", "5403": "La vieille, se croyant désormais à l’abri de tout dérangement et de tout regard indiscret, commença par creuser une fosse ;", "5404": "elle alluma ensuite un bûcher par les deux bouts, et plaça au milieu le cadavre de son fils.", "5405": "Puis, prenant une tasse de terre sur un trépied disposé auprès, elle en versa du miel dans la fosse ;", "5406": "d’une autre elle versa du lait, et d’une troisième du vin.", "5407": "Cela fait, elle jeta dans la fosse un gâteau de farine représentant un homme, couronné de laurier et de fenouil.", "5408": "A la fin elle ramassa une épée qu’elle se mit à brandir avec un transport frénétique ;", "5409": "après avoir adressé à la lune de nombreuses invocations dans une langue barbare et avec un accent étranger, elle se fit une incision au bras, recueillit le sang sur un rameau de laurier et en arrosa le bûcher.", "5410": "Après beaucoup d’autres conjurations semblables, elle se pencha sur le cadavre de son fils, lui murmura quelques mots à l’oreille, le réveilla de la mort et le força tout à coup par ses enchantements à se dresser sur ses pieds.", "5411": "Chariclée, qui la contemplait depuis le commencement avec terreur, frissonna d’horreur à cette vue.", "5412": "Tremblante et éperdue à l’aspect de cette scène étrange, elle réveilla Calasiris et lui fit contempler ce spectacle.", "5413": "Placés dans l’ombre, ils voyaient, sans être vus, les parties éclairées, surtout aux environs du bûcher :", "5414": "le peu de distance leur permettait également d’entendre ce qui se disait ;", "5415": "car déjà la vieille adressait plus distinctement la parole au cadavre ;", "5416": "elle lui demandait si le frère du mort, son fils à elle, vivait encore, s’il reviendrait sain et sauf.", "5417": "Le mort ne répondit pas ;", "5418": "il fit seulement un geste d’une signification douteuse, qui permettait à sa mère d’espérer ce qu’elle désirait ;", "5419": "et aussitôt il retomba étendu le visage contre terre.", "5420": "Elle retourna le corps sur le dos, et, loin de cesser ses questions, elle redoubla, à ce qu’il semblait, la violence de ses conjurations, recommençant à lui murmurer une foule de choses à l’oreille, et s’élançant, l’épée à la main, tantôt vers le bûcher, tantôt vers la fosse.", "5421": "A la fin elle le réveilla une seconde fois.", "5422": "Lorsqu’il se fut dressé, elle lui posa la même question et le força à lui révéler ce qu’elle demandait, non plus seulement par signes, mais distinctement et à haute voix.", "5423": "Pendant que la vieille accomplissait ainsi ses sortilèges, Chariclée pressait vivement Calasiris de s’approcher et de s’informer, eux aussi, de Théagène.", "5424": "Mais il refusa, en disant que la vue même d’un pareil spectacle était un sacrilège, et qu’il fallait une nécessité impérieuse pour les contraindre à la supporter ;", "5425": "qu’il ne convenait à un prêtre ni de se complaire, ni même d’assister à de semblables pratiques ;", "5426": "qu’il puisait la puissance prophétique dans des sacrifices légi times et de saintes prières, tandis que les conjurations comme celles de l’Égyptienne, dont le hasard les rendait témoins, étaient chose impure, et se traînaient terre à terre autour des cadavres.XV.", "5427": "Il parlait encore, lorsque le mort fit entendre une voix rauque et caverneuse, comme si elle fût sortie de dessous terre ou de quelque antre profond ;", "5428": "il disait d’un ton plaintif :", "5429": "« J’ai d’abord eu pitié de vous, ma mère ;", "5430": "je vous ai laissé enfreindre les lois de la nature humaine, faire violence aux décisions immuables du Destin, et sonder par vos conjurations des mystères interdits aux mortels :", "5431": "car le respect pour ceux à qui on doit le jour persiste, autant qu’il se peut, même chez les morts.", "5432": "Mais vous m’arrachez même ce respect, autant qu’il est en vous, par votre insistance :", "5433": "il ne vous suffit pas du sacrilège par lequel vous avez débuté ;", "5434": "vous poursuivez, vous mettez maintenant le comble à l’abomination ;", "5435": "vous forcez un cadavre non plus seulement à se dresser et à faire un signe, mais même à parler ;", "5436": "vous négligez le soin de ma sépulture et m’empêchez de me réunir aux autres âmes, uniquement pour vos convenances personnelles :", "5437": "écoutez donc les révélations devant lesquelles je recule depuis longtemps déjà :", "5438": "votre lils ne reviendra pas sain et sauf ;", "5439": "vous-même, vous n’échapperez pas à la mort par le fer.", "5440": "Votre vie, consumée tout entière dans des pratiques impies, ne tardera pas à être couronnée par la fin tragique réservée à quiconque vous ressemble.", "5441": "Ce n’est point seulement en secret avec vous-même, c’est publiquement que vous avez osé accomplir ces criminels mystères, réservés au silence et aux ténèbres ;", "5442": "c’est en présence de pareils témoins que vous révélez les secrets du tombeau :", "5443": "l’un est un pontife (mais ce n’est pas sa présence qui vous condamne le plus ;", "5444": "car il est assez sage pour ne point révéler de telles choses, et pour les renfermer dans le silence ;", "5445": "il est d’ailleurs ami des Dieux.", "5446": "Il arrêtera et séparera par sa présence, s’il se hâte, ses deux fils engagés dans un combat sanglant et déjà armés du glaive.", "5447": "Mais, ce qu’il y a de plus affreux, c'est qu’une jeune fille voit les conjurations dont je suis l’objet, et qu’elle entend tout.", "5448": "C’est une enfant tourmentée par l’amour, errante en quelque sorte par toute la terre, à la recherche de son amant.", "5449": "Après mille traverses et mille dangers, elle trouvera aux extrémités de la terre une brillante et royale existence.", "5450": "» Après ces paroles, le cadavre retomba lourdement à terre.", "5451": "La vieille, comprenant que les témoins en question étaient les deux étrangers, se précipita aussitôt contre eux, dans l’état où elle se trouvait, l’épée à la main, folle de fureur.", "5452": "Elle errait de tous côtés à travers les cadavres, persuadée qu’ils s’étaient cachés au milieu des morts, et bien décidée, si elle les rencontrait, à les tuer comme des espions dont la présence avait contrarié ses enchantements.", "5453": "Mais tandis que furieuse, acharnée à leur poursuite, elle errait ainsi sans précaution parmi les morts, un tronçon de lance fiché en terre, contre lequel elle alla donner sans le voir, lui traversa l’aine.", "5454": "Elle tomba sans vie ;", "5455": "châtiment bien mérité, et qui réalisait à l’instant même la prédiction de son fils.I.", "5456": "Après avoir couru un pareil danger, Calasiris et Chariclée, impatients de se soustraire à la frayeur qu’ils éprouvaient, pressés d’ailleurs par la prédiction qu’ils venaient d’entendre, continuèrent sans tarder leur marche vers Memphis.", "5457": "Au moment où ils approchaient de la ville, les événements annoncés par l’ombre évoquée devant eux s’y accomplissaient déjà.", "5458": "Thyamis était aux portes, à la tête dos brigands de Bessa.", "5459": "Mais le bruit de sa marche l’avait précédé à Memphis :", "5460": "on venait de fermer les portes, sur l’avis d’un des soldats de Mitranès qui, échappé au massacre de Bessa, avait prévu cette attaque et en avait prévenu les habitants de la ville.", "5461": "Thyamis, ayant fait camper sa bande au pied de la muraille, d’un seul côté de la ville, afin de la reposer des fatigues d’une marche rapide, se disposa à faire le siège de la place.", "5462": "Cependant les habitants, effrayés d’abord de l’arrivée de cette troupe, qu’ils croyaient plus considérable, ne tardèrent pas à reconnaître du haut des murs le petit nombre des assaillants :", "5463": "aussitôt ils s’empressèrent de réunir les quelques archers et cavaliers laissés à la garde de la ville, armèrent le peuple de tout ce qu’on put trouver, et se disposèrent à faire une sortie contre l’ennemi.", "5464": "Mais un vieillard, homme de crédit et d’autorité, s’y opposa ;", "5465": "il leur remontra que, puisque le satrape Oroondatès se trouvait absent et retenu au dehors par une guerre contre les Éthiopiens, il convenait du moins de faire part de ce qui arrivait à Arsacé, sa femme ;", "5466": "que, du moment où ils agiraient par ses ordres, les troupes qu’ils pourraient trouver dans la ville montreraient plus d’empressement à se réunir, plus d’ardeur à les défendre.II.", "5467": "Cet avis fut goûté, et tous coururent au palais du roi, habitation ordinaire des satrapes, lorsque le roi était absent.", "5468": "Arsacé était belle, grande, d’une intelligence active, d’une noblesse de sentiments en rapport avec sa haute naissance, telle enfin qu’il convenait à la sœur du Grand Roi.", "5469": "Mais sa vie n’était point sans reproche :", "5470": "portée à la volupté, elle ne savait point mettre un frein à ses passions déshonnétes :", "5471": "elle avait en particulier à se reprocher de n’être pas étrangère à l’exil de Thyamis.", "5472": "Lorsque Calasiris, à la suite des avertissements des Dieux au sujet de ses enfants, se fut exilé de Memphis à l’insu de tout le monde, et que sa disparition donna lieu de supposer qu’il était mort, Thyamis fut appelé à la dignité pontificale, comme l’aîné de ses fils.", "5473": "Le jour où il célébrait son entrée en fonctions, par un sacrifice public, Arsacé était venue au temple d’Isis :", "5474": "voyant là un jeune homme plein de grâce, dans la fleur de l’âge, embelli encore de tout l’éclat de la solennité qu’il accomplissait, elle jeta sur lui des regards de convoitise, et lui fit des gestes où se peignaient ses honteux désirs.", "5475": "Thya mis ne s’en aperçut même pas ;", "5476": "car il était naturellement chaste, et cette qualité avait été cultivée en lui avec soin dès l’enfance.", "5477": "Il était loin de soupçonner le sens et l’intention de ces gestes ;", "5478": "et, tout entier à son saint ministère, il supposait qu’ils devaient avoir quelque autre objet.", "5479": "Mais son frère Pétosiris, jaloux de lui à cause de la prêtrise, ayant observé les avances d’Arsacé, prit occasion de ses criminelles tentatives pour calomnier et perdre Thyamis.", "5480": "Il alla secrètement trouver Oroondatès, et, non content de lui dénoncer la passion d’Arsacé, il ajouta, contrairement à la vérité, que Thyamis était d’accord avec elle.", "5481": "Oroondatès crut facilement cet avis, qui ne faisait que confirmer ses soupçons antérieurs contre Arsacé ;", "5482": "cependant il ne témoigna aucun mécontentement contre elle, soit parce qu’il n’avait pas de preuve certaine, soit parce que la crainte, le respect du sang royal le forçaient à dissimuler, en dépit de ses soupçons.", "5483": "Quant à Thyamis, il ne cessa de le menacer ouvertement de la mort, et ne lui laissa aucun repos, qu'il ne l’eût forcé à s’exiler, pour installer à sa place Pétosiris dans les fonctions sacerdotales.III.", "5484": "Mais c’étaient là des faits déjà anciens, au moment où la multitude se précipita vers la demeure d’Arsacé pour lui apprendre l’attaque, qu’elle-même connaissait déjà d’ailleurs, et pour la prier d’enjoindre aux soldats dont elle disposait de sortir avec le peuple contre l’ennemi.", "5485": "Elle répondit qu’elle ne donnerait pas un pareil ordre à la légère, sans savoir encore ni quel était le nombre des assaillants, ni qui ils étaient et d’où ils venaient ;", "5486": "surtout sans connaître même les motifs de leur attaque.", "5487": "Il fallait, disaitelle, aller d’abord aux murs, tout observer de là, réunir d’autres troupes et agir dans les limites du possible.", "5488": "On applaudit à cette décision, et, sans désemparer, on courut aux murs.", "5489": "Arsacé y fit dresser une tente de drap d’or et de pourpre.", "5490": "Elle-même s’avança dans le plus somptueux appareil, et vint prendre place sur un trône élevé, autour duquel se rangèrent ses gardes sous leurs armes dorées et étincelantes.", "5491": "Elle fit élever un caducée, symbole d’une en trevue pacifique, et invita les premiers et les plus distin- gués des ennemis à s’approcher du mur.", "5492": "Thyamis et Théagène, choisis par leur troupe, s’avancèrent et s’arrêtèrent au pied du mur, complètement couverts de leurs armes, mais la tête nue.", "5493": "Le héraut prit alors la parole :", "5494": "« Voici ce que vous dit Arsacé, femme d’Oroondatès, le premier des satrapes, et sœur du

l’autre ;", "5515": "pour l’un elle sentait se raviver son ancien amour, pour l’autre elle éprouvait instantanément un sentiment plus vif encore, à tel point que les assistants même s’aperçurent de son trouble.", "5516": "Cependant, après quelques instants, elle se remit, semblable aux malheureux qui reviennent d’une attaque du mal sacré.", "5517": "« La guerre à laquelle vous songez, dit-elle,

touchez juste le but de ma propre pensée.", "5550": "J’ai l’intention de le vaincre, avec l’aide des Dieux, mais non de le tuer ;", "5551": "car à Dieu ne plaise que je me laisse jamais dominer par la colère et le ressentiment de mon injure au point de vouloir acheter la réparation d’une injustice passée et quelques honneurs pour l’avenir, au prix du sang d’un frère ;", "5552": "je ne veux point souiller mes mains du meurtre de celui qui a été porté par le même sein que moi.", "5553": "— Ces paroles, dit Théagène, sont d’un noble cœur, bien instruit de ce qu’on doit aux sentiments de la

cependant gagner beaucoup de terrain dans sa fuite ;", "5574": "il semblait à chaque instant sur le point d’être pris, et n’avait sur Thyamis que l’avance que devait naturellement prendre un homme

haut des murs, les uns s’étonnaient qu’il se ménageât si peu et se jetât ainsi au milieu des combattants les autres le croyaient fou et riaient de l’inutilité de sa poursuite.", "5594": "A la fin, le vieillard comprit que c’était son misérable accoutrement qui empêchait de le reconnaître ;", "5595": "il se dépouilla des haillons qui l’enveloppaient, délia et laissa flotter, à la manière des prêtres, sa longue chevelure, et, rejetant le fardeau qu’il portait sur l’épaule, le bâton qu’il tenait à la main, il se plaça devant eux et les frappa par son aspect vénérable et tout sacerdotal.",

Calasiris, avait de loin reconnu Théagène ;", "5610": "car l’œil do l’amant a une merveilleuse pénétration pour reconnaître l’objet aimé, à la démarche, à l’attitude seule, même de loin et par derrière, sur la simple apparence d’une forme qui le rappelle.", "5611": "Aussitôt, comme aiguillonnée par cette vue, elle s’élança vers lui avec une sorte de fureur, se jeta à son col, y resta

cette fête :", "5642": "entourée d’un corps nombreux de ses gardes, resplendissante au milieu du brillant cortège qu’elle traînait à sa suite, elle était venue déposer au temple d’Isis des colliers et une grande quantité d’or.", "5643": "En apparence elle ne faisait que suivre l’exemple de toute la ville ;", "5644": "en réalité ses regards étaient comme suspendus à Théagène seul ;", "5645": "personne autant qu’elle ne s’enivrait de sa contemplation.", "5646": "Sa joie cependant n’était pas sans quelque mélange :", "5647": "car la vue de Théagène, conduisant Chariclée par le bras et

sentiment par ceux qui l’entouraient, il se releva avec peine, fit des libations à la Déesse et lui adressa sa prière.", "5651": "Il ôta ensuite de sa tête la couronne, emblème du pontificat, et la déposa sur celle de son fils Thyamis, en déclarant au peuple qu’il était déjà vieux, et qu’il sentait d’ailleurs que sa fin était proche ;", "5652": "que les insignes des fonctions sacerdotales

dévotion à la Déesse.", "5657": "A la fin elle s’en alla, mais non sans tourner fréquemment la tête, pour voir Théagène aussi longtemps qu’elle le pourrait.", "5658": "De retour au palais, elle alla droit à sa chambre, se jeta sur son lit, toute parée, et y resta étendue sans prononcer une parole.", "5659": "Naturellement portée à la volupté, elle était en ce moment enflammée plus que jamais par la vue de l’irrésistible beauté de Théagène, beauté supérieure à tout ce qu’elle avait rencontré jusque-là.", "5660": "Toute la nuit elle demeura ainsi couchée, se retournant sans cesse d'un côté sur l’autre, poussant à chaque instant de profonds soupirs, tantôt se dressant sur les pieds, tantôt se laissant retomber sur les genoux, quelquefois demi-nue, et l’instant d’après se jetant à la renverse sur son lit.", "5661": "Soudain elle appelait une de ses femmes sans aucun motif, et la renvoyait aussitôt sans lui rien commander.", "5662": "En un mot, son amour allait insensiblement dégénérer en fureur, si une vieille servante, nommée Cybèle, sa camériste habituelle, ministre ordinaire de ses amours, ne fût entrée auprès d’elle.", "5663": "Elle vit aussitôt ce dont il s’agissait ;", "5664":

inconnue vous tourmente ?", "5668": "Quel est celui dont la vue trouble ainsi ma chère enfant ?", "5669": "Qui donc est assez présomptueux et insensé pour n’être point subjugué par votre incomparable beauté, pour ne point regarder comme la suprême félicité vos embrassements amoureux, pour dédaigner vos désirs et un simple signe de votre volonté ?", "5670": "Faites-le-moi seulement connaître, chère petite ;", "5671": "il n’est si dur cœur de diamant qui résiste à mes enchantements.", "5672": "Parlez, et rien ne tiendra devant votre volonté ;", "5673": "bien des fois déjà je crois vous en avoir

s’est terminé tout à coup, à peine commencé, s’est passé sans effusion de sang pour personne et a abouti à la paix ;", "5680": "mais il a été pour moi le commencement d’une guerre bien plus réelle, dans laquelle ce n’est point seulement un de mes membres, une partie de mon corps, c’est mon âme elle-même qui a été blessée :", "5681": "il m’a fait voir, pour mon malheur, ce jeune étranger qui courait aux côtés de Thyamis pendant le combat singulier.", "5682": "Tu connais certainement, ma bonne, celui dont je parle ;", "5683": "car sa beauté brillait d’un tel éclat et éclipsait tellement

chère amie, tu connais le trait qui m’a frappée ;", "5685": "c’est à toi maintenant de mettre en œuvre tous tes moyens, toutes les séductions de ta vieille habileté, toutes tes cajoleries, si tu veux sauver ton nourrisson :", "5686": "car je ne saurais vivre, si je ne le possède entièrement.", "5687": "— Je connais le jeune homme, dit la vieille :", "5688": "sa poitrine et ses épaules sont larges,

enfin ce jeune garçon aux cheveux bouclés, à la joue couronnée d’un blond duvet, au col duquel est venue tout à coup se jeter et se suspendre une fille étrangère assez belle, il est vrai, mais d’une rare impudence, à ce qu’il m’a semblé.", "5692": "— C’est celuilà même, ma petite mère, car tu me rappelles avec raison et tout à fait à point cette misérable, une de ces beautés communes et fardées, qui ont longtemps traîné dans les mauvais lieux, bien fière d’elle-même cependant et plus heureuse que moi, puisqu’elle possède un tel amant.", "5693": "» A ce tableau, la vieille sourit un instant en montrant les dents :", "5694": "« Ayez confiance, dit-elle, maîtresse :", "5695": "notre jeune étranger a bien pu la croire belle jusqu’ici ;", "5696": "mais si je lui procure le bonheur de vous posséder avec tous vos charmes, il changera, comme on dit, son cuivre pour de l’or et écartera du coude, comme une courtisane, cette belle qui se donne des airs et s’en fait accroire.", "5697": "— Si tu fais cela, ma chère petite Cybèle, tu m’auras d’un seul coup guéri de deux maux, l’amour et la jalousie, en donnant satisfaction à l’un et en me débarrassant de l’autre.", "5698": "— Vous serez satisfaite, reprit la vieille, autant du moins qu’il est en moi.", "5699": "Mais que je vous voie un peu reprendre vos sens ;", "5700": "soyez tranquille pour le moment ;", "5701": "ne vous mettez pas d’avance l’esprit à la torture, et ayez bon espoir.XI.", "5702": "Après cela, elle emporta la lampe, ferma la porte de la chambre et s’en alla.", "5703": "Le lendemain, à peine était-il jour, qu’elle prit avec elle un des eunuques royaux, se fit suivre par une autre servante, chargée de gâteaux et de tout ce qui était nécessaire pour un sacrifice, et se dirigea vers le temple d’Isis.", "5704":

vision favorable.", "5705": "Mais un des gardiens du temple l’empêcha d’entrer, et la renvoya en lui disant que le temple était tout en deuil.", "5706": "« Le pontife Calasiris, lui dit-il, de retour chez lui, après une longue absence, s’était le soir livré, avec ses amis les plus chers, à toute la joie d’un brillant festin ;", "5707": "jamais on ne l’avait vu plus libre d’esprit et plus joyeux.", "5708": "Après le repas, il fit des libations à la Déesse et lui adressa de longues et ferventes prières ;", "5709": "puis il dit à ses enfants que le moment était venu où ils ne verraient plus leur père ;", "5710": "il leur recommanda avec les plus vives instances d’avoir toute la sollicitude possible pour les jeunes Grecs qu’il avait amenés avec lui, et de les servir, autant qu’il serait en

supplice ;", "6588": "elle voulait se jouer en quelque sorte de leurs maux et les torturer davantage, en les enfermant dans la même prison, afin qu’ils pussent se voir l’un l’autre dans les fers et entre les mains des bourreaux.", "6589": "Car elle savait que les souffrances de la personne aimée sont plus sensibles à l’amant que les siennes propres.", "6590": "Mais c’était pour eux au contraire,

quel que soit le supplice qu’on nous réserve, le feu, l’eau ou le glaive, accordez-nous, comme grâce, de mourir tous deux d’une seule et même mort.", "6708": "» Chariclée leur adressa de son côté la même prière.", "6709": "Les eunuques versaient dos larmes ;", "6710": "car ils avaient compris, sans mot dire ;", "6711": "et ils les emmenèrent encore chargés de leurs fers.XIV.", "6712": "Quand ils furent hors du palais des satrapes, Eu- phratès demeura là :", "6713": "Bagoas et les cavaliers débarrassèrent les jeunes gens de la plus grande partie de leurs liens, ne laissant que ce qui était indispensable pour les garder sans les faire souffrir.", "6714": "Ils les placèrent chacun sur un cheval, firent cercle autour d’eux et poussèrent vers Thèbes de toute la vitesse de leurs montures.", "6715": "Toute la nuit ils marchèrent ainsi sans interruption ;", "6716": "et, le lendemain, à la troisième heure du jour, ils n’avaient pas encore mis pied à terre.", "6717": "A ce moment, épuisés par les brûlantes ardeurs du soleil, sous le ciel d’Égypte et en plein été, accablés par l’insomnie, touchés surtout do l’état de Chariclée qu’ils voyaient brisée par le mouvement prolongé du cheval, ils résolurent de s’arrêter quelque part pour respirer un peu, faire souffler leurs chevaux et donner à la jeune fille le temps de reprendre haleine.", "6718": "Le rivage du Nil forme en cet endroit comme un promontoire contre lequel vient se briser le courant ;", "6719": "le fleuve, forcé à dévier do sa direction, s’infléchit, forme un demi-cercle, et revenant ensuite sur lui-même parallèlement à sa première déviation, embrasse dans son contour une sorte de presqu’île, couverte de brillantes prairies, grâce à l’eau qui l’enveloppe do tous côtés.", "6720": "L’herbe et le fourrage y naissent spontanément et offrent aux troupeaux d’abondants pâturages.", "6721": "Le pêcher, le sycomore et tous les arbres qu’on voit ordinairement affectionner les bords du Nil, couvrent et ombragent la prairie.", "6722": "Bagoas et ses compagnons s’arrêtèrent en cet endroit et s’abritèrent sous les arbres en guise de tente.", "6723": "Bagoas prit quelque nourriture et en fit accepter à Théagène et à Chariclée, malgré le refus qu’ils avaient opposé d’abord, sous prétexte qu’il était superflu de rien prendre quand on devait bientôt mourir.", "6724": "Il leur affirma qu’ils n’avaient rien de pareil à craindre et leur apprit qu’il les conduisait non pas à la mort, mais auprès d’Oroondatès.XV.", "6725": "Lorsque la chaleur brûlante de midi eut un peu cédé, et que le soleil, au lieu de tomber à plomb, se fut rapproché du couchant et n’envoya plus ses rayons qu’obliquement, la troupe de Bagoas se disposa à se remettre en marche.", "6726": "Mais à ce moment parut un cavalier, soutenant à peine son cheval inondé de sueur, et haletant lui-même, on le voyait, d’une course longue et soutenue.", "6727": "Après avoir dit à Bagoas quelques mots en particulier, il alla se reposer.", "6728": "Bagoas baissa un instant la tête et parut méditer sur la nouvelle qu’il venait de recevoir :", "6729": "« Étrangers, dit-il ensuite, ayez bon courage ;", "6730": "justice vous est faite de votre ennemie.",

persécutrice n’est plus sur votre route.", "6738": "En leur parlant ainsi, Bagoas s’était placé debout à côté d’eux ;", "6739": "il balbutiait péniblement la langue grecque ;", "6740": "sa parole était traînante et incorrecte ;", "6741": "mais on voyait qu’il éprouvait lui-même un certain plaisir à leur annoncer cette nouvelle ;", "6742": "la vie honteuse et la tyrannie d’Arsacé lui pesaient ;", "6743": "il désirait d’un autre côté consoler et réconforter ces jeunes gens :", "6744": "car il espérait, ce qui était beaucoup pour lui, qu’Oroondatès lui saurait infiniment de gré de lui amener, sains et saufs, un jeune homme qui éclipserait tous les autres serviteurs du satrape, et une jeune fille d’une incomparable beauté, dont il pourrait faire sa femme, maintenant qu’Arsacé était morte.", "6745": "Théagène et Chariclée se réjouirent aussi à cette nouvelle ;", "6746": "ils rendirent grâce aux Dieux tout-puissants et à la Justice.", "6747": "Il ne pouvait plus leur arriver mal désormais, pensaient-ils, quand bien même les plus rudes épreuves les attendraient, puisque leur ennemie acharnée était à terre.", "6748": "Ainsi quelquefois la mort même est douce, du moment où l’on a la joie de voir auparavant succomber ses ennemis.", "6749": "Sur le soir, une brise légère s’étan't répandue dans l’air, et une agréable fraîcheur les invitant à continuer leur route, ils poussèrent en avant.", "6750": "Ils marchèrent ainsi le reste de la soirée, la nuit suivante et la matinée du lendemain, faisant toute diligence afin de rencontrer, s’il était possible, Oroondatès à Thèbes.", "6751": "Mais ils n’y purent parvenir, un émissaire envoyé de l’armée, qu’ils rencontrèrent en route, leur ayant appris que déjà le satrape n’était plus à Thèbes.", "6752": "Lui-même était envoyé pour faire diriger en toute hâte sur Syène tous les soldats armés, même ceux laissés à la garde des villes :", "6753": "car la confusion était partout ;", "6754": "il était à craindre que la ville ne fût prise et que le satrape n’arrivât trop tard, l’invasion de l’armée éthiopienne ayant devancé toute nouvelle.", "6755": "Aussitôt Bagoas quitta la route de Thèbes, et poussa sur Syène.XVI.", "6756": "Déjà ils approchaient, lorsqu’ils tombèrent dans une embuscade.", "6757": "C’était un corps nombreux de jeunes Éthiopiens bien armés, qui avaient été envoyés en avant pour éclairer la route et s’assurer par leur propre expérience que toute l’armée pouvait avancer en sûreté.", "6758": "Arrêtés par la nuit et l’ignorance des lieux (car ils avaient ordre de se porter le plus loin qu’ils pourraient en avant des leurs), ils se jetèrent dans un fourré au bord du fleuve et y passèrent toute la nuit, éveillés et en alerte, tant pour se garder de toute surprise que pour surprendre eux-mêmes les ennemis.", "6759": "Au point du jour, ils virent passer Bagoas et ses cavaliers.", "6760": "Après avoir reconnu à travers les broussailles qu’ils étaient peu nombreux, ils leur laissèrent prendre un peu d’avance, pour se bien assurer qu’ils n’étaient pas suivis par d’autres ;", "6761": "puis ils se précipitèrent tout à coup hors du marais, en poussant de grands cris, et se mirent à leur poursuite.", "6762": "Bagoas et ses cavaliers furent consternés de cette clameur imprévue ;", "6763": "ils virent bien à la couleur que c’étaient des Éthiopiens, et reconnurent en même temps à leur nombre qu’il était impossible de leur tenir tête ;", "6764": "car ce corps d’éclaireurs ne formait pas moins de mille hommes armés à la légère.", "6765": "Sans prendre même le temps de les examiner attentivement, ils se mirent à fuir, mais avec moins de rapidité d’abord qu’ils n’auraient pu, et de manière à ne pas laisser croire qu’ils se sauvaient en désordre.", "6766": "Les Éthiopiens se mirent à leur poursuite et lancèrent en avant tous les Troglodytes qu’ils avaient avec eux, au nombre d’environ deux cents.", "6767": "Ces Troglodytes sont une peuplade éthiopienne, nomade et confinant aux Arabes.", "6768": "La légèreté à la course est chez eux une qualité naturelle, perfectionnée dès l’enfance par l’exercice.", "6769": "L’habitude de porter des armes pesantes leur est complètement inconnue.", "6770": "Dans les combats ils escarmouchent de loin, armés de la fronde, et mettent leurs adversaires en désordre à la première attaque ;", "6771": "ou, s’ils se sentent inférieurs, ils s’esquivent et s’enfuient au plus vite.", "6772": "L’ennemi ne cherche même pas à les poursuivre, sachant qu’ils ont des ailes pour la course et qu’ils se dérobent en se cachant dans des souterrains étroits d’embouchure, et dans les cavernes les plus ignorées des rochers.", "6773": "Quoique à pied, ils ne tardèrent pas à atteindre les cavaliers, et parvinrent même à en blesser quelques-uns à coups de fronde.", "6774": "Cependant, lorsque ceux-ci se retournèrent contre eux, ils n’attendirent pas leur choc et s’enfuirent de toute leur vitesse vers le gros de leur troupe qu’ils avaient laissée bien loin en arrière.", "6775": "A cette vue, les Perses, enhardis par leur petit nombre, les attaquèrent à leur tour sans hésiter et balayèrent en un instant tout ce qui se trouvait devant eux ;", "6776": "puis ils reprirent leur course rapide, pressant leurs chevaux de l’éperon et les lançant à toute bride tant qu’ils avaient de force et d’haleine.", "6777": "Ils ne tardèrent pas à se mettre hors de portée, en se jetant derrière un coude du Nil, où l’élévation des rives et les massifs d’arbres interposés les dérobèrent à la vue de l’ennemi.", "6778": "Mais Bagoas fut jeté à terre par son cheval qui s’abattit :", "6779": "blessé d’une cuisse, au point de ne pouvoir faire un mouvement, il tomba aux mains de l’ennemi.", "6780": "Théagène et Chariclée furent pris également.", "6781": "Vraisemblablement ils auraient pu s’échapper ;", "6782": "mais ils mirent pied à terre, ne pouvant se résigner à abandonner Bagoas, qui leur avait témoigné jusque-là tant d’égards, et sur lequel ils n’avaient pas moins compté pour l’avenir.", "6783": "Un autre motif, plus puissant encore, les avait décidés à se rendre volontairement ;", "6784": "Théagène avait dit à Chariclée :", "6785": "« C’est là mon songe ;", "6786": "ce sont les Éthiopiens au pays desquels il est dans notre destinée d’étre emmenés captifs ;", "6787": "mieux vaut nous remettre entre leurs mains et préférer à un danger indubitable auprès d’Oroondatès les chances d’une fortune au moins incertaine.", "6788": "»XVII.", "6789": "Chariclée, de son côté, sentit alors que les destinées la conduisaient désormais comme par la main ;", "6790": "elle commença à espérer un meilleur avenir, et vit dans ceux qui venaient à eux plutôt des amis que des ennemis.", "6791": "Sans rien dire cependant à Théagène de ce qu’elle pensait, elle lui fit signe qu’elle ne voulait avoir d’autre avis que le sien.", "6792": "Les Éthiopiens s’étant approchés, reconnurent à première vue que Bagoas était un eunuque et non un homme de guerre.", "6793": "Lorsqu’ils aperçurent sans armes et enchaînés deux jeunes gens aussi remarquables par leur beauté que par leur jeunesse, ils leur demandèrent qui ils étaient.", "6794": "Un Égyptien, enrôlé parmi eux et qui parlait aussi le perse, fut chargé de les interroger, espérant qu’ils entendraient au moins l’une des deux langues.", "6795": "Car les éclaireurs, les espions envoyés pour observer ce qui se fait et ce qui se dit, ont appris de la nécessité à emmener avec eux des interprètes qui parlent la même langue, le même idiome que les ennemis.", "6796": "Théagène, déjà familiarisé par un long séjour avec la langue égyptienne, comprit d’autant mieux la question qu’elle était courte.", "6797": "Il répondit que l’eunuque était un des premiers dignitaires du satrape des Perses ;", "6798": "que luimême et Chariclée étaient Grecs, prisonniers des Perses auparavant, et maintenant, pour leur bonheur peut-être, livrés par la fortune aux mains des Éthiopiens.", "6799": "Ceux-ci résolurent de les emmener prisonniers afin d’offrir à leur roi, comme les prémices et la plus noble partie de leurs prises, ce que le satrape possédait de plus précieux :", "6800": "car, dans la cour des rois perses, les eunuques sont l’œil et l’oreille du prince ;", "6801": "ils n’ont ni enfants, ni famille pour partager leur affection, et dépendent uniquement de ceux qui ont mis en eux leur confiance.", "6802": "Quant aux jeunes gens, ils les regardaient comme un présent de grand prix à offrir au roi pour le service de la cour.", "6803": "Ils les placèrent donc sur des chevaux, l’un parce qu’il était blessé, les autres parce que leurs liens ne leur auraient pas permis de suivre l’armée dans ses rapides mouvements, et ils les emmenèrent.", "6804": "On eût cru réellement assister au prologue, au début d’un drame :", "6805": "des prisonniers chargés de chaînes, après avoir vu quelques instants auparavant la mort suspendue sur leur tête, étaient entraînés ou plutôt conduits solennellement, dans l’attitude de simples captifs, gardés par ceux qui bientôt après devaient être leurs sujets.", "6806": "Telle était alors leur situation.I.", "6807": "Cependant, la ville de Syène était entièrement investie et comme prise dans un filet par les Éthiopiens.", "6808": "Oroondatès, informé qu’ils allaient bientôt paraître, et que, laissant derrière eux les cataractes, ils marchaient directement sur Syène, les avait prévenus de peu de temps et s’était jeté dans la ville.", "6809": "Il fit fermer les portes, disposer sur les murailles des traits, des armes et des machines, et attendit les événements.", "6810": "Le roi des Éthiopiens, Hydaspe, prévenu à distance par ses éclaireurs que les Perses devaient se jeter dans Syène, avait, de son côté, forcé de marche pour l’occuper avant eux.", "6811": "Mais, étant arrivé trop tard, il mena son armée à l’attaque de la ville.", "6812": "Une fois ses troupes répandues autour des murailles, il se contenta d’abord d’observer la place, sans livrer aucun combat, entassant aux abords de Syène une multitude innombrable d’hommes, d’animaux et d’armes.", "6813": "C’est là que les éclaireurs le rencontrèrent et lui amenèrent les prisonniers.", "6814": "Hydaspe contempla avec un certain plaisir ces jeunes gens, et, par une sorte d’inspiration de l’âme, se montra dès le premier moment bienveillant pour ses enfants, même sans les connaître.", "6815": "Mais il accueillit surtout avec joie ce présage de prisonniers qu’on amenait enchaînés.", "6816": "« A merveille, dit-il ;", "6817": "cette première prise montre que les Dieux nous livrent nos ennemis enchaînés.", "6818": "Que ces premiers prisonniers soient réservés pour les prémices de la guerre ;", "6819": "qu’on les garde comme victimes triomphales, afin de les offrir en sacrifice aux Dieux du pays, suivant l’antique loi éthiopienne.", "6820": "» Après avoir fait des présents aux éclaireurs, il les envoya aux bagages, ainsi que les captifs, assigna à ces derniers un certain nombre de gardes qui parlaient leur langue, et recommanda de les traiter à tous égards avec le plus grand soin.", "6821": "Ordre fut donné de leur fournir une nourriture abondante, de les garder purs de toute souillure, comme des victimes désormais consacrées, et de remplacer leurs chaînes de fer par des chaînes d’or.", "6822": "Car en Éthiopie l’or est employé aux mêmes usages qu’ailleurs le fer.II.", "6823": "On se conforma à ces instructions.", "6824": "En se voyant enlever leurs premiers liens, ils avaient conçu quelque espoir de vivre libres désormais ;", "6825": "mais, quand ils s’aperçurent qu’ils n’avaient rien gagné et qu’on les chargeait de chaînes d’or, Théagène se mit à rire :", "6826": "« Bons Dieux !", "6827": "s’écria-t-il, le magnifique changement !", "6828": "Ce sont là pour nous les brillantes faveurs de la fortune ;", "6829": "nous échangeons le fer contre de l’or ;", "6830": "riches de notre servitude, nous sommes devenus des prisonniers de plus haut prix.", "6831": "» Chariclée sourit de son côté ;", "6832": "pour changer le cours des pensées de Théagène et relever son courage, elle lui rappela les prédictions des Dieux et s’efforça de faire luire à ses yeux de meilleures espérances.", "6833": "Cependant Hydaspe, qui avait attaqué Syène avec l’espoir d’emporter d’emblée les murs et la ville, se voyait presque repoussé par les assiégés.", "6834": "Non contents d’opposer une vigoureuse résistance, ils raillaient les assaillants et provoquaient leur colère par d’injurieux propos.", "6835": "Aussi Hydaspe, courroucé de ce qu’ils eussent même songé à résister, au lieu de se soumettre tout d’abord et de leur plein gré, résolut de ne point perdre de temps avec son armée dans les lenteurs d’un siège ordinaire.", "6836": "Au lieu de prendre la ville par des moyens qui, tout en mettant à sa discrétion une partie des habitants, auraient peut-être permis au reste de lui échapper, il imagina un genre d’attaque qui exigeait d’immenses travaux, mais d’un effet inévitable, pour détruire la ville de fond en comble en quelques instants.III.", "6837": "Voici comment il s’y prit :", "6838": "tout le pourtour de la ville fut divisé en un certain nombre de lots, et chaque lot, d’une longueur de dix brasses, fut assigné à une escouade de dix hommes, avec ordre d’y creuser un fossé, le plus large et le plus profond possible.", "6839": "Le travail commença aussitôt ;", "6840": "pendant que les uns creusaient, les autres emportaient les déblais ;", "6841": "d’autres les amoncelaient et les disposaient en talus, de manière à former une nouvelle muraille en face de celle de la ville assiégée.", "6842": "Personne ne s’opposait à ce travail, et la circonvallation ne rencontrait aucun obstacle ;", "6843": "car on n’osait pas sortir de la ville contre une armée innombrable, et les traits lancés du haut des créneaux restaient d’ailleurs sans effet, Hydaspe ayant à dessein laissé entre les deux murs un intervalle tel que les travailleurs fussent hors de la portée des traits.", "6844": "Ce premier ouvrage achevé avec une incroyable rapidité, grâce au nombre prodigieux de bras qui y étaient employés sans relâche, il en fit commencer un autre.", "6845": "L’enceinte de circonvallation, interrompue sur une étendue d’un demi-plèthre, laissait tout cet espace parfaitement libre de tout obstacle.", "6846": "Chacune des deux extrémités du retranchement fut reliée à une chaussée dirigée perpendiculairement au Nil et s’élevant graduellement jusqu’au fleuve.", "6847": "On eût dit deux longs murs conservant toujours entre eux dans toute leur étendue la même distance d’un demi-plèthre, et d’une longueur égale à la distance de Syéne au Nil.", "6848": "Lorsque les chaussées eurent atteint la jetée du fleuve, Hydaspe y lit pratiquer une ouverture et déversa le courant dans le canal formé par les deux digues.", "6849": "Les eaux, tombant de haut en bas, et s’engouffrant de l’immense bassin du Nil dans un étroit conduit, se brisaient en mugissant contre cette barrière artificielle, se précipitaient avec un bruit furieux, indicible, à travers l’ouverture, et s’amoncelaient dans le canal avec un fracas, qui retentissait au loin.", "6850": "Frappés de ce bruit, et voyant par eux-mêmes ce dont il s’agissait, les Syéniens comprirent à quelle terrible extrémité ils étaient réduits, et que le but de la circonvallation était de les noyer.", "6851": "Il ne leur était plus possible de s’échapper de la ville, enfermés par le retranchement et par les eaux qui déjà approchaient et leur fermaient toute issue ;", "6852": "y rester n’était pas non plus sans péril, ils le voyaient bien.", "6853": "Cependant ils mirent en œuvre pour leur salut toutes les ressources qu’ils avaient sous la main :", "6854": "d’abord ils bouchèrent les interstices des portes avec des étoupes et du bitume ;", "6855": "ensuite ils étayèrent et consolidèrent leurs murailles :", "6856": "celui-ci apportait de la terre, celui-là des pierres, un autre du bois, chacun enfin ce qui lui tombait sous la main.", "6857": "Personne ne restait oisif ;", "6858": "femmes, enfants, vieillards, tous travaillaient également.", "6859": "Car quand il s’agit de la vie, on accueille également toute espèce de concours, sans exception d’âge ni de sexe.", "6860": "Les plus robustes, ceux qui étaient en état de porter les armes, avaient mission de creuser un étroit souterrain, allant de la ville au retranchement des ennemis.IV. Voici comment fut conduit ce travail :", "6861": "à peu de distance du mur d’enceinte on creusa perpendiculairement un puits d’environ cinq brasses de profondeur ;", "6862": "au fond on ouvrit, à la lueur de torches, une galerie horizontale, qui passait sous les fondements et se dirigeait en droite ligne vers la circonvallation.", "6863": "Les déblais, passés de main en main au moyen d’une chaîne continue, étaient transportés et amon celés dans une partie de la ville occupée dès longtemps par des jardins.", "6864": "Leur but était d’ouvrir par ce conduit une issue à l’eau, si elle venait à les envahir.", "6865": "Mais la soudaineté du mal déjoua leurs calculs ;", "6866": "déjà le Nil, débouchant du grand canal, so précipitait avec violence autour de l’enceinte, envahissait tout et transformait en lac l’intervalle entre les deux murs, Syène ne forma bientôt plus qu’une île :", "6867": "une ville de terre ferme surgissait au milieu des flots, battue de tous côtés par les eaux du Nil.", "6868": "D’abord le mur tint bon pendant une petite partie du jour :", "6869": "mais quand les eaux accumulées commencèrent à monter ;", "6870": "quand, se frayant un passage à travers les crevasses d’une argile noire et grasse fendue par les chaleurs de l’été, elles eurent pénétré profondément le sol et passé sous les fondements, alors la terre détrempée céda sous le poids de la masse.", "6871": "Le sol effondré venant à s’affaisser, les murs s’inclinèrent et annoncèrent en tremblant sur leur base l’imminence du danger.", "6872": "Les créneaux s’agitaient, les défenseurs même oscillaient entraînés dans le mouvement.V.", "6873": "Vers le soir, une partie de la muraille, comprise entre deux tours, s’écroula, sans pourtant descendre au-dessous du niveau des eaux, et sans leur ouvrir encore passage.", "6874": "Mais, comme une hauteur de cinq coudées seulement séparait la ville de l’inondation, on tremblait sous le coup d’une menace incessante.", "6875": "Des gémissements confus s’élevaient de la ville et arrivaient jusqu’au camp ennemi.", "6876": "Ils levaient les mains au ciel, leur seul espoir désormais ;", "6877": "ils invoquaient les Dieux sauveurs, et suppliaient Oroondatès d’envoyer faire à Hydaspe des propositions.", "6878": "Il céda, esclave malgré lui de la fortune contraire.", "6879": "Mais comme il était de tous côtés investi par les eaux, et sans moyen de faire arriver un messager jusqu’aux ennemis, la nécessité lui suggéra un expédient.", "6880": "Il écrivit ce qu’il désirait, attacha l’écrit à une pierre et fit lancer son message à l’ennemi avec une fronde, espérant que cette requête sous forme de trait arriverait au delà de l’eau.", "6881": "Mais ce fut sans succès :", "6882": "le jet de la pierre fut trop court, et elle tomba dans l’eau.", "6883": "Le même écrit, lancé une seconde fois, n’arriva pas davantage au but.", "6884": "En vain tous les archers et les frondeurs rivalisèrent d’ardeur, sentant bien que leur vie était le prix du succès ;", "6885": "tous échouèrent également.", "6886": "A la fin, tendant les mains vers les ennemis qui, du haut des levées, se faisaient un spectacle de leurs misères, ils leur firent comprendre autant que possible, par leurs gestes suppliants, la prière que les traits n’avaient pu leur porter.", "6887": "Tantôt ils leur représentaient leurs bras ouverts et dirigés vers la terre, en signe de supplication ;", "6888": "tantôt ils les croisaient sur le dos comme pour recevoir des fers et montrer qu’ils se soumettaient à l’esclavage.", "6889": "Hydaspe reconnut bien qu’ils demandaient la vie sauve ;", "6890": "il était d’ailleurs disposé à la leur accorder ;", "6891": "car, pour une âme élevée, un ennemi qui se soumet commande la pitié :", "6892": "mais ne pouvant rien pour eux dans le moment, il résolut de mieux s’assurer encore de leurs dispositions.", "6893": "Il avait précédemment fait préparer des bateaux de transport, les avait introduits du Nil dans l’intérieur des levées par la coupure de la jetée, et les y avait amarrés.", "6894": "Il en choisit dix nouvellement construits, les chargea d’archers parfaitement armés, les instruisit de ce qu’ils avaient à dire et les envoya vers les Perses.", "6895": "Les archers s’avancèrent couverts de leurs armes, afin d’être prêts à se défendre, si, contre toute attente, les assiégés tentaient quelque chose du haut des murs.", "6896": "C’était un spectacle étrange et nouveau :", "6897": "des vaisseaux faisaient voile d’une muraille contre une muraille ;", "6898": "des matelots dirigeaient leurs bâtiments au milieu des terres ;", "6899": "une flotte voguait au-dessus des champs de labour.", "6900": "La guerre, mère de toutes nouveautés, se surpassait en quelque sorte elle-même par des merveilles inouïes jusque-là, elle mettait aux prises des forces navales avec des assiégés défendant leurs murs, des soldats de terre avec des troupes combattant sur un lac.", "6901": "Lorsque ceux de la ville virent des barques, montées par des soldats armés, se diriger vers le point où le mur s’était écroulé, l’effroi qui pesait déjà sur eux, les terreurs que leur inspiraient les dangers dont ils étaient environnés, les disposèrent à ne voir que des ennemis dans ceux qui venaient pour les sau- ver (car dans les dangers extrêmes, tout est sujet de défiance et de trouble) ;", "6902": "ils se mirent à lancer des traits du haut des murs et à viser aux bâtiments.", "6903": "Ainsi dans une situation désespérée, les hommes se figurent toujours avoir beaucoup gagné s’ils diffèrent, ne fût-ce que d’une heure, l’instant de leur mort.", "6904": "Cependant, ils ne tiraient pas de manière à blesser ;", "6905": "ils ne visaient qu’à écarter les bâtiments qui cinglaient vers eux.", "6906": "Les Éthiopiens répondirent à cette attaque ;", "6907": "et, comme ils visaient plus juste, ne connaissant pas encore les intentions des Perses, ils en blessèrent deux ou trois, si rudement et si inopinément, qu’ils tombèrent la tête en avant, hors des murs, et furent lancés dans les flots.", "6908": "Les assiégés ne ripostaient que mollement ;", "6909": "mais les Éthiopiens attaquaient avec fureur et le combat allait s’échauffer, lorsqu’un des Syéniens, homme d’âge et d’autorité, courut aux murs au milieu des combattants :", "6910": "« Pauvres insensés !", "6911": "leur dit-il ;", "6912": "vos malheurs vous troublent la raison :", "6913": "ceux que nous appelions tout à l’heure par nos supplications, dont nous ne cessions d’invoquer l’appui, ils arrivent contre tout espoir, et nous les repoussons !", "6914": "S’ils viennent comme amis, avec des propositions de paix, nous leur devrons notre salut ;", "6915": "si, au contraire, ils viennent avec des intentions hostiles, nous en aurons aisément raison, mais après qu’ils auront abordé.", "6916": "A supposer même que nous les écrasions tous, qu’aurions-nous gagné, quand une telle nuée d’ennemis enveloppe la ville et par terre et par eau ?", "6917": "Recevons-les donc et sachons ce qu’ils veulent.", "6918": "» Tous approuvèrent son avis, et le satrape lui-même s’y rangea.", "6919": "Les soldats s’établirent de part et d’autre de la muraille écroulée, et se tinrent immobiles, les armes au repos.VI.", "6920": "Quand l’intervalle entre les deux tours fut vide de combattants et que les habitants eurent fait signe, en agitant des lambeaux d’étoffe, qu’ils permettaient l’abordage, les Éthiopiens approchèrent.", "6921": "Du haut de leurs bâtiments, qui leur tenaient lieu de tribune, ils parlèrent ainsi à l’assemblée des assiégés :", "6922": "« Perses et Syéniens qui nous écoutez, Hydaspe, roi, des Éthiopiens de l’Orient et l’Occident, votre roi maintenant, sait dompter ses ennemis ;", "6923": "mais il sait aussi prendre pitié des suppliants :", "6924": "car il voit dans la victoire une preuve de valeur, et dans la commisération une marque de générosité ;", "6925": "l’une témoigne de la vigueur guerrière de son bras, l’autre de ses propres sentiments.", "6926": "Il dépend de lui que vous soyez ou que vous ne soyez pas ;", "6927": "mais, cédant à vos prières, il vous fait remise des calamités de la guerre, maintenant inévitables, évidentes à tous les yeux.", "6928": "Quant aux conditions auxquelles vous vous rachèterez de ces maux, il vous en laisse le choix, sans rien fixer lui-même.", "6929": "Car Hydaspe n’est point un tyran qui méprise les lois de la justice ;", "6930": "c’est un roi qui gouverne les hommes sans donner prise à la haine.", "6931": "» A ces propositions, les Syéniens répondirent qu’ils se mettaient, sans conditions, eux, leurs enfants et leurs femmes, à la discrétion d’Hydaspe ;", "6932": "que s’ils échappaient à la destruction, ils lui remettraient leur ville ;", "6933": "mais que, maintenant encore, elle était comme suspendue sans espoir sur l’abîme, à moins que les Dieux et Hydaspe ne trouvassent quelque moyen de prévenir sa ruine.", "6934": "Oroondatès déclara de son côté qu’il renonçait aux objets en litige, cause et prix de la guerre :", "6935": "il offrit d’abandonner la ville de Philé et les mines de diamant.", "6936": "Mais il demanda à n’être point réduit à la nécessité de se livrer lui et ses soldats ;", "6937": "il priait Hydaspe de pousser la générosité jusqu’au bout, et de leur permettre de se retirer à Éléphantis, à la condition de ne causer aucun dommage et de ne point porter les armes contre lui.", "6938": "Peu lui importait, dit-il, d’être tué maintenant, si l’on devait, en lui faisant la vie, l’exposer à être mis à mort par le roi des Perses comme traître à son armée.", "6939": "La condition même serait pire, puisque maintenant on lui ferait sans doute souffrir simplement la mort, à la manière accoutumée, tandis qu’alors on le soumettrait aux plus affreuses tortures, aux plus cruels raffinements de barbarie.VII.", "6940": "Après cette réponse, il les pria de recevoir sur leurs bâtiments deux Perses qu’il voulait, disait-il, envoyer à Éléphantis ;", "6941": "promettant, d’ailleurs, si les habitants voulaient se rendre, de ne pas hésiter à en faire autant de son côté.", "6942": "Les Éthiopiens repartirent avec ces propositions, emmenèrent avec eux les deux Perses, et allèrent tout rapporter au roi.", "6943": "Hydaspe sourit et se moqua fort de la sottise d’Oroondatès, qui prétendait traiter sur le pied de l’égalité, quand déjà il était la propriété d’un autre, quand sa vie et sa mort étaient chose incertaine et qui ne relevait plus de lui.", "6944": "« Mais, dit-il, il ne serait pas raisonnable que la folie d’un seul causât la ruine de tant d’hommes ;", "6945": "» et il autorisa les envoyés d’Oroondatès à se rendre à Éléphantis, affectant de ne faire aucun cas de la résistance qu’ils pourraient provoquer.", "6946": "En même temps, il ordonna à une partie des siens de fermer la coupure pratiquée pour la dérivation du Nil, pendant que d’autres ouvriraient dans la circonvallation une issue pour les eaux.", "6947": "De cette manière, le courant cessant d’arriver et une voie d’écoulement étant ouverte aux eaux accumulées autour de la ville, le terrain s’assainirait plus vite et deviendrait praticable.", "6948": "Ils se mirent incontinent à l’œuvre ;", "6949": "mais ils ne purent exécuter qu’une faible portion du travail, et durent remettre au lendemain pour le terminer ;", "6950": "car ils furent surpris par le soir et la nuit, peu de temps après avoir reçu cet ordre.VIII.", "6951": "Cependant les habitants de la ville ne négligeaient aucun moyen de défense en leur pouvoir, et, dans une situation désespérée, ils n’oubliaient rien de ce qui pouvait contribuer à leur salut.", "6952": "Les uns creusaient la galerie souterraine, et déjà ils se croyaient à peu de distance de la circonvallation, autant qu’ils pouvaient en juger en comparant la distance du mur à la levée, estimée à l’œil, avec la longueur du souterrain, mesurée à la corde.", "6953": "D’autres relevaient aux flambeaux le pan de mur écroulé.", "6954": "Cette reconstruction, du reste, était facile, les pierres, au moment de la chute, ayant été jetées à l’intérieur.", "6955": "Mais, au moment même où ils croyaient avoir suffisamment pourvu à leur sûreté pour le présent, ils se trouvèrent sous le coup de nouvelles terreurs :", "6956": "vers le milieu de la nuit, la partie de la levée que les Éthiopiens avaient commencé à couper la veille, se rompit tout à coup :", "6957": "peut-être, la terre accumulée en cet endroit étant légère et sans consistance, la base céda-t-elle, du moment où elle fut pénétrée par l’eau ;", "6958": "peut-être aussi ceux qui creusaient le souterrain ayant miné le dessous des terrassements, ceux-ci se trouvèrentils entraînés dans le vide.", "6959": "On peut supposer aussi que l’étroite tranchée pratiquée la veille occupant la partie la plus basse des ouvrages, il arriva un moment où l’eau, en montant, la remplit, et que la voie, une fois ouverte, alla s’élargissant sans qu'on s’en aperçût ;", "6960": "à moins pourtant qu’on n’aime mieux voir là un secours tout providentiel.", "6961": "Quoi qu’il en soit, il se lit un si horrible fracas que chacun, en l’entendant, se sentit glacé de terreur :", "6962": "on ne savait ce qui arrivait ;", "6963": "mais tous, Éthiopiens et Syéniens, s’imaginèrent que la plus grande partie des murs de la ville s’était écroulée.", "6964": "Mais les Éthiopiens, qui se savaient en sûreté, restèrent tranquilles dans leur camp, attendant patiemment le jour pour savoir exactement à quoi s’en tenir.", "6965": "Ceux de la ville, au contraire, coururent de toutes parts autour des murs.", "6966": "Chacun, voyant le rempart intact de son côté, s’imaginait que l’accident était arrivé sur un autre point.", "6967": "A la fin, le jour venant à paraître dissipa ce nuage de vagues terreurs qui les environnait ;", "6968": "car on voyait distinctement la digue rompue, et l’eau s’était subitement retirée.", "6969": "Les Éthiopiens, de leur côté, obstruaient l’entrée de la prise d’eau, au moyen d’un barrage formé de planches agencées ensemble et assujetties en dehors par de grosses pièces de bois.", "6970": "En même temps des milliers de travailleurs y jetaient de la terre et des fascines, les uns de dessus la digue, les autres avec des bateaux.", "6971": "De cette façon l’eau fut bientôt étanchée.", "6972": "Cependant les communications n’étaient encore possibles ni d’un côté ni de l’autre;", "6973": "car la terre était couverte d’un limon profond, et, sous la surface, desséchée en apparence, se cachaient des mares fangeuses, véritables pièges où venaient également s’enfoncer hommes et chevaux.IX.", "6974": "Ils passèrent ainsi deux ou trois jours, les Syéniens laissant leurs portes ouvertes et les Éthiopiens restant désarmés en signe de paix.", "6975": "Il y avait trêve, mais sans rapports réciproques.", "6976": "On ne posait plus de gardes ni d’un côté ni de l’autre ;", "6977": "ceux de la ville surtout se livraient aux réjouissances :", "6978": "car, c’était l’époque où se célèbre le Niloa, la plus grande fête des Égyptiens, qui tombe vers le solstice d’été, au moment où commence la crue du fleuve.", "6979": "C’est de toutes les fêtes celle que les Égyptiens solennisent avec le plus d’éclat, et en voici la raison :", "6980": "les Égyptiens divinisent le Nil ;", "6981": "ils le regardent même comme le plus grand des Dieux et le proclament le rival du ciel, parce qu’il arrose leurs terres sans l’intervention des nuées ni des pluies, et qu’il remplace pour eux, chaque année, l’eau du ciel par ses débordements réguliers.", "6982": "Telle est, du moins, la croyance populaire.", "6983": "Ceux qui cherchent à ce culte une explication plus élevée disent que le concours de l’humide et du sec est pour l’homme le principe de l’existence et de la vie, les autres éléments étant inhérents à ceux-là et se manifestant avec eux.", "6984": "L’humide est le Nil ;", "6985": "leur territoire constitue le second principe.", "6986": "Cette manière de voir est également du domaine public.", "6987": "Mais les initiés aux mystères disent qu’Isis est la terre et Osiris le Nil, substituant ainsi des mots à des choses réelles.", "6988": "Ils prétendent que la Déesse soupire après son époux absent, qu’elle se réjouit de sa présence, s’afflige de nouveau à son départ et qu’elle redoute comme un ennemi le Typhon.", "6989": "Ces initiés, adonnés à la contemplation de la nature et des choses divines, ne révèlent point aux profanes les véritées répandues sous ces symboles, et se contentent de les leur faire pressentir sous forme de mythes, réservant à ceux qui sont plus versés dans la science, plus avant dans le sanctuaire, une initiation plus complète et plus claire, à la lumière éclatante des réalités.X.", "6990": "Aussi nous réclamons nous-même l’indulgence pour le peu que nous en avons dit, et nous gardons un profond et respectueux silence sur la partie la plus secrète de ces mystères, pour revenir au récit des événements de Syène.", "6991": "Les fêtes du Niloa tombant à cette époque, les habitants étaient tout entiers aux sacrifices et aux cérémonies religieuses.", "6992": "Leurs corps étaient épuisés par les épreuves qu’ils venaient de traverser :", "6993": "mais ce qu’ils devaient aux Dieux était présent à leur esprit, et ils s’en acquittaient suivant leurs moyens.", "6994": "Cependant, au milieu de la nuit, Oroondatès profita du moment où, à la suite des réjouissances, les Syéniens étaient plongés dans un profond sommeil, et fit sortir sans bruit son armée.", "6995": "Il avait d’avance désigné secrètement aux Perses la porte par laquelle devait avoir lieu la sortie et l’heure du rendez-vous.", "6996": "Chaque décurion avait ordre de laisser sur place les chevaux et les bêtes de somme, de peur qu’ils n’embarrassassent la marche et que leur bruit ne donnât quelque soupçon de l’évasion.", "6997": "Chaque homme devait prendre seulement ses armes et apporter avec lui une poutre ou une planche.", "6998": "Lorsqu’ils furent réunis â la porte désignée, Oroondatès fit jeter en travers sur la vase, à la suite l’une de l’autre, les poutres qu’ils avaient apportées et que les derniers faisaient passer de main en main à ceux qui étaient en tête.", "6999": "Il forma ainsi une sorte de pont où toutes les troupes passèrent aisément en quelques instants.", "7000": "Quand il eut une fois gagné la terre ferme, il lui fut facile d’échapper ;", "7001": "car les Éthiopiens, ne soupçonnant rien, n’avaient songé à exercer aucune surveillance et dormaient sans la moindre inquiétude.", "7002": "Il courut à perte d’haleine vers Éléphantis, où il arriva avec toute son armée et fut reçu sans difficulté.", "7003": "Car les deux Perses précédemment envoyés de Syène avaient, conformément à leurs instructions, guetté chaque nuit son arrivée et lui ouvrirent les portes dès qu’ils entendirent le mot d’ordre convenu.", "7004": "Au point du jour, les Syéniens eurent connaissance de l’évasion :", "7005": "d’abord chacun d’eux remarqua l’absence des Perses logés chez lui ;", "7006": "puis ils se communiquèrent leurs soupçons, que confirma encore la vue de la traînée de planches.", "7007": "Ils se trouvaient donc encore une fois en proie à de cruelles perplexités, coupables en apparence de nouveaux griefs, et exposés à une accusation plus grave, celle de s’être montrés infidèles et d’avoir favorisé l’évasion des Perses après de telles preuves de clémence.", "7008": "Aussi résolurent-ils de sortir en masse de la ville et d’aller se remettre entre les mains des Éthiopiens, en protestant par serment de leur ignorance, afin d’exciter chez eux quelque pitié.", "7009": "Ils rassemblèrent toute la population, sans distinction d’âge, prirent à la main des rameaux, emblème de supplication, des flambeaux et des torches allumées, et, précédés de la caste sacerdotale, des statues de leurs Dieux, en guise de caducée, ils s’avancèrent vers les Éthiopiens par le pont de planches, dans l’attitude de suppliants.", "7010": "Arrivés à quelque distance, ils s’agenouillèrent, et, dans cette posture, tous, comme à un signal donné, firent entendre d’une seule voix des gémissements plaintifs et de déchirantes lamentations.", "7011": "Pour exciter encore plus la compassion, ils mirent à terre devant eux leurs petits enfants, et les laissèrent aller au hasard, espérant que l’innocence de leur âge à l’abri de tout soupçon pourrait fléchir la colère des Éthiopiens.", "7012": "Ces pauvres enfants, glacés d’effroi et ne comprenant rien à tout cet appareil, mis en fuite peut-être par l’immense cri qui retentissait derrière eux, couraient éperdus devant leurs pères et leurs mères.", "7013": "Les uns se traînaient en rampant le long du chemin qui menait à l’ennemi ;", "7014": "d’autres trébuchaient en marchant et poussaient des vagissements à fendre le cœur, comme si la fortune eût voulu personnifier en eux la supplication.XI. Hydaspe, à la vue de cette multitude, crut qu’ils venaient simplement pour réitérer les mêmes prières et se mettre entièrement à sa discrétion.", "7015": "Il leur envoya demander ce qu’ils voulaient et pourquoi ils venaient seuls, sans être accompagnés des Perses.", "7016": "Alors ils racontèrent tout ;", "7017": "l’éva- sion des Perses, sans aucune complicité de leur part ;", "7018": "leur fête nationale ;", "7019": "comment les Perses s’étaient enfuis pendant qu’ils étaient occupés au service des Dieux et s’abandonnaient au sommeil après le festin solennel ;", "7020": "comment enfin, même le sachant, ils n’auraient pu, sans armes, opposer aucune résistance à des gens armés.", "7021": "Hydaspe, en recevant ces nouvelles, se douta bien qu’Oroondatès lui tendrait quelque piège, ce qui était vrai.", "7022": "Il fit seulement mander les prêtres, adora les statues des Dieux qu’ils portaient avec eux pour inspirer plus de respect, et leur demanda s’ils avaient quelque chose de plus à lui apprendre au sujet des Perses, de la direction qu’ils avaient suivie, de leurs espérances ou de leurs projets.", "7023": "Ils répondirent qu’ils ne savaient rien positivement, mais que, d’après leurs conjectures, les Perses avaient dû se diriger vers Éléphantis où était réunie la plus grande partie de leur armée ;", "7024": "qu’Oroondatès comptait sur toutes ses troupes, mais principalement sur les cavaliers bardés de fer.XII.", "7025": "Après cette réponse, ils le prièrent de considérer la ville comme sa propriété, d’y faire son entrée et de ne point persévérer dans sa colère contre eux.", "7026": "Cependant Hydaspe ne jugea pas à propos pour le moment d’entrer luimême dans la ville ;", "7027": "il y envoya deux phalanges d’hoplites, pour sonder le terrain dans la crainte de quelque embûche, ou, dans le cas contraire, pour garder la place.", "7028": "Quant aux Syéniens, il les renvoya avec de bonnes promesses.", "7029": "Luimême rangea son armée en bataille, afin de recevoir les Perses s’ils attaquaient, ou de marcher à eux s’ils se faisaient attendre.", "7030": "Les dispositions n’étaient pas encore entièrement terminées, que ses éclaireurs vinrent lui annoncer que les Perses s’avançaient en ordre de bataille.", "7031": "En effet, Oroondatès avait précédemment ordonné à toute son armée de se réunir à Eléphantis ;", "7032": "mais, informé que les Éthiopiens s’avançaient à l’improviste, il avait été obligé de se jeter lui-même dans Syène avec quelques troupes.", "7033": "Enfermé dans la ville par une circonvallation, il avait demandé la vie sauve, l’avait obtenue d’Hydaspe, grâce à ses promesses, et s’était montré ensuite le plus perfide des hommes.", "7034": "Car les deux Perses qu’il avait embarqués avec les Éthiopiens, sous prétexte de les envoyer à Éléphantis sonder les dispositions des habitants et voir à quelles conditions ils consentiraient à traiter avec Hydaspe, avaient en réalité pour mission de s’assurer s’ils voulaient se pré parer au combat, dans le cas où lui-même parviendrait à s’échapper.", "7035": "La trahison réussit :", "7036": "il les trouva tout préparés ;", "7037": "et sans perdre un instant, il les mena aussitôt en avant dans l’espoir de surprendre l’ennemi par sa rapidité, avant qu’il eût fait ses dispositions.XIII.", "7038": "Déjà l’armée était en vue, éblouissant les regards par son faste persique et étincelant au loin dans la campagne sous ses armes d’or et d’argent.", "7039": "Le soleil se levait en face des Perses, et ses rayons, réfléchis par leurs armes, lançaient à une immense distance des éclairs éblouissants, auxquels venaient s’ajouter encore l’éclat et les feux des armures.", "7040": "A l’aile droite étaient les Perses et les Mèdes ;", "7041": "aux premiers rangs les hoplites, derrière eux les archers ;", "7042": "n’ayant point d’armure pour se protéger, ils pouvaient viser plus sûrement, à l’abri derrière les troupes armées de toutes pièces.", "7043": "Les Égyptiens, les Libyens et tous les soldats étrangers formaient la gauche.", "7044": "Avec eux se trouvaient aussi des archers et des frondeurs qui avaient ordre de diriger des attaques sur les flancs de l’ennemi et de l’accabler de traits.", "7045": "Oroondatès s’était placé au centre, majestueusement assis sur un char armé de faux, flanqué de troupes à droite et à gauche pour sa sûreté, et n’ayant devant lui que les cavaliers bardés de fer, corps d’élite, sur lequel il comptait surtout pour justifier son audacieuse attaque.", "7046": "Cette troupe est en effet la plus redoutable de l’armée des Perses, elle les couvre comme un rempart inébranlable.XIV.", "7047": "Voici quelle est leur armure :", "7048": "les hommes, choisis avec soin et remarquables pour leur vigueur, portent sur la tête un casque massif et d’une seule pièce, qui embrasse exactement tous les contours du visage, comme un masque de théâtre.", "7049": "La tête on est entièrement enveloppée depuis le sommet jusqu’au col, à part deux trous ménagés pour les yeux.", "7050": "La main droite du cavalier tient une lance d’une longueur plus qu’ordinaire, sa gauche dirige les rênes.", "7051": "Un sabre pend à son côté.", "7052": "Une cuirasse embrasse non seulement la poitrine, mais le corps tout entier.", "7053": "Le travail en est remarquable :", "7054": "elle est formée de lames d’airain ou de fer, de forme carrée et mesurant un empan dans tous les sens.", "7055": "Ces lames sont disposées de manière à se recouvrir mutuellement par leurs bords ;", "7056": "l’extrémité inférieure de l’une couvre le bord supérieur de l’autre, et de même en sens latéral.", "7057": "Sous les sutures sont adaptées des pièces de rapport retenues par des crochets, de manière à produire un tout continu.", "7058": "L’ensemble forme une sorte de tunique composée d’une série d’écailles, qui tombe sur le corps sans le froisser et l’enveloppe de toutes parts, s’adaptant exactement à chaque membre, et pouvant se resserrer ou s’étendre à volonté pour ne pas gêner les mouvements.", "7059": "Elle est garnie de manches, s’étend du col aux genoux et n’est fendue aux cuisses qu’autant qu’il est nécessaire pour que le cavalier puisse se tenir à cheval.", "7060": "Telle est leur cuirasse :", "7061": "non seulement cette armure est à l’épreuve des traits, mais aucun coup ne peut rien sur elle.", "7062": "Les jambes sont emboitées dans des grèves qui vont de l’extrémité du talon jusqu’au genou et s’attachent à l’extrémité du haubert.", "7063": "Le cheval est bardé de la même manière :", "7064": "à ses pieds sont attachés des jambarts ;", "7065": "sa tête est armée d’un chanfrain, et de son dos pend de part et d’autre sur les flancs un tissu de lames de fer qui le protège, tout en laissant libre le dessous du ventre pour ne point gêner sa course.", "7066": "Le cavalier ainsi armé, et pour ainsi dire enchâssé, s’établit sur son cheval ;", "7067": "mais il ne peut y monter seul ;", "7068": "il faut qu’on l’aide à se hisser, à cause de son poids.", "7069": "Quand vient le moment du combat, il rend les rênes, donne de l’éperon et se précipite à toute vitesse au milieu des ennemis, semblable à un homme de fer, ou à une statue qu’on verrait se mouvoir tout d’une pièce.", "7070": "La pointe de la lance, placée horizontalement, dépasse de beaucoup la tête du cheval.", "7071": "La hampe du côté du fer, est suspendue au col de l’animal, tandis que la poignée est fixée sur la croupe.", "7072": "De cette manière, elle ne cède point sous le choc, et l’impétuosité du cheval vient en aide à la main du cavalier qui n’a plus qu’à diriger le coup.", "7073": "Quelquefois aussi, il se raidit lui-même et fait effort pour frapper un coup plus terrible ;", "7074": "alors le choc est tellement irrésistible qu’il transperce tout ce qui se trouve devant lui, et bien souvent d’un seul coup emporte deux ennemis à la fois suspendus à sa lance.XV. Telle était la cavalerie du satrape.", "7075": "Son armée rangée en bataille, comme on l’a vu, il marcha droit à l’ennemi, ayant soin de garder toujours le fleuve à dos, afin de s’en faire une barrière pour n’être pas enveloppé par l’armée éthiopienne, de beaucoup supérieure en nombre.", "7076": "Hydaspe se mit en mouvement de son côté :", "7077": "à l’aile droite, occupée par les Perses et les Mèdes, il opposa les troupes de Méroé, pesamment armées et exercées à combattre corps à corps.", "7078": "Les Troglodytes et les peuples qui habitent près des régions où naît le cinnamome, tous armés à la légère, rapides à la course et maniant l’arc avec une rare habileté, furent opposés aux archers et aux frondeurs ennemis de l’aile gauche.", "7079": "Sachant que les Perses comptaient surtout sur les cavaliers bardés de fer, qui occupaient leur centre, Hydaspe se posta luimême en face d’eux avec ses éléphants chargés de tours.", "7080": "Devant lui, il rangea les hoplites Blemmyes et Sères auxquels il fit connaître ce qu’ils auraient à faire une fois l’action engagée.XVI.", "7081": "Les signaux levés de part et d’autre, les éclats de la trompette préludèrent à l’action du côté des Perses, les roulements du tambour du côté des Éthiopiens.", "7082": "Oroondatès, criant de toute sa force, lança ses troupes au pas de course.", "7083": "Hydaspe, au contraire, ordonna aux siennes d’aller à l’ennemi lentement d’abord, et d’accélérer ensuite la marche peu à peu.", "7084": "Il voulait que les éléphants ne fussent point devancés par les combattants placés devant eux ;", "7085": "il espérait, d’un autre côté, amortir l’impétuosité de la cavalerie ennemie, en lui laissant traverser l’intervalle des deux armées.", "7086": "Lorsqu’on fut à portée de trait, les Blemmyes, voyant les cavaliers bardés de fer exciter leurs chevaux pour se précipiter sur eux, exécutèrent les ordres d’Hydaspe :", "7087": "laissant derrière eux les Sères, pour servir aux éléphants comme de rempart et de bouclier, ils s’élancèrent de toute leur vitesse, bien loin hors des lignes, à la rencontre des cavaliers.", "7088": "A les voir ainsi courir en si petit nombre, contre des troupes plus nombreuses et bardées de fer, on les eût crus atteints de folie.", "7089": "Les Perses n’en poussèrent que plus vivement leurs chevaux, regardant comme un bonheur l’audace de leurs ennemis, et persuadés qu’ils allaient les balayer aussitôt au premier choc.XVII.", "7090": "Déjà on s’abordait ;", "7091": "les Blemmyes touchaient presque le fer des lances, lorsque tout à coup ils se baissèrent tous, comme par un même mouvement, et se glissèrent sous les chevaux, un genou en terre.", "7092": "A peine y en eut-il quelques-uns qui eurent la tête et le dos foulés sous les pieds des chevaux.", "7093": "Eux, au contraire, ils firent aux chevaux un mal incroyable en leur ouvrant le ventre, au passage, avec leur épée.", "7094": "Rendus insensibles au frein par la douleur, les chevaux s’abattaient en grand nombre et renversaient leurs cavaliers.", "7095": "Ceux-ci gisaient entassés et immobiles, et les Blemmyes n’avaient qu’à les percer sous les cuisses au défaut de la cuirasse.", "7096": "Car, le cavalier perse bardé de fer ne peut faire aucun mouvement, s’il n’a un guide pour le conduire par la main.", "7097": "Ceux dont les chevaux n’étaient point blessés et qui purent échapper, furent emportés vers les Sères.", "7098": "Mais ceux-ci, dès qu’ils les virent approcher, se glissèrent entre les éléphants, et se réfugièrent à l’abri de leur masse, comme derrière un retranchement ou un rempart.", "7099": "Là périrent beaucoup de cavaliers, ou pour mieux dire ce fut presque un massacre général.", "7100": "A l’aspect hideux des éléphants démasqués tout à coup, à la vue de ces énormes animaux qu’ils ne connaissaient point, les chevaux furent saisis d’épouvante :", "7101": "les uns tournaient bride, les autres s’entre-heurtaient ;", "7102": "en un instant le désordre fut dans les rangs.", "7103": "Du haut des tours qui surmon- taient les éléphants, les Éthiopiens faisaient pleuvoir une grêle de traits.", "7104": "Chaque tour portait six hommes sur le front, et deux de chaque côté, la partie tournée du côté de la queue étant seule dégarnie.", "7105": "C’étaient pour eux comme autant de citadelles, du haut desquelles ils lançai ent une telle quantité de traits, et tellement à coup sûr, que les Perses paraissaient au milieu d’une nuée de flèches.", "7106": "Visant surtout aux yeux de leurs adversaires, comme s’il se fût agi non d’un combat sérieux, mais d’un simple jeu où ils auraient disputé le prix de l’adresse, les Éthiopiens touchaient le but avec une telle précision, qu’on voyait ceux qu’ils avaient atteints errer au hasard dans les rangs, portant fichés dans les yeux deux traits qu’on eût pris pour de longues flûtes.", "7107": "Si quelques-uns, entraînés par l’impétuosité de la course, et dans l’impossibilité de retenir leurs chevaux, étaient malgré eux emportés en avant, ils tombaient au milieu des éléphants.", "7108": "Les uns périssaient renversés et foulés aux pieds par les éléphants eux-mèmes ;", "7109": "les autres étaient tués par les Sères et les Blemmyes qui, s’élançant de derrière les éléphants comme d’une embuscade, choisissaient le défaut des armes pour les frapper à coup sûr, ou les saisissaient corps à corps et les renversaient de leurs chevaux.", "7110": "Ceux qui échappaient se sauvaient sans avoir fait aucun mal aux éléphants :", "7111": "car ces animaux sont aussi bardés de fer quand ils vont au combat ;", "7112": "la nature leur a donné d’ailleurs une peau excessivement dure, couverte à la surface d’écailles impénétrables, contre lesquelles tous les traits viennent s’émousser impuissants.XVIII.", "7113": "Une fois les derniers cavaliers mis en fuite, le sa- trape Oroondatès sauta à bas de son char, monta un cheval de Nysa, et s’enfuit lui-même plus honteusement que personne.", "7114": "A l’aile gauche, les Égyptiens et les Libyens, ignorant cette déroute, soutenaient vaillamment l’effort du combat, et tout en recevant plus de blessures qu’ils n’en portaient, opposaient au péril un courage innébralable.", "7115": "Les troupes de la région du cinnamome qui leur étaient opposées les harcelaient à outrance et les tenaient dans de perpétuelles alarmes ;", "7116": "fuyant quand elles voyaient les Égyptiens avancer, elles prenaient sur eux une avance considérable, et tout en reculant se retournaient pour décocher leurs traits.", "7117": "L’ennemi cédait-il, ils revenaient à la charge, et voltigeaient sur ses flancs :", "7118": "les uns lançaient des pierres avec leurs frondes, les autres dardaient de petites flèches imprégnées de sang de dragon, dont les blessures causent instantanément la mort.", "7119": "Ces peuples de la région du cinnamome semblent lancer leurs traits en se jouant plutôt qu’avec l’application d’un combat sérieux.", "7120": "Leur tête est entourée d’une sorte de tresse circulaire, dans laquelle les flèches sont passées en rond, la partie ailée contre la tête, la pointe en l’air comme les rayons d’une couronne.", "7121": "Chacun les a ainsi sous la main et les tire sans peine comme d’un carquois au moment du combat.", "7122": "Ils vont à l’ennemi entièrement nus, avec des danses sauvages, des bonds et des contorsions de Satyres, la tête couronnée de leurs flèches, et lancent des traits qui, pour n’être point armés de fer, n’en sont pas moins acérés.", "7123": "Ces traits sont tirés de l’épine dorsale du dragon :", "7124": "ils la dressent, la coupent à la longueur d’une coudée, amincissent et aiguisent l’extrémité, et forment ainsi des flèches naturellement armées de leur pointe.", "7125": "Il est probable même que c’est par allusion à cet usage, que la flèche est appelée chez les Grecs oïston, parce qu’elle est formée d’un os.", "7126": "Pendant quelque temps, les Égyptiens tinrent bon, et se firent de leurs boucliers enlacés un rempart contre les traits.", "7127": "Car ils sont naturellement braves et se font un point d’honneur de mépriser la mort, moins cependant dans un but d’utilité que par vaine gloire.", "7128": "Peutêtre aussi étaient-ils retenus à leur poste par la crainte du châtiment.XIX.", "7129": "Mais quand ils apprirent que la cavalerie bardée de fer, regardée comme la principale force de l’armée et l’espérance de la guerre, avait été anéantie, que le satrape avait pris la fuite, enfin que les hoplites mèdes et perses, cette troupe si vantée, n’avaient pas eu beaucoup plus de succès et avaient fait moins de mal à ceux de Méroé qui leur étaient opposées qu’ils n’en avaient éprouvé eux-mêmes, alors ils cédèrent, eux aussi, à l’ennemi qui les pressait, et se mirent en déroute, Hydaspe, voyant du haut d’une tour, qui lui servait comme d’observatoire, la victoire désormais certaine, envoya des hérauts à ses soldats occupés à pour suivre l’ennemi pour leur enjoindre de cesser le massacre, et d’amener prisonniers tous ceux qu’ils pourraient, particulièrement Oroondatès.", "7130": "Ces ordres furent aussitôt exécutés :", "7131": "les Éthiopiens élargirent leur front de bataille, en diminuant la profondeur de leurs lignes, et étendirent les ailes de part et d’autre.", "7132": "Les extrémités do la ligne se rabattirent ensuite vers le fleuve, de manière à enfermer les Perses dans un cercle et à ne leur laisser pour fuir qu’une seule voie libre, celle qui conduisait au Nil.", "7133": "Un grand nombre en effet allèrent s’y précipiter, poussés en désordre par la cavalerie, par les chars armés de faux et par le reste des fuyards, qui se précipitaient éperdus au milieu de la confusion générale.", "7134": "Ils comprirent alors que ce qui avait paru d’abord une habile tactique du satrape contre l’ennemi, était, au contraire, une faute d’imprévoyance qui tournait contre eux-mêmes.", "7135": "Craignant d’être enveloppé, il avait eu soin de garder toujours le Nil à dos, sans s’apercevoir qu’il se fermait ainsi le chemin de la retraite.", "7136": "Aussi, lui-même fut-il fait prisonnier.", "7137": "Déjà Achéménès, fils de Cybèle, avait tenté de le tuer :", "7138": "informé de tout ce qui s’était passé à Memphis, il avait résolu de profiter du tumulte pour se débarrasser d’Oroondatès ;", "7139": "car il regrettait les rapports qu’il avait faits contre Arsacé, depuis que les moyens de conviction lui étaient enlevés.", "7140": "Mais il manqua son coup, et ne lui fit pas une blessure mortelle.", "7141": "Le châtiment ne se fit pas attendre ;", "7142": "car, au même instant, Achéménès fut percé d’un javelot par un Éthiopien, qui avait reconnu Oroondatès, et voulait le sauver conformément aux ordres d’Hydaspe.", "7143": "Le cœur du soldat s’était soulevé d’indignation contre cette odieuse tentative, lorsqu’il avait vu un homme qui fuyait lui-même devant l’ennemi se retourner contre les siens, et saisir l’occasion d’un désastre public pour satisfaire une inimitié privée.XX.", "7144": "Il fut amené par celui qui l’avait pris :", "7145": "Hydaspe, le voyant prêt à défaillir et tout sanglant, fit étancher le sang comme par enchantement, par ceux qui sont chargés de ce soin.", "7146": "Résolu à le sauver, s’il était possible, il lui adressa quelques paroles de consolation :", "7147": "« Mon ami, lui dit-il, pour ce qui est de ma volonté, tu peux te regarder comme sauvé :", "7148": "car s’il est beau d’abattre ses ennemis par les armes quand ils sont debout, il ne l’est pas moins de les vaincre par la générosité quand ils sont tombés.", "7149": "Mais à quoi donc songeais-tu de te montrer ainsi traître à ta parole ?", "7150": "— Traître envers toi, dit-il, mais fidèle à mon maître.", "7151": "— Puisque tu as succombé, reprit Hydaspe, fixe toi-même le châtiment que tu mérites.", "7152": "— Celui qu’eût infligé mon roi, répondit Oroondatès, à un de tes généraux, s’il l’eût pris, pour t’avoir gardé sa foi.", "7153": "— Alors, dit Hydaspe, s’il a vraiment les sentiments d’un roi et non ceux d’un tyran, il eût loué sa conduite, et l’eût renvoyé comblé de présents, afin d’exciter chez les siens, par les éloges donnés à des étrangers, l’émulation de les imiter.", "7154": "Mais, si tu te prétends fidèle, tu ne saurais disconvenir toi-même que tu as été imprudent d’attaquer aussi témérairement tant de milliers d’hommes.", "7155": "— Peut-être n’y avait-il pas imprudence, dit-il, à présumer les sentiments de mon roi, qui se montre plus sévère encore à punir toute espèce de lâcheté à la guerre, que généreux à récompenser la valeur.", "7156": "Aussi ai-je résolu d’aller moi-même au-devant du péril, dans l’espoir de faire quelque action mémorable, de rencontrer une de ces bonnes fortunes inespérées, comme en offrent souvent les hasards de la guerre, ou du moins, si j’avais le bonheur d’échapper, de me ménager quelque moyen de justification, comme ayant fait tout ce qui dépendait de moi.", "7157": "»XXI.", "7158": "Après cet entretien, Hydaspe lui donna des éloges, et l’envoya à Syène, en recommandant aux médecins d’avoir pour lui tous les soins imaginables.", "7159": "De son côté il fit son entrée dans la ville, avec les principaux de son armée.", "7160": "Tous les habitants, sans distinction d’âge, étaient sortis au-devant de lui ;", "7161": "ils répandaient sur l’armée des couronnes et des fleurs du Nil, et célébraient dans des chants de triomphe les louanges d’Hydaspe.", "7162": "Lorsqu’il eut pénétré dans l’intérieur de la ville, monté sur un éléphant, en guise de char, ses premières pensées furent pour la religion.", "7163": "Après avoir témoigné, par des actions de grâces, sa reconnaissance aux Dieux immortels, il demanda aux prêtres quelle était l’origine des fêtes du Nil, et s’ils avaient à lui montrer dans la ville quelque chose qui fût digne d’être vu ou admiré.", "7164": "Ils lui firent voir le puits qui sert à mesurer la crue du Nil :", "7165": "il ressemble à celui de Memphis et est formé de pierres de taille polies, sur lesquelles sont gravées des lignes, distantes entre elles d’une coudée.", "7166": "L’eau du fleuve arrive dans le puits par un conduit souterrain, s’élève le long de l’échelle, et fait connaître aux habitants la crue ou la décroissance du Nil, le nombre de degrés atteints ou abandonnés par les eaux mesurant la hauteur de l’inondation ou la retraite du fleuve.", "7167": "Ils lui montrèrent aussi leurs gnomons horaires :", "7168": "ils ne donnent aucune ombre à midi ;", "7169": "car, à Syène, les rayons du soleil, tombant perpendiculairement sur le sommet, au solstice d’été, éclairent de tous côtés la pyramide qui ne peut dès lors projeter aucune ombre.", "7170": "C’est pourle même motif que l’eau au fond des puits reçoit aussi directement les rayons du soleil.", "7171": "Hydaspe n’admira pas beaucoup ces particularités qui n’avaient pour lui rien de nouveau ;", "7172": "car le même phénomène se produit à Méroé, en Éthiopie.", "7173": "Ils exaltèrent aussi à l’euvi devant lui leur fête et les divines vertus du Nil, qu’ils appelaient le Dieu des saisons, le principe fécondant de la terre, le sauveur de la Haute-Égypte, le père et le créateur de la Basse, sur laquelle il répand chaque année un nouveau limon, Néan ilyn, ce qui lui a valu chez les Grecs son nom de Neilos.", "7174": "« C’est lui, disaient-ils, qui détermine les saisons de l’année, l’été par ses crues, l’automne par sa décroissance, le printemps par les fleurs qu’il produit et par la ponte des crocodiles.", "7175": "Le Nil, en un mot, est l’année elle-même, ainsi que le prouve son nom, puisque les lettres qui le composent, prises avec leur valeur numérique, forment le nombre trois cent soixantecinq, qui est celui des jours de l’année.", "7176": "» Ils lui vantèrent encore les plantes et les animaux particuliers au Nil, et mille autres vertus du même genre.", "7177": "— « Mais, dit Hydaspe, toutes ces merveilles appartiennent à l’Éthiopie et non à l’Égypte :", "7178": "car c’est de l’Éthiopie que vous vient ce fleuve, ce Dieu comme vous l’appelez, et tout ce qu’il nourrit dans son sein ;", "7179": "elle a donc justement droit à vos hommages, étant pour vous la mère des Dieux.", "7180": "— Sans doute nous l’honorons, dirent les prêtres, pour bien des motifs, mais surtout parce qu’elle nous a fait voir en vous un sauveur et un Dieu.", "7181": "»XXII.", "7182": "Hydaspe leur dit qu’il fallait apporter dans l’éloge une pieuse réserve, et se retira dans sa tente pour y prendre quelque repos le reste du jour.", "7183": "Il invita à un festin les principaux des Éthiopiens ainsi que les prêtres de Syène, et permit au reste de l’armée de se livrer également aux réjouissances.", "7184": "Les Syéniens fournirent à l’armée un grand nombre de têtes de bétail, bœufs, moutons, troupeaux de chèvres et de porcs, partie en don, partie à prix d’argent.", "7185": "Le lendemain Hydaspe, assis sur un trône élevé, se fit amener les bêtes de somme, les chevaux et tout le reste du butin pris soit dans la ville, soit dans le combat, pour les distribuer à ses soldats, chacun suivant son mérite et le courage qu’il avait montré dans l’action.", "7186": "Celui qui avait fait prisonnier Oroondatès s’étant présenté :", "7187": "« Demande, lui dit Hydaspe, ce que tu voudras.", "7188": "— Je n’ai rien à demander, grand roi, dit-il ;", "7189": "mais si vous m’accordez ce que j’ai pris à Oroondatès, quand je l’ai sauvé par votre ordre, je n’ai plus rien à désirer.", "7190": "» Et en même temps il montra le poignard du satrape, enrichi de pierreries, d’un travail précieux et d’une valeur considérable.", "7191": "Beaucoup des assistants se recrièrent sur ce qu’un tel trésor était au-dessus de la fortune d’un particulier et convenait mieux à un roi.", "7192": "« Et qu’y a-t-il de plus royal, dit Hydaspe en souriant, que de ne pas laisser ma générosité au-dessous de sa cupidité ?", "7193": "D’ailleurs les lois de la guerre autorisent le vainqueur à dépouiller son prisonnier.", "7194": "Qu’il s’en aille donc et emporte, avec mon assentiment, ce qu’il eût pu du reste aisément cacher et

roi ;", "7201": "vous faites bien de me les rappeler ;", "7202": "car je ne les ai vus qu’en passant et au milieu des préoccupations de la guerre, quand vous me les avez présentés.", "7203": "Qu’on

pour ordonner aux gardiens de les amener au roi sur-lechamp.", "7206": "Chemin faisant, ils demandèrent à un des gardiens, semi-Grec de naissance, où on les conduisait.", "7207": "Celui-ci leur ayant répondu que le roi Hydaspe faisait la revue des prisonniers :", "7208": "« Dieux sauveurs !", "7209": "» s’écrièrent en même temps les jeunes gens, à ce nom d’Hydaspe :", "7210": "car jusqu’à ce

Divinité a embarrassé les débuts de tant d’entraves, ne peut nécessairement arriver à bonne fin qu’à travers de longs et pénibles détours.", "7216": "D’ailleurs il n’est point prudent de découvrir brusquement et en un instant des faits que tant d’années ont couverts d’un épais nuage, surtout quand l’unique fondement de toutes nos espérances, celle de laquelle dépend tout le nœud de l’intrigue

ferme par là tout espoir de retourner en Éthiopie ?", "7218": "— Tout au contraire, dit Chariclée ;", "7219": "car nous avons bien des fois entendu dire à nos gardiens qu’on nous nourrit comme des victimes réservées, afin de nous sacrifier aux Dieux qui sont à Méroé.", "7220": "Nous n’avons donc pas à craindre d’être donnés en présent ou immolés auparavant, puisque nous sommes consacrés aux Dieux par une promesse que ne peuvent violer des hommes d'une piété aussi rigide.", "7221": "Mais si, cédant à un entraînement irréfléchi, éblouis par la fortune qui nous attend, nous livrons imprudemment notre secret, sans attendre même la présence de ceux qui peuvent nous reconnaître et confirmer nos dires, nous ne pouvons manquer d’exciter la colère de ceux qui nous écouteront :",

invention, qu’ils sont les fils du roi.", "7223": "— Mais, dit Théagène, les signes de reconnaissance que tu conserves, et que tu portes sur toi, je le sais, aideront à prouver qu’il n’y a ni invention ni fourberie de notre part.", "7224": "— Sans doute, dit Chariclée, ce sont des signes de reconnaissance pour ceux qui les connaissent et qui les ont exposés ;", "7225": "mais pour ceux qui les ignorent ou qui ne les connaissent qu’en partie, ce sont des bijoux sans aucune signification, des colliers, bons tout au plus peutêtre à faire soupçonner de vol et de brigandage ceux qui les possèdent.", "7226": "Et quand bien même Hydaspe reconnaîtrait quelqu’un de ces objets, qui lui persuadera que c’est Persina qui les a donnés, qui lui fera croire que ce sont les présents d’une mère à sa fille ?", "7227": "Le sentiment maternel, au contraire, cher Théagène, est un témoignage irréfragable.", "7228": "Grâce à lui, la mère éprouve pour son enfant, à la première rencontre, un élan d’amour, inspiré par une secrète sympathie de l’âme.", "7229": "Négligerons-nous donc ce témoignage qui doit donner d’ailleurs plus d’autorité aux autres signes de reconnaissance?", "7230": "»XXIV.",

bœufs de labour, sans doute comme emblème des travaux de la terre, consacrés à la Déesse qui en est la plus rapprochée.VII.", "7366": "Ce sacrifice n’était pas encore terminé, qu’il s’éleva tout à

sacrifice ordinaire pour le salut de la nation ;", "7368": "que les prémices de la guerre soient consacrées aux Dieux.", "7369": "» Hydaspe comprit qu’ils réclamaient le sacrifice humain, qu’on avait coutume d’offrir seulement à l’occasion des victoires sur les nations étrangères, et où l’on immolait des prisonniers.", "7370": "Il les calma d’un geste, leur fit comprendre d’un signe de tête qu’on allait faire sur-le-champ ce qu’ils demandaient, et ordonna d’amener les prisonniers destinés dès longtemps à cet usage.", "7371": "Théagène et Chariclée furent amenés avec les autres, libres de chaînes et entourés de gardes.", "7372": "Tous étaient tristes, comme il est naturel, Théagène cependant moins que les autres.", "7373": "Chariclée seule montrait un visage gai et souriant.", "7374":

contre les coups de la fortune !", "7379": "combien sa jeunesse est digne de pitié !", "7380": "Si nous avions conservé notre unique enfant, la fille que nous avons si malheureusement perdue, elle aurait à peu près cet âge.", "7381": "Mais, plût aux Dieux, seigneur, qu’il y eût quelque moyen de sauver cette jeune fille !", "7382": "Ce serait pour moi une grande consolation de l’avoir à mon service.", "7383": "Peut-être même la malheureuse est-elle Grecque ;", "7384": "car son visage n’annonce point une Égyptienne.", "7385": "— Elle est Grecque, en effet, lui dit Hydaspe, et elle va tout à l’heure nous faire connaître ses parents ;", "7386": "car, quant à les montrer, elle ne le saurait, quoiqu’elle l’ait promis.", "7387": "Du reste il n’est point en mon pouvoir de l’arracher au sacrifice, et pourtant je le voudrais ;", "7388": "car moi-même j’éprouve, je ne sais comment, quelque émotion ;", "7389": "j’ai compassion de cette enfant.", "7390": "Mais, vous le savez, la loi exige que l’on consacre et qu’on offre en sacrifice un jeune homme au Soleil, une jeune fille à la Lune.", "7391": "C’est la première captive qui m’ait été amenée ;", "7392": "elle a été destinée au sacrifice actuel, et toute hésitation serait inexcusable aux yeux du peuple.", "7393": "Une seule chose pourrait lui venir en aide, ce serait que l’épreuve du foyer, que vous connaissez, prouvât qu’elle n’est pas pure de tout commerce avec les hommes.", "7394": "Car la loi exige que la victime offerte à la Lune, aussi bien qu’au Soleil, soit sans tache ;", "7395": "tandis que pour les sacrifices de Bacchus, c’est chose indifférente.", "7396": "Mais songez aussi que si elle était convaincue, à l’épreuve du foyer, de n’être point restée chaste, il serait peu convenable, peut-être, de recevoir une telle femme dans votre palais.", "7397": "— Qu’elle soit convaincue, dit Persina, pourvu qu’elle soit sauvée.", "7398": "La captivité, la guerre, la vie errante si loin de sa patrie rendraient une faiblesse excusable, chez elle surtout, si toutefois elle a eu ce malheur ;", "7399": "car sa beauté est une provocation à la violence qu’elle porte partout avec elle.", "7400": "»VIII.", "7401": "Elle avait à peine cessé de parler et s’efforçait de dérober aux assistants les larmes qui lui échappaient, lorsque Hydaspe ordonna d’apporter le foyer de l’épreuve.", "7402": "Les serviteurs prirent dans la foule, pour le porter, de jeunes enfants qui n’étaient pas encore en âge de puberté ;", "7403": "car il n’y a que ceux-là qui puissent le toucher sans se blesser.", "7404": "Après l’avoir apporté du temple et placé au milieu de l’assemblée, ils y firent monter les prisonniers tour à tour.", "7405": "Mais tous, à peine montés, avaient la plante des pieds brûdée, à tel point que quelques-uns n’en pouvaient pas supporter un instant le simple contact.", "7406": "Car l’épreuve se fait sur un réchaud recouvert de barreaux d’or entrelacés auxquels a été communiquée par une vertu secrète la propriété de brûler quiconque n’est pas pur, ou s’est souillé de quelque parjure ;", "7407": "tandis que ceux dont la vie est irréprochable peuvent y marcher impunément.", "7408": "Ceux qui ne purent soutenir l’épreuve furent mis à part pour être sacrifiés à Bacchus et aux autres Dieux.", "7409": "Il n’y eut que deux ou trois jeunes Grecques qui prouvèrent à l’épreuve du foyer qu’elles étaient vierges.IX. Théagène y étant monté à son tour, l’épreuve cons tata également sa virginité.", "7410": "Tous furent saisis d’admiration en le voyant si grand, si beau, si florissant de jeunesse, et pourtant étranger aux plaisirs de Vénus.", "7411": "On le destina donc à être immolé au Soleil.", "7412": "« Voilà, dit-il tout bas à Chariclée, la récompense d’une vie pure, chez les Éthiopiens, l’immolation.", "7413": "Pour prix de la chasteté, le sacrifice et la mort.", "7414": "Mais, chère Chariclée, pourquoi ne point se faire connaître ?", "7415": "Que tardes-tu encore ?", "7416": "Veux-tu attendre qu’on nous égorge ?", "7417": "Parle, révôle-toi, je t’en supplie ;", "7418": "peut-être me sauveras-tu moi-même quand on saura qui tu es, et que tu me réclameras ;", "7419": "sinon, tu échapperas du moins certainement au péril, et, quand je te saurai sauvée, c’en sera assez pour moi, la mort même ne me causera point de regrets.", "7420": "— L’instant fatal approche, dit Chariclée ;", "7421": "voici le moment où s’agite notre destinée !", "7422": "» Et, sans attendre l’ordre des gardiens, elle tira d’un sachet qu’elle portait avec elle sa tunique de Delphes, brochée d’or, toute parsemée de rayons écarlates, et s’en revêtit.", "7423": "Puis, laissant tomber ses cheveux, elle courut, semblable à une inspirée, et s’élança sur la grille ardente.", "7424": "Longtemps elle s’y tint immobile, sans ressentir aucune atteinte.", "7425": "Sa beauté, plus éclatante encore, lançait des éclairs ;", "7426": "du haut du foyer, elle dominait la foule.", "7427": "visible pour tous ;", "7428": "sous scs vêtements sacerdotaux elle ressemblait plutôt à une statue de Déesse qu’à une mortelle.", "7429": "A cet aspect, toute la multitude fut frappée d’étonnement.", "7430": "Un cri immense, confus, inarticulé, témoigna de l’enthousiasme universel.", "7431": "On admirait tout en elle, mais surtout cette beauté tellement surhumaine qui avait traversé pure les séductions de l’adolescence, cette chasteté qui se montrait relevée encore par les plus merveilleux attraits.", "7432": "Beaucoup s’affligeaient de ce qu’elle eût été trouvée propre au sacrifice ;", "7433": "malgré leurs superstitions ils l’eussent vue avec joie sauvée par quelque miracle.", "7434": "Persina surtout ne pouvait contenir sa douleur, à ce point qu’elle dit à Hydaspe :", "7435": "« Combien est à plaindre et infortunée cette jeune fille !", "7436": "On exalte à grands cris sa pureté, si funeste pour elle, et, en retour de ces nombreux éloges elle va donner sa vie !", "7437": "Mais que pourrait-on donc faire, seigneur ?", "7438": "— C’est en vain, reprit-il, que vous me pressez, et que vous vous apitoyez :", "7439": "elle ne peut être sauvée ;", "7440": "elle a été, j’imagine, destinée aux Dieux dès sa naissance, à cause de l’excellence de sa nature.", "7441": "» Et, s’adressant aux gymnosophistes :", "7442": "« Très sages pontifes, dit-il, tout est préparé, pourquoi ne pas commencer la cérémonie religieuse ?", "7443": "— De grâce, épargueznous le reste, répondit en grec Sisimithrès, pour n’être pas entendu de la foule.", "7444": "Nous sommes assez souillés par ce que nous avons vu et entendu jusqu’ici.", "7445": "Nous allons rentrer au temple ;", "7446": "car, pour nous, nous ne saurions approuver ces affreux sacrifices où l’on immole des victimes humaines, et nous ne croyons pas que la Divinité les approuve.", "7447": "Que ne pouvons-nous même empêcher tous les sacrifices où l’on égorge des animaux !", "7448": "Car, à notre sentiment, les prières et les parfums sont une offrande suffisante.", "7449": "Pour vous, restez ;", "7450": "car un roi est quelquefois obligé à se soumettre aux entraînements, même irréfléchis, de la multitude ;", "7451": "accomplissez ce sacrifice, horrible sans doute, mais que les lois établies et les coutumes nationales ne permettent pas de supprimer.", "7452": "Mais il vous faudra ensuite vous purifier, ou plutôt, peutêtre n’en aurez-vous pas besoin ;", "7453": "car je ne crois pas que ce sacrifice s’accomplisse jusqu’au bout, si j’en crois une foule de présages célestes et surtout la lumière surnaturelle qui environne ces étrangers, témoignage assuré que quelqu’un des immortels combat pour eux.", "7454": "»X.", "7455": "A ces mots, il se leva avec tout le reste du sacré cel lège et se disposa à se retirer.", "7456": "A ce moment, Chariclée s’élança du foyer et courut se jeter aux genoux de Sisimithrès, malgré l’opposition absolue des sacrificateurs persuadés que ses supplications n’avaient d’autre objet que d’échapper à la mort.", "7457": "« Très sages pontifes, dit-elle, attendez un peu ;", "7458": "j’ai à plaider ma cause contre le roi et la reine, et j’ai appris que, seuls, vous pouvez prononcer même sur les rois.", "7459": "Soyez donc arbitres dans ce combat que je soutiens pour ma vie ;", "7460": "vous reconnaîtrez qu’il n’est ni possible, ni juste que je sois immolée aux Dieux.", "7461": "» Les prêtres l’écoutèrent avec plaisir.", "7462": "« O roi, dirent-ils, vous entendez la sommation et les allégations de cette étrangère ?", "7463": "— Et de quel procès, dit en riant Hydaspe, peut-il être question ?", "7464": "Qu’y a-t-il de commun entre elle et moi ?", "7465": "A quelle occasion ?", "7466": "Quel droit allègue-t-elle?", "7467": "— C’est ce qu’on verra, dit Sisimithrès, par ce qu’elle va dire.", "7468": "— Cela ne semblera-t-il pas, dit Hydaspe, une moquerie plutôt qu’un jugement, si moi qui suis roi, je me soumets à plaider contre une captive.", "7469": "— La justice, lui répondit Sisimithrès, ne s’inquiète point de la différence des rangs ;", "7470": "à ses yeux celui-là seul est roi qui allègue les meilleures raisons.", "7471": "— La loi, dit Hydaspe, vous autorise à juger les différends des rois avec leurs sujets, mais non avec les étrangers.", "7472": "— L’honnêteté, dit Sisimithrès, ne se contente pas seulement de l’extérieur et des apparences de la justice, elle s’attache au fond et à la réalité.", "7473": "— Il est évident, reprit Hydaspe, qu’elle n’a rien de sérieux à alléguer ;", "7474": "elle va, comme tous les malheureux réduits à la dernière extrémité, prétexter quelque vaine raison, quelque mensonge, pour différer le moment ;", "7475": "cependant qu’elle parle, puisqu’ainsi le veut Sisimithrès.", "7476": "»XI.", "7477": "Chariclée, toute rayonnante déjà de l’espoir de sa prochaine délivrance, fut plus joyeuse encore lorsqu’elle entendit le nom de Sisimithrès ;", "7478": "car c’était lui qui l’avait recueillie

eût dit un rayon empourpré courant à travers la suie.", "7764": "Après un instant de silence :", "7765": "« Mon père, dit-il, les autres ambassadeurs viennent vous apporter en présent, chacun de son côté, ce que leur pays produit de plus précieux, comme pour couronner votre mémorable victoire.", "7766": "Pour moi, sachant la valeur et le courage que vous avez montrés dans le combat, j’ai cru devoir vous offrir un don qui rappelle vos glorieuses qualités :", "7767": "je vous amène un homme, athlète invincible au combat et dans la mêlée, irrésistible champion à la lutte, au ceste, dans l’arène et à travers le stade.", "7768": "» En même temps il lui fit signe de s’avancer.XXV.", "7769": "Il arriva au milieu de l’assemblée et adora Hydaspe ;", "7770": "sa taille était si prodigieuse, c’était un homme tellement gigantesque, qu’en embrassant le genou du roi, il paraissait presque à la hauteur de ceux qui étaient assis sur le trône.", "7771": "Sans attendre même qu’on lui en donnât l’ordre, il se dépouilla de ses vêtements, et nu, debout devant le trône, il provoqua au combat quiconque voudrait lutter avec lui, avec ou sans armes.", "7772": "Comme personne ne se présentait, malgré les nombreux appels faits par le héraut, au nom du roi :", "7773": "« Je te donnerai néanmoins, dit Hydaspe, le prix du combat, et un prix qui réponde à tes mérites.", "7774": "» Et aussitôt il ordonna de lui amener un vieil éléphant d’une taille colossale.", "7775": "Quand l’éléphant fut amené, il le reçut avec une satisfaction évidente, taudis que le peuple éclatait en applaudissements ironiques, enchanté de cette facétie du roi, et se consolant de l’infériorité où il s’était trouvé vis-à-vis du géant par cette dérision de ses vanteries.", "7776": "Après lui furent introduits les députés des Sères, qui présentèrent des tissus fabriqués avec les fils de certaines araignées de leurs pays, les uns blancs, les autres teints en pourpre.XXVI.", "7777": "Ces présents offerts, ils demandèrent qu’on leur délivrât quelques prisonniers retenus depuis longtemps dans les fers, après condamnation ;", "7778": "ce que le roi leur accorda.", "7779": "Arrivèrent ensuite les ambassadeurs de l’Arabie heureuse, avec des herbes odoriférantes, de la lavande, du cinnamome et tous les parfums que produit le territoire do l’Arabie ;", "7780": "il y en avait pour plusieurs talents de chaque espèce, et leur odeur embaumait au loin les airs.", "7781": "Après eux les députés des Troglodytes offrirent de l’or déterré par les fourmis et un attelage de griffons, retenus sous le joug par des chaînes d’or.", "7782": "Les ambassadeurs des Blemmyes furent ensuite présentés :", "7783": "ils apportaient des arcs et des flèches d’os de dragon tressées en forme de couronne.", "7784": "« Roi, dirent-ils, voici les présents que nous t’offrons ;", "7785": "ils le cèdent en richesse à ceux des autres ;", "7786": "mais toi-même tu as apprécié ce qu’ils valent, contre les Perses, sur les bords du fleuve.", "7787": "— Ils sont plus précieux certainement, reprit Hydaspe, que les dons les plus riches ;", "7788": "car c’est grâce à eux que les autres me sont maintenant offerts.", "7789": "» Il les autorisa ensuite à réclamer ce qu’ils désiraient, et, sur leur demande d’un adoucissement dans le tribut, il leur en fit remise entière pour dix ans.XXVII.", "7790": "Déjà presque tous les ambassadeurs avaient été admis ;", "7791": "chacun, en échange de ses présents, avait reçu du roi des dons d’une égale valeur, beaucoup même en avaient obtenu de plus précieux, lorsque arrivèrent en dernier lieu les députés des Axiomites.", "7792": "Ils n’étaient point tributaires ;", "7793": "mais, à titre d’amis et d’alliés, ils venaient, à propos de ses succès, lui témoigner leurs bonnes

brillantes.", "7795": "La partie postérieure du corps et le ventre étaient peu élevés et assez semblables à ceux du lion.", "7796": "L’avanttrain, au contraire, les pieds de devant et le poitrail avaient une longueur hors de toute proportion avec ceux des autres animaux.", "7797": "D’un corps gros et massif sortait un col grêle et allongé comme celui du cygne.", "7798": "La tête, semblable à celle du chameau, était un peu plus du double de celle de l’autruche de Libye.", "7799": "Le mouvement perpétuel de ses yeux, rehaussés d’un cercle brillant, lui donnait un aspect terrible.", "7800": "Sa démarche ne ressemble en rien à celle d’aucun autre animal, terrestre ou aquatique :", "7801": "au lieu de porter chacun des pieds en avant séparément et alternativement, il avance en même temps et d’un même mouvement les deux jambes de droite, puis celles de gauche, de sorte que l’un des deux côtés est toujours suspendu et sans appui.", "7802": "Du reste, ses mouvements sont tellement calmes, ses mœurs si douces qu’une légère corde attachée à sa tête suffisait à son conducteur pour le diriger et s’en faire suivre à son gré, comme s’il eût été retenu par d’irrésistibles liens.", "7803": "Le peuple, frappé d’étonnement à la vue de cet animal, lui donna un nom tiré de sa forme même et des parties les plus saillantes de son corps, celui de chameau-léopard.XXVIII.", "7804": "Son apparition occasionna un grand tumulte dans toute l’assemblée.", "7805": "Voici en effet ce qui arriva :", "7806": "auprès de l’autel de la Lune étaient deux taureaux, et auprès de celui du Soleil quatre chevaux blancs, préparés pour le sacrifice.", "7807": "A l’aspect de cet animal étranger, inconnu, prodigieux, qu’ils voyaient pour la première fois, ils furent frappés de trouble et de terreur, comme par quelque monstrueuse apparition.", "7808": "Malgré les efforts de ceux qui les retenaient, ils brisèrent leurs liens :", "7809": "l’un des taureaux, le seul sans doute qui eût vu l’animal, et deux des chevaux s’échappèrent et s’enfuirent à toute vitesse.", "7810": "Ne pouvant franchir l’enceinte formée par la haie de soldats qui leur opposaient comme un rempart leurs boucliers serrés et enlacés, ils gambadaient à tout hasard, tourbillonnant en désordre autour de l’espace réservé, et renversant tout ce qu’ils rencontraient, hommes et choses.", "7811": "Une clameur confuse s’éleva de toute part :", "7812": "les cris de terreur de ceux vers lesquels ils s’élançaient se mêlaient aux cris de joie, aux rires, aux applaudissements de ceux qui voyaient les autres renversés et foulés aux pieds.", "7813": "Au milieu de ce tumulte, Persina et Chariclée elles-mêmes ne purent se contenir et rester en repos dans leur tente ;", "7814": "elles entr’ouvrirent un peu la tapisserie, pour voir ce qui arrivait.", "7815": "A ce moment, Théagène s’aperçut que les gardes placés autour de lui s’étaient dispersés au milieu de la confusion générale ;", "7816": "cédant à un élan spontané de son propre courage, ou peutêtre obéissant à une inspiration d’en haut, il se releva tout à coup du pied de l’autel où il était à genoux, s’attendant à être immolé d’un moment à l’autre.", "7817": "Il saisit un des éclats de bois amassés autour de l’autel, s’empara d’un des chevaux qui n’avaient pas fui, sauta sur son dos, et saisissant avec les mains la crinière pour s’en servir comme de frein, éperonnant le cheval du talon, l’excitant sans relâche avec l’éclat de bois, en guise de fouet, il se mit à la poursuite du taureau échappé.", "7818": "Au premier abord, les assistants crurent que Théagène voulait s’évader, et tous, avec de grands cris, s’excitaient mutuellement à ne point lui laisser franchir la haie des hoplites.", "7819": "Mais la suite leur fit bien voir que chez lui ce n’était pas crainte, ni désir de se soustraire au sacrifice.", "7820": "En un instant il eut atteint le taureau ;", "7821": "pendant quelque temps d’abord il le chassa par derrière, l’aiguillonnant, le harcelant, pour presser encore sa course furieuse.", "7822": "De quelque côté qu’il s’élançât, il suivait chacun de ses bonds, tout en ayant soin d’éviter adroitement ses retours et ses attaques de front.XXIX.", "7823": "Lorsqu’il l’eut ainsi familiarisé à sa vue et à ce manège, il poussa son cheval côte à côte avec lui, de telle sorte que les deux animaux se touchaient et que l’haleine et la sueur du cheval se mêlaient à celle du taureau.", "7824": "L’allure de l’un était si exactement réglée sur la course de l’autre, que de loin les deux têtes semblaient n’en faire qu’une ;", "7825": "le peuple applaudissait bruyamment Théagène qui montrait à ses yeux étonnés cet étrange attelage d’un cheval et d’un bœuf.", "7826": "Telles étaient les dispositions de la multitude.", "7827": "Cependant Chariclée, à cette vue, restait tremblante et glacée d’effroi.", "7828": "Ne sachant ce qu’il voulait faire, elle redoutait pour lui quelque chute, et la seule pensée qu’il pouvait se blesser la jetait dans des angoisses non moins vives que si personnellement elle eût dû être immolée.", "7829": "Ses inquiétudes n’échappèrent pas à Persina :", "7830": "« Mon enfant, dit-elle, dans quel état jete vois, il semble que les dangers de cet étranger te touchent plus encore que lui-même !", "7831": "Et moi aussi j’éprouve bien quelque trouble et j’ai pitié de sa jeunesse.", "7832": "Je demande au ciel qu’il échappe au péril et soit conservé pour le sacrifice, afin que les Dieux ne soient pas entièrement frustrés de l’offrande que nous leur devons.", "7833": "— Il est vraiment risible, dit Chariclée, de demander qu’il ne meure pas, afin de le faire mourir.", "7834": "Mais, ma mère, si cela est en votre pouvoir, sauvez cet homme pour l’amour de moi.", "7835": "» Persina, sans deviner le véritable motif de cette insistance, soupçonna néanmoins quelque raison amoureuse.", "7836": "« Il n’est pas possible, dit-elle, de le sauver ;", "7837": "cependant si tu as eu avec cet homme quelques rapports intimes qui te fassent prendre de lui tant de souci, dis-le maintenant en toute confiance à ta mère :", "7838": "si tu as eu quelque faiblesse de jeunesse, commis quelque faute contre la virginité, une mère sait être indulgente pour sa fille, une femme sait jeter un voile sur des fautes auxquelles son sexe lui apprend à compatir.", "7839": "» A ces mots, Chariclée fondit en larmes :",

une bruyante clameur partie du milieu de la foule.", "7845": "Théagène, ayant lancé son cheval à toute vitesse, prit une légère avance :", "7846": "au moment où les flancs du coursier se trouvaient au niveau de la tête de l’animal, il s’élança tout à coup, laissa le cheval en liberté at se jeta au col du taureau.", "7847": "La tête solidement appuyée entre les cornes, les bras passés par-dessous, comme une couronne, les mains jointes et enlacées sur le front du taureau, le reste du corps suspendu tout entier sur son épaule, il se laissa emporter par lui sans toucher terre, obéissant, presque sans secousse, à ses mouvements rapides et impétueux.", "7848": "Quand il sentit que le taureau fléchissait sous le poids et que ses muscles commençaient à céder sous une pression trop forte, il se laissa tout à coup glisser en avant, au moment où il passait devant le trône du roi.", "7849": "Ses pieds, jetés en avant des jambes de la bête et heurtant ses ongles à chaque pas, entravaient sa marche.", "7850": "Embarrassé dans sa course impétueuse, appesanti par la vigoureuse étreinte du jeune homme, il fléchit le genou, tomba tout d’une pièce la tête contre terre, et, roulant sur lui-même, il alla labourer le sol de ses épaules et de son échine et resta étendu sur le dos.", "7851": "Ses cornes, fichées et comme enracinées en terre, ne lui permettaient plus le moindre mouvement, ses jambes s’agitaient en vain, battaient l’air, et par leur impuissance attestaient sa défaite.", "7852": "Théagène, penché sur lui, se contentait de le contenir de la main gauche et ne cessait d’agiter la droite levée vers le ciel.", "7853": "Son visage, joyeux et serein, tourné vers Hydaspe et le reste du peuple, les provoquait par son sourire à partager sa joie.", "7854": "Le mugissement du tau reau était comme la trompette qui proclamait sa victoire.", "7855": "Les applaudissements de la foule y répondaient :", "7856": "sans articuler distinctement aucun éloge, la plupart, la bouche béante, témoignaient leur admiration par des cris confus et gutturaux, qui longtemps montèrent sans s’affaiblir vers le ciel.", "7857": "Sur un ordre du roi, les serviteurs accoururent ;", "7858": "pendant que les uns relevaient Théagène et l’amenaient à Hydaspe, les autres passèrent une corde dans les cornes du taureau, l’emmenèrent triste et abattu, et l’attachèrent de nouveau à l’autel avec le cheval qu’ils avaient également repris.", "7859": "Au moment où Hydaspe se disposait à adresser la parole à Théagène, la multitude, enchantée de ce jeune homme et pleine de sympathie pour lui du moment où elle l’avait aperçu, frappée d’ailleurs de sa vigueur, mais pardessus tout piquée de jalousie contre l’Éthiopien, champion de Méroëbus, s’écria tout d’une voix :",

que fit le coup, il se rengorgea de nouveau et sourit avec complaisance.", "7883": "Théagène, en homme habitué dès sa jeunesse aux gymnases, aux luttes, et versé dans toutes les ruses des combats de Mercure, prit le parti de céder d’abord, afin de faire l’essai des forces de son adversaire ;", "7884": "au lieu de résister en face au choc de cette masse sauvage, il songeait à triompher par l’habileté de cette force brutale.", "7885": "Aussitôt, quoiqu’il n’eùt été que légèrement ébranlé par ce premier coup, il feignit d’avoir plus de mal qu’il n’en avait en réalité, et tendit l’autre

l’impulsion de sa main qui avait porté dans le vide l’entraînait vers la terre, et, le saisissant sous l’aisselle, il lui embrassa et lui étreignit vigoureusement le dos et le ventre, quoique leur grosseur énorme lui permît à peine de les tenir entre ses bras.", "7889": "A force de lui frapper violemment et à coups précipités les chevilles et le bas des jambes avec les talons, il le fit tomber sur les genoux.", "7890": "Alors il le tint serré entre ses jambes en lui enfonçant les genoux dans l’aine, renversa ses deux bras dont il se servait comme d’appui pour se soutenir et relever sa poitrine, les ramena sur le dos et les épaules en les croisant sous les tempes, et le força à s’étendre à plat, le ventre contre terre.", "7891": "Le peuple à cette vue applaudit d’une voix unanime,
